“The unique thing about Avalanche is how it is attempting to achieve scale. Unlike Ethereum or Solana, Avalanche (AVAX) uses a set of subnets, or sidechains,” Kendrick said in a note on Wednesday, initiating coverage on AVAX with a $55 price target for the end of 2025, $100 for 2026, $150 for 2027, $200 for 2028 and $250 by the completion of 2029.

“While it is still too early to tell whether the new subnet approach will work, we think the fact that one-quarter of active subnets are already Etna-compatible is encouraging.”

He also pointed out the network’s growing developer number since its upgrade in December, which cut the cost of establishing a subnet close to zero.

Avalanche, which stands at a $9 billion market cap, is currently the 15th-largest cryptocurrency by that metric, making it a great candidate to profit from a big impact even through incremental improvements, according to Kendrick. Among blockchains, it is the tenth-largest by total value locked (TVL).

“As a result, we see AVAX outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of relative price gains in the coming years, reaching a level around USD 250 by end-2029, more than 10x today’s price.”

Ahead of the December upgrade, the Avalanche Foundation, the issuer of AVAX, raised $250 million in a token sale, led by Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly and ParaFi Capital.",coindesk

An excerpt of the writ Techteryx filed in Hong Kong

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

After acquiring TrueUSD from TrueCoin in December 2020, Techteryx appointed First Digital Trust (FDT), a Hong Kong-based fiduciary, to manage its stablecoin reserves.

According to documents prepared by U.S. law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel, FDT was instructed to invest the reserves in the Aria Commodity Finance Fund (Aria CFF), a Cayman Islands-registered vehicle. However, court filings allege that approximately $456 million was instead improperly diverted into Aria Commodities DMCC, a separate, unauthorized entity based in Dubai.

An excerpt of a complaint presented to the Department of Justice prepared by Cahill

Court documents identify Matthew Brittain as controlling Aria Commodity Finance Fund (Aria CFF) through Aria Capital Management Ltd and Cecilia Brittain as the sole shareholder of the separately owned Dubai-based entity Aria Commodities DMCC.

However, emails from Aria's Matthew Brittan are signed with an address in Dubai.

Court documents say that Cecilia is Matthew's wife.

ARIA DMCC engages in trade finance, asset development, and commodity trading, while ARIA CFF finances commodity traders, including ARIA DMCC and third parties, according to Matthew Brittain, who described the relationship between the two companies in an email to CoinDesk.

Attestations produced by Moore CPA Limited show, first published by Protos, that FDT managed $501 million of TrueUSD's reserves by November 2024.

Hong Kong court filings also say Vincent Chok, First Digital's CEO, allegedly directed around $15.5 million in undisclosed commissions to an entity called ""Glass Door"" and separately structured approximately $456 million in unauthorized trade finance loans from FDT to Aria DMCC, later retroactively mischaracterizing them as legitimate fund investments in actions plaintiffs describe as fraudulent misrepresentation and misappropriation.

""The remittances to Aria DMCC were blatant misappropriation and money-laundering,"" a statement of claim reads. ""They were made without the knowledge, authorization or approval of the Plaintiff.""

These statements have not been tried in court as of press time.

Aria DMCC invested funds in global projects that they described as relatively illiquid, such as manufacturing plants, mining operations, maritime vessels, port infrastructure, and renewable energy ventures.

When Techteryx attempted to redeem its investments from Aria CFF between mid-2022 and early 2023 it received little or no funds back, with Aria entities allegedly defaulting on payments and failing to fulfill redemption requests, the court documents say.

Techteryx then took full operational control of TUSD in July 2023, after TrueCoin terminated its involvement. As part of a transitional period following the December 2020 sale, TrueCoin continued running the day-to-day operations of TUSD.

According to the complaint Cahill prepared for the U.S. DOJ, Sun stepped in around this time to provide emergency liquidity support, which was structured as a loan.

The Techteryx team then quarantined 400 million TUSD so that retail redemptions could continue and token holders wouldn't be affected, despite the stablecoin issuer's empty coffers, the court filings said.

First Digital says it followed Techteryx's instructions

In response to a request for comment from CoinDesk, First Digital's Chok, categorically denied any wrongdoing or participation in fraudulent schemes.

Chok told CoinDesk that First Digital Trust acted strictly as a fiduciary intermediary, executing transactions precisely according to instructions provided by Techteryx and its representatives. He asserted that his company was not responsible for independently evaluating or advising on these investment decisions.

""It is our understanding that one of the main blockers voiced by ARIA for early redemptions of funds (as requested by Techteryx) has been their AML/KYC concerns regarding the deal between TrueCoin and Techteryx and the true identity of the ultimate beneficial owner of Techteryx,"" Chok said in an email to CoinDesk, adding that he believed nobody named in the case considers Aria illiquid.

""We have not yet had the opportunity to fully defend ourselves,"" Chok said in an email to CoinDesk. ""We are fully committed to clarifying these matters in due course as the legal and arbitration process continues.""

Aria Group's Matthew Brittain said to CoinDesk that he ""completely rejects Techteryx’s claims against ARIA DMCC and any related entities,"" adding that ""a number of false allegations were made in the court proceedings.""

Techteryx was fully aware of term commitments, Brittain said, and these were outlined in contracts that subscribers have agreed to when investing in ARIA CFF, which are clearly set out in the Offering Memorandum.

Brittain also echoed Chok's concerns about Techteryx's beneficial ownership, pointing to Wall Street Journal coverage of the topic.

The Hong Kong writ identifies Li Jinmei as the ultimate beneficial owner of Techteryx. A spokesperson for Techteryx confirmed that this is not the same person as Jennifer Yiyang — the previous ultimate beneficial owner of the company — despite some media reporting to the contrary.

""The subscriber has not resolved these issues,"" Brittain continued, referring to the beneficial ownership concerns.

Prime Trust's collapse and SEC settlement compounds challenges

While this was happening, TUSD's challenges continued in the form of a collapsing banking partner and regulatory scrutiny in the U.S.

In mid-2023, Prime Trust, an independent crypto custodian based in Nevada that is not connected to this case, but which TrueUSD used for its fiat ramps, was put into receivership by state regulators.

State regulators alleged Prime Trust had improperly used customer funds to cover withdrawal requests, raising serious concerns about its financial stability.

Court filings from Nevada showed that Prime Trust owed around $85 million in fiat obligations with only about $3 million available.

This wasn't the last headache for the stablecoin issuer.

In September 2024, TrueCoin and TrustToken (the stablecoin's owners before Techteryx) settled with the SEC over allegations they falsely marketed TrueUSD as fully dollar-backed while secretly investing reserves in risky offshore funds.

Without admitting wrongdoing, or detailing the nature of their offshore investments with Aria's companies, both TrueCoin and TrustToken agreed to pay civil penalties and disgorge profits to the tune of just over $500,000 to resolve charges of fraud and unregistered securities offerings.

For his part, Aria's Brittain said that investing in Aria wasn't the right move to begin with for a stablecoin's reserves.

""ARIA CFF has never held [its] strategy out as highly liquid, or appropriate for the reserves of a stablecoin,"" he said in an email.

“Even if current market conditions persist in the second quarter, we are seeing strong traction from financial advisors and institutional investors,"" said Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise (whose BITB is among the bitcoin ETFs).

""While retail interest is weak due to the fixation on price action, professional investors are recognizing the global adoption momentum spurred by the Trump administration’s embrace of bitcoin, and many are seeing these market conditions as an opportunity to start or increase an allocation,"" Leon added.

The ETFs saw over $1 billion in inflows in the first quarter of the year despite a challenging macro situation that sent the S&P 500 Index into its biggest quarterly loss since 2022 and bitcoin's 13% plunge.

Leon expects inflows to be even stronger in the second quarter — as much as $3 billion or even more as wirehouse platforms unlock and legislative policy progresses.

ETF inflows possibly less than meets the eye

The $1 billion in first quarter net flows — and whatever the second quarter brings — doesn't necessarily reflect investor interest in buying the bitcoin dip. That's because of the so-called basis trade (also known as cash-and-carry). In this, institutional players buy the spot bitcoin ETF while shorting CME bitcoin futures, picking up yield without exposure to price movement.

That yield was well into the double-digits in late 2024 and remained nicely above the risk-free rate throughout much of the first quarter. It's collapsed to the 5% area of late, suggesting arbitrage-related ETF inflows may dry up.

Back to bull case: It's still early

“While a favorable price environment would certainly be a boost, it's important to remember that adoption of spot bitcoin ETFs by these groups is still in its infancy,"" said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, who is also bullish on the outlook for inflows throughout the rest of the year.. ""As they grow more comfortable allocating to bitcoin, this should provide a meaningful tailwind for inflows,” he added..,

While many institutions have indeed already made their first allocations into bitcoin in the past year, it represents only a small fraction of ETF investment, with most of the money still coming from retail investors — something recently noted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, whose IBIT is the asset-gathering leader among the spot ETFs. The more favorable regulatory stance toward the industry, not to mention the government’s own potential allocation into bitcoin, however, means that ratio could soon shift significantly.

During an ETF conference in Las Vegas earlier this month, a survey showed that 57% of advisors plan on increasing their allocations into crypto ETFs this year as crypto has lost its “reputational risk” attribute among advisors.

The view that bitcoin could serve as a “safe haven” in times of an economic decline, which investors remain anxious about, could also boost confidence in the asset, especially as fears of a potential recession grow.

“If we see continued rate cut expectations, signs of economic uncertainty, or deepening fears of a potential recession in the US, Bitcoin’s role as 'digital gold' will likely support additional inflows,” said David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets. “While some short-term traders may rotate out if price weakness persists, long-term players will continue to keep inflows strong, especially as institutional adoption takes off and drives demand throughout the year.""",coindesk

As of writing, the number of open positions in the $80,000 put option tallied 10,278 contracts, equating to a notional open interest of $864.26 million, according to data source Amberdata. That makes it the most popular options play on Deribit, where one contract represents one BTC.

It also marks a significant positioning shift from early January when the call option at the $120,000 strike was the most popular bet with an open interest of nearly $1.5 billion. Last month, the $100,000 call took the crown.

The positioning shift indicates traders have reassessed upside expectations amid the market swoon and lingering economic uncertainty. BTC fell 11.66% in the first quarter, with prices slipping below $80,000 at one point as President Donald Trump's tariffs shook Wall Street. Additionally, disappointment over the lack of fresh purchases in the U.S. strategic reserve weighed over prices.

Later Wednesday, Trump is expected to announce sweeping reciprocal tariffs on its trading partners, which could lead to a full-blown trade war. That has BTC traders chasing downside protection.

The Bitcoin Covered Call ETF (BTCC) and Bitcoin Premium Income ETF (BPI) offer covered call writing strategies, which involves selling call options to generate income on the premium received.

Call options are derivatives contracts betting on the price of an asset rising. They give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the asset at a predetermined price within a define period of time.

BTCC will write calls very close to spot prices to deliver income for investors seeking regular cash flow, with the options premiums possibly also providing a cushion against market downturns.

BPI meanwhile will target options with strike prices that are well out-of-the-money, meaning the price is much higher than the spot price. This would allow investors to participate in much of BTC's upside potential while possibly benefiting from some dividend income, according to an emailed announcement from Grayscale on Wednesday.

The options contracts that both ETFs use will track other bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale's own Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC).

Despite the surge in institutional investment into BTC through spot ETFs since their introduction in January 2024, bitcoin's volatility does not appear to be going anywhere for the time being.

After gaining nearly 48% in the fourth quarter, the largest cryptocurrency kicked off 2025 by losing 12% in the historically bullish first quarter. It rose by 72% and 69% in the first quarters of 2023 and 2024, respectively, according to data tracked by Coinglass.

The sudden price action happened as CoinDesk earlier Wednesday reported that some of the TrueUSD stablecoin's reserve assets were stuck in illiquid investments, according to filings. Tron founder Justin Sun bailed out the issuer company. First Digital Trust, a trust company affiliated to First Digital, was appointed to manage TUSD reserves.

""First Digital Trust (FDT) is effectively insolvent and unable to fulfill client fund redemptions. I strongly recommend that users take immediate action to secure their assets,"" Tron founder Justin Sun claimed in a Wednesday X post.

Collateral is a fundamental part of risk management in financial markets, ensuring stability amid market fluctuations. However, traditional systems often suffer from inefficiencies due to fragmented infrastructure and lagging settlements.

DTCC said its new platform seeks to address these challenges by tokenizing collateral on blockchain rails, allowing for real-time transfers and automation through smart contracts, according to a Wednesday press release. The platform runs within DTCC’s AppChain ecosystem, which was developed on top of LF Decentralized Trust’s Besu blockchain.

""Collateral mobility is the ‘killer app’ for institutional use of blockchain,"" Dan Doney, chief technology officer of DTCC Digital Assets, said in a statement. ""By using smart contracts to automate the full range of collateral operations, we enable complex trade execution across markets in real-time at any time, even in volatile conditions.""

""This platform is unique in that we’ve created something that’s more open, flexible, dynamic, and comprehensive than any previous digital collateral initiative,"" said Nadine Chakar, global head of DTCC Digital Assets.

The initiative comes as tokenization of traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and other traditional investments has become one of the hottest use cases for blockchain technology. Multiple financial heavyweights like BlackRock, CME Group and Fidelity have thrown their hat in the ring pursuing benefits such as operational efficiencies, speedier settlements and increased transparency compared to using traditional financial plumbing.

The Researcher Was Ben Fielding, Who Had Built a Large Machine Stuffed with Early GPUS to Develop ai. The Machine what Loud it Annoyed Fielding’s Lab-Mates. Fielding Crammed the Machine Beneath the Desk, but it was so big he had to awkwardly stick his legs to the side.

Fielding had some unorthodox ideas. He Explored How “Swarms” of AI - Cluster of many different models - Could Talk to Each Other and Learn from Each Other, which Might IMPROVE THE COLLECTIVE THE. There was just one problem: He was handcuffed by the realities of that noisy machine Beneath his desk. And he knew he was outgunned. “Google was doing this research as well,” Fielding Says Now. ""And they had thousands [of gpus] in a data center. The Things they doing Were’t crazy. I knew the methods ... i had lints of proposals, but i kildn’t run topic.""

Ben Fielding, CEO of Gensyn, is a Speaker at Consensus 2025 in Toronto.

Jeff Wilser is the host of the people's ai: The Decentralized Ai Podcast and Will Host the Ai Summit at Consensus 2025.

So a decade ago, it dawned on field: Compute constraints would always be to issue. In 2015, he knew that if compute was a hard constraint in academia, it would absolutely echely be a hard constraint when ai when mainstream.

The Solution?

Decentralized Ai.

Fielding Co-Founded Gensyn (Along with Harry Grieve) in 2020, Or Years Before Decentralized Ai Became Fashionable. The Project was initially for building decentralized compute - and i’ve spoken with field this for coindesk and on panel after panel at conferences - but the vision is actually something like: ""The network for machine intelligence."" They’re Building Solutions Up and Down the Tech Stack.

And now, a decade after Fielding’s Noisy Desk Annoyed his Lab-Mates, The Early Tools of Gensyn are out in the wild. Gensyn Recently Released Its “RL Swarms” Protocol (A Descendant of Fielding’s PhD Work) and Just Launched Its testnet - which Brings Blockchain Into the Fold.

In this conversation leading up to the ai summit, at consensus in Toronto, field gives a primer on ai swarms, explains how blockchain snaps into the puzzle, and shares why all innovators - not Just Tech Giants - “Should have the right to Build machine learning technology.”

This interview has been to condensed and lightly edited for Clarity.

Congrats on the testnet launch. What’s the gist of what it is?

Ben Fielding: It’s the Addition of the First Mvp Features of Blockchain Integration with what we've launched so far.

What were the original features, pre-blockchain?

So we launched rl [Reinforcement Learning] Swarming a FEW Weeks Ago, which is Reinforcement Learning, Post-Training, as a Peer-to-Peer Network.

Here’s the Easiesse Way to Think About it. When a pre-trained Model Goes Through Reasoning Training-Like Deepseek-R1-It Learns To Critique Its Own Thinking and Recursively IMPROVE AGAINST The Task. It can then Impove its own Answer.

We take that process one step Further and Say, “It’s great for models to critique their own thinking and recursively IMPROVE. What if they can talk to other models and critique Each Other's Thinking?” If you get many models together in a group that Can All Talk to Each other, they start learning how to send information to the other models… with the overall goal of improving the entire swarm itself.

Gotcha, which explains the name “Swarm.”

Right. It’s this training method which allows many models to Kind of Combine, in parallel, to improve the outcome of a final meta-model that you Could Could From Those Models. But at the same time, you have every single individual model just improving on its own. So if you were to come to come with a model on a MacBook, Join a Swarm for an Hour and then Drop Back Out Again, You would have an impured local model based on the knowledge in the Swarm, and you would have so IMPODED the other models in the Swarm. It’s this Collaborative Training Process That Any Model Can Join Join and Any Model Can Do. So that's what rl Swarm is.

Okay, that's what you released a few Weeks AGO. Now where does Blockchain come in?

So the blockchain is us moving forward some of the lower-level primitive into the system.

Let’s just pretend that someone doesn’t understand The Phrase “Lower-Level Primitive.” What do you mean by that?

Yeah, so I Mean, very close to the resource itself. So if you think about the software stack, you've got a gpu stack in a data center. You've got drivers on top of the gpu. You've got Operating Systems, Virtual Machines. You've got all this stuff going up.

So a Lower-Level Primitive is the closest to the Bottom Foundation in the Tech Stack. At I Getting that right?

Yes, exactly. And the rl Swarm is a demonstration of what's possible, basically. It's just a Somewhat Hacky Demo of Doing Really Interesting Large Scale, Scalable Machine Learning. But what Gensyn's Been Doing for the Past Four-Plus Years, realistic, is building infrastructure. And so we'Re in this period now where the infrastructure is all at that v0.1 sort of beta level. It's all Done. It's ready to go. We have to figure out how to show the world what's possible when it's a big shift to the way people think of machine learning.

It sounds like you guys are doing a lot more than decentralized compute, or even infrastructure?

We have three main components that Sit Undernath our infrastructure. Execution - We have consistent execution libraries. We have our own compiler. We have reproducible libraries for any hardware target.

The Second Piece is communication. So Assume You Can Just Run a Model on Anny Device In The World That's Compatible, Can You Get Talk to Each Other? If everybody opts into the same standard, everybody can communicate like TCP/IP from the Internet, Basically. So we build the those libraries and rl swarm is an example of that communication.

And then, final, verification.

Ah, and i’m guessing this is where blockchain commes in ...

Imagine a scenario where every device in the world is Executing Consistently. They Could Link Models together. But can they trust Each other? If I Connected My MacBook to Yours, YES, They Could Execute the Same Task. Yes, They Could Send Tensors Back and Forth, but do they know that what they send to the other device is actually happening on the other device or not?

In the Current World, you and I would proximity sign a contract to say, yes, we agree that we'll make Sure our devices do the right Thing. In the Machine World, It Needs to Happen Programmatically. So that's the final Piece We Build, Cryptographic Proofs, Probabilistic Proofs, Game Theoretic Proofs to make that Process Entirely Programmatic.

So that's the blockchain commes in. It gives us all of the benefits of blockchain you can imagine, like persistent identity, payments, consensus, etc. and so what we doing with is taking rl swarm and the primitives of the other infrastructure and we're adding in the Blockchain Components and Saying, ‘Hey, When you Join a Swarm now, you have a persistent identity, which exists out there on a decentralized ledger.’

In the future you’ll have the ability to make payments, but right now, you have that trust consensus mechanism where where terminates disputes. So, it's kind of an mvp of the future genyn infrastructure, where we’re going to add in components as we go.

Give US A Tease of What's Coming Down The Pipeline?

When we recach Main-Net, All of the Software and Infrastructure is live against blockchain as the source of trust, payments, consensus, etc., identity. This is the first step of that. It's Adding Identity in and Saying When You Join A Swarm, You Can Register as The Same Person. Everyone Knows Who You Are Without Having to Check Some Centralized Server Or Website Somewhere.

Now Let’s Get Wild and Talk Further in the future. What does this look like one year from Now, Two Years From Now, Five Years From Now? What’s your north star?

Sure. The ultimate vision is to take all of the resources that sit under machine learning and make theme instantaneously programmatical accessible to eachone. Machine Learning is heavy constrained by its core resources. This creates this huge Moat for Centralized Ai Companies, but it does not need to exist. It can be open source if we can build the right software. So our view is Gensyn Builds All of the Low-Level Infrastructure to Allow that to get as close to open source as it possibly can. People Should have the right to build machine learning technologies.",coindesk

A similar standard for data-backed tokens, called VRC-20, has now emerged.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

Vana, an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain that helps users monetize personal data by bundling it into DataDAOs for AI model training, introduced the new standard early this week to boost trust and transparency in the market for data-backed digital assets.

""For data markets to work, tokens must be reliable, secure, and useful. As a universal standard for data-backed tokens, VRC-20 delivers this by ensuring fair and transparent data token trading,"" Vana announced on X.

The VRC-20 standard design includes specific criteria such as fixed supply, governance, and liquidity rules while ensuring real data access by tying tokens to actual data utility. Additionally, it promotes continuous liquidity through rewards that ensure market stability.

""This isn’t speculation. This is real financialization of data,"" Vana noted.

Vana launched its mainnet in December, with VANA as its native cryptocurrency. Since then, the network has onboarded over 12 million data points through multiple DataDAOs, reflecting strong demand for user-owned data.

DataDAOs or data liquidity pools are decentralized marketplaces that bring data onchain as transferable digital tokens. DLPs are where data is contributed, tokenized and made ready for use in applications such as AI model training.

Monday's announcement replaced VANA emissions as DataDAO inventive with a new feature that calls for DAOs to issue VRC-20-compliant tokens to receive liquidity support.

Additionally, the protocol introduced data validator staking, where VANA holders can lock their coins in data validators instead of individual DataDAOs.

""Rewards are based on network security and usage. Stakers earn proportionally to their contribution to network uptime and data availability. No more idle staking. Earnings are tied to real network utility and reliability,"" Vana said.

The VANA token changed hands at $5.58 at press time, the lowest in over two weeks, extending the decline from the recent price high of $8.78 on Binance, according to data source TradingView.",coindesk

Florida voters elected state Senator Randy Fine to take Waltz's former seat and picked the state's chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, to replace Gaetz. The races drew a high level of attention and money from both parties, because of every seat's importance to the tight majority in the House. While Democrats failed to steer the conservative districts onto their side, they did win much more support in both districts than they had in the recent 2024 elections.

An affiliate of the Fairshake PAC had paid for advertising supporting the pro-crypto candidates, Patronis and Fine, in the primary and general elections in Florida, including a last-minute $1.5 million to help ensure their victory.

The two submitted a joint request to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday to consider a 60-day pause in the case as they consider a potential resolution.

The motion mirrors similar stay requests filed by the SEC in other crypto-related cases, including its cases against Binance and Tron, both of which were granted by the court. The regulator also filed a similar motion in its case against Coinbase before later dropping the suit entirely.

The SEC filed suit against Gemini and bankrupt crypto lender Genesis in January 2023, alleging that both companies had violated securities laws through the Gemini Earn program. Through the Earn program, retail investors were promised as much as 8% interest — paid by Genesis — on tokens invested through the program.

When Genesis halted withdrawals in the wake of FTX’s November 2022 collapse, approximately $900 million in user funds were trapped on the platform, according to the SEC’s initial complaint. A public dispute between the two companies’ leadership followed, and by Jan. 10, 2023, Gemini shuttered the Earn program. Two days later, the SEC filed charges against both companies. That same month, Genesis filed for bankruptcy. In February 2024, Genesis paid the SEC a $21 million fine to settle the charges against it.

A separate SEC probe into Gemini was closed in February.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,No Password Reset? How Frostr Saves Your Nostr Identity,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/no-password-reset-how-frostr-saves-your-nostr-identity,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","Born out of a hackathon at TABCONF 2024, Frostr may have just solved Nostr’s most pernicious issue: the inability to reset your password if your private key gets compromised.



Started in October of 2024, Frostr just announced the alpha release of Igloo and Frost2x, a desktop and accompanying browser extension key signers for the Nostr ecosystem.

The project was founded by Topher (cmdruid) who made his name as a Bitcoin engineer for developing Tapscript — a popular library for managing Taproot, Schnorr signatures, and Bitcoin transactions — and Austin (bitcoinplebdev) a Lightning developer for Voltage and founder of PlebDevs, a Lightning-powered developer education platform with over 500 enrolled students.

While resetting a password may seem innocuous or like a simple UI feature, it’s not that easy. Let me take you on a journey of the complexity of the issue it solves and the magnitude of what is at stake if we fail to solve this apparently simple problem.

The Social Media Revolution

Social media has changed the world. And yet, we find ourselves in a strange place with our digital identities. Who we are online and how we assert ownership of our online profiles often depends on trusted third parties like Facebook that are too big to care about any individual customer and fundamentally have the power to change the rules at any time, or even cancel your account altogether.



The deplatforming of controversial influencers and even politicians in recent years serve as examples of how this centralized power can be wielded. Perhaps the best-known illustration of this is the removal of U.S. President Donald Trump from both Facebook and Twitter shortly after the January 6 riots at the U.S. capitol, just days before the end of his first term.

Still, much of the world continues to operate on this digital neo-feudalism structure. It seems there’s a fundamental problem with the “decentralization” of identity that is yet to be solved.

Modern-Day Bank Robbery

Identity systems are a critical layer of society. Whether you are a citizen of Rome 2,000 years ago or of the United States today, doors open and close based on what ID you hold. Today’s systems, as advanced as they may seem, rely on a pre-digital conception of identity and security: They depend on authenticating your face.



The ID card itself, whether your driver’s license or passport, helps government employees, bank tellers and bar bouncers all over the world do a very simple thing: Decide if you look like the person on the official card, and then sort out if you are allowed access or not.



But the world is changing fast. Neither the obscurity of your physical appearance nor the secret nature of your social security number (SSN) are what they were in the pre-internet world: Many people have published their full names and pictures to Facebook, and a series of hacks have leaked tons of SSN data to the dark web. (For example, the Equifax Data Breach in 2017, which affected 147.9 million Americans, or the National Public Data Breach of 2024 with over 200 million Americans compromised.)



In the analog, pre-internet days, when a robber burst through the doors of their local bank, they would do so to take the cash, gold and tradable valuables stored in the vaults.



But that’s no longer how things work. In the digital age, money is no longer cash. Fiat payments are often reversible, so if you hack into a bank and move money to your account somehow, not only can that be reversed, but you just exposed a link to your identity.



Today, the online equivalent of a robber is not looking to steal cash, gold or other valuables, but rather, personal identity data.

That data can, in turn, be used to defraud those same banks, as well as businesses of all sizes.



Indeed, identity fraud costs more than all other forms of theft combined, totaling over $56 billion in 2020.

Not only have many of these centralized platforms had their data vaults hacked and their contents sold on the dark web for pennies on the dollar, but AI is improving quickly and has already passed the Turing test of image generation. We are at a point where rogue actors can create fake selfies holding fake IDs with leaked user data and fool the gatekeepers to your digital wealth.



This threat is likely to incentivize change, and you can see the new efforts by tech companies and government institutions to upgrade identity systems. Take California’s mobile driver’s license app as an example, mDL — developed in partnership with both Google and Apple — is initially integrated with airports for identity verification. But the app also invites developers to integrate it as a form of authentication for websites in general. ID.me takes a similar approach and is already fully integrated with the IRS, boasting 136 million members.

Many of these apps require face or fingerprint authentication, and ask for increasingly complex KYC selfies from their users who must hold up IDs and recent newspapers to be authenticated.

Despite the obvious weakness of using your face to authenticate your identity in the age of Facebook, tech giants continue to rely on biometric data, combining it with mass surveillance tools seen in the social credit score systems being built up in China.

To have a chance at curbing what seems like fate in the digital age, before it comes to the West, we need an identity authentication system that is both secure and agnostic to biometric data. We need an identity system that does not rely on our face.

Enter Nostr, a Bitcoin-Era Identity and Social Media Protocol

Born out of the Bitcoin developer ecosystem, Nostr has quickly grown into a social media network in its own right.



An abbreviation of “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays” — a bit of a mouthful — Nostr empowers users to authenticate themselves into social media pseudonyms (nyms) and sign their posts with a Bitcoin-style private key. As a self-custody system that fundamentally democratizes the internet away from its current structure, it opens up a whole new set of possibilities for social media.



Proponents of Nostr argue that users can finally own their own data and no longer need to depend on the charity or benevolence of the Silicon Valley giants when they decide to move platforms or pick the wrong political party.



Nostr works via a distributed client-server network topology, which allows you to access content across various servers called relays. If one goes down or starts censoring users unfairly, chances are there’s another window into the Nostr content feed that will grant you access and allow you to publish your thoughts.

The dream of Nostr is to unlock a new generation of social media technology that does not turn users into products by mining their data, that does not force biometric authentication, compromising their privacy, and that allows developers to build in an open network whose cryptography and specs are already open source and which is natively integrated with Bitcoin, the internet’s money.

Celebrities and users who wish to protect their Nostr brands from fake accounts trying to impersonate them can follow a standard similar to the one developed by Keybase, which asked users to publicly attest to their a keybase identity with their other social media accounts, consolidating markers of reputation into one cryptographically controlled identity. Though that is not currently a practice in Nostr, it is a problem reasonably well solved in a decentralized way by Keybase.

However, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Pushing identity ownership to the edges comes with a whole new set of problems that up until now have not really been solved and which have personally held me back from investing in building up my brand on Nostr.

No Password Resets

There’s currently no real way to reset your password for a Nostr nym or identity. Built on a simple public key pair system, if your private key gets hacked or leaked, your identity is essentially now under the control of whoever got it. (You both have the secret, so no one has exclusive control of it.)



This is a huge issue. Although the examples of such hacks are not too common, they are a significant deterrent for brands that might consider putting serious capital into building on this new social network protocol.



This particular risk is made worse by the intended design of Nostr, which invites many different interfaces to be created to access content of various kinds with the same user identities and means that users give their private keys to multiple clients, thus multiplying the risk of compromise.



One layer of defense that has been built up and become popular as a result is the idea of an external signer, often a browser extension like Alby that helps manage your private key as a kind of password manager, facilitating signing of content for you on the various Nostr platforms.



While this works well enough today it doesn’t solve the fundamental problem. One mistake and the nym is effectively compromised, the value of that built-up brand or reputation not just harmed but potentially exploitable by scammers wearing your identity to harass your friends or customers.



This is similar to the very common impersonation scams on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which clone your profile and DM your known associates with phishing schemes, but even worse. In Nostr such an attack would be done with your identity — not a fake profile — significantly harming confidence in the authenticity of all content for those who are aware of the issue.

The solution should be simple: just create a password reset feature. Right?



Well, it turns out some very creative engineering is needed here, because password resets are basically only possible by giving up your control over your identity to a third party who can update a central database and give you a new key set.



Until now, that is. Let’s dive into Frostr.

Frost a Breakthrough in Sovereign Key Management

Recent breakthroughs in cryptography have opened new doors for self custody in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry. One specific innovation that is quickly entering the market is Frost, a Schnorr-based key management and key rotation scheme that achieves similar functionality as Bitcoin multi-signature addresses and transactions, but without the on-chain transactions costs or privacy trade-offs.

Schnorr is a form of cryptography invented in the 1990s. A few years after the expiration of its European and U.S. patents, Schnorr started being discussed as a possible future upgrade to Bitcoin, and was ultimately introduced in the Taproot soft fork upgrade of 2020.

That same year Chelsea Komlo and Ian Goldberg published “FROST: Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures”, a technical spec that set the foundation for its use in the Lightning Network infrastructure as well as new multi-signature schemes for self custody known as FROST.



While the cryptography is complex and explaining it beyond the scope of this article, it resembles schemes like Shamir’s secret sharing. The cryptographic principles involved allow users to create a 24-word seed with Trezor’s hardware wallet, split up into three shares of 12 words each. Any two shares combined can be assembled into the master private key of the wallet, while any one share alone is insufficient to compromise or recover access to the account.

Here’s a two-minute video explanation of FROST by Andrew Poelstra, Head of Research at Blockstream:



This same principle is used in FROST, a scheme which is designed to enable multi-party, multi-signature wallets, like those used by exchanges, potentially replacing multi-signature Bitcoin scripts, benefiting users with more privacy and lower costs.



Frostr extends FROST by integrating it with Nostr’s relay protocol — hence the added “r” in the name. It also adapts the technology to single-user wallets, rather than industrial-grade, multi-user schemes, allowing simpler setups and unlocking key rotation (password resets) for individual users with single key pairs, like those used in Nostr.

Frostr enables three new features in particular:

Threshold key signing, so that if one key gets compromised, it can be rotated out, and a fresh set of sub keys are generated, which generate the Nostr private keypair. No need to change your Nostr public and private keys (nsec). Similar to — for example — a 2-of-3 multisignature Bitcoin wallet, where if one key is lost or compromised, the other two can be used to move the coins to a new stable structure, and regain control of three fresh keys, but off-chain. It’s a magical thing.



No need for application-layer solutions to Nostr key rotation, only the key signers like Alby would have to integrate Frostr; Nostr apps like Primal or Damus would not even know that Frostr is being used for key rotation by its users.



Users who already have Nostr accounts, whose nsecs have not been compromised, do not need to migrate to new keypairs and identities but simply remove their nsecs from current key signers and start using Frostr as a more secure key management system instead.

The result? A major piece of the decentralized social media puzzle is unlocked: Trustless identities with password resets that do not depend on centralized gatekeepers for authentication.

The consequences of this innovation, if fruitful, are fundamental. The Nostr ecosystem would be wise to take a look at Frostr; it might just be enough of a security and UI improvement that a whole new generation of non-biometric, trustless digital identities, and sovereign data ownership use cases are unlocked for the Bitcoin age.

For Miller, corporate Bitcoin strategy is more than a hedge—it’s a signal of innovation, adaptability, and capital efficiency.

Strategy: Solving Corporate Finance Problems with Bitcoin

Miller praised Strategy’s transformation from software company to capital allocator focused on Bitcoin. He emphasized that the company isn’t just investing in Bitcoin—it’s solving traditional corporate finance challenges through Bitcoin-backed innovation. Strategy continues to create access to Bitcoin across the capital stack, offering various instruments with different risk profiles—from equity to convertible notes.

While some view the firm’s market premium as excessive, Miller sees it as deserved. He framed Strategy’s persistent accumulation of Bitcoin through share issuance as an intelligent response to monetary debasement and a model that others have yet to replicate effectively.

He also noted that the rebrand from MicroStrategy to Strategy marked a shift not just in name, but in purpose—cementing the company’s identity as a Bitcoin development company.

Not Every Company Can Be Strategy—But Many Can Start

According to Miller, there’s a growing list of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets—more than 70 by his count—but his firm only invests in a select few. He emphasized that his team evaluates each one on its own merits, with a value-oriented lens and a clear focus on the core business.

While not every company can become a Bitcoin development company like Strategy, Miller believes many can and should adopt Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. He described Bitcoin as a way for companies to preserve the purchasing power of their excess capital, especially in light of monetary policies designed to erode fiat value over time.

He emphasized that companies facing secular challenges—such as declining core businesses or structural industry shifts—may find in Bitcoin a meaningful way to preserve relevance and shareholder value.

New Position: GameStop Signals Memetic and Strategic Potential

Miller confirmed a new starter position in GameStop, explaining that the decision was driven by the company’s recent capital raise and signs that it may be exploring a Bitcoin strategy. Though the position is small, it reflects his firm’s broader interest in companies that show signs of innovation and unorthodox capital allocation.

He highlighted Ryan Cohen’s role at GameStop as a potentially powerful catalyst, pointing to Cohen’s cultural influence and willingness to think outside traditional finance norms. The ability to shape narratives, Miller suggested, is increasingly important in a world where memetics and capital markets are intertwined.

He sees potential for GameStop to follow a path similar to Metaplanet or Strategy—retail businesses that have embraced Bitcoin in response to broader existential challenges.

Bitcoin as the Rational Response to Monetary Debasement

Miller made the case for Bitcoin adoption as a response to ongoing monetary debasement. He explained that if policymakers openly target 2% annual inflation—or more—then it is rational for companies and individuals to move an equivalent portion of their fiat-denominated capital into Bitcoin.

He stressed that this isn’t a speculative move but a fundamental capital preservation strategy. The key, he noted, is holding Bitcoin over the long term and recognizing it as a way to transfer value into the future with a lower risk of purchasing power erosion.

Miller also noted that more companies are waking up to this logic, especially as regulatory clarity improves. He expects adoption to continue accelerating and sees the current period as a pivotal moment for CFOs and corporate treasurers to take action.

A Call to Forward-Thinking Financial Leaders

For Miller, Bitcoin isn’t a temporary trade—it’s a long-term solution to structural problems in fiat finance. He believes corporate leaders who ignore this trend risk falling behind. The momentum, he says, is clear: more public companies are entering the space, and early adopters are beginning to outperform.

Strategy remains the benchmark. GameStop, Metaplanet, and others may follow. But the broader takeaway is this: in a competitive, inflationary world, companies that fail to evolve risk irrelevance. Bitcoin offers a path forward—one rooted in long-term thinking and strategic capital deployment.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,"Breez Announces Launch of New Wallet, Misty Breez",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/breez-announces-launch-of-new-wallet-misty-breez,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","Today, Breez launches Misty Breez, their latest application built using the Breez SDK. The Breez SDK was initially developed to simplify the process of integrating Lightning Network support into different consumer applications. Dozens of existing projects and companies currently build on Lightning using the SDK.

The SDK supports two methods of Lightning integration. Native, which allows app developers to integrate a Lightning wallet or functionality utilizing the Greenlight service offered by Blockstream, which allows the wallet provider to host a cloud based Lightning node for users while keeping private keys solely in the users control, and Nodeless, which allows Liquid support to seamlessly integrate with the Lightning Network. Both models supported in the SDK give full support to the range of features available on the Lightning Network, as well as Liquid, without the complexity of having to build support from scratch.

Misty Breez is built on the Nodeless SDK tooling. This means that users’ coins are self-custodied on the Liquid sidechain, giving users the ability to fully control their own funds but also requiring the trust trade-offs involved in using the Liquid Network (i.e. that the majority Federation signers will remain honest and trustworthy).

The wallet supports BOLT 11 and BOLT 12 invoices, LNURL-Pay, Lightning Addresses, on-chain BTC addresses, and even Matt Corrallo’s BIP 353 using DNS to fetch payment details for another user’s wallet. It also supports offline payments based on mobile notifications in the phone’s operating system.

Breez SDK’s goal is to provide developers with the tooling to build a seamless and use-case specific user experience with as little effort as possible. In that vein Misty Breez aims to set a benchmark for a simplified user experience that other developers can use as a reference for Lightning integration into their own applications, or even to build on top of Misty Breez itself. If you want, feel free to simply integrate the functionality you seek to build into Misty Breez itself and rebrand it however you want (it is 100% opensource).

Documentation for the Breez SDK Nodeless configuration used by Misty Breez is available here. The Github for the Misty Breez implementation is available here. Lastly, for users who wish to play around with the application, early access release is available here for Android, and here for iOS.

A direct APK download is available here.

All the tooling for developers to build a new UX experience for users is here today.",bitcoinmagazine
https://bitcoinmagazine.com,The Smarter Web Company Plans Public Listing with Bitcoin Treasury Strategy,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/bitcoin-for-corporations/smarter-web-company-plans-public-listing-with-bitcoin-treasury-strategy,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 05:48:36 GMT","The next Bitcoin treasury company may not be a U.S. tech giant or a legacy enterprise—it might be a 15-year-old UK-based web services firm with a lean team, a proprietary CMS, and a clear thesis on the future of money.

The Smarter Web Company, founded in 2009 by Andrew Webley, has announced plans to go public on the AQUIS Stock Exchange in April 2025 through a reverse takeover of a business originally incorporated in 1907. But what makes this listing significant isn’t the transaction mechanics—it’s the capital strategy behind it.

BITCOIN BUILT INTO THE BALANCE SHEET

Since 2023, The Smarter Web Company has accepted Bitcoin as payment. Now, as it prepares to list its shares, it’s laying the groundwork for a formal Digital Assets Treasury Policy—one that includes holding Bitcoin alongside cash.

The company’s leadership views Bitcoin not as a speculative play, but as a deliberate reserve asset. It is, in their words, a hedge against inflation and a forward-looking mechanism to preserve value over time.

As the company pursues both organic growth and strategic acquisitions post-listing, Bitcoin will serve as part of its long-term capital preservation toolkit—a move echoing the playbooks of early movers like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet.

BACKED BY BITCOIN-NATIVE CAPITAL

The company’s plans have already attracted aligned investors. In January 2025, The Smarter Web Company closed a pre-IPO funding round of more than £1 million, backed by UTXO Management—a Bitcoin-focused investment manager and operator of the hedge fund 210k Capital, LP.

An additional raise of over £2 million is underway as part of the company’s listing strategy.

This isn’t passive capital. UTXO and other mission-aligned backers are building a new class of public company—firms with long-term Bitcoin alignment and treasury discipline integrated from the start.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR CORPORATE LEADERS

Once listed, The Smarter Web Company will become one of the first UK-listed businesses to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy from day one. That alone makes it notable. Most publicly traded companies that hold Bitcoin did so as a pivot or response to broader macro shifts. Smarter Web is taking a different route—baking Bitcoin into its financial DNA before it ever hits the public markets.

This signals something much larger than a single company’s conviction. It shows that the Bitcoin treasury model is becoming accessible, practical, and strategically relevant for companies beyond the usual early adopters. You don’t need a multibillion-dollar balance sheet to begin integrating Bitcoin into your corporate strategy—you need alignment, vision, and a framework that prioritizes capital preservation and long-term value.

For mid-sized and growth-stage businesses, Bitcoin increasingly fits the bill. The same financial pressures that push large enterprises toward more efficient capital strategies—persistent inflation, fiat depreciation, and the opportunity cost of holding idle cash—apply equally, if not more urgently, to smaller firms operating in competitive environments.

Whether it’s recurring revenue or future M&A, capital efficiency is a strategic imperative. Bitcoin offers a unique tool in that mix—one that traditional treasury assets cannot replicate. It’s portable, non-sovereign, resistant to dilution, and optimized for long time horizons. For companies seeking to store the value they’ve earned today and deploy it tomorrow without losing purchasing power, Bitcoin represents a new operating standard—not just a hedge.

THE PATH FORWARD

As public company disclosures begin post-listing, The Smarter Web Company has committed to including material treasury updates alongside core business performance—a level of transparency that will give investors and analysts insight into how digital assets play a role in managing corporate capital.

Bitcoin-native capital formation, treasury strategy, and operational adoption are no longer isolated to headline-making firms like Strategy and Metaplanet. The playbook is expanding, and companies like The Smarter Web Company are positioning themselves to lead a new chapter—where treasury innovation is a signal, not a stunt.

For corporate leaders, the lesson is clear: the barriers to action are falling. The only question that remains is timing.

https://cryptobriefing.com,Overtime launches $OVER token and full account abstraction UX,https://cryptobriefing.com/overtime-launches-over-token-and-full-account-abstraction-ux/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 18:04:10 GMT","Share this article

Willemstad, Curaçao, April 2nd, 2025, Chainwire

Overtime, an onchain sportsbook platform, has formally integrated its parent protocol, Thales, under the Overtime brand. The consolidation introduces a unified identity for the protocol and coincides with the launch of a new native token, $OVER. As part of the transition, the project has also unveiled a new primary domain and implemented full Account Abstraction integration to enhance the platform’s user experience.

With over four years of development, Overtime has established itself as a fully onchain sportsbook offering functionality comparable to traditional offchain platforms. Built on the Ethereum network, the protocol emphasizes transparency, security, and immutability. Overtime’s operational history includes:

Over $200 million in volumes

Support for over 100 sports and leagues

50,000 active users

More than 10,000 unique betting markets

Users can access the new Overtime domain here: https://www.overtime.io/

A Decentralized Alternative to Traditional Sports Betting

Overtime distinguishes itself from traditional bookmakers by operating a fully decentralized, permissionless sportsbook platform. Anyone can seamlessly access Overtime with a simple connection without the barriers of traditional restrictive betting limits, arbitrary bans, or withheld payouts.

Since its inception, Overtime has organically become the primary driver of Thales DAO growth. Recognizing this growth, the DAO’s community unanimously approved (via Thales Improvement Proposal 238) the full merger of Thales DAO to the branding of Overtime.

Comprehensive Onchain User Experience Enabled by Full Account Abstraction

With this launch, Overtime is also introducing a new concept: Overtime Accounts—an onchain smart account designed to abstract wallet and EVM network complexities.

Overtime Accounts use Particle Network for the seamless creation of wallets via Social Logins, and Biconomy’s SDK to handle the smart-account functionalities, enabling frictionless transactions through its Paymaster, Bundler, and Session Keys infrastructure.

After creating an Overtime Account, users can deposit supported collateral into their designated address to access Overtime’s onchain sportsbook interface. The platform supports features such as parlays, system bets, same-game parlays (SGPs), futures, and live betting. Transactions are executed through an account abstraction framework, removing the need for manual confirmations or the use of ETH to cover gas fees.

Overtime’s user experience has been designed to minimize blockchain-related complexities, allowing users to engage with the platform’s sportsbook features without requiring technical knowledge of underlying blockchain processes. The interface offers a streamlined experience comparable to traditional web applications while maintaining the transparency and self-custody benefits provided by the Ethereum network.

A new Overtime UX is available here: https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/

The new Overtime DAO token: $OVER

The new $OVER token will have a new total supply of 69.42M, compared to the original 100M of the THALES token. This means that 30.58M THALES tokens will be burned in preparation for the migration to $OVER. All THALES token holders will be able to migrate their $THALES to $OVER token at a 1:1 ratio on the new overtime.io domain. This aligns with the new sustainable tokenomics designed to foster growth and focus it entirely on the $OVER token.

The new $OVER token will serve multiple utilities:

$OVER as Betting Collateral: By using $OVER token as collateral on Overtime, users will enjoy improved odds (2% better than baseline odds) compared to other collaterals. This boosts $OVER token usage and aligns token holders with platform users.

By using $OVER token as collateral on Overtime, users will enjoy improved odds (2% better than baseline odds) compared to other collaterals. This boosts $OVER token usage and aligns token holders with platform users. Buyback & Burn: All fees from Overtime will flow directly towards $OVER token buybacks, focusing the entire growth of the project towards the token. Burning the buybacks reinforces deflationary token dynamics.

All fees from Overtime will flow directly towards $OVER token buybacks, focusing the entire growth of the project towards the token. Burning the buybacks reinforces deflationary token dynamics. Governance Token: Holding $OVER grants voting power within Overtime’s decentralized governance structure.

The $OVER token is built using Chainlink’s CCT token standard for easy and secure cross-network bridging using Chainlink’s CCIP. The token will be live and liquid on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base across prominent decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, Velodrome, and Aerodrome.

Key Takeaways Bhutan's government transferred $32 million worth of Bitcoin today, part of ongoing movements totaling $95 million in two weeks.

The Gelephu Mindfulness City in Bhutan plans to include Bitcoin, Ether, and BNB in its strategic reserves for a digital asset ecosystem.

Share this article

Bhutan’s government transferred $32 million worth of Bitcoin to a new wallet today, its second crypto movement in two weeks, according to data from Arkham Intelligence.

The transfer follows last week’s movement of $63 million in Bitcoin to three separate wallets. Druk Holdings, the government’s investment arm, maintains holdings of approximately 8,594 Bitcoin, valued at $729 million at current prices.

Druk Holdings’ portfolio extends beyond Bitcoin to include Ether, LinqAI, Phil, and Apu Apustaja tokens.

While crypto is not legal tender in Bhutan, the country has been mining Bitcoin using hydroelectric resources since 2019, building crypto wealth equivalent to 30.7% of its GDP.

In January, Bhutan’s newly established Gelephu Mindfulness City Special Administration Region announced plans to include Bitcoin, Ether, and BNB in its strategic reserves. The initiative, announced under the Application of Laws Act 2024, aims to enhance the region’s digital asset ecosystem within a regulated framework.

Crypto markets brace for volatility ahead of Trump’s tariff announcement

The Bitcoin transfer comes as markets prepare for potential volatility ahead of President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement. The White House confirmed the tariffs will take effect immediately upon announcement.

Agne Linge, Head of Growth at WeFi, cautioned that the growing link between digital and traditional markets amplifies crypto’s vulnerability to macroeconomic changes, especially when investors become risk-averse.

“The recent downturn in the S&P 500, hitting a new low, serves as a strong signal that global markets are facing heightened uncertainty, which in turn is putting pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies,” Linge noted in a statement.

According to Linge, economic volatility indicators have surged past historical benchmarks, surpassing peaks from both the 2008 financial crisis and the early 2020 pandemic.

“This surge in uncertainty highlights the growing concern about the stability of the global economy, particularly as inflationary pressures remain persistent,” Linge added.

Trump’s tariffs are expected to fuel inflation, which could lead to higher interest rates. This environment might initially be unfavorable for Bitcoin, as investors seek safe assets.

London, UK, April 2nd, 2025, Chainwire

Decentraland’s flagship virtual event returns April 9–12, showcasing digital fashion as a new canvas for storytelling, activism, and global identity.

Metaverse Fashion Week (MVFW) returns to Decentraland from April 9–12, amid a shifting fashion landscape characterized by declining traditional luxury sales and evolving consumer preferences. MVFW 2025 highlights digital fashion’s growing relevance as a meaningful response to these industry transformations. Under this year’s theme, “Infinite Identities,” more than 47 global designers and brands leverage digital mediums to challenge creative boundaries and articulate nuanced cultural identities.

Hosted on Decentraland 2.0, the platform’s newly redesigned desktop client offers improved visuals, greater interactivity, and better accessibility. These enhancements, developed during the event’s hiatus, provide an immersive and engaging environment for attendees and creators alike.

“This year’s Metaverse Fashion Week comes at a critical moment for fashion and our society at large; one marked by rethinking priorities, authenticity, and connection,” says Bay Backner, Head Producer of MVFW. “I’ve had the privilege of working closely with every designer and brand taking part, and I’ve seen how digital fashion can elevate unheard voices, ask important questions, and spark real cultural change. In a time like this, when the physical world feels increasingly heavy or limiting, third spaces like Decentraland become places where people can breathe, create, and truly be themselves. MVFW 2025 channels that energy into a live moment for fashion’s next breakout names and creative economies.”

Runways: Fashion as Cultural Dialogue

Runways have always been the cornerstone of fashion weeks worldwide, but MVFW 2025 reimagines this classic format through immersive, collaborative, and interactive experiences. Attendees can anticipate creative surprises as designers redefine the runway with innovative animated collections that blur the line between digital and physical fashion.

Cyberdog: London’s iconic brand brings its neon-infused, rave-culture aesthetic into the virtual realm, blending futuristic fashion with underground electronic subcultures.

Free The Youth: Ghanaian collective Free The Youth highlights African streetwear and creativity, celebrating bold, culturally driven designs that bridge physical and virtual worlds.

The Banners We Wear: Decentraland’s inaugural MVFW Prize unveils deeply personal collections from emerging designers. With a $15,000 prize pool, this unique competition challenged designers globally to create digital wearables that convey powerful messages about identity, activism, and resilience. Winning entries will debut on a dedicated runway, spotlighting urgent social narratives and elevating voices often marginalized in mainstream fashion.

Interactive Designer Showrooms: Digital Fashion as Storytelling

At the heart of MVFW 2025 are 16 interactive designer showrooms, each exploring the interplay between fashion, technology, and cultural narrative. These showrooms are divided into two thematic zones, Augmented Self and Storied Self, offering distinct yet complementary perspectives on digital self-expression.

Augmented Self: This zone highlights innovative uses of AI, AR, and digital-physical (“phygital”) fashion. Showrooms include AI-driven styling by Digital Drip, AR-enhanced virtual fashion by FFFACE.ME, NFT-powered wearable collaborations from Another-1 X Templa, and microchip manicure technology from Chipped.

Key conclusions The Bhutan government today transferred $ 32 million in Bitcoin, part of ongoing movements that total $ 95 million in two weeks.

The city of full care of Gelepphu in Bhután plans to include Bitcoin, Ether and BNB in ​​its strategic reserves for an ecosystem of digital assets.

The Bhutan government today transferred $ 32 million in Bitcoin to a new portfolio, its second crypto movement in two weeks, according to Arkham Intelligence data.

The transfer remains to the movement last week of $ 63 million in Bitcoin to three separate portfolios. Druk Holdings, government investment arm, maintains approximately 8,594 bitcoin, valued at $ 729 million at current prices.

The Druk Holdings portfolio extends beyond Bitcoin to include Ether, Linqai, Phil and Tokens from Apu Apustaja.

Although the crypto is not legal tender in Bhután, the country has been undermining Bitcoin using hydroelectric resources since 2019, accumulating crypto wealth equivalent to 30.7% of its GDP.

In January, the newly established Special Administrative Region of the City of Full Attention of Gelepphu in Bhután announced plans to include Bitcoin, Ether and BNB in ​​its strategic reserves. The initiative, announced under the Law of Application of Laws 2024, aims to improve the digital asset ecosystem of the region within a regulated framework.

Crypto markets prepare for volatility before Trump's tariff announcement

Bitcoin's transfer occurs while the markets prepare for possible volatility before the ""release day"" rates by President Donald Trump. The White House confirmed that the rates will immediately take effect when advertising.

Agne Linge, head of growth in Wefi, warned that the growing link between digital and traditional markets amplifies the vulnerability of the crypto to macroeconomic changes, especially when investors become aES avers to risk.

""The recent fall in the S&P 500, reaching a new minimum, serves as a strong sign that global markets face high uncertainty, which in turn is putting pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies,"" Linge said in a statement.

According to Linge, economic volatility indicators have exceeded the historical reference points, exceeding both the financial crisis of 2008 and pandemic in early 2020.

""This increase in uncertainty highlights the growing concern about the stability of the global economy, particularly while inflation pressures remain persistent,"" Linge added.

It is expected that Trump rates will feed inflation, which could lead to higher interest rates. This environment could be initially unfavorable for Bitcoin, since investors seek safe assets.

https://decrypt.co,Trump’s Crypto Conflicts Dominate Stablecoin Legislation Debate,https://decrypt.co/312993/trump-crypto-stablecoin-legislation-debate-house-stable-act,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 20:04:05 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

A House Financial Services Committee markup of stablecoin legislation appeared to go off course Wednesday, with Democrats spending hours hammering home the same message: Democrats would in principle support the STABLE Act, but see President Donald Trump’s personal involvement in the stablecoin sector as an unacceptable conflict of interest.

Multiple Democrats, including a co-sponsor of the STABLE Act itself, offered amendments to the bill on Wednesday that would have prevented the president, his cabinet, the first lady, and special government employees like Elon Musk from offering stablecoin products while in office.

One by one, over the course of hours, those amendments were shot down by voice vote the Committee's slim Republican majority.

Republican leadership countered the proposals by arguing the STABLE Act currently requires all issuers to comply with the same rules, and that boxing out certain issuers—even the sitting president himself—would stifle market competition. The Act would create a set of rules, involving compliance with anti-money laundering laws and reserve audits, that all stablecoin issuers would have to comply with to operate in American markets.

“We're not picking winners and losers here,” Committee Chair French Hill (R-AR) said. “If you don't want to use a payment stablecoin, don't use one.”

Numerous Democrats took issue with the position that the Trump family’s recently announced stablecoin, the World Liberty Financial USD1 token, should be treated like any other.

“He is unlike any other issuer because he's the president of the United States,” Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) retorted. “And he's going to take U.S. taxpayer money to assist his family business when it gets in trouble.”

Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to the U.S. dollar that allow cryptocurrency traders to enter and exit positions without the need to access dollars directly. Some stablecoin issuers, like the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial, purport to strengthen U.S. dollar hegemony by encouraging the use of dollar-backed assets in both foreign and digital asset markets. But absent a regulatory framework in the United States, the legality of such products remains in question.

The Trump family’s lucrative crypto investments have caused some controversy ever since the president returned to the White House, where he is currently overseeing the creation of the nation’s first ever digital assets regulatory framework. But the Trump family’s announcement last week of a stablecoin product—right at the moment that stablecoin legislation is moving quickly through both chambers of Congress—appears to have struck a particularly resonant chord with Democrats.

The timing appears to have been inadvertent. A source with direct knowledge of the matter told Decrypt that World Liberty did not intend to roll out its stablecoin so soon. The revelation of blockchain data concerning the product, though, appears to have forced the team’s hand.

It remains unclear whether the flare up over Trump’s crypto dealings will meaningfully change the calculus when it comes to bipartisan support for the STABLE Act, which has until now been widely expected to earn a fair number of Democrat votes. One House Financial Services Committee staffer told Decrypt Wednesday they do not anticipate much has changed after today’s mark up, in terms of Democrat support for the bill.

And yet on Monday, Rep. Hill, the Committee’s Republican chair, took the rare step of conceding that Trump’s crypto dealings—particularly, the president’s stablecoin and meme coin projects—have made the task of creating legislation in the same areas “more complicated.”

Some Democrats already cosponsoring the STABLE Act, including Rep. Sam Liccardo (D-CA), issued forceful rebukes of Trump’s crypto dealings on Wednesday. Liccardo said the need to prevent high-ranking officials like Trump from offering their own stablecoins was “self-evident and obvious,” and highlighted the potential for such tokens to offer foreign actors a means to curry favor with the president.

Another House staffer familiar with the work of the House Financial Services Committee told Decrypt, however, that Democrats who already cosponsored the bill embraced it last month as it was written then—and are unlikely to change their positions over tweaks that, while important, may not be existential.

“You can connect the dots on what will happen if those amendments don’t get in,” the staffer said.",decrypt

Fund manager Fidelity is allowing its clients to invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin via individual retirement accounts.

Starting Wednesday, investors have been able to get exposure to three virtual coins, which Fidelity already offers via its crypto trading service, by opening a ""crypto IRA.""

Decrypt reached out to Fidelity for comment.

The firm, which is the U.S.'s largest provider of 401(k) savings accounts, will custody the assets with the new service.

Bitcoin is the biggest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $1.7 trillion. Ethereum, the second biggest virtual coin, has a market cap of $228 billion.

Litecoin, which originally set out to be a faster, cheaper version of Bitcoin, is number 23 on the list, with a market cap of $6.4 billion. BTC was recently up about 1.3% in Wednesday trading, while ETH and LTC were in negative territory.

All of the virtual coins have been around since the digital asset industry's early days, with Litecoin launching in 2011—two years after Bitcoin's first block was mined.

Fidelity has been offering customers crypto for years. In 2022, along with Wall Street giants Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Paradigm, it launched EDX Markets, a crypto exchange for institutional investors.

That same year, Fidelity revealed it would allow workers to save 20% of retirement funds in Bitcoin.

The Boston-based firm is also one of the top asset managers that received the go-ahead from the SEC last year to launch Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) has generated nearly $11.4 billion in net inflows, the second most among the 11 funds currently trading, according to data from U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. Those funds now manage almost $100 billion in assets.

The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), which debuted last July, has received about $1.4 billion in net inflows, the second most among the nine funds currently trading, according to Farside.

Monday Marked the End of a Painful Quarter for Ethereum, as the Network’s Native Asset’s So-Called Burn Rate Fizzled Amid One of Its Worst Performanances in Recent Memory.

The metric, which tracks the rate of Ethereum Removed from Circulation, Recently Hit Its Lowest Level Since August 2021, A Nagging Concern Among Investors That’s “Weighed on Ethereum’s Market Performance,” According to the Crypto Market Maker Wintermute.

Last Week, Around 53 ETH Was Burned per day, The firm Said. MEAUHHILE, ETH’s Supply Has Increaseed 3% Since an upgrade Called EIP-1559 Took Effect, According to Ultrasound Money.

The Lower Burn Rate Undercores How Eth’s Ability to Accrue Value Has Shifted Since Developers Embraced Layer-2 Scaling Solutions A Year Ago. Since then, Ethereum’s So-Called Issuance Has Be Net Net Positive, Yet Some Experts Believe Institutional Adoption Trends Could Change Change that.

During the First Quarter, ETH’s Price Plummeted 45%, Wiping Away $ 170 Billion in Market Value, According to Crypto Data Providers Coingecko and Coinglass. That represented the third worst quarters for eth going as far back as 2016.

Years AGO, User Activity on Ethereum Became A Core Driver of Eth’s Value, When Ethereum Developers Implemented A Fee-Burning Mechanism Called EIP-1559 in August 2021.

While Ethereum’s Users Previously Paid Transaction Fees to Miners, The Network Started Burning Them Instead, Reducing The Asset’s Circulating Supply in Relation to Network Activity.

When Ethereum Later Transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake Consensus Model in 2022, Making Miners Obsolete and Vastly Reducing The Network’s Carbon Footprint, The Rate At What New Eth is Issued what reduced. Together, the upgrades Made Ethereum’s Circulating Supply Deflationary.

EIP-4844, an upgrade that significantly reduced the amount of eth burned by layer-2 networks, Changed that dynamic. As user activity has gravitated Toward Those Scaling Solutions, Transaction Fees have fall on Ethereum Too, Recently Hitting a Five Year Low of $ 0.40.

During the Pandemic-E-Crypto Boom, So-Called Gas Wars Plagued Ethereum Users, Who Sometimes Paid Upwards Of $ 4,000 for a Single Transaction. NFT Projects Were a Common Yet Ultimately Beneficial Source of Conesion, Like Those Tied to Bored Ape Yacht Club.

Tokenize Everything

As Wall Street Migrating on-Chain, some analysts Believe that eth Could Become Deflationary Again, if institutions end up Bringing Trillions of Dollars of Assets with Them.

The Process of Taking Real-World Assets, Such as Stocks and Bonds, and Represing Them on-Chain as Digital Tokens is Referred to As Tokenization.

In a letter to shareholder, Larry Fink, CEO of the World’s Largest Asset Manager, Blackrock, Menioned the Term a Dozen Times.

“One Day, I Expect Tokenized Funds wants to go family to investors as etfs,” Fink wrote. ""Every Stock, Every Bond, Every Fund - Eevery Asset -Can Be tokenized.""

Excluding Ethereum’s Layer-2 Networks, $ 5 Billion Worth of Real-World Assets have been tokenized on Ethereum, Accounting for 54% of the Market, According to RWA.XYZ. The Measure Excludes StableCoins, which Are Often Backed by Cash and U.S. Treasuries.

That sum could Broadly Grow to $ 16 Trillion by 2030, According to a Paper Published by Boston Consulting Group in October, but Estimates from Experts Vary Widely.

“We're not seeing the economic benefits from tokenization Yet,” Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon Told Decrypt. ""This is going to take Longer Than People Want It To Because Thesis Large Asset Managers Don't Move very quickly.""

A stablecoin called First Digital USD (FDUSD) lost its dollar peg on Wednesday after Tron founder Justin Sun claimed that its issuer, First Digital Trust, is effectively insolvent.

The Hong Kong-based firm is currently “unable to fulfill client fund redemptions,"" Sun warned in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, urging “regulators and law enforcement to take swift action to address these issues and prevent further major losses.”

First Digital Trust denied the allegation, saying on X that its stablecoin worth $2.5 billion is backed one-to-one with U.S. Treasuries. The firm described Sun’s rhetoric as part of a “smear campaign,” adding that it will pursue legal action to protect its rights and reputation.

Every dollar backing $FDUSD is completely, secure, safe and accounted for with US backed T-Bills. The… — First Digital (@FirstDigitalHQ) April 2, 2025

FDUSD—which is prominently used by top crypto exchange Binance after it dropped support for BUSD in 2023—plunged as low as $0.95 and was recently changing hands around $0.96, according to the crypto data provider CoinGecko. It had recovered to $0.97 before Sun doubled down.

Sun said on X that First Digital Trust’s insolvency is a “factual statement,” urging the company’s business partners to sever ties “as soon as possible to protect your assets.”

The crypto billionaire recently helped a firm called Techteryx avoid insolvency, CoinDesk reported on Wednesday, citing Hong Kong court documents.

The company, which acquired the stablecoin TrueUSD in 2020, reportedly needed a $456 million bailout from Sun after its reserves were allegedly misappropriated by First Digital Trust.

First Digital Trust manages TrueUSD’s reserves, and the company diverted cash to a Dubai-based entity instead of an investment vehicle registered in the Cayman Islands, the publication reported, citing court documents prepared by U.S. law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel.

When Techteryx tried to redeem funds between mid-2022 and early 2023, the company received “little or no funds back” from the Cayman Islands-based fund, and it allegedly defaulted on payments and failed to fulfill redemption requests, according to the court documents.

First Digital Trust has not had the chance to defend itself in court, the firm noted on X.

Despite its small market cap, the disruption centered around FDUSD is “a big deal,“ Coinbase's Head of Product, Conor Grogan, said on X Wednesday. Historically, the stablecoin has been popular among traders on Binance, with the exchange holding 94% of FDUSD in circulation.

Willemstad, Curaçao, April 2nd, 2025, Chainwire

Overtime, an onchain sportsbook platform, has formally integrated its parent protocol, Thales, under the Overtime brand. The consolidation introduces a unified identity for the protocol and coincides with the launch of a new native token, $OVER. As part of the transition, the project has also unveiled a new primary domain and implemented full Account Abstraction integration to enhance the platform's user experience.

With over four years of development, Overtime has established itself as a fully onchain sportsbook offering functionality comparable to traditional offchain platforms. Built on the Ethereum network, the protocol emphasizes transparency, security, and immutability. Overtime’s operational history includes:

Over $200 million in volumes

Support for over 100 sports and leagues

50,000 active users

More than 10,000 unique betting markets

Users can access the new Overtime domain here: https://www.overtime.io/

A Decentralized Alternative to Traditional Sports Betting

Overtime distinguishes itself from traditional bookmakers by operating a fully decentralized, permissionless sportsbook platform. Anyone can seamlessly access Overtime with a simple connection without the barriers of traditional restrictive betting limits, arbitrary bans, or withheld payouts.

Since its inception, Overtime has organically become the primary driver of Thales DAO growth. Recognizing this growth, the DAO’s community unanimously approved (via Thales Improvement Proposal 238) the full merger of Thales DAO to the branding of Overtime.

Comprehensive Onchain User Experience Enabled by Full Account Abstraction

With this launch, Overtime is also introducing a new concept: Overtime Accounts—an onchain smart account designed to abstract wallet and EVM network complexities.

Overtime Accounts use Particle Network for the seamless creation of wallets via Social Logins, and Biconomy’s SDK to handle the smart-account functionalities, enabling frictionless transactions through its Paymaster, Bundler, and Session Keys infrastructure.

After creating an Overtime Account, users can deposit supported collateral into their designated address to access Overtime’s onchain sportsbook interface. The platform supports features such as parlays, system bets, same-game parlays (SGPs), futures, and live betting. Transactions are executed through an account abstraction framework, removing the need for manual confirmations or the use of ETH to cover gas fees.

Overtime’s user experience has been designed to minimize blockchain-related complexities, allowing users to engage with the platform's sportsbook features without requiring technical knowledge of underlying blockchain processes. The interface offers a streamlined experience comparable to traditional web applications while maintaining the transparency and self-custody benefits provided by the Ethereum network.

A new Overtime UX is available here: https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/

The new Overtime DAO token: $OVER

The new $OVER token will have a new total supply of 69.42M, compared to the original 100M of the THALES token. This means that 30.58M THALES tokens will be burned in preparation for the migration to $OVER. All THALES token holders will be able to migrate their $THALES to $OVER token at a 1:1 ratio on the new overtime.io domain. This aligns with the new sustainable tokenomics designed to foster growth and focus it entirely on the $OVER token.

The new $OVER token will serve multiple utilities:

$OVER as Betting Collateral: By using $OVER token as collateral on Overtime, users will enjoy improved odds (2% better than baseline odds) compared to other collaterals. This boosts $OVER token usage and aligns token holders with platform users.

By using $OVER token as collateral on Overtime, users will enjoy improved odds (2% better than baseline odds) compared to other collaterals. This boosts $OVER token usage and aligns token holders with platform users. Buyback & Burn: All fees from Overtime will flow directly towards $OVER token buybacks, focusing the entire growth of the project towards the token. Burning the buybacks reinforces deflationary token dynamics.

All fees from Overtime will flow directly towards $OVER token buybacks, focusing the entire growth of the project towards the token. Burning the buybacks reinforces deflationary token dynamics. Governance Token: Holding $OVER grants voting power within Overtime’s decentralized governance structure.

The $OVER token is built using Chainlink’s CCT token standard for easy and secure cross-network bridging using Chainlink’s CCIP. The token will be live and liquid on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base across prominent decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, Velodrome, and Aerodrome.

A global movement

Overtime represents an onchain revolution, a real-life example of how a traditional industry is improved by going onchain. It is a fair, permissionless, and globally accessible powerhouse that is bound to organically dethrone all classic offchain platforms.

Unlike traditional sportsbooks that may restrict users based on performance, Overtime operates on a fully transparent and onchain infrastructure. The platform’s design ensures that participation is governed by smart contracts, removing the ability to impose user-specific limitations. Engagement is determined solely by the interaction between users and the underlying liquidity smart contracts.

To date, Overtime has distributed cryptocurrency-based incentives, rewards, and competition payouts amounting to several million dollars in value. Participation in Overtime’s promotional campaigns and airdrops is open to all users, subject to eligibility criteria and regional availability.

The platform supports multiple cryptocurrencies and provides fiat onramp options through credit card payments. Overtime replicates the core functionalities of traditional sportsbooks while operating through decentralized infrastructure.

London, UK, April 2nd, 2025, Chainwire

Decentraland's flagship virtual event returns April 9–12, showcasing digital fashion as a new canvas for storytelling, activism, and global identity.

Metaverse Fashion Week (MVFW) returns to Decentraland from April 9–12, amid a shifting fashion landscape characterized by declining traditional luxury sales and evolving consumer preferences. MVFW 2025 highlights digital fashion's growing relevance as a meaningful response to these industry transformations. Under this year's theme, ""Infinite Identities,"" more than 47 global designers and brands leverage digital mediums to challenge creative boundaries and articulate nuanced cultural identities.

Hosted on Decentraland 2.0, the platform’s newly redesigned desktop client offers improved visuals, greater interactivity, and better accessibility. These enhancements, developed during the event's hiatus, provide an immersive and engaging environment for attendees and creators alike.

“This year’s Metaverse Fashion Week comes at a critical moment for fashion and our society at large; one marked by rethinking priorities, authenticity, and connection,"" says Bay Backner, Head Producer of MVFW. “I’ve had the privilege of working closely with every designer and brand taking part, and I’ve seen how digital fashion can elevate unheard voices, ask important questions, and spark real cultural change. In a time like this, when the physical world feels increasingly heavy or limiting, third spaces like Decentraland become places where people can breathe, create, and truly be themselves. MVFW 2025 channels that energy into a live moment for fashion’s next breakout names and creative economies.”

https://decrypt.co,US Crypto Taxes in 2025: What You Need to Know,https://decrypt.co/resources/us-crypto-taxes-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:44:23 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Whether you’re casually trading meme coins or deeply immersed in DeFi, understanding your tax obligations now could help you avoid headaches—or penalties—later.

For much of its existence, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ignored crypto. That changed in 2019 under the Trump Administration, when the IRS began requiring citizens to report their crypto holdings. A crypto-related question appeared on Schedule 1 of Form 1040 in 2020, asking taxpayers whether they had made any cryptocurrency transactions during the year.

“You may have to report transactions with digital assets such as cryptocurrency and non fungible tokens (NFTs) on your tax return,” the IRS said in a post. “Income from digital assets is taxable.”

This article will examine current crypto tax policies in 2025, how Donald Trump's return to office influences the crypto regulatory landscape, and what these changes mean for investors. Whether you’re headed to the moon—or facing an audit—your outcome depends on how well you navigate the complex U.S. tax system.

What is taxable in the crypto world?

Despite its name, cryptocurrency is not currency—at least not as far as the United States government is concerned.

Purchasing cryptocurrency, by itself, is not a taxable event. Buying and holding digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana does not trigger tax liability. However, crypto becomes taxable when sold, traded, or used to purchase goods or services—essentially, when a transaction occurs and a gain or loss is realized.

“Since the IRS classifies cryptocurrency as property, most transactions are taxable,” Navin Sethi, partner at Eisner Advisory Group LLC, told Decrypt. “Examples of reportable transactions include but are not limited to sales to fiat, swaps to stablecoins or other cryptocurrency, and purchases/sales of NFTs.”

Capital gains and losses

Capital gains taxes apply to profits from selling, trading, or using cryptocurrencies. Investors may owe capital gains tax if they made more money from selling their digital asset than they paid for it. The amount owed, however, depends on the length the asset was held for, and the investor’s tax bracket.

Short-term gains refer to assets held for less than one year that are taxed at your ordinary income rate.

refer to assets held for less than one year that are taxed at your ordinary income rate. Long-term gains, which refer to assets held for over a year, are taxed at reduced rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on income.

Sethi noted that cryptocurrency transactions are reported on Schedule D of IRS Form 1040 as capital gains or losses. Whether a transaction is considered short-term or long-term depends on how long the asset was held. If held for over a year, it qualifies for long-term capital gains treatment, typically with a lower tax rate.

He added that the IRS is tightening its crypto reporting rules, requiring investors to track and report gains and losses by individual wallets rather than using a universal basis method.

“Starting January 1, 2025, taxpayers can no longer use the universal basis method and instead must track their basis by wallet,” Sethi said. “Special situations could impact the character or treatment of the reporting; consult your tax advisor about your personal tax situation.”

Income events

The IRS treats several types of cryptocurrency activity as ordinary income, meaning they’re taxable under regular income tax rules—not capital gains. In these cases, the fair market value on the day the crypto was received determines how much is owed.

Here’s what counts as taxable income:

Getting paid in crypto : Whether it’s for goods, services, or a job, if you’re paid in cryptocurrency, the value at the time you receive it is taxed as income.

Whether it’s for goods, services, or a job, if you’re paid in cryptocurrency, the value at the time you receive it is taxed as income. Mining rewards : Any crypto earned from mining is taxable based on its value when you receive it. If you're mining as a business, it could also be hit with self-employment taxes.

Any crypto earned from mining is taxable based on its value when you receive it. If you're mining as a business, it could also be hit with self-employment taxes. Staking rewards : Like mining, staking rewards are taxed as income based on their fair market value at that time.

Like mining, staking rewards are taxed as income based on their fair market value at that time. Airdrops and hard forks : If you receive new tokens from an airdrop or a hard fork, the IRS considers them income once you can access them and taxes them accordingly.

If you receive new tokens from an airdrop or a hard fork, the IRS considers them income once you can access them and taxes them accordingly. DeFi interest or yield : Earnings from lending your crypto or participating in DeFi protocols (like earning yield or interest) are also taxable as ordinary income.

Earnings from lending your crypto or participating in DeFi protocols (like earning yield or interest) are also taxable as ordinary income. Referral bonuses and promos: Any incentives, such as referral rewards or ""play-to-earn"" campaigns, are taxable income when you receive the crypto. However, the specific tax treatment may vary depending on the nature of the reward and how it's obtained within the game.

In all these scenarios, the dollar value of the crypto at the time of receipt determines your tax liability.

“With crypto treated as property, taxpayers need to treat each transaction as a taxable event, calculating gains or losses based on their cost basis and holding period,” Derek Wride, Founder of crypto tax software CPAI, told Decrypt. “In 2025, this will become even more critical as IRS enforcement and new reporting requirements ramp up.”

Capital gains are tricky enough in traditional finance, but as Wride explained, they get even more complicated with cryptocurrency, where every action is a transaction.

“The challenge with crypto is tracking your cost basis over thousands of small transactions across wallets and exchanges, often with incomplete or conflicting data,” he said.

NFTs and collectibles

NFTs may be taxed as collectibles—which carry a higher 28% tax rate on long-term capital gains—if they represent an underlying collectible item. This is higher than the typical 20% rate for other long-term capital assets.

To determine whether an NFT is a collectible, the IRS uses a “look-through analysis,” examining what the NFT represents. If it points to things like artwork, antiques, gems, precious metals, stamps, coins, or alcoholic beverages, it may be classified as a collectible.

Short-term gains on NFTs held for less than a year are taxed as ordinary income, ranging from 10% to 37%.

All NFT-related activities—buying, selling, trading, depositing, or transferring—must be reported on your tax return. Because guidance is still evolving, consult a tax professional to ensure compliance.

What’s new in 2025?

Here are the key IRS updates taking effect in 2025:

New Tax Form (1099-DA) : Under Form 1099-DA, U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges must begin reporting user transactions, gross proceeds from crypto sales and trades using Form 1099-DA. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, brokers must also report the cost basis of crypto transactions to help investors determine gains or losses.

: Under Form 1099-DA, U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges must begin reporting user transactions, gross proceeds from crypto sales and trades using Form 1099-DA. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, brokers must also report the cost basis of crypto transactions to help investors determine gains or losses. Wallet-by-Wallet Accounting : Investors must now calculate the cost basis separately for each wallet. The cost basis is whatever you paid in U.S. dollars to acquire a token plus any associated fees.

: Investors must now calculate the cost basis separately for each wallet. The cost basis is whatever you paid in U.S. dollars to acquire a token plus any associated fees. Temporary Safe Harbor: Beginning January 1 through December 31, 2025, the IRS will allow “alternative identification” methods for digital assets—giving exchanges and taxpayers time to adapt to new digital asset identification requirements.

Penalties

Failure to report crypto transactions can lead to severe fines and penalties, including:

Fines of up to $100,000 for individuals.

Up to 75% of unpaid tax as an additional penalty.

Accrued interest on unpaid amounts.

Criminal charges.

Up to five years in prison.

It's important to note that while enforcement is increasing, these penalties represent the most extreme causes of tax fraud.

How to calculate and report your crypto taxes

Tracking tools and software

Providing crypto tax services has become a booming industry, and several platforms are on the market that can help track transactions, calculate gains, and generate tax reports. These platforms include:

CoinLedger, ZenLedger, and CoinTracker: Integrate with TurboTax and H&R Block.

Integrate with TurboTax and H&R Block. Koinly: Supports 23,000+ cryptocurrencies across 20+ countries.

Supports 23,000+ cryptocurrencies across 20+ countries. TokenTax: Covers DeFi, NFT, and futures trading.

Covers DeFi, NFT, and futures trading. Blockpit (formerly Accointing): Supports 150+ exchanges and 60+ wallets.

Supports 150+ exchanges and 60+ wallets. CPAI: Uses AI to automate the crypto tax preparation process.

Token-tracking software makes it easy to switch between the different cost basis methods to compare your total liability under each one. The most popular ones are:

FIFO (first in, first out)

LIFO (last in, first out)

HIFO (highest in, first out)

Conclusion

With new IRS reporting requirements and increased enforcement, accurate crypto tax reporting is more important than ever. Start organizing your records as early as possible, use reliable tax software, and seek professional guidance to stay compliant—and avoid costly penalties.

As lawmakers grapple with regulating the evolving crypto space, some want to eliminate rules that don’t fit the technology.

​In February 2025, the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee advanced a resolution to prevent the IRS from imposing tax reporting requirements on decentralized finance projects that would classify DeFi projects as brokers, obligating them to provide users with Form 1099 tax documents.

This move reflects growing concern that applying traditional financial rules to decentralized technologies could stifle innovation and drive activity offshore.

“As crypto tax legislation develops, I believe we’ll see some retracing of past regulatory oversteps,” Wride said. “If policymakers recognize the importance of maintaining healthy on-chain transaction volume, we could see fewer taxable events and a more rational approach to crypto taxation overall.”",decrypt

Grayscale Investments is listing two exchange-traded funds giving investors a modified source of income based on Bitcoin's volatile price movements, the crypto asset manager announced Wednesday.

The Bitcoin Covered Call ETF (BTCC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Premium Income ETF (BPI) use covered call strategies that allow investors to buy equity shares they already own at a given price.

Neither fund gives investors exposure to Bitcoin directly but rather the opportunity to cash in on the asset's potential upside via contracts that bet on the cryptocurrency's performance.

The new funds will use options Bitcoin exchange-traded products, including Grayscale's two spot Bitcoin ETFs, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC).

BTCC and BPI, which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange, are among the latest crypto offerings from issuers trying to meet investors’ voracious appetite for digital asset-focused products.

Grayscale was among 10 asset managers that last year received the green light from the SEC to launch a Bitcoin ETF. GBTC, which traded as a trust before converting to an ETF, manages about $16.5 billion in assets.

BTCC is ""an income-first strategy, potentially ideal for investors seeking regular cash flows and high yielding opportunities,"" while BPI aims to generate income and increase the fund's value over time.

Bitcoin funds had the most successful ETF launch in the products' 32-year history and now manage nearly $100 billion in assets. They have given investors previously locked out of the world of crypto investing.

The asset manager then converted its Ethereum trust to an ETF later that year. The asset manager also has trusts giving investors exposure to Bitcoin Cash, Filecoin, Chainlink, Litecoin, and other digital assets, and has taken steps toward debuting funds based on different altcoins.

“Grayscale® Bitcoin Covered Call ETF may complement an investors existing Bitcoin exposure by adding income, while Grayscale Bitcoin Premium Income ETF offers an alternative to Bitcoin ownership, aiming to balance upside participation and income generation for investors,” said David LaValle, Global Head of ETFs at Grayscale. ""We understand that every investor has unique needs, and we're excited to offer these new products that not only may capture and deliver income but also offer differentiated outcomes and behavioral characteristics tailored to their specific goals.""

Off the Grid creator Gunzilla Games added a Bored Ape Yacht Club-themed content pack Wednesday as part of an “Ape-ril” promotion for Pro subscribers of its battle royale game.

The pack contains two new Bored Ape-inspired skins or avatar designs, along with two Ape-themed guns and two fresh emotes that allow users to “go apeshit” or “hump for dominance” when celebrating their in-game achievements.

“Time to go full ape sh*t with two Bored Apes battling for clout, coin, and chaos,” the game’s official account posted on X (formerly Twitter), alongside a promotional trailer that features Apes running around inside the game world.

Off the Grid also released a limited edition “Ape-fool Mask” that was only claimable on Tuesday for users that played at least one game on April Fool’s Day, making it a potentially rare in-game item given the limited availability window.

The Bored Ape Yacht Club is one of the most prominent Ethereum NFT collections, and surged to prominence in 2021 and 2022 alongside the broader market. Bored Ape NFTs peaked at a price of nearly $430,000 worth of ETH in April 2022, though now start for about $29,000 worth of ETH.

Owners of Bored Ape NFTs can use their avatar's likeness in commercial products, including in video games and on merchandise.

Off the Grid's Bored Ape pack launch comes just days after Gunzilla’s GUNZ mainnet rollout and the token generation event for its Gunz token (GUN). GUNZ is a gaming-centric Avalanche L1 network that will support Off the Grid and potential other future crypto games.

Despite the excitement surrounding the game and the GUNZ launch, GUN has dropped consistently since its launch, falling another 10% in the last 24 hours to $0.055—and more than 53% overall from its $0.115 peak.

At current prices, the token falls outside the top 50 gaming tokens by market cap and #800 overall, according to CoinGecko. Its $32 million market cap is particularly small compared to other major crypto gaming tokens, due to only around 6% of tokens being in circulation.

However, when comparing GUN by fully diluted value—or the current token price multiplied by its total supply—at a $550 million FDV, GUN is valued higher than other notable game-adjacent tokens like ApeCoin (APE) and Parallel’s PRIME, which are valued at $468 million and $395 million, respectively.

Off the Grid has yet to implement the GUN token and GUNZ mainnet following the launch earlier this week. Gunzilla’s Web3 Head Theodore Agranat told Decrypt on Tuesday that the mainnet migration is a “main priority” right now, but there’s no ETA yet on when that process will be completed.

You get an ape and pfp it, I play your game. Simple. Logging in to @playoffthegrid tonight pic.twitter.com/zWH2WjYewe — Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) April 2, 2025

Token price and mainnet migration aside, Off the Grid drew in at least one new player thanks to its new Ape content pack and Bored Ape profile picture (or PFP) on X.

“You get an Ape and PFP it, I play your game. Simple,” wrote Yuga Labs CEO and Bored Ape Yacht Club co-founder Greg Solano. “Logging in to Off the Grid tonight.”

Gunzilla did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment regarding the Bored Ape Yacht Club-inspired content pack.

Crypto and stock markets alike saw a jump Wednesday morning following a report that Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk will depart his current role as a close ally to President Donald Trump.

Bitcoin rapidly spiked to $87,300 for the first time since March 27, while major stock market indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both bounced into the green for the day following the publication of Politico's report, which cites three sources close to Trump who asked not to be named.

Tesla (TSLA)—one of the world's biggest publicly traded Bitcoin reserve holders—saw a surge following the report, rebounding following Wednesday's release of a brutal quarterly report showing falling demand and production for Musk's electric car maker.

TSLA jumped above $280 following the report, but has settled to about $275 as of this writing, up nearly 3% on the day. The stock has been battered in recent months, falling from a peak above $480 set in December as Musk's political moves have proven controversial.

Bitcoin has since cooled to about $86,770 as of this writing, but remains up by nearly 2% on the day.

According to the report, Trump has told his inner circle and members of his cabinet that Musk ""will be stepping back in the coming weeks"" from his prominent role as a close Trump advisor. Musk is unlikely to disappear entirely from Trump's administration, the report claims, but his departure may be timed with the end of his status as a ""special government employee"" in the coming weeks.

Per the report, there's concern among Trump advisors that Musk is starting to become a political liability for Trump.

The report comes following a Republican loss in Wisconsin's Supreme Court judge election on Tuesday—a race in which Musk personally spent $20 million to support Trump's favored candidate, Brad Schimel. But Schimel was handily defeated by the Democrat-backed Susan Crawford, who won by 10%.

Both Musk and Trump have publicly hinted in recent days that the Tesla head's time in government could be ending.

Musk is the figurehead of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a government cost-cutting initiative that had led to mass layoffs at various agencies—and plenty of court challenges about DOGE's authority. While Musk was announced to head DOGE, the White House has since clarified that is officially a ""senior advisor to the president.""

DOGE is indeed apparently inspired by Dogecoin (DOGE), Musk's longtime favorite cryptocurrency, with the meme logo briefly appearing on the government website in January. Trump also sells a t-shirt featuring himself, Musk, and the coin's familiar Shiba Inu meme mascot.",decrypt

Elon Musk’s X, formerly Twitter, has filed a brief to the U.S. Supreme Court questioning the legality of sending “broad, suspicionless” requests for data to crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and other firms.

Many crypto exchanges have been hit by these types of requests, termed “John Doe” requests. And it’s not been limited to Coinbase: Competitor crypto exchange Kraken and USDC stablecoin issuer Circle received them in 2021.

The brief was filed in support of the case of James Harper, who has been locked in a legal battle with the IRS since 2020. Harper’s civil case objected to the IRS using a subpoena to obtain three years of transaction records concerning over 14,000 customers from cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, including himself.

The argument hinges on the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment, which protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government, ensuring that warrants are issued only when the government can prove probable cause and provides specific details.

The X attorney’s brief, filed on Friday, asks whether these Fourth Amendment protections permit “warrantless searches of customer records held by third-party service providers if the records are contractually owned by the customer” and “if those records enable surveillance of future behavior.”

The brief says that “Mr. Harper’s contract with the exchange made clear that the records belonged to him and that the exchange would protect his privacy.”

In particular, the brief focuses on what is called the “third-party doctrine,” a legal precedent established in the 1970s that can enable these types of invasive data requests—as long as they are directed toward a third party, rather than a particular private individual.

For example, the application of the “third-party doctrine” could allow the government to access an individual's bank records, which they gave consent for the bank to access, without a warrant, but not papers stored in their home.

A decision by the Supreme Court in favor of Mr. Harper would bolster legal protections against data requests by all U.S. companies, outside of the crypto industry, including X. But the Supreme Court, the final court of appeal, has not yet agreed to hear James Harper’s case.

Though the outcome of the case could impact the fortunes of X, the third-party doctrine has had plenty of criticism from independent legal academics who think it is outdated in today’s digital age. There have also been judges who ruled against the third-party doctrine when it comes to accessing geolocation data from smartphones and smart home devices.

Solana meme coin Act I: The AI Prophecy (ACT) crashed 55% in less than an hour on Tuesday, as millions of dollars worth of positions were liquidated on Binance. This has led to a campaign across social media to stop using the popular centralized exchange, spurred on by the hashtag #BoycottBinance.

Traders believed these liquidations came following the exchange changing its leverage and margin tiers. Put simply, Binance increased the amount of collateral traders needed to keep leveraged positions open, both long and short. Users who didn’t adjust their margin accordingly saw their accounts liquidated.

In the hour following the change, according to CoinGlass, over $3.89 million worth of ACT positions, mostly long contracts, were liquidated on Binance as the token tumbled 55%—causing a cascade of liquidations across other exchanges, including $785,540 on Bybit and $612,600 on OKX. Over a 24 hour period, according to DEX Screener, ACT fell 66% from a $179.4 million market cap to $60.5 million.

Binance later claimed in a blog post that the drop was caused by four users selling approximately $1,0150,000 worth of ACT on the exchange, adding that it is opening an investigation into the incident.

“We understand the ACT community's concerns regarding today's unforeseen price action, and want to clarify that these market movements were outside of our control,” the ACT X, formerly Twitter, account posted. “We will release a postmortem report once there is complete clarity on the situation and finality in the solutions we are working on.”

As the token plummeted, market maker Wintermute was caught in the cross fire when its traders saw that it was selling ACT amid the chaos. Specifically, there were four sales from the firm’s public wallet on Solana decentralized exchange Raydium totalling $255,503. But this was then followed up 15 minutes later by three larger purchases of ACT via Binance totalling $377,656.

Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO at Wintermute, told Decrypt that this was a “basic arbitrage” move made by its algorithm to automatically sell on Raydium while purchasing on Binance. Gaevoy was describing an arbitrage strategy, which takes advantage of the difference in the price of ACT between two liquidity pools. Wintermute sold the tokens in the more expensive pool and bought the tokens in cheaper pool, effectively balancing the pools out.

Meanwhile #BoycottBinance started to spread across social media as traders found a number of other meme coins on the exchange that had also crashed, including Sui based token Sudeng (HIPPO) that dropped 36.5% in an hour.

“If the entire space collectively stopped using Binance, they’d no longer be the absolute terror they are [to] this industry,” pseudonymous crypto sleuth Crypto Rug Muncher posted on X. “All they do is list scams, and they’re no better than any of the other rotten CEXs out there despite their market share. Stop giving them your money, and they’d quickly become irrelevant.”

Binance is the biggest centralized exchange in the industry with a 34.7% market share in December, according to a CoinGecko report, with Crypto.com in second place holding just 11.2%. The recent uproar hasn’t changed much as, over the past 24 hours Binance processed the most spot trading volume with over $16.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, while Bybit sat in second place with just $2.4 billion.

Another pseudonymous on-chain detective, Dethective, highlighted that the majority of Binance listings in 2025 are currently in the red, with an average loss of 44%. Similar figures through 2024 can be seen via a Dune dashboard. Some traders believe this is because the exchange only lists “scam shitcoins” rather than focusing on legitimate projects.

""We aim to strike the right balance between providing users access to new and promising digital assets while ensuring we take appropriate measures including due diligence to protect users,"" a Binance spokesperson told Decrypt.

ACT was listed by Binance in November, causing the token to skyrocket over 2,000% over a 10 hour period from a market cap of just $21 million to about $460 million. This came as the creator of the original Web2 ACT fundraising project, known as Amp, was denouncing the crypto token. In fact, they still call the project a “scam” to this day.

$ACT IS A SCAM. ""Act I: The AI Prophecy"" IS A SCAM. The Act I project is not affiliated with any crypto token. If someone sent you here anyway, they're trying to scam you. For more information, please watch this video. 🔽 https://t.co/F9pIoJTjCJ — &. (@amplifiedamp) March 12, 2025

“I hereby declare my personal decision to boycott Binance,” one pseudonymous X user said, in response to the recent controversy. “I have already withdrawn all my assets from the platform and will no longer conduct any trading activity on Binance.”

As the pressure has mounted on the exchange, BNB (BNB), the native token for the Binance Smart Chain, has fallen 2.5% over the past 24 hours, despite VanEck filing for the creation of a BNB ETF on Tuesday.

Nintendo shared its launch plans for the Switch 2 console in a long-awaited livestream Wednesday, announcing that the successor to the massively popular convertible game device will release in June.

The Switch 2 will hit North American retailers on June 5 and sell for $450 on its own, or $500 with a download code for Mario Kart World included. The base model is $150 more than the original Switch's launch price.

Nintendo also shared some details about what new hardware features mean for the Switch 2 experience. The Switch 2 will feature a 7.9-inch LCD display at a crisper 1080p resolution, with HDR support and the option for 120 frames per second on supported games—but the hardware itself won't be any thicker than the original Switch model.

The system will come with 256GB of internal storage—that's eight times more than the original Switch model. It will also support microSD Express cards for expandable storage, but not traditional microSD cards.

And the dock will enable 4K resolution when you play on your TV. As previously announced, the Switch 2 will also play original Switch games, both physical and digital, with a Switch transfer feature available to move data over to the new console.

The new Joy-Con controllers feature a magnetic attachment, as previously hinted, with larger control sticks that hopefully will be less susceptible to breaking down (or ""drifting"") over time. And yes, the Joy-Cons can be used individually like a mouse on a table for supported games.

Chat, share your game screen, and hang out with friends using GameChat, a new online feature for #NintendoSwitch2! #NintendoDirect pic.twitter.com/uhobno5cju — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) April 2, 2025

For example, the previously spotted ""C"" button on the right Joy-Con controller will pull up a GameChat feature that lets you connect with friends in a Discord-like audio conversation while you game.

There's also a screen-sharing feature available, though even Nintendo's own stream suggested that the video quality will be pretty choppy for external observers. You can add your own image to streams via a USB camera, including one that Nintendo itself will release on day one, as well as put your face in certain supported games.

GameChat will be free to use for any Switch 2 owner through March 31, 2026, though it will require a Switch Online paid subscription after that.

The hardware will be flanked by notable games such as Mario Kart World—a more expansive-looking sequel to the hit driving series, with larger tracks, 24 drivers on the courses (double the previous norm), and fresh elements like weather conditions and swappable costumes.

You'll even drive between the interconnected courses alongside your rivals, with a separate Free Roam mode letting you explore all of the connected terrain. Nintendo will host another livestream dedicated to Mario Kart World on April 17 to showcase more details from the game.

Nintendo also teased another racing game, Kirby's Air Riders, and a new 3D Donkey Kong game called Donkey Kong Bananza—yes, like ""bananas."" The latter will release on July 17.

Nintendo will also release upgraded editions of some original Switch games—such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, both of which will feature crisper graphics and smoother frame rates.

Meanwhile, an upgraded version of last fall's Mario Party Jamboree brings in various new features, including gameplay that uses cameras, while Kirby and the Forgotten Land adds a new world alongside visual upgrades. These enhanced versions will be sold on their own for Switch 2, and owners of the Switch originals can purchase an upgrade pack to get the enhancements on Switch 2.

Upcoming Nintendo games Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Pokémon Legends: Z-A will both be released across the Switch and Switch 2 alike, with performance enhancements added for the Switch 2 versions.

The stream also featured various third-party games coming to Switch 2, such as Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Hades 2, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Street Fighter 6, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, Hitman: World of Assassination, Borderlands 4, and enhanced versions of Sid Meier's Civilization 7 and Hogwarts Legacy.

Nintendo is also working on a new Hyrule Warriors action game with Koei Tecmo, Age of Imprisonment, featuring a storyline set before the start of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. It's due out next winter.

The Switch 2 will also feature GameCube games available exclusively to Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers, with titles like The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur 2, and F-Zero GX offered digitally—with both local and online multiplayer available.

Additional titles like Super Mario Sunshine and Luigi's Mansion are also planned for the library, with Nintendo set to sell a GameCube-like wireless controller for Switch 2 as well.

Bitcoin could soon find a place on state balance sheets, with Alabama and Minnesota both pressing ahead with legislative frameworks for state Bitcoin reserves.

In Minnesota, House File 2946, also called the Minnesota Bitcoin Act, introduced by Rep. B. Olson (R-MN) on Tuesday, would allow the state to invest in Bitcoin directly. Its Senate counterpart, SF 2661, was introduced earlier in March.

The identical bills seek to authorize the State Board of Investment to allocate public funds into Bitcoin, marking a direct acknowledgment of the digital asset’s long-term financial potential.

Meanwhile in Alabama, Senate Bill 283, filed this week by Sen. April Weaver (R-AL)is a companion to House Bill 482, introduced earlier in March.

Though neither bill explicitly names Bitcoin, the legislation limits eligibility to digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $750 billion.

Currently, only Bitcoin meets that threshold, effectively making it the sole qualifying asset under the proposed framework.

If the proposals pass, they would take effect on October 1, 2025 in Alabama and January 1, 2026 in Minnesota.

Both states are embracing a legislative tactic commonly used to fast-track approval: introducing identical bills in both chambers.

HF 2946/SF 2661 would allow the state to not only invest in Bitcoin but also accept it for tax payments and government transactions.

The bill amends more than a dozen statutes to incorporate crypto, including tax codes, pension plans, and investment rules.

The Alabama legislation also outlines digital assets must be held directly by the treasurer, by a qualified custodian, or via exchange-traded products, and cannot exceed 10% of any state fund.

U.S. state Bitcoin reserve proposals

The proposals follow a wider trend of state-level efforts across the U.S. to explore the world’s largest crypto as a strategic reserve asset.

While some states, including Wyoming, Montana, and Pennsylvania, have recently paused or withdrawn their Bitcoin reserve plans, the momentum remains strong elsewhere.

South Carolina recently introduced a bill to allow its treasurer to allocate up to 10% of certain state funds into digital assets—starting with Bitcoin.

Oklahoma’s House Bill 1203, which allows for crypto asset reserves, passed overwhelmingly and is pending Senate review. Texas passed Senate Bill 21 to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve and is awaiting gubernatorial approval.

Arizona and Utah have introduced their own frameworks, although Utah’s reserve language was dropped during revisions.

Bitcoin reserve tracker Bitcoin Law’s data shows that 47 state-level Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced in 26 states, 41 of which are currently live.

Sentiment around the passing of a state Bitcoin reserve proposal appears to have turned negative, however. Users of MYRIAD, the decentralized prediction market launched by Decrypt’s parent company DASTAN, overwhelmingly predicted that no state would implement such a reserve, in a market that closed at the end of March.",decrypt

Bitcoin was broadly flat on Wednesday as the crypto markets await details of Donald Trump's planned tariffs.

The White House is describing April 2 as ""Liberation Day,"" with the president set to make an announcement at 4 p.m. Eastern Time during his Make America Wealthy Again event in the White House Rose Garden.

Uncertainty looms about which products imported to the U.S. will be most affected—as well as the countries that will be hardest hit.

European stocks were trading lower in the run-up to Trump's address, and according to Bloomberg, many Wall Street firms are expecting heightened volatility in the S&P 500 as details emerge.

That could prove problematic for Bitcoin, as stock market sell-offs tend to have a negative impact on the world's biggest cryptocurrency.

At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price has gained 1.1% and had nearly reclaimed $85,000. Meanwhile, the Ethereum price has lost 0.2% over the past day. ETH is currently changing hands for $1,880.45, according to CoinGecko data.

Data from Newhedge suggests the fates of BTC and U.S. equities are closely tied right now. On a scale from -1 to 1, the correlation currently stands at 0.74, indicating both markets are almost always moving in the same direction.

In a note seen by Decrypt, BRN lead analyst Valentin Fournier warned the threat of a global trade war is prompting institutional investors to scale back risk exposure. Tuesday saw $158 million flow out of ETFs tracking BTC's spot price, according to SoSoValue.

""Notably, this capital rotation coincides with new inflows into gold, as investors hedge against uncertainty surrounding Trump’s upcoming 'Liberation Day' announcements,"" he wrote.

Fournier went on to note that Bitcoin's dominance, referring to its share of the total crypto market, now stands at 61.8%. That's compared with 52.3% a year ago—an indication that traders are pulling out of lesser-known altcoins, CoinMarketCap data shows.

With BTC's bull run on ice, a wider question is how long Trump's tariff campaign will last and whether struggling markets will force the president to change tack.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is slated to release its March employment numbers on Friday morning. The jobs report beat estimates in February, but BLS data showed that the unemployment rate still rose to 3.9%.

Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, believes the president will be forced to backtrack in the next 6 to 12 months because this policy risks ""choking global supply chains and hiking prices for U.S. consumers.""

""History teaches us that trade wars are easy to start but hard to win, and the early signs of strain are already visible across markets and boardrooms,"" he warned.

Green went on to argue that a reversal is ""almost inevitable"" because ""markets crave clarity, businesses need stability, and consumers demand relief.""

Bitcoin miners continue to face challenges, with 14 top public companies in the space collectively having their worst month on record in March, according to investment bank JP Morgan.

In a Tuesday report, the Wall Street giant said that the Bitcoin miners it tracks, which include the likes of MARA and Core Scientific, collectively shed 25%—or about $6 billion—of their value market cap last month.

Analysts at the bank Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce added in their report that companies with high-powered computing exposure “generally underperformed pure-play miners for the second consecutive month.” Some Bitcoin miners have branched out to the AI data center industry in a bid to earn more cash.

The data from the investment bank comes after the 14 miners also struggled in February, when they also lost over 20%—again around $6 billion—of their combined market cap.

President Donald Trump promised to help the digital asset industry on the campaign trail, and specifically spoke about the mining space, claiming that he wanted all future Bitcoin to be 100% American-made.

The industry is far from easy, though, as miners told Decrypt at last week’s annual Mining Disrupt conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, as the price of Bitcoin dips while mining difficulty steadily rises.

Bitcoin miners are typically industrial operations of warehouses full of computers that work to secure the network. Miners are rewarded in newly minted coins for processing blocks on the decentralized payment network, but when the price of BTC drops, businesses can struggle to cover their costs.

Bitcoin is down nearly 22% from its all-time high of nearly $109,000—which it hit when President Trump was inaugurated on January 20.

Sentient, a San Francisco-based AI development lab valued at $1.2 billion, announced Tuesday afternoon the public release of Open Deep Search (ODS), an open-source AI search framework.

Over key benchmarks, Sentient claims it outperforms major closed-source competitors like Perplexity and OpenAI's GPT-4o Search Preview.

Backed by Peter Thiel's Founder's Fund, Sentient claims its work represents America's answer to China's DeepSeek.

When it broke out, DeepSeek's open-source model questioned industry beliefs and caused a $1 trillion tech slump.

Sentient’s models challenge the ""dominance of closed AI systems"" as the U.S. approaches its own ""DeepSeek moment,"" the company said in a statement shared with Decrypt.

Operating as a nonprofit, Sentient argues AI development ""should belong to the community, not controlled by closed-source corporations.""

It's a numbers game

According to Sentient testing, ODS scored 75.3% accuracy on the FRAMES benchmark, significantly outperforming GPT-4o Search Preview (50.5%) and Perplexity Sonar Reasoning Pro (44.4%).

ODS uses Sentient's Open Search Tool, powered by an agentic framework, to rephrase queries and extract context from results.

Asked about their testing methodology, Sentient co-founder Himanshu Tyagi told Decrypt that the benchmarking framework required models ""to orchestrate knowledge from multiple sources.""

To make ODS more efficient, ""ground truth"" sources such as Wikipedia were excluded. This ensured that models ""relied on their retrieval systems"" instead of being artificially assisted, creating ""a more realistic and rigorous evaluation,"" Tyagi claimed.

ODS reached these numbers using an ""agentic approach that writes self-correcting code,"" Tyagi said. That approach helped build out and determine which questions were needed to get a final answer.

When the framework misses a critical piece of info, it calls the search tool again, but with a more specific query to retrieve more precise information.

If it hits a speed bump, the model does ""enhanced query rephrasing, multi-pass retrieval, and intelligent chunking and reranking of web pages,"" Tyagi explained.

ODS and its evaluations can now be reviewed on their public GitHub repository.

America's 'DeepSeek moment'

When DeepSeek came to global attention in January, Decrypt asked NYU Shanghai professor Bogna Konior why this was a key moment.

""We now routinely let AI draft our thoughts—a development as remarkable as the invention of language itself,"" Konior told Decrypt. ""It's as if humanity is recreating that pivotal moment of language invention within computers.""

The parallels between DeepSeek and Sentient show these philosophical shifts for AI.

""Once open-source technology is released into the world, it cannot be contained,"" Konior said.

Sentient believes that the moment has arrived for America.

https://decrypt.co,Why Trump-Induced Stagflation Could Finally Make Bitcoin a Safe Haven,https://unchainedcrypto.com/why-trump-induced-stagflation-could-finally-make-bitcoin-a-safe-haven/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 19:14:06 GMT","Historically bitcoin has failed to live up to its investment thesis as an inflationary hedge or safe harbor asset. But Trump’s tariffs could change that.

As the global economy anxiously awaits President Trump’s tariff announcements, some traders are already thinking about worst-case scenarios. In today’s climate that means stagflation, a troublesome economic climate defined by high inflation and low growth.

“Tariffs are a stagflationary shock to the economy. They reduce growth and raise inflation,” says Zach Pandl, head of research at digital asset manager Grayscale and a former senior economist at Goldman Sachs. “What we don’t know is the mix in terms of stagnation and inflation. At the moment, markets are more focused on stagnation, but we very well may see more inflation persistence over time.”

For many investors, especially those with bitcoin exposure, a key question is how the asset class will perform in such an environment. After all, the last period of stagflation occurred, at least in the U.S., in the 1970s due to the Arab oil embargo of the U.S. These are questions that have not needed to be addressed for 50 years — long before Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the famous Bitcoin white paper.

Bitcoin’s history during periods of market turmoil is not necessarily encouraging. During the market recession in 2020 at the outset of the COVID pandemic, the asset briefly dropped below $4,000. At other times of market stress, such as the unwinding of the Japanese yen carry trade in August 2024 or the broader market downturn in 2022, it behaved more like a speculative asset than the store of value that it is purported to be.

But there is reason to be cautiously optimistic about bitcoin’s chances this time, Pandl says. “Much like the 1970s was a breakout period for gold [which had an average annualized 31% return], I believe that the coming decade will be a breakout period for Bitcoin. It’s the right macro asset at the right time, and we have significant improvements in market structure creating more investor access to the product.”

Stagflation = Gold Rush

Stagflation is an exceptionally rare occurrence, even during poor economic climates. The U.S. has had 16 recessions in the past 100 years, but only one period of stagflation: the 1970s. And given the economy’s ongoing resilience, it’s not a material concern yet.

“Although there are concerns about stagflation, we’re nowhere near what occurred in the Seventies. At that period of time, there was a period of excess in the Sixties, the Vietnam War, and then you also had this exogenous shock of the Arab oil embargoes. The price of energy skyrocketed and the nation just was not ready for it,” says Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers. Sosnick went on to point out how, at 4% unemployment, the U.S. economy remains in an enviable position. Also, inflation, which peaked to 1970s levels just a couple of years ago, is now down to 2-3%.

But even according to Sosnick, the threshold for stagflation does not have to meet the trauma of the 1970s. “If you want to define stagflation as a period involving a stagnating economy and higher prices, then I think it’s hardly an idle concern,” he says.

So how did markets react to the shock of the oil embargo, which started in 1973? They bought gold and moved away from stocks, as indicated in the chart below. The S&P 500 only gained 26.99% for the entire decade, an annualized growth rate of a little over 2%. Considering the double-digit inflation of that period, anyone holding shares in those stocks lost money in real terms. Conversely, gold offered 30% annualized returns for most of the decade, and then it surged more than 500% at the tail end of the decade after concerns about persistent inflation really took hold.

This inverse relationship between gold and stocks has been consistent through the decades. The only real exception was when they rose at the same rate during the COVID outbreak as the Federal Reserve injected trillions of dollars into the economy and buttressed virtually every asset class in the world.

It is even holding true again in 2025 as concerns about the impact of President Trump’s erratic tariff policies spook markets. Gold continues to set record highs, and it is currently priced at $3,171 per oz, while bitcoin is trailing both the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100.

Bitcoin: Finally a Safe Haven?

Will things be different this time? It is important to start with some key assumptions. For starters, it seems likely that either due to reduced trust and confidence in the U.S. economy or pro-active policymaking from the Fed to reduce interest rates, the dollar is going to drop.

Pandl says of the FOMC meeting earlier this month when the rate-setting body held steady, “The message from Jay Powell sounded to me as if they are more likely to reduce rates to support the economy rather than raise rates to try to bring down inflation.”

This means that the U.S. dollar, which has charted an upward trend over the past 15 years or so since the Great Financial Crisis, could be due for a reversal.

In that case, the question becomes what will traders use to substitute the dollar in their portfolios. Sosnick points out that other currencies could take some of its place: “When you’re trading currencies it’s A versus B.” The euro could be a strong contender, as it has appreciated almost 4% against the dollar in 2025, a gargantuan move for major currencies in such a short period of time, and its major stock indexes are outperforming their U.S. counterparts. Most analysts, however, are still having a tough time trusting the current surge in European equities and hardly anyone expects the euro to unseat the dollar.

So then it all comes back to the gold vs. bitcoin discussion. There are reasons to be optimistic as well as pessimistic. On the pessimistic side, historically, bitcoin has hardly traded like the store of value that it is purported to be. Additionally, most of the new flows into the assets have come from U.S. investors looking for outsize risk-weighted returns, not a hedge on local fiat.

From the optimistic side of the ledger, there are a few things to consider. For starters, most of the new gold demand has not come from retail traders but from central banks around the world looking to de-risk themselves from the dollar. Since it’s now easier than ever for retail traders to add gold to their portfolios, it seems they are choosing not to do so. They may prefer to find their hedges somewhere else. Perhaps bitcoin.

But, this new demand for bitcoin may need to come from retail buyers outside of developed economies, a growing but still small part of the overall crypto investment economy. This is because they would be buying bitcoin as a hedge rather than a speculative instrument. Many are also buying stablecoins as a way to de-risk themselves from their local currencies, but as access to this industry becomes more democratized, demand could grow for both asset classes, though it could take time. The bull case for bitcoin would be that a period of stagflation would depress the dollar to a point that bitcoin is seen as the better store of value for emerging market investors.

But as the economy enters this uncertain period of time all investors need to take a long-term perspective with regard to their portfolios. Yes, gold dramatically outstripped equities during the ’70s, but the role reversed in the 1980s (see below). If traders are confident in the long-term ability of bitcoin to manifest its mission as a hybrid of digital gold and a speculative asset, then it could serve as a welcome landing spot for them.",decrypt

Shiba Inu recovered with a 20% price bounce after dropping from $0.0000152 resistance

Shibarium blockchain achieved 1 billion transactions in less than 2 years, a milestone that took Bitcoin 15 years

SHIB maintains a bullish structure on daily timeframes despite short-term bearish pressure

The Layer-2 network processes approximately 4 million transactions daily with over 193 million addresses

Technical analysis suggests potential for a rally toward $0.000020 if the token can break above the $0.000013 resistance

Shiba Inu, the second-largest meme cryptocurrency, has shown resilience in recent days following a substantial rejection from key resistance levels. The popular token is navigating mixed market conditions while its underlying blockchain infrastructure continues to demonstrate impressive growth metrics.

The SHIB token retraced nearly 20% after rallying to $0.0000152 last week. This pullback came amid broader market uncertainty, with Bitcoin falling from $87,600 to $82,400, representing a 5.8% decline that triggered panic selling across altcoins.

Despite this setback, bulls have maintained control of the overall market structure on higher timeframes. The daily chart indicates accumulation patterns that suggest the meme coin may be preparing for another leg up.

The On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator has been trending higher for three consecutive weeks, signaling increased buying pressure. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows signs of recovery and could soon climb above the neutral 50 level, which would confirm renewed bullish momentum.

Shibarium’s Record-Breaking Achievement

Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain solution, reached a remarkable milestone on March 31, processing its billionth transaction since launching in August 2023. This achievement is particularly impressive considering the network is less than two years old.

For comparison, Bitcoin needed 15 years to reach the same transaction volume. Shibarium’s rapid growth highlights the network’s capacity to handle high transaction loads and suggests increasing adoption within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The Layer-2 blockchain currently processes approximately four million transactions daily across more than 193 million addresses. The network has mined over 10.23 million blocks with an average block time of 5 seconds, demonstrating robust performance despite early technical challenges that briefly took the system offline after its initial launch.

This infrastructure progress comes as Shiba Inu’s community continues to focus on utility development and token burns to support price appreciation.

Technical Outlook and Market Position

The 4-hour chart reveals that SHIB struggled to defend short-term support levels at $0.000013 and $0.0000125 during its recent decline. However, the subsequent 20% bounce has brought prices back above the $0.0000125 mark.

This creates a contrasting picture between timeframes, with the 4-hour chart showing bearish structure while the daily chart maintains a bullish outlook. Since higher timeframes typically carry more weight for swing traders and investors, there remains a case for opening long positions.

The token’s price action recently shows signs of a Morning Star pattern developing after Monday’s Doji candlestick formation. However, declining Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) present considerable resistance, with the immediate challenge coming from the 20-day EMA at $0.000013.

Derivatives market data indicates growing optimism despite these technical hurdles. The long-to-short ratio stands at 1.0321, suggesting a positive shift, while open interest has increased 3.47% to $121.57 million. The funding rate has risen to 0.0073%, reflecting traders’ heightened expectations for a potential breakout.

On-chain data reveals a surge in large transaction volume, with transactions over $100,000 increasing from $12.58 million to $45.53 million in just one week. This points to increased whale activity that could influence price action in the coming days.

Looking ahead, after a challenging March that saw a 7% decline, April has started positively with a nearly 4% increase on the first day. AI prediction tools project a possible 63% rise later this week, with SHIB potentially reaching $0.00002069 by April 4.

While sentiment appears optimistic, it’s worth noting that 85.22% of holders currently find themselves in losing positions, underscoring the volatile nature of meme cryptocurrency investments.

For now, Shiba Inu maintains its position as the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. To climb into the top 10 and overtake ninth-ranked Cardano, SHIB would need a 224% price increase—still leaving it 55.56% below its all-time high.",blockonomi

Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have partnered with Hut 8 to launch American Bitcoin Corp., aiming to create one of America’s largest Bitcoin mining operations

Hut 8 will contribute most of its ASIC miners for an 80% ownership stake, while the Trump brothers’ American Data Centers holds 20%

Eric Trump cites being “debanked” as his motivation for entering crypto, calling Bitcoin “cheaper, faster, more transparent, uncancelable, global”

The venture plans to eventually go public and can reportedly mine Bitcoin at nearly half its current trading price

The announcement comes amid the Trump family’s expanding crypto footprint, following World Liberty Financial and USD1 stablecoin launches

The Trump family is making another significant move into cryptocurrency with a new Bitcoin mining operation backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. The brothers have partnered with Miami-based mining and energy infrastructure firm Hut 8 to launch American Bitcoin Corp., according to reports this week.

The venture aims to become one of the largest Bitcoin mining operations in the United States. It also plans to go public in the future, expanding the Trump family’s growing cryptocurrency portfolio.

On Monday, Hut 8 announced it would merge with American Data Centers Inc., a company formed by investors including Eric and Donald Trump Jr. The deal gives Hut 8 an 80% ownership stake in the newly renamed American Bitcoin, with the Trump brothers’ firm holding the remaining 20%.

Under the agreement, Hut 8 will contribute most of its Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners to American Bitcoin. Hut 8 will serve as American Bitcoin’s exclusive infrastructure and operations partner going forward.

Leadership and Strategy

The leadership team includes several key figures from both organizations. Mike Ho, chief strategy officer for Hut 8, will serve as executive chairman for American Bitcoin. Matt Prusak, former chief commercial officer for Hut 8, will become chief executive. Eric Trump will take on the role of chief strategy officer.

“From the start, we’ve backed our conviction in bitcoin — personally and through our businesses,” Donald Trump Jr. said in a statement. “But simply buying bitcoin is only half the story. Mining it on favorable economics opens an even bigger opportunity.”

Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot described the merger as creating two “focused yet complementary businesses.” He told Bloomberg TV the new structure combines one company focused on energy and infrastructure with another focused on Bitcoin mining and reserves.

“The vision here is to give shareholders a pure play mining company that has the ability to produce Bitcoin cheaper than just buying it,” Genoot explained. “For Hut 8, this made sense because we have investors investing in the infrastructure, AI, and Bitcoin sides of the business.”

Trump Family’s Crypto Expansion

The mining venture marks another step in the Trump family’s broader crypto strategy. In October, they launched World Liberty Financial, followed by the USD1 stablecoin in March.

For Eric Trump, the move into cryptocurrency was spurred by personal experience with traditional banking. In an interview with Fox Business, he explained how his family faced banking challenges due to his father’s political career.

“I never thought I’d fall into the world of crypto—until every bank started canceling us for no reason other than my father being in politics,” Trump told host Maria Bartiromo. “We got canceled by everybody. They came after us viciously.”

Banking Concerns and Crypto Adoption

This experience led to what Eric Trump calls an “epiphany” about the value of cryptocurrency. “That’s when I realized how important crypto is—cheaper, faster, more transparent, uncancelable, global. That’s what made me fall in love with Bitcoin, with DeFi, CeFi, and stablecoins,” he added.

Eric Trump also emphasized the need for regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency industry. “Everybody in the industry does—I think everybody wants guidelines,” he said. “That’s part of the problem in the crypto industry. It’s always been so murky that people didn’t know what guidelines to follow.”

The Bitcoin mining venture appears well-positioned from an economic standpoint. Eric Trump told Bloomberg TV that the company can mine Bitcoin at “nearly half its current trading price while scaling rapidly.”

He also pointed to Bitcoin’s long-term performance as a key factor in the decision. “Combine that with an asset that’s appreciated 60% year-over-year for the past decade… it’s a dynamite combination,” he said.

Market Reaction

Market reaction to the announcement has been mixed. Hut 8 stock initially rose in early trading on Monday but later reversed course to close down 0.9%. Bitcoin was trading at approximately $84,900 on Tuesday, a more than 2.5% gain over 24 hours.

The announcement comes as the broader cryptocurrency market watches for potential impacts from President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. Bitcoin miners at industry events have expressed optimism about opportunities under the Trump administration despite these concerns.

The American Bitcoin venture adds to Eric Trump’s recent cryptocurrency moves. In March, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet named him to its newly formed Strategic Advisory board, citing his “business expertise and passion for Bitcoin.”

For the Trump family, cryptocurrency appears to be a long-term strategy. “Crypto is here to stay. It’s solving so many financial problems,” Eric Trump told Fox Business. “When we look out 10 years, the nature of finance and banking in this country will be very different.”",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,North Korean Tech Workers Expand Infiltration to UK Blockchain Projects,https://blockonomi.com/north-korean-tech-workers-expand-infiltration-to-uk-blockchain-projects/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 09:40:54 GMT","TLDR

North Korean tech workers are expanding their infiltration beyond the US to Europe, particularly the UK

They’re involved in blockchain projects, web development, and AI applications

These workers operate in teams, working impossibly long hours and sharing access

Organizations that hire them risk espionage, data theft, and system disruption

North Korean workers are increasingly using extortion tactics when discovered

North Korean tech workers are expanding their covert operations to blockchain firms and tech companies outside the US. According to recent reports from Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), these workers have infiltrated projects in the UK and across Europe. This expansion comes as US authorities increase scrutiny and enforcement actions against the regime’s IT worker scheme.

Jamie Collier, a GTIG adviser, noted in an April 2 report that while the US remains a key target, North Korean workers are establishing “a global ecosystem of fraudulent personas” to enhance their operational flexibility. This shift follows heightened awareness and stricter employment verification procedures in the US.

The infiltration spans multiple technology sectors. In the UK, North Korean workers have been found working on blockchain applications, including projects involving Solana and Anchor smart contract development. They’ve also worked on traditional web development and AI applications that leverage blockchain technologies.

These tech workers pose serious risks to the organizations that hire them. “This places organizations that hire DPRK IT workers at risk of espionage, data theft, and disruption,” Collier warned in the report. The workers use deceptive tactics, falsely claiming nationalities from countries including Italy, Japan, Malaysia, and the US.

European Expansion and Sophisticated Operations

The expansion into Europe is well-coordinated. Google identified one North Korean worker using at least 12 different personas across Europe and the US. Others used resumes listing degrees from Belgrade University in Serbia and claiming residences in Slovakia.

Investigations uncovered IT worker personas seeking employment in Germany and Portugal. GTIG also found login credentials for European job websites, instructions for navigating European job portals, and contacts for brokers specializing in false passports.

The North Korean operation extends beyond simple infiltration. According to Mohan Koo, co-founder and president of insider risk management firm DTEX, their research indicates the scheme is more extensive than previously thought. “Some of the roles that we’re investigating, the infiltrators that we’re investigating right now, have actually got the keys to the kingdom,” Koo told CyberScoop.

These workers often have privileged access rights. They can control access for other employees, install and uninstall software, and write code. This level of access presents serious security concerns for affected organizations.

The Operation: Team-Based Approach

The North Korean operation employs a team-based approach that allows them to work impossibly long hours. Rob Schuett, director of insider intelligence investigations at DTEX, explained that these workers typically show anomalous login patterns.

“What we see with the DPRK worker is completely anomalous compared to everybody else, meaning you’ll see a login time that runs an extremely long amount of time and then there is no logout activity,” Schuett said. DTEX observed instances where workers remained logged in for four to five days continuously, with one case lasting three weeks.

This unusual productivity occurs because the North Korean workers share their desktop access with other co-conspirators who have similar technical skills. Multiple people work on a single employee’s account, taking shifts and sometimes working side by side.

Increasing Extortion Attempts

Since late October 2024, North Korean IT workers have increased extortion attempts, targeting larger organizations. After being fired, these workers threaten to release sensitive data or provide it to competitors. The data at risk includes proprietary information and source code for internal projects.

The rise in extortion coincides with increased US law enforcement actions. This suggests pressure on these workers to maintain revenue streams through more aggressive measures.

Previously, terminated workers would try to provide references for their other personas to get rehired. Now, suspecting their true identities have been discovered, they resort to extortion.

Scale of the Infiltration

The scale of infiltration is concerning. DTEX, which works with many Fortune Global 2000 organizations, currently has active investigations with 7% of its customer base. The firm estimates thousands of critical infrastructure organizations have been infiltrated by North Korean operatives.

Once hired, these workers move quickly to further infiltrate the organization. They pivot into virtual desktop infrastructure environments and use their access to target trusted partners, creating supply chain risks.

Multiple threat hunters have observed a surge in insider threat activity linked to North Korea. Adam Meyers, head of CrowdStrike’s counter adversary operations, noted a “tremendous amount of companies” have unknowingly hired North Koreans for technical roles.

Nearly 40% of CrowdStrike’s incident response cases involving North Korea last year were insider-threat operations. Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 reported that insider threats tied to North Korea tripled in 2024.

Revenue Generation for the Regime

The primary motivation for these operations appears to be financial. North Korean technical workers generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the regime, according to Unit 42.

In January, the US Justice Department indicted two North Korean nationals for their involvement in a fraudulent IT work scheme involving at least 64 US companies from April 2018 to August 2024.

The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control also sanctioned companies accused of being fronts for North Korea that generated revenue via remote IT work schemes.

Beyond Financial Motivation

While the current focus seems to be revenue generation, security experts worry about the potential for more damaging activities. Koo from DTEX suggests it’s “inconceivable” to think these workers won’t eventually plant backdoors, disable critical infrastructure, or commit other forms of sabotage.

“For any of us to be naive enough to think that that’s all they’re ever going to do is ridiculous,” Koo said. “We have to be vigilant because, at the point that they decide to weaponize in a different way, they have the access to do it.”

Identifying the Threat

Organizations can take steps to identify potential threats during the hiring process. Security professionals recommend requiring remote job candidates to be on camera and show government-issued identification. Paying attention to candidates’ behavior during video interviews can provide insights.

“We can see other people in the room with them taking an interview,” Schuett said. “I don’t know about you, but when I’m applying for a job, I’m probably not doing it in a Starbucks or some other public location.”

Other red flags include long pauses during interviews and inconsistencies on resumes, such as claimed expertise in technologies before they were widely available.

Human resources professionals and recruiters serve as the first line of defense. For workers who make it past the hiring stage, companies should watch for unusual behaviors, such as a lack of casual communication in meetings or emails.

North Korean technical workers “don’t ask how your kid did in soccer last night,” Schuett noted. “They don’t talk about the new, cool restaurant they found, because they can’t.”",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Bybit to Close NFT Marketplace Amid 95% Industry Volume Decline,https://blockonomi.com/bybit-to-close-nft-marketplace-amid-95-industry-volume-decline/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 09:32:18 GMT","TLDR

Bybit announced the closure of its NFT and Inscription marketplaces effective April 8, 2025

The shutdown is part of a broader industry trend as NFT trading volumes have fallen over 95% from peak levels

Other major platforms including X2Y2, Kraken, RTFKT, and LG have also recently exited the NFT marketplace business

Bybit’s decision comes weeks after suffering a $1.4 billion hack attributed to North Korea

First quarter 2025 NFT sales dropped 63% year-over-year, though some collections like Pudgy Penguins and Doodles showed growth

Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit announced it will shut down its NFT marketplace on April 8, joining a growing list of major platforms abandoning the once-booming digital collectibles sector. The decision comes as NFT trading volumes have plummeted more than 95% from their 2021 peak.

In an April 1 statement, Bybit said it would close its NFT Marketplace, Inscription Marketplace, and Initial DEX Offering (IDO) product pages as part of an effort to “streamline offerings and enhance user experience.” Users have been advised to transfer assets from their Bybit web3 wallets before the deadline.

The move follows a major security breach at Bybit in February, when hackers linked to North Korea stole an estimated $1.4 billion in digital assets. This hack, described as the largest crypto theft to date, has put added pressure on the exchange to reevaluate its risk exposure and operational focus.

Industry-Wide Retreat

Bybit is far from alone in its exit from the NFT space. Several other major platforms have made similar moves in recent months, pointing to a broader market shift.

Just days earlier, Ethereum NFT marketplace X2Y2 announced it would shut down its trading platform at the end of April. Despite processing $5.6 billion in trading volume over its lifetime, X2Y2 cited the “90% shrinkage of NFT trading volume from its peak” as a key factor in its decision.

The X2Y2 team stated, “Marketplaces live or die by network effects. We fought tooth and nail to be #1, but after three years, it’s clear it’s time to move on.” The company indicated it would pivot toward artificial intelligence.

Kraken also closed its NFT marketplace on February 27, saying it needed to reallocate resources toward “new products and services.” Nike-owned RTFKT ceased operations in January following steep declines in the value of its NFT collections.

Even non-crypto companies are retreating. Television manufacturer LG plans to close its NFT platform, LG Art Lab, on June 17, stating it’s “the right time to shift our focus and explore new opportunities.”

Market Collapse

Data tells the story of a market in steep decline. Daily NFT trading volume has fallen from over $18 million a year ago to just $5.34 million today—a 70% drop. The contrast is even more striking when compared to the market’s peak on December 17, 2024, when volume exceeded $113.6 million.

Total NFT sales fell to $1.5 billion during the first quarter of 2025, down from $4.1 billion in the same period last year—a 63% year-over-year drop. Sales in March alone were down 76% compared to the prior year.

The number of active wallets engaging in NFT trades has plummeted from over half a million at the market’s height to less than 20,000 today, according to blockchain analytics firm DappRadar.

Value Erosion

Once-prestigious NFT collections have seen their value erode rapidly. The floor price for CryptoPunks has fallen to 42.59 ETH, down nearly 66% from their August 2021 high of 125 ETH.

Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs have fared even worse, with prices plunging 90% from a May 2022 peak of 153.7 ETH to just 15.35 ETH today. These collections, once the crown jewels of the NFT world, no longer command the trading volumes or attention they once did.

Some industry experts suggest the market is evolving rather than dying. Charu Sethi, president at NFT-focused Polkadot and Kusama chain Unique Network, told Cointelegraph that “the speculative phase focused on collectibles and trading is over, but NFTs are now entering their next growth era as core infrastructure.”

This shift may explain why some collections have bucked the downward trend. Pudgy Penguins saw a 13% sales increase in the first quarter of 2025, reaching $72 million in sales.

Doodles also performed well, benefiting from a recent partnership with McDonald’s to hit $32 million in quarterly sales. Milady Maker was another collection that outperformed market expectations, according to recent reports.

The struggles of new projects highlight the changed landscape. NFT project Gutter Cat Gang (GCG) reportedly had a difficult token launch for its GANG token on Apechain on March 31, attributed to a “technical issue” by the team.

However, data shared online indicated the project attracted only 3.66 Ether (worth about $6,800) in its token sale, far short of its $1 million target. The team has not yet addressed these claims.

Despite the market downturn, some in the space remain optimistic. The NFT Paris conference in February 2025 drew an estimated 20,000 attendees, suggesting continued interest from creators and collectors even as investor enthusiasm wanes.

Industry analysts point to a shift from purely speculative trading toward utility-based applications. Future growth may come from gaming, AI, fan engagement, and content authentication rather than digital art speculation.

For now, however, the exodus of major platforms like Bybit indicates a market correction that shows few signs of reversing in the near term. Users of Bybit’s NFT and Inscription marketplaces have until April 8 at 4:00 pm UTC to manage their assets before the platform becomes inaccessible.",blockonomi

Circle, the company behind USDC stablecoin, has filed for an IPO aiming to list on NYSE under ticker “CRCL”

JPMorgan and Citigroup are leading the IPO with a valuation target of $4-5 billion

Circle reported $1.68 billion in revenue for 2024 and $156 million in net income

This marks Circle’s second IPO attempt after a failed SPAC merger in 2022

The move comes amid improved regulatory climate for crypto under the Trump administration

Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL” with JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup serving as lead underwriters.

This marks Circle’s second attempt to go public. In 2021, the company tried to enter public markets through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). That deal collapsed in late 2022 due to regulatory challenges and timing issues with the SEC.

The IPO filing comes during a time of growth for the stablecoin market. USDC is the second-largest stablecoin by market cap with about $60 billion in circulation, representing roughly 26% of the total stablecoin market.

Circle has positioned itself closer to global finance since its failed SPAC attempt. The company moved its headquarters from Boston to One World Trade Center in New York as part of this strategy.

Financial Performance

Circle reported $1.68 billion in revenue and reserve income for 2024. This marks an increase from $1.45 billion in 2023 and $772 million in 2022.

The company posted net income of about $156 million for 2024. This represents a decline from the $268 million reported in 2023.

The IPO is expected to value Circle between $4 billion and $5 billion. This valuation is lower than the $9 billion figure from February 2022 when Circle revised its SPAC merger terms.

Most of Circle’s revenue comes from interest generated by the assets backing USDC. According to unaudited financial statements from early 2023, interest income generated 99% of the firm’s revenue.

USDC’s market cap has grown 36% this year. This growth outpaces the 5% growth seen by market leader Tether during the same period.

Regulatory Environment

The timing of Circle’s IPO aligns with a shift toward more crypto-friendly regulations in the United States. President Donald Trump has taken a pro-crypto stance since taking office.

Trump has stated he hopes lawmakers will send stablecoin legislation to his desk before Congress’s August recess. This potential regulation has boosted confidence in the stablecoin sector.

The U.S. Senate Banking Committee advanced a stablecoin bill in March 2025. The House is expected to vote on their version in early April, creating momentum for the sector.

This improved regulatory outlook has given more assurance to firms in the crypto space. Circle now has a chance to conduct operations under a more friendly regulatory environment.

The stablecoin market has grown about 11% so far this year and about 47% in the past year. Bernstein has described this sector as a “systemically important” part of the crypto market.

Competitive Landscape

A successful IPO would make Circle one of the most prominent pure-play crypto companies to list on a U.S. exchange. Coinbase, which went public through a direct listing in 2021, has a market cap of about $44 billion.

Circle isn’t alone in its public listing ambitions. Ripple, another major blockchain player, is reportedly considering going public despite ongoing regulatory scrutiny from the SEC.

The stablecoin space has become increasingly crowded. A number of both crypto and traditional financial firms have launched their own stablecoins, including Ripple and PayPal. Reports suggest Fidelity is also exploring entering the market.

Coinbase has a close relationship with Circle and USDC. The crypto exchange has an agreement to share 50% of the revenue from USDC, earning $225.9 million from this arrangement in Q4 2024.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has stated a “stretch goal to make USDC the number 1 stablecoin.” This partnership could help USDC compete against Tether, which currently holds 67% of the stablecoin market.

Circle faced challenges in March 2023 when it revealed that $3.3 billion of its reserves were stuck at the failing Silicon Valley Bank. USDC briefly lost its $1 peg but recovered after regulators stepped in to backstop the bank.

Despite this setback, USDC’s market cap has recovered and now sits at an all-time high of around $60 billion. This recovery demonstrates market confidence in the stablecoin and Circle’s management.

The IPO market has shown signs of improvement in 2025. So far this year, 73 companies have gone public on U.S. exchanges, a 70% increase from 2024, with the total value reaching $11.8 billion.

Several well-known companies have filed to go public alongside Circle. These include eToro, StubHub, and Klarna, suggesting a broader reopening of the IPO market after a quiet period.

Circle’s public debut will occur as tech stocks face volatility. The Nasdaq recently wrapped up its steepest quarterly drop since 2022, creating a challenging environment for new tech listings.",blockonomi

SEC and Gemini have jointly requested a 60-day pause in their lawsuit to explore a potential resolution

The original lawsuit filed in January 2023 alleged Gemini Earn program offered unregistered securities

Genesis already settled related charges for $21 million in March 2024

This pause follows a trend of the SEC easing crypto enforcement since Trump took office

Several other crypto companies have recently had SEC investigations closed

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and cryptocurrency exchange Gemini have jointly asked a New York federal court to pause their ongoing legal battle for 60 days. The request, submitted in an April 1 letter to Judge Edgardo Ramos, aims to give both parties time to “explore a potential resolution” to the case involving Gemini’s Earn program.

The joint letter states that pausing the case would serve the interests of both parties. It adds that “a resolution would conserve judicial resources” and notes that “no party or non-party would be prejudiced by a stay.” If granted, the parties would submit a joint status report within 60 days.

Case Background

The SEC filed the lawsuit in January 2023. The regulator alleged that Gemini and crypto lending firm Genesis Global Capital offered unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program.

The program allowed customers to lend crypto assets including Bitcoin to Genesis. In return, they received interest payments. Gemini took a fee as high as 4.29% for facilitating these transactions.

Genesis halted customer withdrawals in November 2022. This happened the same month as the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Genesis later filed for bankruptcy in January 2023.

At the time of the bankruptcy filing, Genesis held about $900 million in assets. These belonged to roughly 340,000 Gemini Earn customers who could not access their funds.

Recent Developments

While the case against Gemini remains ongoing, Genesis agreed to pay $21 million to settle charges related to the lending program in March 2024. Genesis did not admit wrongdoing as part of this settlement.

Gemini has denied any wrongdoing in the case. The exchange is run by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who Forbes magazine estimates are worth $3 billion each.

The letter does not specify what a possible resolution might look like. Options could include a settlement, the SEC dropping the case, or some other outcome.

Changing Regulatory Environment

This potential resolution comes amid a changing regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency in the United States. The SEC has eased its oversight of the crypto industry since Donald Trump became president in January 2025.

In February, Gemini announced that the SEC had closed a separate investigation into the firm. Cameron Winklevoss commented on this development saying, “The SEC cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal bills alone and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation.”

The twins’ exchange isn’t the only crypto company seeing relief from regulatory pressure. The SEC has recently ended civil lawsuits against several major players in the industry.

These include cases against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken. The regulator also agreed to settle a case against Ripple Labs over the unregistered sale of securities.

Industry-Wide Pattern

The potential resolution of the Gemini case fits into a broader pattern of regulatory easing. OpenSea, Crypto.com, and Uniswap have all recently reported that the SEC closed probes into their operations.

These investigations were examining alleged breaches of securities laws. The closure of these probes suggests a shift in the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation under the Trump administration.

The Winklevoss twins were among industry leaders who participated in the White House Crypto Summit in March 2025. This event highlighted the administration’s more supportive stance toward the cryptocurrency sector.

The case is officially listed as SEC v Gemini Trust Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 23-00287. Both parties are now awaiting the court’s decision on their request for a 60-day pause.",blockonomi

EOS price has surged by nearly 20%, reaching a two-month high at $0.802

The Vaulta Banking feature and new Advisory Council are bolstering investor confidence

Social dominance metrics jumped to 0.31%, indicating rising market attention

EOS broke out of a descending channel pattern, with bullish technical indicators

EOS, the cryptocurrency powering its namesake blockchain network, has seen its price soar by nearly 20% in the past 24 hours. The token reached $0.802, its highest level in two months, pushing its market cap past the $1 billion mark.

This price rally comes amid several key developments in the EOS ecosystem. The primary driver appears to be updates to the Vaulta Banking feature, which was introduced by the EOS Network last month.

The EOS Network recently unveiled the Vaulta Banking Advisory Council. According to the network, “To bridge traditional finance and Web3, we’ve brought together seasoned leaders from banking, fintech, and digital assets. Their strategic guidance ensures Vaulta stays compliant, credible, and ready for mass adoption.”

Vaulta aims to bridge traditional banking with Web3 technologies. This feature has been gaining traction as traditional financial institutions like BlackRock expand their crypto presence.

The EOS team has also announced that Vaulta will bring Web3 to portfolio investments, including real estate and commodities, through Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization.

Technical Indicators Point to Bullish Momentum

From a technical analysis perspective, EOS has broken out of a descending parallel channel that had contained its price for months. This breakout suggests a potential shift from bearish to bullish momentum.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for EOS stands at 77, indicating a surge in buying activity. While this puts the token in overbought territory and may cause a short-term reversal, the Average Directional Index (ADX) is rising, showing that the bullish momentum is strengthening.

On the daily chart, EOS has risen above the 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which typically indicates a bullish trend. The Bull Bear Power reading has been increasing since March 18, suggesting that bears have found it challenging to keep bulls out of the picture.

The token formed a golden cross on March 25, with the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This pattern often signals the potential for a longer-term upward move.

Rebranding and Future Outlook

Another factor driving EOS’s recent gains is the project’s upcoming rebranding to Vaulta, expected to go live by the end of May 2025. As part of this transition, the EOS token will become Vaulta, with a new ticker symbol to be announced later this month.

The rebranding comes with a shift in focus toward blockchain-powered banking solutions. The new Vaulta token will maintain all of EOS’s core technology, including its integration with exSat, the Bitcoin banking solutions.

One appealing aspect of the upcoming Vaulta token is its planned staking yield of approximately 17%, supported by a reward pool of about 250 million tokens. This rate is much higher than those offered by major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (2.03%) and Solana (5.14%).

Social media metrics also point to growing interest in EOS. Data from Santiment shows that social dominance around EOS has jumped to 0.31%, indicating rising market attention.

In the derivatives market, open interest in EOS futures has surged more than 30%, reaching an 11-month high of $144.14 million. The funding rate has turned positive, suggesting that more traders are betting on continued upward movement in the near term.

Despite the broader crypto market experiencing a downturn, these developments around Vaulta and the strong technical indicators have allowed EOS to buck the trend and post impressive gains.

Dogecoin has surged 7.3% over the past day, currently trading around $0.17

Whales accumulated over 220 million DOGE throughout March, signaling strong buying interest

Major resistance levels at $0.18 and $0.21 could be catalysts for the next bull run if broken

Technical indicators show a bullish crossover on the RSI with buyers returning to the market

Analyst Javon Marks predicts a potential 270% rally for DOGE, targeting $0.65 in the long term

Dogecoin has seen a significant price movement in the past 24 hours, with buyers returning to the market after a period of decline. The popular memecoin is currently trading around $0.17, marking a 7.3% increase in the past day.

This latest surge comes after DOGE declined to a two-week low of $0.160, prompting investors to buy the dip. The buying pressure has been instrumental in pushing prices higher.

The uptick is supported by growth in Dogecoin’s derivatives market. Options volume increased by 84.21%, while Options Open Interest rose by 8% to $804,000.

Trading volume for the cryptocurrency also saw a 22% increase, reaching $1.22 billion. Open Interest climbed 7.23% to $1.67 billion, indicating heightened market activity.

Whale Activity Driving Optimism

A key factor behind the recent price movement appears to be whale activity. Large investors accumulated over 220 million Dogecoin throughout March, suggesting strong buying pressure from major market players.

This accumulation by whales signals growing optimism about DOGE’s future price trajectory. When large holders increase their positions, it often precedes upward price movements.

The increased whale activity coincides with technical indicators pointing to further upside potential. A falling wedge breakout pattern has emerged, which typically precedes price rallies.

Dogecoin’s four-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered oversold territory, which often signals a price bottom. This technical indicator supports the case for continued upward momentum.

Analyst Ali Martinez has identified two major resistance levels for Dogecoin based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). These levels are $0.18 and $0.21, where approximately 8% and 7% of the supply was last transacted, respectively.

These price points represent psychological barriers where investors who bought at these levels might be inclined to sell when the price returns to their break-even point.

Martinez notes that breaking through both levels “could be the catalyst for the next major bull rally” as there are no other supply walls as large in sight beyond these points.

The largest supply wall for Dogecoin exists around the $0.07 level, where over 20% of all coins in circulation were last transacted. However, with DOGE currently trading well above this level, this supply is sitting on profit rather than acting as resistance.

Technical Indicators Turn Bullish

Technical analysis shows a bullish crossover on Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index, suggesting that buyers have regained control of the market. When the RSI rises and makes a bullish crossover, it signals that buying pressure is exceeding selling pressure.

This buyer dominance is confirmed by positive order imbalance, indicating more buy orders than sell orders in the market. This behavior showcases strong bullish sentiment, as investors view current prices as favorable entry points.

Dogecoin’s Long/Short Ratio further confirms this trend, with longs spiking to 71.47% over the past day. Shorts account for only 28% of futures contracts, indicating that traders are positioning for price increases rather than declines.

If the Stochastic RSI completes its upward move and makes a bullish flip, it will validate the RSI’s bullish crossover, potentially confirming continuation of the uptrend.

Price Predictions and Targets

With this bullish momentum building, analysts suggest DOGE is likely to reclaim the $0.18 level in the near term. Success at this level could strengthen its position for a push toward $0.19.

Looking further ahead, analyst Javon Marks has made a more ambitious prediction. He observes that DOGE is forming a series of higher lows, a technical pattern that has preceded large price increases in the past.

Marks suggests that Dogecoin could rally over 270% from current levels, potentially reaching $0.65 in the long run. His analysis shows historical correlation between price rallies and the pattern of higher lows.

The recent breakout from a descending triangle pattern is seen as confirmation of this bullish setup. If the price continues to rise, breaking through the $0.25 barrier could pave the way for higher targets.

However, if buying pressure fades and sellers return to the market, DOGE could see a correction down to $0.168.

Despite previous downward trends that saw Dogecoin decline by 5.45% weekly and 15.5% monthly, the current market indicators suggest a potential reversal of this trend.

With Bitcoin maintaining its current pace and technical indicators aligning favorably, Dogecoin appears well-positioned for potential price increases in the coming weeks.",blockonomi

Pi Coin price has dropped below $0.70, falling about 20% over the past week

The Pi Network community is frustrated with the Core Team’s lack of transparent communication

Pi Network’s base mining rate decreased by 1.18% this month to 0.0029030 π per hour

Pi Network faces criticism over increasing KYC requirements, raising privacy concerns

Price is currently forming a falling wedge pattern with next support level at $0.60

Pi Coin, the native token of the Pi Network, has continued its downward trend, dropping below the $0.70 mark as community frustration mounts. The cryptocurrency is now trading around $0.72, representing a 20% decrease over the past seven days, with trading volumes also declining significantly.

The Pi Core Team recently announced record participation in the inaugural PiFest on the Open Network, with over 125,000 registered sellers and 1.8 million Pioneers using Map of Pi. However, this news has done little to stem the price decline or improve community sentiment.

Community members have expressed dissatisfaction with the Core Team’s communication approach. Critics argue that monthly updates are predictable and insufficient for maintaining an engaged community. One member, Dr. Altcoin, noted that trading activity in the Pi ecosystem has reached its lowest point since PiFest began, with most transactions involving selling Pi for cash.

Technical Analysis

The current price action shows Pi forming a classic falling wedge pattern, testing the lower boundary near $0.687. Technical analysts suggest that a confirmed breakout with volume above the $0.71–$0.72 range could signal a bullish move, potentially pushing the price toward $0.75–$0.78, where key resistance levels exist.

The 5-minute chart displays fundamental support areas between $0.7100 and $0.7150. The exchange rate maintains its position within this support interval while trading at $0.7212. Market movements in this zone demonstrate a balance between bullish and bearish pressures.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a neutral value of 50.46, indicating indecisive market conditions. Previous market upward movements occurred when the RSI value fell below 30 during oversold conditions. Resistance typically appears when RSI surpasses 70, entering overbought territory.

Controversial Decisions

The Pi Network has made several controversial moves recently, including strengthening its Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols. The project will now request an email address to activate the two-factor authentication feature of its mobile application, moving away from SMS authentication.

Pi Network is adding email-based two-factor authentication to the overall account management and verification. https://t.co/UeoJ0F8H17 This change addresses challenges with current SMS (text message) account verification, improves security, and lays the groundwork for future… — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) March 29, 2025

The developer claims this change is necessary because Pi users are spread across the world, making it difficult to reach all users through telecommunications. However, the crypto community has criticized this decision as an unnecessary breach of users’ privacy in an industry where anonymity is highly valued.

Pi was already under scrutiny for its unilateral decision to demand that Pi holders go through a strict KYC process to migrate their tokens to the public mainnet. These decisions, along with allegations from prominent figures in the crypto industry who claim that Pi is a scam, have contributed to depressing its price.

The Pi Network’s base mining rate has also dropped by 1.18% this month, now standing at 0.0029030 π per hour. This adjustment continues the network’s trend of gradual mining rate reductions. Some community members speculate that the declining interest in mining may be linked to Pi’s current low trading value on exchanges.

Despite talks of the Pi Network listing on top crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, these have not materialized so far. The BTCC exchange stated that it has added the cryptocurrency for spot trading, but this has failed to add any upward momentum to the Pi coin price.

The cryptocurrency is currently just 14.9% away from its all-time low of $0.6152 from February 20. If the current support level of $0.6800 fails to hold, nothing would prevent Pi from collapsing to all-time lows.

Market experts suggest monitoring both RSI and MACD indicators as they provide clear signals for investors. Crossing $0.7300 could propel the price to $0.7400-$0.7500 resistance with enough trading volume to potentially reach $0.7550. However, if sellers push the price beneath $0.7100, it could lead to further declines toward $0.7000 and potentially to $0.6900.

The Pi Network Mainnet Launch has been highly anticipated, with many expecting a price rally. However, market changes have caused concern among investors after Pi Coin fell by 68% during its latest dip. The future movement of Pi Coin remains uncertain, and investors must track team statements from Pi Network as well as market conditions.",blockonomi

Ethereum is struggling to maintain support at $1,900 after recovering from the $1,750 level

An Ethereum early adopter sold 2,001 ETH for $3.82 million, securing an $8.66 million profit

ETH options worth $2.13 billion expired on March 28, creating market uncertainty

ETH’s leverage ratio reached a new all-time high, with nearly $100 million in long liquidations

Technical indicators show mixed signals with a bullish trend line at $1,860 but resistance at $1,920

Ethereum price has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent days, recovering from support levels but facing strong resistance as it approaches the $1,920 mark. The cryptocurrency market has been watching ETH closely as it battles to regain momentum after a period of selling pressure.

Ethereum started a recovery wave above the $1,820 and $1,850 levels recently. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap managed to stay above the $1,750 support zone before beginning its upward movement.

The bulls pushed ETH above the $1,880 resistance zone and the price moved above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,032 swing high to the $1,767 low. However, sellers have become active near the $1,920 zone.

Currently, Ethereum is trading above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $1,860 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

Key Resistance Levels

On the upside, Ethereum faces several key resistance levels that may determine its short-term price action. The immediate challenge is near the $1,900 level, followed by a stronger resistance at $1,920.

If ETH can clear these hurdles, the next major resistance would be near the $1,970 level. A successful break above $1,970 could potentially send the price toward the $2,020 resistance.

An even more optimistic scenario would see Ethereum breaking above $2,020, which might trigger more gains in the coming sessions. In such a case, Ether could rise toward the $2,050 resistance zone or even reach $2,120 in the near term.

However, if Ethereum fails to clear the $1,920 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,860 level and the trend line, with the first major support sitting near the $1,845 zone.

Whale Activity and Market Impact

A major market event occurred when an Ethereum early adopter, referred to as an “Ethereum OG,” sold their last 2,001 ETH for $3.82 million. This sale netted the seller an $8.66 million profit, though they missed out on a potential peak value of $23 million.

The transaction took place at a price of $1,909 per ETH and has sparked discussions about shifting dynamics in the Ethereum market. The narrative suggests that new whales are poised to take over the market as early adopters exit their positions.

Following this large sale, Ethereum’s price experienced a slight dip of 0.5%, dropping to $1,899. This movement coincided with a surge in trading volume, with 1.2 million ETH traded in the hour following the sale.

The market’s reaction suggests that the sale may have triggered a short-term sell-off, as traders adjusted their positions in response to the news. On-chain metrics revealed that the number of active addresses on the Ethereum network increased by 5% in the hour following the sale.

Options Expiry and Leverage Concerns

ETH has been struggling to maintain the $1,900 price level after approximately $2.13 billion worth of Ethereum options expired on March 28th. Options in the crypto market typically expire on the last Friday of every month.

According to options data, 301,000 ETH coins were locked in options contracts set to expire, equivalent to $574.3 million at market value. ETH had a 0.39 call-put ratio, which is traditionally considered favorable for bulls. However, the market moved in the opposite direction, likely due to uncertainty surrounding the options expiry.

This bearish market reaction sent ETH price below $1,900. This is an important price level because it previously served as a support zone. However, selling pressure has forced ETH to remain under this mark for now.

Adding to the concerns, ETH’s estimated leverage ratio reached a new all-time high recently. As a result, the market was primed for liquidation events. ETH experienced $97.85 million worth of long liquidations in a 24-hour period, highlighting the risks of leveraged positions.

Recent reports also suggest that hackers may have taken advantage of the latest wave of sell pressure. Data revealed that two wallets received 14,064 ETH from Chainflip and Thorchain. These addresses then sold the ETH at a $1,956 price tag, receiving about $26.87 million worth of DAI.

The Ethereum market remains at a critical juncture, with technical indicators and market sentiment providing mixed signals. Traders and investors are closely watching key support and resistance levels as ETH attempts to regain its footing in a volatile market environment.",blockonomi

Cardano is trading at $0.67, down about 50% from December highs

Network fees dropped from $977k in December to $316k in March 2025

App revenue crashed from $400k to just $26,000 in March

Technical analysis shows a potential morning star pattern forming

Price could test $0.73 resistance with some analysts predicting eventual rise to $2

Cardano’s price has been consolidating around $0.67, showing early signs of potential recovery despite significant ecosystem challenges. The cryptocurrency has formed what appears to be a morning star pattern on daily charts, suggesting the possibility of a bullish reversal after recent downward pressure.

The third-generation blockchain has experienced a steep decline from its December peak, falling nearly 50% as network activity slowed substantially. This price action comes amid a broader downturn in the platform’s on-chain metrics.

Recent data reveals a concerning trend in Cardano’s network fees, which dropped to $316,000 in March from $330,000 in February. This continues a downward trajectory that began after fees peaked at $977,000 in December 2024.

Ecosystem Under Pressure

Even more troubling for the Cardano ecosystem is the collapse in application revenue. DApps built on Cardano generated only $26,000 in March, compared to $400,000 in December—a 93% decrease in just three months.

This revenue decline coincides with substantial capital outflows from major Cardano applications. Minswap lost 20% of its assets, dropping to $81 million. Other protocols experienced even steeper losses, with Liqwid, Indigo, Splash Protocol, and Lenfi each seeing asset reductions exceeding 40%.

The performance gap between Cardano and competing networks has become increasingly apparent. Base, Coinbase’s layer-2 solution, generated over $20 million in fees during March. Even Sonic, a relatively new blockchain that rebranded from Fantom, produced more than $200,000 in the same period.

These metrics have fueled criticism from some quarters of the crypto industry, with detractors labeling Cardano a “ghost chain” due to its relatively underdeveloped application ecosystem compared to other major layer-1 networks like Solana and BNB Chain.

Technical Analysis Points to Potential Recovery

Despite these fundamental challenges, technical indicators suggest Cardano may be preparing for a bounce. The formation of a Doji candle followed by a bullish candle has created what analysts identify as a morning star pattern—a potential reversal signal.

This pattern emerged after ADA found support near the $0.60 level, which coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from recent highs. This technical support has so far prevented further declines despite broader market uncertainty.

Cardano now faces immediate resistance at approximately $0.73, which aligns with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. The 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is also approaching this resistance, making it a key level for bulls to overcome.

If ADA can break through this resistance zone, the next target would be the 78.6% Fibonacci level around $0.92, representing a potential 37% gain from current prices.

Long-term Projections and Risk Factors

Some analysts remain optimistic about Cardano’s long-term prospects despite near-term challenges. Elliott Wave theorists suggest the current price action represents the second bearish phase of a larger pattern, which is typically followed by a third phase characterized by extended bullish momentum.

Under this scenario, Cardano could eventually reach $2, which corresponds to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from all-time highs. Such a move would represent nearly 200% appreciation from current levels.

However, traders should be aware of downside risks. A failure to hold support at $0.60 could trigger a drop to the next support zone around $0.53. More concerning is the potential “death crossover” between the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, which would signal additional bearish pressure if it occurs.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has warned that if Cardano cannot reclaim the critical $0.70-$0.80 range, it could face a deeper correction toward the $0.31-$0.24 range—a decline of more than 50% from current levels.

The coming days will be crucial for determining Cardano’s direction. A sustained break above $0.73 would confirm the reversal pattern and potentially trigger the anticipated rally, while failing to hold current support levels could extend the months-long downtrend.",blockonomi

Solana recently experienced a correction after reaching an all-time high of $295

A bearish divergence has emerged on SOL’s weekly chart, testing critical support levels

ETF speculation continues with prediction markets showing 90% approval odds

Technical analysis shows SOL price at a crucial $109-$130 support zone

Analysts project potential targets of $180-$200 if support holds and momentum builds

Solana (SOL) finds itself at a critical juncture after falling from its recent all-time high of $295. The cryptocurrency is now testing key support levels as traders closely monitor technical indicators to determine its next move.

The past few months have been a rollercoaster for SOL holders. After reaching new heights just three months ago, the altcoin has faced increased volatility and downward pressure.

Market experts have identified a bearish divergence on SOL’s weekly chart. This pattern suggests weakening momentum despite previous price increases and has raised concerns about further downside risk.

Currently, SOL is testing horizontal support that has held over the past year. This support coincides with the Fibonacci 0.618 level at around $117, creating a critical zone that must hold to prevent deeper drops.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen to 40, a level that has previously served as strong support for SOL. Traders are watching this indicator closely for signs of a potential reversal.

ETF Speculation Driving Bullish Sentiment

Despite technical concerns, excitement continues to build around a potential Solana ETF. This development could dramatically change SOL’s market dynamics.

Prediction markets are now pricing a 90% chance of a Solana ETF becoming reality. If approved, this could unlock substantial institutional investment and drive a new wave of adoption.

The ETF catalyst mirrors what happened with Bitcoin’s ETF launch. Analysts believe approval could propel SOL toward the $180-$200 range, potentially setting new all-time highs.

Adding to the bullish case, the current administration has shown openness to adding US-based coins to strategic reserves. This political support might benefit Solana, especially after Trump’s own meme coin launched on the Solana blockchain.

Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization presents another growth avenue for Solana. With the RWA market potentially worth $240 trillion, Solana’s fast transactions and low fees make it a strong contender in this space.

Technical Analysis Points to Crucial Decision Point

Solana’s price action suggests we’re approaching a pivotal moment. The $109-$130 range has emerged as a key battleground between bulls and bears.

Recent corrections have brought SOL into the 61.8%-88.7% Fibonacci retracement zone. This area historically attracts buyers and could serve as a launching pad for a relief rally.

If support holds, analysts project a short-term move toward $135-$145. However, a breakdown below $105 would confirm bearish control and likely trigger deeper corrections.

The Elliott Wave pattern suggests the next 24-48 hours will be decisive for SOL’s trajectory. Market participants are closely watching for confirmation of either a bounce or breakdown.

#Polymarket is now pricing in the chances of a #Solana #ETF approval at just under 90%. Soon 💥 pic.twitter.com/7bHq2ypK8t — Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand) March 29, 2025

Despite the bearish flag pattern on daily charts, some indicators display hidden bullish divergence. This contradiction reflects the market’s current uncertainty about SOL’s direction.

Trading volume has decreased during this consolidation period, indicating reduced market activity. This often precedes a major move in either direction.

For now, Solana remains range-bound between $123 and $130. Bulls have defended the $123 support since March 2024, suggesting continued buying interest at these levels.

External factors like the announcement of new tariffs could increase volatility and push prices lower. However, without major negative news, the probability of revisiting the $150 level remains.",blockonomi

Here is the situation – Trump is all in on crypto. World Liberty Financial (WLF) is working on its own USD-backed stablecoin – and Trump is handing out pardons across the board.

Biden and Gens…wait…what was his name again?

Gens…something. The SEC guy. Anyway those losers are long gone and now Big Daddy Trump is pimp-slapping the anti-crypto squad right across the face.

Thankfully the USA isn’t Iran or North Korea – yet – so Biden and his crew won’t face no-casket funerals. Yet.

We knew Trump would be good for crypto. We didn’t expect him to do so much, so soon.

With the USA going full-tilt into cryptocurrency – we think another bubble is on the horizon…

Who Pissed This Guy Off?

Hey snowflakes – you feel safe now?

No more safe spaces. No more coddling. The hammer is coming down.

If you’re feeling triggered – talk to state security – they carry weapons with triggers!

It looks like President Trump is more than cleaning the Federal “house” in the USA.

McTrumper is burning the house down!

Everything that was done under “Biden” was just undone in a matter of months. Four years down the drain for whoever was running that dog and pony show.

In addition to ripping apart existing anti-crypto policy in the USA, McTrumper is pardoning everyone but SBF. BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Samuel Reed and Benjamin Delo all received full McTrumper pardons.

We think Trump is looking for business opportunities – and people who will help him grow into the next boom market – crypto!

Fascism!

For anyone that forgot – fascism isn’t necessarily violent – ask anyone in Norway.

Fascism was originally used in the 1930s to unify state and private interests with violence – at every level. Norway didn’t do this BTW – they learned from earlier mistakes and gave away loads of cash.

Always take the silver – forget the lead!

One could be forgiven for thinking Trump&Co. are taking a few pages from the 1930s fascist playbook – and aligning the state with private interests. Namely – the President’s business interests.

Now that Arthur Hayes, Samuel Reed and Benjamin Delo are all free – thanks to McTrumper – they are all more than likely to work with WLF in whatever capacity the company desires.

Don’t look down on them – we would take the same deal!

In fact – the high profile pardons from McTrumper have the punters moving.

No less a charlatan than Jim Cramer thinks SBF will be the next crypto felon to get the tap. We are not so sure. SBF seems like a low value asset at this point.

And never forget:

A total hack. At least as an analyst.

If you look at Cramer as a Wall St. sell-side marketer without ethics of any sort – his brilliance stands alone.

No, we think President Trump has something much larger brewing. It will be worth trillions of USD, and it will be global.

Long Live Liberty

We go on and on about how cryptos are never going to be money (at least anytime soon).

Take at look here for more on that:

Stablecoins are money. And most are USD based.

The use of stablecoins is screaming higher. While the total amount (market cap) of stablecoins isn’t impressive, their overall volume is incredible.

According to the WEF:

“The use of stablecoins has increased in recent years with the average supply of stablecoins in circulation increasing roughly 28% year-over-year. Total transfer volume, meanwhile, hit $27.6 trillion last year, surpassing the combined volume of Visa and Mastercard transactions in 2024.”

Impressive!

Make NO mistake – Trump&Co. want in on the action.

WLF is already planning to issue its own stablecoin (USD1) – and the US Dems are furious. The US opposition says that USD1 poses huge risks to the US financial system – yeah right!

Did something really bad happen to the US Military?

Nope. So don’t worry about the USD or the rest of the crap the West calls a financial system.

Trump&Co. are also planning to work with Crypto.com on investment products that could take the form of ETFs. We think the potential market for these products is much larger than the USA.

BTW – the SEC just dropped its investigation into Crypto.com. Great timing…

What’s He Building In There?

The Trump-era crypto policy shift is welcome – but we wonder what Trump&Co. have planned.

Clearly Trump wants into crypto in a big way. He is setting up the pieces for a big move into new crypto products – with his interests at the center of his policy moves.

Trump sees that stablecoins are a way to shore up demand for the USD, and finance the next generation of USG borrowing. With global access to the USD market – there is no limit to how much the USG can expand its market size.

Here’s the issue. Unlike the USD cash market – all stablecoin transactions are recorded on a blockchain. Total data oversight is here.

We have zero doubt that Trump wants to make big money on the shift to blockchain-based assets. But we think there is a security angle here too.

More on that here:

It is a perfect fit for Trump – money and power!

Reality Is Painful!

If you want to use common sense around here – don’t bother. It won’t help.

There are two major themes you need to understand going forward:

1. The US Financial system can be the epicenter of a global collapse – and the USD/bond market will thrive (it happened in 2008-9 – and will happen again).

2. Corruption is king. It will rarely be prosecuted – and in most cases – the more corrupt you are, the higher you rise (take a look at the USG).

Welcome to the other side of the looking glass – Alice. What a pretty dress you have on today.

It isn’t about any kind of colored pill – black, white, red, whatever color you like – it’s about reality. Your stupid as f#^k opinions don’t matter. No one with power cares.

Identity politics is the opiate of the masses. If you think we are wrong – go find a safe space circa 2015. It is a big hustle – and it is growing more brazen by the day.

Just so everyone knows – we don’t mind what McTrumper and Musk et al. are doing in the cryptosphere. We worry about what they are building.",blockonomi

“This collaboration signals a new phase for Rivalz,” said Igor K, Founder and CEO of Rivalz. “It shows that our infrastructure, once emerging, is now mature enough for mission-critical deployments in traditional industries, where reliability, compliance, and scale are non-negotiable. 51nodes is the ideal partner to help unlock that potential.”

Scalable, Secure, and Ready for Enterprise

Initial implementations will target high-impact use cases, such as predictive maintenance or supply chain optimization, and establish a model for broader enterprise adoption. The partnership combines Rivalz’s agent-based coordination layer with 51nodes’ track record of secure, compliant integrations in regulated sectors.

“We are excited to work with Rivalz on this transformative journey,” said Jochen Kassberger, Co-Founder and Managing Director of 51nodes. “Together, we’ll help traditional enterprises adopt AI systems that meet the highest standards of security, adaptability, and performance.”

Everyone wonders if such tokens will be able to rally in 2025. Meanwhile, another new project called Remittix presents a real solution to real-world problems.

Remittix can redefine the way you use crypto in daily money transactions. Remittix has low coin prices currently and is one among the best to invest in per most investors’ view. It would be wise to check recent news and technical opinions about Shiba Inu, PEPE, and Remittix here.

Shiba Inu: Mixed Signs on the SHIB Price

Shiba Inu has watched its feral initial gains, but the latest SHIB price has not been performing well. Recent news has SHIB decreasing in value and under stress due to market action.

Technical analysis indicates that the price of SHIB will decline lower if key levels fail to hold. Its long-term future has made investors anxious. Current trends cause some investors to consider moving funds to alternatives with real-world uses.

SHIB’s pressure is partially caused by an over-supply of the network and the market. The majority of the talk of the SHIB price point is that the currency is still to realize its potential.

There are some who think that if there are some technological improvements, SHIB can bounce back. For now, SHIB is predicted to drop by 2.19% and reach $0.00001268 by April 28.

PEPE Price Prediction: The Warning Signal from the Meme World

PEPE Price Prediction news that PEPE has dropped nearly 7% in value in the past 30 days. The token has begun to recover and has grown in value by about 7% in the past 24 hours to be trading at $0.000007771 currently.

Analysts now expect further price rise if market sentiment remains favorable. Technically, strong levels to support and high trading volumes exist. The majority of the investors consider the Pepe Price Prediction charts and observe the direction that can place a good recovery process in place.

However, the recent slip has sent others into alarm especially after they had anticipated a massive rally in 2025. Punters in their Pepe price prediction reports have promised that nothing is lost and Pepe can recover 225.14% and hit $0.00002489 by April 28.

https://blockonomi.com,"Why Remittix Is Being Dubbed XRP 2.0 as $RTX Could Become a Household Name by 2027. The Next 1,000x Opportunity?",https://blockonomi.com/why-remittix-is-being-dubbed-xrp-2-0-as-rtx-could-become-a-household-name-by-2027-the-next-1000x-opportunity/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 10:56:22 GMT","The crypto market has seen many narratives come and go, but none have maintained long-term staying power quite like the payments use case. It’s why XRP saw its early rise and why many believe a new wave of payment-based tokens could drive the next bull run.

At the center of that conversation now is Remittix—a rapidly rising PayFi project that’s already being called “XRP 2.0” by those watching its growth. With $RTX continuing to gain traction in presale, some analysts are now calling it a potential 1,000x play. Let’s take a closer look at why Remittix is shaping up to become a household name by 2027.

How Remittix Revives XRP’s Early Narrative—and Improves It

Ripple paved the way for blockchain-powered cross-border transactions, promising faster, cheaper international payments. But as Ripple got caught in years of regulatory uncertainty, the space was left wide open for innovation. That’s where Remittix enters—a clean-slate solution designed for today’s financial landscape.

While XRP’s strength lay in its banking partnerships, Remittix focuses on peer-to-peer and business-to-business transfers with an eye on speed, transparency, and fiat integration. The platform’s PayFi model enables users to send crypto that gets automatically converted into local fiat currency and deposited into a bank account.

This removes the need for third-party off-ramps or complex exchange processes. It’s a payment experience that feels as simple as using PayPal, but with the global reach and speed of blockchain.

Massive Growth in Presale Shows Investor Confidence

The numbers behind Remittix speak for themselves. Over 525 million tokens have already been sold, and the project has raised more than $14.3 million during its ongoing presale. Its price currently sits at $0.0734, with early investors already seeing sizable gains.

What’s more important than the price is the consistent growth of its investor base. While other projects rely on hype cycles or influencer shills, Remittix is winning over long-term holders by solving actual problems. This is what sets it apart from countless other tokens that claim utility but fail to deliver.

Unlike meme coins or short-lived trends, Remittix taps into the same fundamentals that helped XRP reach a multi-billion-dollar valuation in its prime—only now, it’s doing so with better tools and a stronger foundation.

The appeal of Remittix becomes clear when viewed in action. Imagine a small publishing company in Eastern Europe that sources content and design services from freelancers worldwide. Traditional banking methods are slow and costly, particularly when paying partners in countries with restrictive financial infrastructure.

By using Remittix, the company can pay its contractors in crypto, which the platform instantly converts into the local currency and deposits directly into the recipient’s bank account. No waiting, no worrying about exchange rates, and no manual transfers required.

Why $RTX Could Become a Household Name by 2027

As the financial world continues to digitize, blockchain-based payment systems will become more embedded in daily life. Remittix is positioning itself as one of the frontrunners in that space, building an ecosystem that could see massive adoption over the next few years.

With more use cases rolling out, increased exchange listings, expected post-presale, and ongoing developer updates, it’s no surprise some investors see Remittix as a 1,000x opportunity. The project’s focus isn’t just to be another altcoin—it’s to become a daily driver for global payments.

Moreover, XRP’s story has shown that tokens that target the payments niche can reach significant levels of adoption. Remittix builds on that framework but adds better user experience, decentralization, and regulatory foresight from day one.

Is Remittix Really XRP 2.0?

XRP made history by proving that crypto could compete with legacy financial systems. But its momentum was halted by lawsuits and outdated infrastructure. Remittix picks up the baton with a cleaner approach—modern tools, legal foresight, and a system that works for individuals and businesses alike.

With an already strong presale, a real solution to global payment inefficiencies, and a growing community, Remittix isn’t just living up to the XRP 2.0 nickname—it’s redefining what that title means.

Ready to experience the next big thing in payments? Visit Remittix and be part of the future of global finance before $RTX becomes a household name.

https://blockonomi.com,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Offers Utility While the Market Reacts to Tariffs, Lawsuits, and Delays Across Major Tokens",https://blockonomi.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-offers-utility-while-the-market-reacts-to-tariffs-lawsuits-and-delays-across-major-tokens/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 08:04:36 GMT","In recent weeks, volatility has once again returned to the crypto market. As headlines focus on new tariffs, unresolved lawsuits, and roadmap delays from some of the biggest names in the space, traders are beginning to reassess what they want from their holdings. Instead of chasing hype or momentum, many are looking for projects with real-world application and a clear direction. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the conversation—not as a reactionary play, but as a project built around utility, sustainability, and passive income potential.

Broader Market Sentiment Is Shifting

There’s no denying that recent macroeconomic tensions are affecting crypto. Trade policy decisions, including sudden tariff announcements, have left many investors on edge. Major tokens are reacting in kind, with price dips and reduced momentum. To add to the uncertainty, several high-cap projects are dealing with legal complications or development delays, making it harder for traders to feel confident about short-term gains.

Amid this uncertainty, users are no longer just looking at market cap or brand name—they’re looking at what each token actually does. This shift has created space for new, utility-focused projects to gain traction.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM)

Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to give users control over their digital assets. Instead of locking capital into idle wallets, users can supply assets and earn interest through automated smart contracts. The platform doesn’t rely on custodians or middlemen, ensuring transparency and trustless execution.

The protocol supports two types of lending approaches. One connects borrowers and lenders via shared liquidity pools with real-time rate adjustments based on pool usage. The other model allows users to create one-on-one loan agreements, offering flexibility—especially for tokens that aren’t traditionally accepted in pooled systems.

One of Mutuum Finance’s standout features is its mtToken system. When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens in return—tokenized representations of the supplied crypto that increase in redeemable value as interest builds. These mtTokens also maintain utility, meaning they can be transferred, stored, or potentially used in other DeFi applications. It’s a model designed for both functionality and passive growth.

The protocol’s reward mechanism also plays a big role in long-term value. A portion of the platform’s revenue is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market and distribute them to active participants. This creates consistent buy pressure and incentives for users to engage with the platform—not just hold the token.

Mutuum Finance is currently in the fourth stage of its presale, priced at $0.025 per token. More than $5.9 million has already been raised, and over 7,600 holders have joined the ecosystem. Earlier presale rounds sold out quickly, and demand continues to rise as the token approaches its next price tier.

This current phase may be the last chance for investors to secure MUTM at its lowest price. Once the presale concludes, the launch price is expected to be higher, with growing interest from early investors and DeFi-focused investors who see long-term potential in the project’s structure.

The Mutuum Finance team has outlined a well-defined development plan. Alongside the token launch, the project plans to release a beta version of the platform, allowing users to immediately engage in lending and borrowing. This sets Mutuum apart from projects that delay utility, giving the community immediate access to the core product.

On top of that, a decentralized stablecoin is in development. This addition will further enhance the ecosystem by providing users with a predictable and transparent store of value within the platform.

To reward early participants, the team has also launched a $100,000 giveaway campaign—an initiative that reflects both its community-first approach and the growing excitement around the token.

In a market clouded by uncertainty, Mutuum Finance stands out as a practical solution with real use cases. With strong momentum, transparent mechanics, and a growing community, MUTM is positioning itself as a serious contender in the DeFi space—especially as traders continue to move away from hype and look toward meaningful, utility-driven projects.

https://blockonomi.com,"GameStop Secures $1.5 Billion Debt Offering, Eyes Bitcoin Investment",https://blockonomi.com/gamestop-secures-1-5-billion-debt-offering-eyes-bitcoin-investment/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 08:13:21 GMT","It looks like GameStop is ready for its first Bitcoin purchase. The video game retailer , best known for the meme stock phenomenon, announced Tuesday the successful completion of a $1.5 billion private offering of convertible senior notes.

The firm plans to use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of Bitcoin.

GameStop Goes Crypto!

According to a new SEC filing, the offering, completed on April 1, saw strong demand, which allowed GameStop to fully exercise the initial purchaser’s option to sell an additional $200 million in notes beyond the initially planned $1.3 billion.

The notes, which will mature on April 1, 2030, are unsecured obligations of the company and carry a 0.00% interest rate. This means that investors will not receive regular interest payments.

It recalls Strategy’s Bitcoin playbook. Michael Saylor’s firm often leverages zero-interest convertible notes to raise capital without immediate dilution, offering investors potential upside through stock conversions.

The structure of the convertible notes allows holders the option to convert their debt into GameStop’s Class A common stock under certain conditions.

Before January 1, 2030, the conversion is contingent on factors such as GameStop’s stock price reaching at least 130% of the conversion price, or if the trading price of the notes falls dramatically.

After January 1, 2030, holders can convert the notes at any time before maturity, regardless of these conditions. Upon conversion, GameStop retains the flexibility to settle its obligation in cash, shares, or a combination of both.

The initial conversion rate is set at 33.4970 shares of GameStop stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, translating to an initial conversion price of approximately $29.85 per share.

Debt For Bitcoin

While GameStop cannot redeem the notes before April 6, 2028, it has the option to do so thereafter if its stock price meets a certain threshold. Conversely, noteholders have the right to demand GameStop repurchase their notes on April 3, 2028, and also in the event of a fundamental change in the company.

GameStop proposed the private offering on March 26 after confirming its plans to invest in Bitcoin. The company also disclosed holding $4.75 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of February 1.

The meme stock icon first showed its intention to invest in Bitcoin in February, CNBC reported. At the time, it was said to also mull over other cryptocurrencies to see whether it made sense to put one or some of them on its balance sheet.

GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen also met with Strategy’s Saylor in early February. There were never details about what they talked about but all the things about Bitcoin investment and note offerings surfaced after that meeting.

Saylor and Strategy have inspired multiple firms, both large and small, American and global, to enter the Bitcoin reserve race. Some remarkable examples are Rumble, a video-sharing platform and cloud services provider, and Metaplanet, a Tokyo-listed company often referred to as “Asia’s Strategy.”

In November 2024, Rumble announced its plan to allocate up to $20 million of its cash reserves to Bitcoin. The decision came after CEO Chris Pavlovski’s poll that resulted in 93.9% of respondents voting in favor of the move.

The company then made its first Bitcoin purchase in March, scooping approximately 188 Bitcoin at an average price of $91,000 per coin, totaling $17.1 million.

GameStop Stock Drops Post-Bitcoin News

GameStop (GME) shares surged after its first Bitcoin announcement, but plummeted over 20% shortly thereafter.

Factors behind the decline could vary, but many experts suggest that investors could be uncertain about how GameStop’s pivot to Bitcoin makes sense for its struggling retail business.

The company has closed over 1,000 stores over the past year due to the shift towards digital gaming and increased competition from online retailers. The company has struggled to adapt its brick-and-mortar model to these changes.

Initial excitement among retail investors, who often follow GameStop as a “meme stock,” quickly gave way to skepticism. Investors are concerned about whether this move will help stabilize or grow the company’s core business.",blockonomi

Bitcoin price hovering around $85,000 amid uncertainty over upcoming Trump tariffs

Short sellers risk $9.41 billion in liquidations if Bitcoin reaches $90,000

Crypto analysts divided on price direction with some predicting a drop to $73,000

Trade war impact on Bitcoin may be overstated compared to other market factors

Institutional demand via spot ETFs has continued despite tariff concerns

Bitcoin prices remain in a state of flux as markets await President Donald Trump’s upcoming “Liberation Day” tariffs, scheduled to roll out this Wednesday and Thursday. Currently trading around $85,000, the leading cryptocurrency faces a critical juncture that could determine its short-term price direction.

Traders are watching closely as $9.41 billion in short positions could face liquidation if Bitcoin reaches the $90,000 mark. This potential short squeeze might trigger even higher prices if the market continues moving upward.

“As Liberation Day approaches, the uncertainty around the magnitude of the tariffs is keeping bitcoin and other risk assets in limbo,” wrote Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and founder of The Coin Bureau. Puckrin noted that Bitcoin has recently closed its most recent CME gap that opened over the weekend around the $83,000 to $84,000 level.

The cryptocurrency is now trading below its 200-day average, while 24-hour liquidations remain low at under $250 million. This indicates momentum could again be on the downside, according to market watchers.

Tariff Impact on Crypto Markets

The relationship between tariffs and Bitcoin presents a complex picture. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, wrote in a February note that tariffs would likely be negative for Bitcoin in the short term.

“Unlike gold, bitcoin has a growth component, meaning it reacts to economic trends and liquidity cycles,” Butterfill explained. Initially, tariffs could slow economic growth, reducing demand for risk assets like Bitcoin.

Inflation would also increase, leading to speculation on higher interest rates. Tariffs could cause a temporary price drop, as crypto often correlates with stock markets.

However, some analysts believe the trade war’s impact on Bitcoin’s price may be overstated. Despite Bitcoin’s recent struggles to break above $89,000, several other factors had already been weighing on investor sentiment long before the tariff announcements.

Price Predictions and Market Indicators

Market sentiment remains divided. According to Puckrin, the Bitcoin long-short ratio is currently close to 50-50. “We really could go either way right now, showing just how uncertain the current macro backdrop is,” he said.

If tariff news is milder than expected, Puckrin anticipates a potential breakout with $88,000 as the short-term price to watch. However, a tariff shock could prompt a Bitcoin breakdown near $79,000 in the short term, or even lower to the next support level at $73,000 if extreme fear grips the market.

On the positive side, there has been low trading volume over the last few weeks. The crypto Fear & Greed Index is still hovering around fear, which Puckrin said could indicate that the market is at or very close to a low.

“In the longer term, we can be fairly confident that BTC will rally from here — the question is only around timing,” he added.

Long-term Outlook

Some market experts anticipate a potential market shakeout soon. Crypto analyst ‘Crypto Fella’ shared a price chart suggesting a possible drop in Bitcoin price to between $78,692 and $70,000, followed by a push toward a $94,655 target.

10X Research released a similar note earlier in March, warning of a potential drop to $73,000. The firm noted that retail traders loaded up on memecoins during Bitcoin’s postelection rally to record highs in January.

However, that was likely a market top that began to crumble, with many portfolios holding falling meme coins. 10X said that Bitcoin would need a refreshed narrative to power the next major upward swing.

Despite the uncertainty, institutional demand has remained strong. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $2.75 billion in net inflows during the three weeks following January 21, even as the trade war escalated.

Some analysts point to broader market factors affecting Bitcoin’s performance. The weakening job market dampens traders’ demand for risk-on assets, including Bitcoin. In February, the US Labor Department reported job openings near a four-year low.

Similarly, yields on the US 2-year Treasury fell to a six-month low, with investors accepting a modest 3.88% return for the safety of government-backed instruments. This data suggests rising risk aversion, which is unfavorable for Bitcoin.

As of Tuesday, Bitcoin traded near $85,000, up 2.6% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum climbed near $1,900, up 4.2% during that period, while the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and other spot bitcoin ETFs rose 3%.",blockonomi
