Newsmax (NMAX) stock dropped 45.7% midday Wednesday after a massive post-IPO surge saw shares soar from $10 to $233.

Newsmax is a conservative cable news outlet and Fox News alternative that was founded in 1998 by CEO Christopher Ruddy, a media mogul and friend of US President Trump. The company — which also owns subsidiaries that sell nutritional supplements and insurance advertised in Newsmax's newsletters — raised $75 million in its IPO Friday, with shares priced at $10. Newsmax had previously raised $225 million in a private offering in February.

The stock surged a staggering 735% Monday and another 180% Tuesday, rocketing its market cap from $1.2 billion upon its market debut to more than $20.8 billion at Tuesday's close. It showed the Trump trade still has room to run in some cases, just as the president's tariff policies slam the market at large.

Newsmax's market cap at Tuesday's close was higher than those of Wall Street Journal parent News Corp (NWSA) and AI server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI).

Newsmax is unprofitable. While the company's revenue jumped more than 26% to $171 million in 2024 from the prior year's $135 million, its loss increased nearly 73% to $72 million from the prior year's loss, according to Newsmax's 10-K SEC filing. The company also said in its filing that it has identified ""material weaknesses"" in its financial reporting controls such that there may be ""a material misstatement"" in its financial statements that it may not detect ""on a timely basis.""

Newsmax's massive upswing has prompted various media outlets to draw comparisons to the meme stock craze of 2020 as well as the notoriously volatile stock of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT). On Monday, trading of Newsmax stock was halted at various points due to volatility.

Newsmax's drop Wednesday sent its market cap down to $11.3 billion, with shares trading around $127. Meanwhile, DJT stock fell more than 5%.

Newsmax is facing an ongoing lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems seeking $1.6 billion in damages related to false claims it made in its coverage of the 2020 election, which Newsmax cited among risk factors to its business in its latest 10-K filing to the SEC. Newsmax settled another lawsuit with another election tech company, Smartmatic, in 2024 for similar claims and has paid $20 million of the $40 million settlement thus far, according to the filing.

The Trump 2.0 stock market is off to one of the worst starts of any presidency since 1950.

New data crunched by SunDial Capital Research strategist Jason Goepfert on Wednesday shows the market's response to President Trump since the inauguration is among the bottom of all presidents since 1950. In the first 50 trading sessions since Inauguration Day, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has dropped about 6.4%.

The only two worse starts were Richard Nixon's first 50 days (-7.2%) and George W. Bush's (-13.6%).

The best 50-day starts are held by John F. Kennedy (+9.4%), Barack Obama (+5.7%), and Bill Clinton (+4.2%).

Rough starts are a ""bad open"" for stocks when zooming out, warns Goepfert.

The S&P 500's median return six months after negative returns in the first 50 days was -1.9%. Even a year later, it was flat. Only four of the 10 instances showed a larger maximum gain than loss over the following year.

""While it is generally foolhardy to assign political motives to stock movements, the correlation seems pretty clear in this case. The new administration's take on tariffs has not impressed the stock market, which overshadows what is perceived as a bevy of more business-friendly policies. Whether the tariffs will take effect in announced form is guesswork,"" said Goepfert.

Trump is expected to unveil his new tariffs on what he calls ""Liberation Day"" after the market closes today around 4:00 p.m. ET. How tariffs shake out is anyone's guess.

The administration has floated everything from a 20% universal tariff to ones that are more sector-based. Administration officials said Tuesday the tariffs would take effect immediately but hinted Trump would be open to negotiating them lower.

Watch: AMD CEO warns about impact of tariffs on semis

A 25% US tariff on imports of steel and aluminum from all countries already took effect on March 12.

Fresh tariffs would arrive as other countries have fired back.

China has implemented a 15% tariff on US chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton products and an additional 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Canada has announced a 25% tariff on 30 billion Canadian dollars of US imports.

Market pros think tariffs could squeeze the economy and send stock prices even lower.

""I don't think the effect of tariffs is fully priced into markets,"" BCA Research chief strategist Peter Berezin told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (clip above). ""If you look at what's happened to stocks this year, they have gone down, but they've gone down primarily because of the Magnificent Seven stocks. If you look at the other 493 companies, they're basically flat for the year. That's not what you would expect from a market that has priced in a recession.""

Oops, something went wrong

CoreWeave's stock (CRWV) is enjoying a rip-your-face-off rally since debuting to a muted reception on the Nasdaq less than a week ago.

Shares of the AI cloud play spiked 41% on Tuesday and popped 11% to $58.60 in early Wednesday trading.

""In the first few days of trading, I would expect it to be added to various AI baskets which are very prominent right now,"" D.A. Davidson software analyst Gil Luria told me on what's driving the robust market action this week.

CoreWeave priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $40 a share in March. The company initially expected to sell shares in the range of $47 to $55, but concerns about the pace of AI spending and CoreWeave's business model caused it to downsize the offering. Nvidia (NVDA) — an early CoreWeave investor — reportedly anchored the IPO at $40.

The company raised $1.5 billion for a valuation of $23 billion on a fully diluted basis. It had planned to raise $4 billion at a valuation of $35 billion.

The stock opened around $40 per share on March 28, fell as much as 6%, then turned green and rose by as much as 4%. Shares were flat to conclude their first day of trading.

When asked whether customers are getting worried about the pace of investment in artificial intelligence, CoreWeave co-founder Brannin McBee told me, ""Not that we see,"" on the company's IPO day (video above). ""And this discussion of an AI bubble — we don't understand it.""

CoreWeave was founded in 2017 as a crypto miner by Michael Intrator, Brian Venturo, and McBee, who largely have backgrounds in the energy industry.

The company took a $100 million investment and $320 million contract from Nvidia (NVDA) as well as a multiyear deal with Microsoft (MSFT) to raise $1.6 billion in equity and $12.9 billion in debt commitments. This allowed CoreWeave to purchase 250,000 GPUs from Nvidia, or about $10 billion worth.

Today, the company provides access to data centers and high-powered chips for AI workloads. It competes with cloud providers like Microsoft and Amazon (AMZN).

Financial results have been solid for an early-stage tech player.

Sales last year rose to $1.9 billion from $228 million in 2023. Adjusted operating profits increased to $1.2 billion from $103 million in 2023.

But CoreWeave is not without a few risks staring down investors.

Concerns linger about CoreWeave using large amounts of debt to fund purchases of a depreciating asset in AI chips. The company has raised $14.9 billion in debt and equity across 12 financings to buy chips and build data centers.

It spent $941 million to service its debt in 2024, according to the company's S-1 filing.

In addition, OpenAI has committed $11.9 billion in orders to CoreWeave. If the large language model builder can't raise enough money to support its growth ambitions, CoreWeave could see order cancellations. Currently, Microsoft accounts for 62% of CoreWeave's sales.

Investors should brace for a leaner stock market and economy as Trump tariffs and retaliations from trading partners like Canada, Europe, and China take hold.

Those are the gloomy calls from BCA Research chief strategist Peter Berezin.

BCA Research is an independent research firm that has been in business since 1942 and is among the largest independent macroeconomic forecasters to institutions. And Berezin has been an economist for more than 30 years, with stints at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Goldman Sachs, and now BCA Research.

Berezin gained attention this year for being the lone bear on Wall Street coming into 2025. Further, he correctly called that in 2022 there would be no US recession — despite most on the Street bracing for one.

In a new episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above), Berezin doubled down on his recent call that there is a 75% chance of a US recession this year. In a new wrinkle shared with me, Berezin believes the US may already be in a mild recession.

He forecasts slight negative economic growth for the year as consumers pull back amid a more inflationary environment, thanks to a global trade war.

Assuming his economic call holds true, Berezin thinks the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is destined for 4,450 — down about 21% from current levels. The best places for investors to hide out this year may continue to be gold and consumer staples and soon, bonds.

""I don't think the effect of tariffs is fully priced into markets,"" Berezin said. ""If you look at what's happened to stocks this year, they have gone down, but they've gone down primarily because of the Magnificent 7 stocks. If you look at the other 493 companies, they're basically flat for the year. That's not what you would expect from a market that has priced in a recession.""

Others on the Street have become more cautious about stocks and the economy as Trump tariffs come into focus.

Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said Monday he now sees US gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 1.5% in 2025. That's down from previous expectations for growth to average 1.9%.

In addition, he sees a 35% chance of a US recession in the next 12 months, compared with 20% previously.

Meanwhile, Hatzius's colleague David Kostin slashed his 2025 S&P 500 target to 5,700 from 6,200. He cited a higher recession risk and tariff-related uncertainty.

Kostin joins the likes of SocGen and Yardeni Research in lowering S&P 500 targets within the last few weeks.

Berezin explained, ""I don't expect a very deep recession because the imbalances in the economy are not as severe as they were in say, 2008. Nevertheless, I think we'll probably get a fairly nasty recession, especially as financial markets are concerned. You think about the 2001 recession, that was a very mild recession. We didn't even have two consecutive quarters of negative growth, and yet stocks still fell 49% peak to trough because they were so expensive going into that recession.""

The full Opening Bid episode with Berezin will air at 8:30 a.m. ET on April 7.

Oops, something went wrong

Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan has a tall task ahead of him. The recently appointed executive has to turn around an ailing Intel that's not only fallen behind in the AI race but is losing market share in its core PC business to longtime and upstart rivals.

Shares of Intel are off a staggering 50% over the last 12 months as the company has struggled with sliding quarterly revenue. And its foundry business continues to weigh on its balance sheet.

But Tan isn't discouraged. Instead, the former Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) head says he knows what it takes to return Intel to its former glory, though he admits it will be difficult. During his first public comments as CEO during Intel Vision 2025 on Monday, he laid out his plans for the company.

“I love this company. It was very hard for me to watch it struggle. I simply cannot stay on the sideline knowing I could help turn things around. I also fully recognize it won't be easy,” Tan said.

“For quite a long time, we fell behind on innovation. As a result, we have been too slow to adapt and to meet your needs. You deserve better, and we need to improve. And we will,” he added.

But it will take a concerted effort to not only revive Intel, but turn it back into the crown jewel of America's chip industry.

During his speech, Tan put the blame for Intel's current situation squarely on the company itself.

“I will pull together strong teams to correct the past mistakes and [start] to earn your trust,” he said.

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said that while Tan's speech was light on details about how exactly he'll address Intel's shortcomings, his candor about wanting Intel customers to call out the company when it fails to deliver is a welcome change of pace compared to former CEO Pat Gelsinger.

“Hoping for more concrete actions was likely unreasonable at this point anyway, and at least he clearly does not suffer from the almost delusional optimism that torpedoed his predecessor,” Rasgon wrote. “Underpromise and overdeliver sounds like a much better way to handle things for now.”

Tan says one of his key tasks is to bring in top talent to ensure the company is able to develop the right products and capture more customers.

“We are going to refocus the company on essential ingredients of innovation, and clearly I need to focus on strengthening my balance sheet,” he explained. “And I need to really drive efficiency and I need to really regroup the talent we have and attract some other new talent.”

Intel is contending with a slew of problems that have damaged its standing in the tech world. That includes an inability to innovate and catch trends, like the AI boom, and delays in developing and rolling out new chip technologies.

But one of the biggest issues is Intel's foundry business. Gelsinger sought to turn the foundry into a third-party manufacturer for customers akin to rival TSMC (TSM). But the division is bleeding cash, posting an operating loss of $13.4 billion in 2024. And Intel says it doesn't expect its foundry business to break even until 2027.

According to the New York Times, the Trump administration is working with TSMC to help the company take control of Intel's foundry. And according to Reuters, TSMC has pitched Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and AMD (AMD) about forming a joint venture that would own less than 50% of Intel's foundry business. However, during a press event at Nvidia's GTC 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he hadn't heard of any such plan.

Regardless of those reports, Tan threw his support behind Intel's foundry business during his speech.

“As we strengthen our Intel products, [we] are equally committed to building a great foundry,” he said. “Global demand for chip production is growing, and you need supply chains that are flexible, resilient, and secure. Intel foundry plays a crucial role. We will continue to advance our foundry strategy to meet our needs,” he said.

Intel's board gave Gelsinger just shy of four years to try to save the company. There's no telling how long it will give Tan.

Tesla stock (TSLA) on Wednesday reversed early losses after a report from Politico said the company's CEO, Elon Musk, was set to pare back his duties in the Trump administration ""in the coming weeks.""

Shares of the electric carmaker had dropped as much as 4% in early trade after the company reported its worst quarter for sales in three years.

According to Politico's Rachael Bade, President Trump ""has told his inner circle, including members of his Cabinet, that Elon Musk will be stepping back in the coming weeks from his current role.""

Bade's report comes just hours before Trump is set to hold a press conference outlining his new tariff plans on what the president has dubbed ""Liberation Day.""

One senior official told Politico Musk would likely retain an ""informal role"" as an adviser to the White House. This report follows the call from some on Wall Street, most notably Wedbush's Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, that Musk needed to ""change course"" and refocus his energies on the carmaker after the stock's 50% decline from its highs reached in December 2024.

Earlier on Wednesday, the company reported first quarter global deliveries that widely missed estimates as demand issues clearly hit the electric vehicle maker.

For the quarter, Tesla reported 336,681 deliveries versus 390,342 estimated, per Bloomberg consensus, making it the worst quarter for deliveries since the second quarter of 2022.

""While the changeover of Model Y lines across all four of our factories led to the loss of several weeks of production in Q1, the ramp of the New Model Y continues to go well,"" Tesla said in a statement. The refreshed Model Y went on sale globally in March, with some analysts citing the changeover as a reason for depressed demand for its top-selling vehicle.

Read more about Tesla's stock moves and today's market action.

Tesla also said it produced 362,615 units globally for the quarter, deployed 10.4 GWh of energy storage products, and would report first quarter earnings on Tuesday, April 22.

Tesla sales have been stalling across most of its global territories. Earlier this week, Tesla registration data in key European regions fell in March, another sign that sales are continuing to slide in one of its key markets as Tesla's brand has also taken a hit due to the right-wing political activities of CEO Elon Musk.

In France, only 3,157 Tesla EVs were registered, down 36.8% from a year ago, per official data cited by Reuters. Norway saw only 2,211 registrations, down 63.9%. Sweden's tally of 911 was only down 1%.

Tesla's registrations are a close proxy for sales, which the company only reports quarterly and does not break out by region.

Also in Scandinavia, usually a stronghold of EV sales, Denmark's Tesla registrations dropped to 593, down 65.6%, and the Netherlands saw 1,536, a drop of 61% compared to last year.

""With the current headwinds for TSLA across the industry, including protests at Tesla dealerships, violence seen at TSLA drivers around the country/Europe, and more Musk-related brand worries, this delivery number was a disaster for the bulls with continuous negativity around the TSLA brand,"" Ives said in a note Wednesday morning. ""We are not going to look at these numbers with rose colored glasses ... they were a disaster on every metric.""

Take it easy on your kitchen's 20-year-old tile floors. New ones likely won't come cheap if the Trump administration imposes new tariffs today.

New research from Bank of America analyst Rafe Jadrosich found that 40% of the ceramic tile market is imported. About 80% of the luxury vinyl tile market is imported. Roughly 35% of ceramic imports come from Italy and Spain, followed by 14% each from Mexico and India. China accounts for 50% of the imports of luxury vinyl tile.

Those tile floors, along with bathroom fixtures and dishwashers, were highlighted as three common household items that could see higher prices with new tariffs.

Jadrosich added that plumbing fixtures, valves, and rough plumbing are manufactured in China, in addition to upstream components imported from Asia.

Plumbing supplier play Fortune Brands Innovations (FBIN) has disclosed that 50% to 60% of its input costs come from outside the US, per Jadrosich.

Home improvement products supplier Masco (MAS) has said a 10% tariff on China would have an annualized impact of $45 million on profits before any mitigating actions like price hikes.

Jadrosich estimated that about 40% of the US appliance industry's sales are imported. About 43% of the industry's products are sourced from China, 20% from Mexico, and 11% from South Korea. Whirlpool (WHR) leans on Mexico and China for 20% of its cost of goods sold.

The most exposed building materials stocks to new tariffs include Whirlpool, Fortune Brands Innovations, Masco, and flooring player Mohawk Industries (MHK), Jadrosich said. All four stocks are down for the year and trailing the S&P 500 (^GSPC), with Whirlpool leading the way with a 20% tumble.

""The impact to housing stocks will depend on the details,"" Jadrosich warned.

Markets are on edge as worries about Trump's tariffs ripple through corporate America, with the threat of retaliation by trading partners adding to the potential impact of hiked duties.

Trump is expected to unveil his new tariffs on what he calls ""Liberation Day"" after the market closes today around 4:00 p.m. ET. How tariffs shake out is anyone's guess.

The administration has floated everything from a 20% universal tariff to ones that are more sector-based. Administration officials said Tuesday the tariffs would take effect immediately but hinted Trump would be open to negotiating them lower.

""The bigger picture is U.S. economic growth [GDP] revisions are being revised lower for the first time in years. Our view is there are downside risks to earnings given the lowering in economic growth estimates alongside risks to profit margins posed by tariffs,"" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner warned.

The fashion industry is gearing back up to navigate Trump tariffs that could hit profits for the crucial spring and holiday shopping seasons.

“It's impossible [to deal with], so we're not dealing with it this time around,” said noted handbag and accessories designer Rebecca Minkoff to Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi during an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (see the video above; listen below). “We dealt with it the last time tariffs were instituted. I think that year we thought we were going to make $3 million. We lost $3 million.”

Minkoff has had a robust career designing everything from handbag color pallets to supply chains.

She is the founder of the Female Founder Collective, as well as her namesake fashion company, and recently published a book called ""Fearless: The New Rules for Unlocking Creativity, Courage, and Success.""

Her fashion business is still rebounding from losses suffered during COVID-19, a time she estimates hampered the company's sales by 70%. Although she sold the company three years ago, she remains a “very happily paid employee.”

Minkoff said she went to testify on behalf of the fashion industry during the first Trump administration. Those efforts didn't help sway policymakers on tariffs, which can leave companies with a slew of matters to solve.

“It was impossible with the timeline set forth to change [the] supply chain,” said Minkoff, who noted that fashion runs on a nine-month life cycle from concept to hitting the floor.

To stay in business back then, Minkoff relocated operations out of China, a move that “saved us a lot of money in the long run, but it's pain we didn't need.""

The company has been manufacturing out of Vietnam and Indonesia for the past three years, which has helped keep costs under control.

Tariffs have proven to be more than a buzzword for the consumer lately.

Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet

Since Trump took office, he has announced a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada, though goods under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) were exempt until April 2. In March, another 10% duty on Chinese goods was levied on top of the previous 10%.

To put it into context, China's 2024 foreign textiles and apparel trade reached $322.4 billion, with $301.1 billion in exports and $21.27 billion in imports.

This is before Trump's ""Liberation Day"" today when he is expected to unwrap fresh tariffs on individual countries.

“We're going to have to spend more on everything,” said Minkoff of the new tariffs. “Everything is going to be more expensive.”

In fashion, one move to offset costs can be to adjust the quality of materials, such as zippers or buttons. “I think a lot of brands are going to do that, and it's going to hurt them in the end,” said Minkoff. “It might be a quick fix for now, but the customer sees it.”

 

An outsider might think the easiest way to avoid tariff-based fees is to move operations back to the US full-time. But US-made goods will sport heftier price tags, Minkoff warned.

Just the cost to make one T-shirt varies greatly by region based on rules and regulations. According to the website successfulfashiondesigner.com, one shirt made in New Jersey costs an average sample fee of $250 plus $7 for shipping, while the same shirt made in China costs $50 to make and $30 to ship.

Minkoff, who started designing out of a shop on 38th Street in New York City, has fielded this advice before. “I would love manufacturing to come back, but it has to come back on a scale that is not just the make,” she said.

The murder of a young Sicilian woman by a stalker in broad daylight has sent shockwaves across Italy, where 11 women have been killed since the start of the year.

University student Sara Campanella, 22, was killed by an acquaintance on Monday afternoon in the Sicilian city of Messina.

Witnesses told media that they saw a man - later identified by prosecutors as 27-year-old Stefano Argentino - walk up to Ms Campanella and stab her on the street. She tried to get away and screamed ""Stop it, let me go, stop it,"" before collapsing, they said.

A passer-by who reportedly heard Ms Campanella's screams tried to chase the attacker, who managed to flee. 

Ms Campanella died on her way to the hospital. Mr Argentino was arrested a few hours later in the nearby town of Noto.

Raffaele Leone, Mr Argentino's lawyer, told Italian media on Wednesday that his client had admitted the charges against him, but had not explained why he had attacked her. 

""I can't say if he's remorseful, he's quite closed up,"" Mr Leone was quoted by Ansa news agency as saying.

The Messina prosecutor, Antonio D'Amato, said that Stefano Argentino had ""insistently and repeatedly"" harassed Sara Campanella since she started university two years ago. She was studying to become a biomedical technician.

One of her friends once had to intervene when Mr Argentino kept complaining that Ms Campanella no longer smiled at him, Mr D'Amato said. 

But he added that Ms Campanella never went to the police as she did not feel that Mr Argentino's attentions were particularly ""threatening or pathological"".

In the police detention order quoted by Italian media, prosecutors said that Mr Argentino had been ""regularly pestering the victim, asking her to go out with him and get to know each other better, and refusing to back down even when she would turn him down"".

Mr D'Amato said that, shortly before being stabbed, Ms Campanella sent a message to some friends, telling them that ""that sick guy is following me"".

Writing on Facebook, Ms Campanella's mother said that her daughter ""bravely thought her 'No' would be enough because [Stefano Argentino] meant nothing to her, they weren't together, she just wanted him to leave her alone, she wanted to live and dream and graduate.

""You always need to speak up and go to the police! Help me give Sara a voice,"" she said.

In an emotional interview to Italian TV, Ms Campanella's brother said that unrequited love or attention could never be a reason for ""act like this one"".

""There are no justifications, and someone like him doesn't even deserve words.""

The father of Giulia Cecchettin, who was also 22 when she was killed by her ex-boyfriend, told Italian newspaper La Repubblica that there are ""entire generations of men who don't accept rejection"".

""Love is not possession, jealousy is not love, and saying 'No' is a right. In Sara's case there hadn't even been a relationship,"" Mr Cecchettin said.

""Women continue to be killed by those who don't accept their rejection. We need to make an extraordinary effort, a collective act of rebellion... against this culture of death,"" said Mara Carfagna, a former minister and lawmaker.

The issue of violence against women is keenly felt in Italy, where femicides are frequently reported by the media. Last month alone, four women died at the hands of their partners or ex-partners. 

On Wednesday, less than 48 hours after her death, Sara Campanella's murder was pushed out of the headlines by news that the body of 22-year-old Ilaria Sula had been found in a suitcase in Rome.

The university student had gone missing last week. According to Italian media, her ex-boyfriend has confessed to her murder.

Louis Buffon, son of Italian World Cup winner Gianluigi, sees his international future with the Czech Republic rather than with his father's country.

Police have described Emanuele Gregorini as  ""the head of the Italian mafia Latin America"".

King Charles III is going ahead with his state visit to Italy and the Vatican, Buckingham Palace says.

Tuscany's president advises residents to exercise ""the utmost attention and caution"".

Many people in and around the Italian city spend the night on the streets and in their cars, fearing aftershocks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:bbc.com?category=world","Your Friends and Neighbors review: 'Radically different from any other show'","https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250402-your-friends-and-neighbors-review","Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:03:38 GMT","

Jon Hamm excels in Apple TV+'s ""emotionally real but absurdist"" drama about a desperate corporate man who resorts to stealing from his neighbours.

Jon Hamm has his best role since Mad Men and brings all his sharp comic timing and dramatic nuance to it as Andrew Cooper, known as Coop, a hedge-fund manager who loses his job and manoeuvres to maintain his elaborate lifestyle and sense of himself. If you took Don Draper and dropped him into 2025 he might be Coop, a corporate man with a broken marriage and two teenaged children, a decent guy and a charmer with all-around bad judgement. Your Friends and Neighbors is emotionally real and affecting but also absurdist and funny, a rare combination.

The show begins with Coop waking up in a pool of blood next to a man's dead body in the foyer of a neighbour's mansion. He cleans up the blood – a bad move – and in one of the many mordant voiceovers that run through the series, looks back four months to reflect on ""the swirling hot mess of my life"". His worst choice is replacing his lost income by stealing loot from friends so rich they'll never miss it. The robberies are the comic vein in the story, but also a Trojan horse for its drama. Coop is hurt and distraught over the loss of his marriage, but that theme exists next to the caper-like thefts. The series is edgier and smarter than its entertaining surface suggests, as it deftly takes on issues of family, class privilege, vapid materialism and toxic masculinity.

Like most series, this could start a bit faster, as it sets up the life Coop is accustomed to in a suburban New York community of huge houses and country clubs, where $200,000 cars and $60,000 donations to charity are ordinary. That was his life until he found his wife Mel (Amanda Peet) in bed with his so-called friend, Nick (Mark Tallman), a former basketball star still in great shape. The divorce has sent Coop out of his expansive home into a smaller rental house nearby. 

More like this:

• A new Hollywood take-down is a must-see

• Why on-screen male nudity is still taboo

But soon enough the first episode gets to its boldest turn as we see why Coop lost his job. A woman who works at his firm, whom he has never met and who doesn't report to him, comes on to him in a bar. Months later, that consensual hookup leads to his being fired for violating the company's HR rules. Pop culture has at times gingerly dipped a toe into the theme of sexual harassment. On The Morning Show, Steve Carell's character, a toxic predator, was sent off a cliff to die. But there has been nothing as complicated as this. The show doesn't deny Coop's bad judgement but also makes it clear through the woman herself and Coop's ruthless boss that the HR rule was a convenient excuse to get rid of him while keeping his clients. The show doesn't go far beyond that in exploring the issue, but it sets up the series' complex realism about social standards. 

A non-compete clause makes Coop unhireable, but he insists on keeping up appearances. His burglaries are treated like adventures, punctuated by mock ads as he describes the luxury items he's lifting, with voiceovers that slyly echo Hamm's in all those Mercedes-Benz commercials. ""The Patek Phillippe Nautilus: sealed 18-carat white gold..."" Coop says, talking about an item no one really needs.

The series' real strength, though, is in his relationships, most of them driven by his wounded pride, and the way his identity has been tied to his role as a successful man of the world. Hamm smoothly navigates the shifts in tone, never allowing the humour to flag while letting us see the emotional pain Coop won't reveal to anyone around him. There is a lot of residual affection between Coop and his cheating ex-wife, whom Peet manages to make sympathetic. When Mel worries and asks him what's wrong, he displays a classic alpha-male inability to share feelings. ""I'm fine,"" he tells her when clearly he is not. Olivia Munn has less to do as Sam, a divorced neighbour and Coop's occasional fling. And Lena Hall is brilliant as Coop's sister, Ali. Briefly off her meds, she stalks her ex-fiancé, sitting on his lawn with her guitar and singing. Hall, who won a Tony for her role in the Broadway revival of Hedwig and the Angry Inch in 2014, sings occasionally through the series – an asset, not an intrusion. She makes Ali empathetic, funny and warm, and the bond between the brother and sister is touching. After she is back on her meds, her romantic subplot suggests that theirs really is a family full of bad choices.

A second season of the show has already been ordered, so the question of whether Coop will pay for his crimes will linger. That plot is an effective hook, but his resonant feelings and increasing self-knowledge set the show apart. At a party of male friends hosted by Nick – why is Coop even there? more bad choices – he looks around at the men who still have their jobs and money, and sees the person he might have become. ""Their future was already written, and so the quest to stave off the emptiness began,"" he says in voiceover, observing their devotion to ""Scotch and cigars"", to ""custom golf clubs and high-end escorts"". He recognises that there are ""entire industries built to cash in on the quiet desperation of rich middle-aged men"". By even acknowledging that desperation, through a hero who is sympathetic – however wrong-headed his path to self-awareness – Your Friends and Neighbors is radically different from any other show around.   

★★★★★

Your Friends and Neighbors is on Apple TV+ from 11 April.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:bbc.com?category=world","Parents allowed to block children's games and friends on Roblox","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86j9ygw45xo","Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:02:01 GMT","

Parents will be able to block their children from specific games and experiences on Roblox as part of new safety measures announced by the hugely popular gaming platform.

They will also be able to block or report their children's friends, and the platform will provide more information about which games young users are playing. 

The measures will only apply to children who are under the age of 13 and have parental controls set up on their accounts.

The announcements comes after the CEO of Roblox, Dave Baszucki told the BBC that parents should keep their children off the platform if they were ""not comfortable"" with it.

Roblox - the most popular site in the UK for gamers aged eight to 12 - has been dogged by claims that some children are being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games.

However, in his BBC interview, Mr Baszucki stressed that the company was vigilant about protecting its users, with ""tens of millions"" of people having ""amazing"" experiences on Roblox.

Announcing the latest safety features, Roblox's Chief Safety Officer Matt Kaufman said: ""These tools, features, and innovations reflect our mission to make Roblox the safest and most civil online platform in the world.""

A spokesperson for the regulator, Ofcom, said the measures were ""encouraging"", but added ""tech companies will have to do a lot more in the coming months to protect children online"".

In preparation for the interview with Mr Baszucki, the BBC found a range of game titles with troubling titles that had been recommended to an 11-year-old on the platform.

They included games such as ""Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP"" and ""Shoot down planes…because why not?""

Parents with linked accounts of children who are 12 and under can now block such titles if they are uncomfortable with them. 

They will also be able to go further in managing who their children are friends with. 

They can already view their child's friends list - now they can block or report people on that list, preventing them exchanging direct messages.

Messaging between children had already been restricted in measures announced in November last year.

Additionally, parents will now be able to see the top games their child played on Roblox over the last week and how long they spent in each one.

Sally, from the north of Scotland, told the BBC last month that her nine-year-old daughter was groomed on the platform in December last year. Despite reporting it to Roblox, she never received a response.

She welcomed the announcements as a ""start"", but said Roblox ""needs to do better"".

She added: ""What's missing is proper authentication of users. How does the company know that users are who they say they are - how will perpetrators be traced when grooming keeps happening?""

Roblox highlighted to BBC News its community standards, which have a zero-tolerance policy for the exploitation of minors.

Amir from Leeds told the BBC last month that his 15-year-old son is ""addicted"" to Roblox, and can use the site for up to 14 hours a day.

He has welcomed the changes announced today for younger users, but wants the platform itself to do more and target the availability of inappropriate games for children.

Kathryn Foley's nine-year-old daughter Helene is a regular on Roblox. Kathryn ensures her daughter avoids games where other players would talk to her, or friend requests.

Ms Foley told BBC News: ""I know I will absolutely be using the game blocking feature, and to see how long my daughter spends on particular games - and also if she is playing games I didn't know she played.""

Kirsty Solman has spoken with the BBC about how Roblox has helped her 13-year-old son Kyle - who has ADHD, autism and severe anxiety - with social interactions.

She said: ""These all sound fantastic especially the experience blocking, as a concern is the type of games our children are accessing.""

Roblox has also announced the expansion of its voice safety AI (artificial intelligence) model, to help moderate voice chats between players, with the feature now available in seven additional languages.

Meanwhile, Roblox has outlined changes to its advertising model, with players to be paid in-game currency to watch adverts on the platform.

Blanche Hoschedé-Monet has barely been acknowledged in art history. But not only did she help her stepfather Claude, she created her own fine works – often of the same scenes as him.

Haystack at Giverny, Poplars at the Water's Edge, Morning on the Seine. These painting titles bring only one name to mind – the great Claude Monet, whose flickering evocations of light and atmosphere are the cornerstone of Impressionism. 

But while Monet painted these very subjects, the paintings belong to the oeuvre of his stepdaughter, and subsequently daughter-in-law, Blanche Hoschedé-Monet (1865–1947). She learned to paint at Monet's shoulder, and exhibited and sold her work through the leading Parisian dealers of the time. Her finest paintings suggest an artist of such flair that you wonder how she has slipped from history's grasp. 

A new exhibition and accompanying monograph – the artist's first – seeks to restore her reputation. Blanche Hoschedé-Monet in the Light at The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art, Indiana, brings together 40 of her paintings, along with sketchbooks, photographs and letters, establishing not just her impressionist credentials, but her role as Monet's assistant and companion on plein air painting expeditions – the only one of his children, blood-related or otherwise, whose passion for painting mirrored his own.

The difficulty of extracting Hoschedé-Monet from history has been compounded by the fact that few of her 300-ish works are in public collections. In her native France, the former Musée Municipal de Vernon, near the Normandy village of Giverny, where the Monet family lived for decades, holds the largest number – eight paintings and one pastel – and was valiantly renamed the Musée Blanche Hoschedé-Monet last year to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Impressionism. Meanwhile Paris's Musée d'Orsay (widely regarded as the best collection of Impressionist art) has only a further two – neither of which, at the time of writing, is on display.

There are no Hoschedé-Monet paintings in British public collections at all, and in the US, only one, The Weeping Willows on the Lily Pond at Giverny (c 1893-7) at the Columbus Museum of Art in Ohio. The Indiana exhibition is the artist's first solo show on US soil, in fact, and an indication that her reputation is finally growing.

""While Hoschedé-Monet's work remains relatively unknown and somewhat underappreciated in the marketplace, it is clear that she is gaining more recognition with collectors and institutions,"" says Julia Leveille, head of modern-day auctions at Sotheby's New York."" Strong prices have been set for her work at auction recently, and we are excited to see where her market goes from here.""

Hoschedé-Monet was the daughter of Eugene Hoschedé, a wealthy businessman and connoisseur of avant-garde painting. Édouard Manet, Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, Mary Cassatt and of course Monet were regular guests at his beautiful homes on the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and at his estate at Montgeron, on the city's edge. 

Hoschedé-Monet was 11 when she first met Claude Monet in 1876. The then-35-year-old had been commissioned by her father to paint a quartet of panels for the dining room at Montgeron. Hoschedé was an important early patron of Monet's – in fact, it was he who bought Impression, Sunrise (1872), the painting that gave Impressionism its name. 

""I remember his arrival. He was introduced to me as a great artist, and he had long hair,"" she recollected in autobiographical notes she wrote towards the end of her life, which her brother Jean-Pierre then used as a basis for a personal and intimate account of Monet's life and family at Giverny. "" That struck me, and I immediately had sympathy for him because we could tell he was fond of children.""

In her notes, Hoschedé-Monet also singled out Monet's Springtime or The Reader (1872) as the painting she loved most in her father's considerable collection. She was ""deeply struck"", she said, by the touches of sunlight on the skirt of the woman – Monet's first wife, Camille.

The six months Monet spent at Montgeron in 1876 led to a magnificent set of paintings that includes the much-loved Turkeys and Willows at the River's Edge, though they did not remain in Hoschedé's possession for long. Dire financial pressures forced him to sell most of his collection in 1878, along with both of his homes. 

More like this:

• How Monet changed the way we see London

• The overlooked painting that unlocked Impressionism

• The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel

Monet brought Hoschedé, his wife Alice and their six children (Marthe, Blanche, Suzanne, Jacques, Germaine, and Jean-Pierre) to live with him, Camille and their two sons Jean, 11, and newborn Michel, at his home in Vétheuil, northwest of Paris.

Camille's health deteriorated post-partum, however, and in 1879 she died, after which Alice and Monet entered into ""what we believe was a domestic partnership,"" says Haley Pierce, co-curator of Blanche Hoschedé-Monet in the Light. But they didn't marry until 1892, after Hoschedé had passed away. [Hoschedé] had been estranged from the family for a while at this point.""

Juvenalia aside, the earliest works in the show date from 1882, when the newly-merged family rented a house in the seaside resort of Pourville, near Dieppe. Monet's painting Cliff Walk at Pourville features the then-17-year-old Hoschedé-Monet with her elder sister, Marthe, and Hoschedé-Monet filled a sketchbook with her own sunlit views.  

In spring 1883, Monet moved the family to Giverny, where Hoschedé-Monet began to paint in earnest. Delighted by her enthusiasm, he began taking her with him on his outdoor painting expeditions. According to the biography of Hoschedé-Monet's which her brother Jean-Pierre also wrote, ""she helped him in all circumstances… transporting his canvases and easel as well as her own. She did it all with the help of a wheelbarrow, following elusive paths, across fields and meadows sometimes drenched in dew. That was the case, for example, with his morning views of the Seine. Here again, she would help her stepfather by taking up the oars of the canoe.""

Monet also suggested exhibitions she might enjoy. In 1891, for instance, he asked his friend Gustave Geffroy, an influential critic, to obtain a pass for her to the Salon of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and later that year, took her with him to dine at the home of the British artist James McNeill Whistler in London (they were visiting her brother Jacques in Lymington) and to see the famous Peacock Room that Whistler created for shipping magnate Frederick Leyland's mansion near Hyde Park.     

Monet's 1887 painting In the Woods at Giverny: Blanche Hoschedé at Her Easel with Suzanne Hoschedé Reading, confirms that he and Hoschedé set up their easels within spitting distance of each other, or even, if she is the figure in the white dress at an easel in John Singer Sargent's oil sketch, Monet in his Bateau Atelier (also 1887), squashed together in the floating studio which Monet designed to paint while drifting along the river.

Unsurprisingly, then, Hoschedé-Monet's paintings often share her mentor's visual vocabulary: Shadows on the Meadow (Giverny, the Ajoux plain) matches his Spring Landscape at Giverny (1894) for instance, and The Small Grainstacks (Les Moyettes) (c 1894) his Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (1890-91). Julie Manet, daughter of the impressionist Berthe Morisot and Manet's brother Eugène, would also describe two of Blanche's paintings of ""trees reflected in the Epte [that] are very like Monsieur Monet's painting"" while visiting Giverny in 1893. 

As Hoschedé-Monet's great-nephew, the art historian Philippe Piguet, further explains, ""her touch is more emphatic, out of concern for capturing what she saw on her canvas rather than what she felt"" – meaning that Hoschedé-Monet's paintings can be described as more solid or direct in their rendering and composition, and less atmospheric, as compared to Monet. She also preferred to paint a subject from varying viewpoints, he adds, rather than, as Monet did, at different times of day.

Consider her painting Haystack at Giverny alongside the Monet Haystacks at Giverny (1893) that was sold at Sotheby's last year. ""They're at the same or approximate location, but she has distinctly chosen a different view,"" says Pierce. ""Her painting is also more solid. She has less interest in the quality of atmosphere, and more in really getting down her subject. Her compositions are very well thought out.""

By now, Hoschedé-Monet was blooming. The previous year, the US artist Theodore Robinson noted in his diary: ""I saw some things by Mlle Blanche, she has improved greatly since I saw her work last – a spring landscape, sold to [the Chicago millionaire] Potter Palmer quite charming."" Her rapid progress excited Monet, too: away in Norway in 1895, he wrote to Alice, ""I can't wait to see what she has done in my absence, especially from what you tell me"". 

In 1897, Hoschedé-Monet married Jean and they moved to Rouen, but returned to Giverny at weekends. For a time, her upward trajectory continued – in 1905, she began exhibiting with the Salon des Indépendants in Paris, and in 1907 the Salon de la Société des Artistes Rouennais – but when Jean had a serious fall in 1912, she gave up painting to care for him.

When Jean died two years later, Hoschedé-Monet returned to live at Giverny, where the recently widowed Monet was panic-stricken that he was losing his sight and finding it difficult to work. Her decision delighted his friends. Geffroy told her he was ""happy for him and happy for you. Your mutual misfortune makes your reunion stronger.""

Her reassuring presence gave Monet the strength he required to begin the monumental compositions of water lilies that occupied his final years and which he hoped would create ""the illusion of an endless whole"". The exhibition includes a photograph of him working on these ""Grand Decorations"", as he called them, with Hoschedé Monet at his side. 

Monet's close friend, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, later wrote that she had prepared the canvas grounds, but Hoschedé-Monet refuted the claim. ""Contrary to what has been said and what has been written, I didn't make a brushstroke on [Monet's] canvases. It would have been a sacrilege."" She also described Monet's death in 1926: ""It was the soul of the house who left… Everything here was illuminated by him.""

With Michel's approval, Hoschedé-Monet remained at Giverny for the rest of her life, caring for the house and studio, and tending to Monet's beloved gardens. She resumed painting again almost immediately, and in 1927 had her first solo exhibition at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris. Critics took great interest in her renaissance, with one from newspaper Le Peuple proclaiming her ""more than the heiress of a great name"".

Impressionism lost its grip on the art world almost as soon as Monet died, but Hoschedé-Monet always remained loyal to her mentor's painting style. We might see her as the comet's tail of that hugely influential artistic movement, though perhaps her greatest contribution to it was her steadfast support. ""Without her, Claude Monet would have lived in an isolation that would have killed him,"" wrote the art dealer René Gimpel. ""It was she who kept him alive for us, posterity must not forget her.""

Blanche Hoschedé-Monet in the Light is at the The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art, Indiana until 15 June.

On Tuesday morning, Rajesh Nayak stepped outside the firecracker warehouse in India's Gujarat state where he worked to drink water.

Some moments later, an explosion ripped through the building, killing 21 people, including Mr Nayak's brother.

""Some of my other relatives have also died. I had come to work here only from Sunday,"" a distraught Nayak, who is in hospital with minor injuries, said.

Most of the victims were from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh state and had recently come to work at the warehouse, located in an industrial estate in Banaskantha district in Gujarat. 

Their families lived in huts close to the building and some of them were also killed from the force of the explosion. Banaskantha District Collector Mihir Patel told BBC Gujarati that the victims included four women and three children.

It's not clear yet what caused the explosion, but officials are investigating if firecrackers were being manufactured illegally at the warehouse.

""Primary information has been received that the explosion took place when firecrackers were being made here,"" said Mr Patel, the collector.

India has strict rules around firecracker production but these are often not enforced strongly on the ground. Accidents are regularly reported, especially at illegal factories.

The incident in Gujarat came a day after eight people were killed in an explosion at an illegal firecracker factory hundreds of miles away in West Bengal state.

Police in Gujarat have arrested two men, owners of the warehouse, in connection with the explosion and are searching for one more person. A special investigation team has been set up to look into the incident.

Banaskantha district police chief Akshay Raj Makwana said a preliminary investigation showed that aluminium powder was stored in the building.

""This powder is non-explosive but flammable and easily available in the market. We are investigating the supply chain and how the accused sourced such material,"" said Mr Makwana.

Mr Patel told reporters that the building had been registered as a warehouse for storing firecrackers, but its licence had expired in December. When a team went to inspect the area in March, he said, the building was empty. 

When BBC Gujarati reached the area on Tuesday, the air smelt strongly of sulphur.

The explosion caused extensive damage, destroying the warehouse and a wall of the adjacent factory. Large concrete slabs were thrown up to 300ft away.

Mr Makwana, the police chief, said a slab in the building collapsed, trapping workers underneath. 

The powerful blast also destroyed surrounding huts and killed some family members of the workers.

A sanitation worker told BBC Gujarati that he carried out four bodies on stretchers from the site. ""My heart sank when I saw a child's body,"" he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is from Gujarat, has expressed his condolences to the victims' families and announced financial assistance.

US Senator Cory Booker has broken the record for the longest speech ever delivered in the Senate. 

The New Jersey Democrat's marathon address, a symbolic protest against President Donald Trump, in which he warned of a ""grave and urgent"" moment in American history, ended after for 25 hours and four minutes. 

Although it was not a filibuster - a speech designed to obstruct passage of a bill - it held up legislative business in the Republican-controlled Senate. The rules for such speeches require a speaker to remain standing and forgo bathroom breaks.

The previous record was held by Republican Senator Strom Thurmond who, when still a Democrat in 1957, spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act.

Booker said he would speak for as long as he was physically able as he began his address at around 19:00 local time on Monday evening. He concluded at 20:06 on Tuesday.

The 55-year-old, who is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the chamber, filled some of the time reading letters from constituents, who said they had been harmed by President Trump's policies.

The former presidential candidate also ran out the clock by discussing sports, reciting poetry and taking questions from colleagues.

Booker, who is African-American, spoke of his roots as the descendant of both slaves and slave-owners. 

""I'm here because as powerful as he was, the people are more powerful,"" he said, referring to segregationist Thurmond's record-setting address 68 years ago.

As he reached the milestone, Booker said he was going to ""deal with some of the biological urgencies I'm feeling"". 

He was able to give his jaw much-needed respite during the speech by taking questions from colleagues, including Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.

The Democratic Party, currently out of power in the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, rallied behind Booker's symbolic act of protest.

Booker's speech is also the longest in the Senate since a 21-hour filibuster in 2013 by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, against Obamacare.

Cruz told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a filibuster is a challenging physical feat. 

For his own protest, he wore comfortable shoes and tried to drink as little water as possible - an approach he described as ""nothing in, nothing out"".

Nigeria's president has appointed Bayo Ojulari - a former Shell executive - to lead the state-owned oil company, as part of sweeping reforms aimed at cleaning up the sector dogged by allegations of corruption, pollution and decades-long inefficiency.

Mr Ojulari was picked in a ""crucial"" overhaul of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), the presidency said on Wednesday.

It added that the restructure - which also involved replacing the entire board - was necessary to drive economic growth in Africa's biggest oil exporter.

President Bola Tinubu's time in power has seen a series of economic shocks, with food and fuel prices rocketing over the past couple of years.

The NNPC has also been under financial strain - last September it admitted to having debts of around $6bn (£4.5bn).

In its statement announcing the NNPC restructure, the presidency said Tinubu wished to boost Nigeria's oil output and refining capacity.

Despite its massive oil sector, most of the crude oil Nigeria produces is exported, while it has to import the fuel it uses from other countries because it does not have enough oil refineries.

The cost of fuel used to be subsidised by the government - until this was removed by President Tinubu when he came to office nearly two years ago.

He said the country could no longer afford to pay for it, leading the price of fuel to skyrocket. 

The subsidy was overseen by the NNPC and was shrouded in mystery leading to allegations of massive corruption.

However, oil marketers say the price at which fuel is imported is still higher than the pump price, leading many to believe that the government is still subsiding the cost of fuel through the NNPC, which it has denied. 

Nigeria's oil production slowed to less than a million barrels per day in 2023, news agency AFP reported.

Tinubu's administration wants to hit two million barrels per day of oil by 2027 and three million barrels per day by 2030.

Tasked with executing this mission, Mr Ojulari replaces former NNPC boss Mele Kyari.

Some oil industry experts have expressed confidence in his appointment owing to his decades of experience in the oil sector, however they fear the challenges he inherits.

""The commission is indebted. Even the NNPC Ltd does not know how much it owes,"" energy expert Henry Adigun told the BBC.

""Its accounting has been marred by corruption and inefficiencies. I think it's bloated. It's a case of the more you read, the less you understand.""

Mr Ojulari joined Shell Nigeria 1991 and rose to become managing director, a position he held for six years. He left the company in 2021 to join the investment advisory organisation BAT Advisory and Energy Company.

He then moved to Renaissance Africa Energy Company last year.

Along with trying to boost Nigeria's oil production, Mr Olujari will no doubt also seek to improve the NNPC's poor public image.

For many years, under previous governments, much of the company's profits never reached the treasury. 

It is only in the last five years that the NNPC has been publishing accounts.

The new board appointed by President Tinubu comprises oil industry experts with decades of experience. 

The hope is the team will be free of politics and restore transparency in the country's murky oil sector.

""If he doesn't succeed, it would be because of government interference,"" Mr Adigun added.

Every time Donald Trump has mentioned his plan to levy massive tariffs on imports into the US, there has been a widespread assumption that they will be delayed, watered down or rowed back.

Today, he will reveal in the White House Rose Garden not just how serious he is about ""the most beautiful word in the dictionary"", but effectively call time on decades of economic globalisation.

And it is still possible that he will do this by launching the equivalent of a salvo of ballistic missiles into the global trading system, with a universal tariff on all imports into the USA.

The option of a 20% universal tariff is the only way to get to some of the massive revenues of trillions of dollars claimed by some of his advisers.

World braces as Trump set to announce sweeping tariffs

In recent days, President Trump has been adamant that the tariffs will be ""reciprocal"" and the US will be ""nicer"" to its trade partners. 

That doesn't rule out wide-scale imposition of tariffs at 10 or 20%, if, for example, the US deems that Value Added Taxes are tariffs. 

It is possible that countries could be very broadly bracketed into different levels of a basically universal tariff. As one G7 negotiator told me at the weekend, ""it all comes down to President Trump"".

A system such as this, with equivalent global retaliation, would see the UK economy shrinking by 1%, enough to wipe out growth and lead to pressure for tax rises or spending cuts. 

The total cost around the world could, according to an Aston University Business School study, be $1.4 trillion (£1.1tn), as trade is diverted, and prices rise.

In industry, there is some expectation that the European Union will target US tech companies. There could be quite the contrast should the UK choose not just to hold back on retaliation, but offer a significant tax cut to US big tech.

Trade wars are hard to win, and easy for everyone to lose. 

A universal tariff of 20%, or its equivalent, would be a historic hit to the global trading system.

There is something bigger here, however. As the Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that ""rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things"". 

As that has not panned out, especially in the case of China, the US is moving away from this world.

If the US overplays its hand in alienating its allies today, China will be waiting. The hit to US business in Europe, for example, could be offset by cheaper electronics, clothes, and toys from the East arriving in the UK and lowering prices, diverted from the US market.

What starts later today is designed not just to reshape America, and trade, but the way the world itself has been run.

The car maker's sales slide has been attributed to competition and controversy around its boss.

The decision comes nearly two months after the Trump administration first sought to drop the case against Eric Adams.

US President Donald Trump is expected to announce a new round of tariffs later on Wednesday.

The Environment Agency (EA) has launched a comprehensive review into shipments of waste tyres from the UK to India.

Last week, BBC File on 4 Investigates heard that millions of these tyres - sent for recycling - were actually being ""cooked"" in makeshift furnaces, causing serious health problems and environmental damage.

The pressure group Fighting Dirty has threatened legal proceedings against the EA over what it called a ""lack of action"" over the issue of tyre exports.

The EA has asked the group to wait until its own review is complete, and it has also asked File on 4 Investigates to share the evidence from its investigation.

The UK generates about 50 million waste tyres (nearly 700,000 tonnes) every year. According to official figures, about half of these are exported to India, supposedly to be recycled.

But BBC File on 4 Investigates revealed that some 70% of tyres exported to India from the UK and the rest of the world are being sent to makeshift industrial plants, where they are ""cooked"" in order to extract steel, small amounts of oil as well as carbon black - a powder or pellet that can be used in various industries.

Conditions at these plants - many of which are in rural backwaters - can be toxic and harmful to public health, as well as potentially dangerous.

In January, two women and two children were killed in an explosion at a plant in the western state of Maharashtra, where European-sourced tyres were being processed.

A BBC team visited the site and saw soot, dying vegetation and polluted waterways around. Villagers complained of persistent coughs and eye problems.

Following the broadcast, the Department for the Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) told BBC File on 4 Investigates that officials and lawyers within the EA were ""very keen"" to investigate the claims made in the programme, including any potential criminal activity.

In a letter seen by the BBC, lawyers for the EA said that our investigation would be carefully considered as part of a review it has launched into its approach to waste tyre shipments.

They added that the EA has been working to engage the relevant environmental authorities in India on this issue and is taking steps to arrange a delegation to meet with officials later this year.

Fighting Dirty founder Georgia Elliott-Smith, who has been in correspondence with the EA over this issue since 2023, said it was a ""major victory"" for the group and that ""the government must stop turning a blind eye to the illegal and immoral activity"".

Tyrannosaurus rex ancestors and their plant-eating dinosaur prey would have congregated to drink water from a lagoon in what is now Scotland, new research suggests.
    


            Despite the fact that the carnivorous megalosaurs would have hunted the long-necked sauropods 167 million years ago, newly identified footprints show that both types of dinosaur would have milled around the edge of the lagoon, much like how modern-day animals congregate at watering holes, researchers from the University of Edinburgh say.
    


            Lead study author Tone Blakesley, a Masters graduate at the Scottish university, told CNN that he was among a small group that recognized an initial three footprints at the remote site on the Isle of Skye's Trotternish Peninsula in 2019.
    


            “It was very exciting,” said Blakesley, who went on to document a total 131 footprints for the study, using a drone to take thousands of overlapping images of the site before producing digital 3D models of the footprints using specialist software.
    


            Because of their flatness, the footprints had previously been mistaken for fish resting burrows. Blakesley explained that this was due to the fact that there would have only been a thin layer of sand on top of a much harder layer of mud, leaving only a shallow indentation.
    


            They are preserved in “exquisite detail,” he added.
    


            The footprints were made 167 million years ago, during the Middle Jurassic period, an important time in dinosaur evolution, but little rock remains from the era, Blakesley said.

            As a result, the site in northern Scotland provides invaluable insights into the life of dinosaurs at the time.
    


            In stark contrast to the generally cold and blustery weather on Skye today, the area would have had a warm and humid subtropical climate during the Middle Jurassic, with a series of lagoons on a huge river estuary, Blakesley said.
    


            The sauropods were “big lumbering giants which would have plodded along,” said Blakesley, who used the spacing of the footprints to estimate that they would have moved at speeds of around 2.5 kilometers per hour (1.55 miles per hour), around half the average human walking speed.
    


            They would have used their long necks to feed from the top of conifers and other trees, he added.
    


            The “jeep-sized” megalosaurs, which are a kind of theropod, would have moved around the lagoon on their way from one area of vegetation to another — in search of prey or to seek shelter and rest — traveling much faster, at around 8 kilometers per hour (5 miles per hour), he said.

            “It would have been quite a surreal place to stand in,” Blakesley said.
    


            But while the dinosaurs would have been in the area at around the same time, the footprints do not demonstrate any evidence that they interacted by the lagoon, and it is unlikely that they would have been side by side.
    


            “That would be a disaster for the sauropods if that happened,” he said. “The temptation for lunch… would have been too much for the theropods.”
    


            Blakesley continues to work at the site and discovered more dinosaur footprints on Tuesday, he told CNN.
    


            “There's more footprints to find,” he said, adding that he is also investigating other dinosaur track sites on Skye as well as in the south of England.
    


            The study was published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One.

            Audrey Hale felt no hatred against anyone at the school where the former student gunned down six people. In fact, the 28-year-old relished fond memories of The Covenant School and wanted “to die somewhere that made her happy,” Nashville police said.
    


            “Hale bore no grudge against the school or staff” and considered them to be “‘innocents' and victims on par with herself,” the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said.
    


            The revelation came in a trove of new details released in a report by Nashville police Wednesday – two years after Hale randomly slaughtered three teachers and three 9-year-old children at the private Christian school.
    


            Shortly after the massacre on March 27, 2023, Hale was gunned down by police – leaving myriad questions about the inexplicable killings that remained unanswered until now.
    


            After conducting interviews and reviewing Hale's digital devices, online accounts, artwork and writings, detectives managed to piece together the killer's preparation and motivation behind the gruesome attack.
    


            Hale attended The Covenant School in the early 2000s, from kindergarten through fourth grade. The former student denied suffering any emotional or physical abuse during this period, investigators said in the report obtained by CNN.
    


            “She felt safe and accepted at The Covenant and made friends with other students,” the report said. “She considered her family life during this time as happy, with a positive relationship with both of her parents and her brother.”
    


            But more than 16 years after leaving the school, Hale targeted the beloved alma mater “due to the notoriety she would obtain” and “because she had a personal connection to the school from earlier in her life and felt she had to die somewhere that made her happy,” police said.

            While the killer “identified as a male and used he/him as preferred pronouns,” Nashville police said, “Under Tennessee law, a person's gender identity must correspond with their biological sex or with information present on their certificate of live birth.”
    


            As a result, authorities described Hale as a female in their 40-plus-page report.
    


            Investigators discovered Hale left “material behind intentionally to be found and analyzed,” including “her detailed plan to commit carnage in a school, with timelines, diagrams, etc.,” Nashville police said.
    


            “The publication of the writings would serve three purposes: to document her struggles with her mental health; to show how … her mental health conditions helped her ‘to execute the perfect plan'; and to show others like her how to best plan and carry out an attack,” the investigative report states.
    


            In the days leading up to the attack, Hale started to transfer writings onto a thumb drive so “they could be found and studied,” the report states.
    


            “Notoriety was the motive,” the report summary says. “It is known that Hale, and other mass shooters, studied material from Columbine High School prior to committing their attacks.”
    


            Hale rated other mass shooters based on the number of people they murdered and considered those who killed a low number of people to be “amateurs” who weren't worthy of respect, Nashville police said. But Hale “made exceptions for those offenders with documented mental health histories showing they had serious mental health diseases or disorders, as she believed they were ‘too sick' to formulate an effective plan to kill an adequate number of victims.”
    


            Hale wanted books, documentaries and movies “to be made about her life and her attack,” police said. The killer also wanted “her firearms to be placed in a museum” and “wanted her bedroom to be left as it was when the attack occurred as a memorial to her.”
    


            Investigators determined Hale was sane, but evidence suggested worsening anxiety, depression and rage.
    


            Before the massacre, Hale's parents assisted their child “with obtaining mental healthcare despite them not being legally required to do so,” police wrote.
    


            But “Hale chronicled that she withheld information from providers to prevent her from being stopped,” authorities said.

            The killer often wrote about the level of secrecy needed to carry out the attack, including withholding information from the therapist, taking steps to delete browsing history, and concealing guns and ammunition, police said.
    


            Even though Hale's “disappointments in relationships, career aspirations, and independence fueled her depression, and even though this depression made her highly suicidal, this doesn't explain the attack,” police said.
    


            “As Hale wrote on several occasions, if suicide was her goal then she would have simply killed herself,” the report states. “Throughout the writings and videos, Hale frequently commented that her death needed to matter and be remembered.”
    


            Investigators learned Hale felt chronic loneliness and disappointment.
    


            “She felt abandoned and ignored by those she longed to befriend and engage with romantically, which angered her more than anything else,” the report says.
    


            “She believed that by simply committing suicide, she would be quickly forgotten and not even worthy of a footnote in history. She craved the notoriety Harris and Klebold attained following Columbine.”
    


            Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were the teen gunmen who killed 13 people at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. The 1999 massacre has been cited as an inspiration for other school shooters in the decades since.
    


            Hale focused on how the Columbine killers' “documented mental health history and societal views were similar to her own and how the notoriety they achieved following their deaths led them to becoming ‘gods,'” Nashville police said.
    


            Hale “sought to become a ‘god' like Harris and Klebold by killing victims nobody would forget: children.”
    


            Like Harris and Klebold, Hale “longed for her name and actions to be remembered long after she was dead,” police said.
    


            “She openly acknowledged none of those she would kill were guilty of anything and denied any personal motivation for targeting them,” Nashville police wrote. Instead, the killer “felt their deaths were necessary to give her death meaning.”

            “She wanted her mental health to be a prominent topic of discussion and debate,” investigators said.
    


            “Most disturbingly, she wanted the things she left behind to be shared with the world so she could inspire and teach others who were ‘mentally disordered' like her to plan and commit an attack of their own.”
    


            Yet Hale “often complained how she didn't know enough about the mental health history or motives of most mass killers, as nothing was publicly documented regarding their struggles,” the reports says.
    


            Nonetheless, “Hale felt she would be a failure if she killed less than 10 people during the attack,” the report said.
    


            Hale took a guided tour of the school in 2021, claiming to be “an alum who wanted to reminisce about her time in elementary school,” the report said. In reality, Hale was casing the school and “discreetly photographed different locations,” police said.
    


            CNN has reached out to the school for comment.
    


            Less than two years after that visit, Hale burst into her beloved former school wielding an assault-style rifle and gunned down six people. The victims included three children, a substitute teacher, a custodian and the head of the school.
    


This is a developing story and will be updated.

            With a 25% tariff about to hit every imported car, many Americans are wondering whether it's better to buy or lease a vehicle before tariffs go into effect, or wait to see how things will play out.
    


            The simple answer is to buy now, experts say, especially if you are already in the market for a car.
    


            “The riskiest thing to do is to hold off and see what happens,” Aaron Bragman, the Detroit bureau chief of automobile shopping site Cars.com, said to CNN. “We're fairly confident that costs and prices are going to go up — that's just the basic economics of tariffs.”

Car prices will surge by thousands of dollars because of Trump's tariffs. It'll happen before you expect it



            President Donald Trump last week announced a 25% tariff on all cars imported from foreign countries, including Canada and Mexico. The tariff could raise prices between $5,000 to $15,000 per vehicle, depending on the make and model, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. And the Trump administration could further send the automobile industry spiraling if it follows through with its plan to enact tariffs on car parts — since even American-made cars import a significant portion of their parts from Canada and Mexico. That could further slam car buyers if enacted.
    


            For example, cars from Ford, Chrysler, GM and Honda are expected to face cost jumps from $4,000 to $10,000, according to a February estimate from Michigan-based think tank Anderson Economic Group. Electric car buyers are expected to pay at least $12,000 more per vehicle.
    


            Some Americans have already begun rushing to dealerships to buy vehicles before price increases take place. And for those who haven't made their way to the dealership, there's still been a spike of interest in car-buying.
    


            Traffic on both Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader.com increased by 30% between last Wednesday, the day tariffs were announced, and Monday, compared to the same time period the year prior. And traffic on the hundreds of dealership sites run by Cox Automotive jumped by 20%.
    


            Jenni Newman, Cars.com's editor-in-chief, also noted that no vehicle currently on a dealer lot should have a tariff fee until after the tariffs go into effect on April 3.
    


            Bragman did note, however, that finding a deal on a dealer lot could get increasingly difficult because dealers know that prices are going to be higher on incoming inventory.
    


            Inventory is decent, especially compared to the era supply chain shortages during the Covid-19 pandemic. Customers shouldn't have a hard time finding well-stocked dealer lots, but as time goes on, there may be fewer deals and incentives.
    


            Besides the initial tariff costs, automakers may also start cutting production, simply because  demand is likely to wane, Bragman said. That could cause dealer inventory to thin out and prices to increase.
    


            As prices go up, more people will likely look into buying used cars. However, the inventory for used cars is already low, because automakers didn't produce as many cars during the pandemic and those cars would be in the used marketplace today, Autotrader.com executive editor Brian Moody told CNN. A spike in demand would only exacerbate the used car market.
    


            And for those looking for affordable vehicles, there could be even fewer options available if tariffs continue. There are only 27 new vehicles on the market priced under $30,000, and four have already been discontinued, Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating wrote in a note on Friday.
    


            Though Keating said cheaper models made up 13% of all vehicles sold in the US in 2024, those models are often the first to get cut. Most cheaper cars, even for American brands like Ford, are not made in the United States and are instead assembled in countries with cheaper labor, like Mexico.
    


            But customers will have about a year to prepare if a car model is discontinued, Moody said, because manufacturers usually have a backlog in their inventory.
    


            What isn't guaranteed is when exactly those price increases will take place. Even so, automakers are worried about the volatility, Bragman said.
    


            “Frankly, if you can find a vehicle, you can find something that you can afford, we're telling people to go for it,” Bragman said.

            Nintendo on Wednesday announced the Switch 2, the sequel to its wildly successful hybrid game console from over eight years ago. Now, the video game company must prove that it can follow one blockbuster hit with another, a goal it's struggled to achieve in the past.
    


            Nintendo revealed concrete details about the Switch 2 for the first time on Wednesday, including specifics about its hardware. The company had in January only revealed the Switch 2's design and compatibility with previous-generation games. The Switch 2 will launch on June 5 for $449.99, which is significantly higher than the first-generation model's $300 price.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is coming. Here's how to get ready for preorders



            The first Switch popularized the idea of a game console that can be played on your living room television or on an airplane, prompting a wave of PC gaming brands to follow suit.  The Switch 2 is the company's biggest launch since the first generation arrived in 2017 — and will likely dictate the next decade for the one of the world's biggest and most recognizable video game companies.
    


            Nintendo will also have to navigate challenges that didn't exist in 2017: tariffs on Chinese goods that could impact production and shipping costs, increased competition from mobile games and pressure to live up to the pandemic-era highs the gaming industry experienced in 2020. And above all else, it's making a big bet that Nintendo fans are willing to spend $450 on what is essentially a revamped version of its current console rather than an entirely new take on gaming.
    


            “The Switch being so successful is a double-edged sword,” said Mat Piscatella, executive director for video game coverage at market research firm Circana. “On the one hand, a huge, great positive base to build on. On the other hand, a huge target to try to reach in terms of the same level of success.”
    


            The Switch 2 iterates on its predecessor with several new features, including a Game Chat function that lets gamers communicate with other players in real time. It also allows users to share certain games with other Switch owners while playing in person even if the other player doesn't own the title.
    


            The Joy-Con controllers, which attach to the Switch when it's being used as a handheld console or can be used separately, will now support computer mouse-like functionality. The console will also work with a separate camera so that players can see each other on screen when using Game Chat and other features.
    


            Nintendo is relying on these changes to differentiate the Switch 2's gameplay from that of its predecessor. During its Nintendo Direct live stream, the company showed how players will be able to slide the Joy-Con controllers across a surface like a computer mouse to move the character on screen in different ways.
    


            Nintendo has also given the console hardware a much-needed upgrade. The Switch 2 has a larger 7.9-inch display compared to the original Switch's 6.2-inch screen, and the Joy-Con controllers now snap to the console magnetically, which should make them easier to attach or remove from the console. The console has eight times as much storage as its predecessor and the dock supports 4K resolution, two changes that should give players more room to store games and improve how they look when connected to a compatible TV.
    


            Nintendo also announced new games from some its most well-known franchises, including Donkey Kong and Mario Kart. Nintendo's titles are a key reason gamers continue to buy Nintendo consoles.
    


            But the company also focused a big portion of its presentation on non-Nintendo games, which is critical because Nintendo is traditionally best known for its own exclusive titles, and doing so could help the company draw in new audiences.
    


            Such games include Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Hogwarts Legacy and Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 and 4.
    


            The Switch 2 is the successor to the world's third-best gaming console of all time. Nintendo has sold roughly 150 million Switch units, putting it just behind Nintendo's handheld DS console from 2004, which sold 154 million units, according to Nintendo's website. Sony says it has sold 160 million units of its PlayStation 2 console since it launched in 2000.
    


            Nintendo has had a hard time replicating success in the past. For example, Nintendo only sold about 13 million Wii U devices after its November 2012 release, just a sliver of the roughly 101 million Wii consoles that were sold in the generation prior. And roughly half as many units of the 3DS, a version of the company's DS portable console with a 3D screen, were sold compared to the original, which remains Nintendo's best-selling console.
    


            But Nintendo is straying from its usual playbook.
    


            It sometimes brands new consoles as different products in the same family, as was the case with Wii U and the Wii. Other times, it has launched new consoles with fresh names that introduce new ways to play games, such as the Wii, which succeeded the GameCube and popularized motion controls, and the Switch, which functions as both a portable and at-home console.
    


            This time, it's positioning the Switch 2 as a direct sequel, an updated version of the same device.
    


            “This would be the first time we're really seeing, though, something like the Switch to Switch 2,” said Piscatella. “It's such a straight transition, especially for Nintendo that's always tried to mix in some new different things.”
    


            But even with a new playbook, the company may have trouble recreating its success from 2020, when the video game industry saw a surge in engagement during pandemic lockdowns. Nintendo's profit jumped more than 400% for the quarter that ended in June 2020.
    


            Console usage has largely been flat since then due to a post-pandemic downswing, among other factors, according to Piscatella and Anders Christofferson, global head of Bain & Company's video gaming sector.
    


            Sony and Microsoft's most recent consoles have already been out for several years, so gamers may not be as engaged with them as when they first purchased them, and there's more competition from mobile games. Mobile gamers account for most of the gaming market's growth, according to a report from Bain & Company.
    


            “It's no secret that video games have gone on a pretty challenging journey over the past couple of years,” said Christofferson.
    


            Then there are President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, that could raise the prices of electronics, though more than half of Nintendo devices imported to the US now come from Vietnam and Cambodia, according to the Financial Times. But it's not just about production: High inflation and price increases from tariffs would make it more difficult for consumers to spend on nonessential items like game consoles. That's especially true considering the Switch 2 is notably more expensive than the $300 original, putting Nintendo's new console in closer competition with Valve's Steam Deck, which starts at $399 and is designed to play PC games on the go.
    


            “In terms of just general market behavior, we are seeing consumers shift their wallet to everyday spending categories like grocery, housing (and) insurance,” said Piscatella. “…It's an incredibly difficult environment to try to sell things in.”
    


            But Nintendo's robust library of beloved characters and games could give it an edge against these difficulties. The company's approach to gameplay is also more cinematic and focused on solo adventures compared to most mobile games, says Michael Pachter, a managing director for Wedbush Securities covering entertainment software. This could help differentiate it from phone-based competitors.
    


            Pachter likens the situation to the dining industry; while McDonald's may draw in more customers than a premium steakhouse, the latter provides a superior and unique experience. In Pachter's comparison, mobile games are analogous to McDonald's, while Nintendo is the steakhouse.
    


            “McDonald's restaurants probably each outgross the best steakhouse in town, and there (are) thousands of them,” he said. “But it's not as good an experience.”

Follow:


            The Supreme Court sided with a former commercial truck driver Wednesday who was fired after failing a drug test he said was caused by a “CBD-rich medicine” in a decision that could make it easier to sue companies under organized crime laws.
    


            Douglas Horn sued the manufacturers of a CBD product called “Dixie X” that the companies proclaimed included no THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Horn took the product to manage debilitating pain after a serious accident, but he later failed a drug test and was fired. The Supreme Court's decision will allow Horn's case to move forward in lower courts.
    


            Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote the opinion for a 5-4 majority that included both liberal and conservative justices.
    


            “When all is said and done, Medical Marijuana is left fighting the most natural interpretation of the text – that ‘injured' means ‘harmed' – with no plausible alternative in hand,” Barrett wrote. “That is a battle it cannot win.”
    


            Horn sued under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, Act, a 1970 law targeted at organized crime that also authorizes civil lawsuits – and allows plaintiffs to collect triple damages – for harm to their business or property. The question for the Supreme Court was whether Horn's loss of employment qualified as a business harm.
    


            Medical Marijuana, Inc., and other companies involved in distributing Dixie X, argued that Horn's injury was a personal one – and therefore not a business or property harm as required in the law. Congress, the companies argued, didn't intend for Americans to be able to collect triple damages under the RICO law for run-of-the-mill injury claims.
    


            Horn sued in the Western District of New York in 2015, alleging in part that Medical Marijuana Inc. engaged in mail and wire fraud. The district court ruled against Horn, but the New York-based 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals allowed his suit to move forward.
    


            The companies appealed to the Supreme Court.
    


            Allowing Horn to sue, the companies said, would vastly expand the number and type of “civil RICO” lawsuits permeating through federal courts. Concern over a flood of new lawsuits appeared to resonate with several of the court's conservatives during the oral arguments in October.
    


            But other justices suggested during arguments that a loss of employment would fall under what most Americans view as an ordinary definition of “business.”
    


            “If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?” Justice Elena Kagan, a member of the court's liberal wing, asked the lawyer for the companies.
    


            The law, Kagan said, “just says if you've been injured by a RICO violation in your business, which includes your employment, then you're entitled to threefold damages.”
    


            President Richard Nixon signed the federal RICO Act in 1970 to give prosecutors more power to go after the heads of organized crime families. Several states have enacted their own versions of the law. In Georgia, prosecutors were attempting to use a state RICO law to prosecute Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results there.

Follow:


            Even by Nikola Jokić's absurdly lofty standards, his performance on Tuesday night was something special.
    


            The three-time NBA MVP put up 61 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, but it wasn't enough to prevent the Denver Nuggets from losing 140-139 to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a double overtime classic.
    


            Jokic's 61 points are the most scored in a triple-double in NBA history and mark a new career-high, while it is also the most points any player has scored in a game this season.
    


            The Serbian star also becomes only the second player in NBA history after Wilt Chamberlain in 1963 to lose a game when posting at least 50 points in a triple-double, per ESPN.
    


            It's not even the first time Jokić has recorded a historic triple-double within the last month, after posting the first 30-20-20 triple-double in league history against the Phoenix Suns in early March.
    


            After the game, Nuggets coach Michael Malone called Jokić “Superman.”
    


            A wild finale to the contest concluded with Nickeil Alexander-Walker hitting two free throws to seal the win for Minnesota.
    


            Moments earlier, Russell Westbrook had stolen the ball back for Denver but then missed an open layup. Westbrook then fouled Alexander-Walker on a three-point attempt at the other end as the game clock expired, giving the Timberwolves guard three free throws to win the game.
    


            Alexander-Walker made the first two and then deliberately missed the third to ensure the clock expired again with just 0.2 seconds remaining.
    


            “I feel awful for him,” Malone said of Westbrook. “When you put forth that kind of an effort, you put so much into and you don't get the result, I just feel bad for our guys.
    


            “It never comes down to who deserves to win, but our guys did everything within their power to win that game and it didn't go our way.
    


            “We've just got to regroup and find a way to get one tomorrow night.”
    


            Jokić's record-breaking night further emphasized his MVP credentials and again highlighted the frequent lack of help he endures on a consistent basis. Though fellow Nuggets star Aaron Gordon did add 30 points, eight rebounds and five assists on the night in the losing effort.
    


            For the Timberwolves, Anthony Edwards scored a team-high 34 points to go with 10 rebounds and eight assists, while Julius Randle and Alexander-Walker had 26 points each as six Minnesota players hit double figures.
    


            The Timberwolves have now won three straight to climb to the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference as they bid to avoid the play-in, while the Nuggets remain the No. 3 seed.
    


            Steph Curry cooked up a vintage performance on Tuesday, dropping 52 points as the Golden State Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies 134-125.
    


            The 37-year-old hit 12 three-pointers in the contest. It is the 15th 50-point game of Curry's career, tied for sixth all time with Damian Lillard.
    


            Curry's final line was 52 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, five steals and a block, and he surpassed Jerry West to move up to 25th in the NBA's all-time scoring charts.
    


            “Fifty-two points with people draped all over him, all game long,” Kerr said, per ESPN. “I've been watching this for 11 years, and actually longer before I became his coach.
    


            “You get a real sense of just the magnitude of his talent. The guy is amazing to watch.”
    


            Jimmy Butler added 27 points, six rebounds, four assists and three steals for the Warriors, who have won three straight and jump ahead of the Grizzlies into the No. 5 seed in the West.
    


            Ja Morant had a team-high 36 points for Memphis, whose slide down the standings continues with a fourth consecutive loss.

    Editor's Note:  This story contains description of sexual assaults.



            To reach Diane Swick's rural California homestead, you have to drive 70 miles north of Los Angeles and traverse a rocky road best suited for an ATV. Few come here without a good reason.
    


            But a man dubbed the “Pillowcase Rapist” had no trouble getting to Pearblossom — in fact, he got a court-mandated escort to the community nearly two weeks ago. Christopher Hubbart, 73, is now Swick's next-door neighbor.
    


            “We are women and that's his prey,” Swick said. The 61-year-old had heart surgery last year and says she was depressed when she first heard Hubbart was coming.
    


            “Now I'm mad,” she told CNN from her back porch, within eyeshot of Hubbart's rented home. “I've never had to lock my doors for the 28 years I've lived here, and now that's been taken away from us.”
    


            Hubbart's release has reignited a debate over how the state should handle the most extreme sexual offenders in its custody, including those like Hubbart who attacked again after serving multiple sentences.
    


            Hubbart was charged with dozens of sexual assaults dating back to the 1970s and spent seven years in a state mental hospital after pleading guilty to one count of rape and three counts of sodomy.
    


            Court records show he was released in 1979 to an outpatient program in the San Francisco Bay area, and “within a few months” sexually assaulted about 15 women after breaking into their homes.  He would “bind the victim's hands, cover her head, and commit forcible sex acts,” court records allege.
    


            In 1982, he was sentenced to 16 years in prison and released in 1990 after serving about half of his time.  Once free, he raped again.  “Within a two-day period, Hubbart attempted to sexually assault one woman and actually assaulted another,” court records state. His parole was revoked, and he was returned to prison.
    


            Until last month, he was held in a state hospital awaiting placement into a home as part of California's “Sexually Violent Predator (SVP) Conditional Release Program.” It's designed for predators in state hospitals “to safely transition back to being a fully functional member of the community,” according to a fact sheet from the California Department of State Hospitals (DSH).
    


            “I have no problem with someone who has gone to prison, done their time and paid their debt to society,” said Linda Adams, who lives across the street from Hubbart. “But how can you pay a debt for (that many) rapes? It's not something that just goes away.”
    


            Rachel Purcell lives down the street from Hubbart's new home and says she now walks with bear spray.
    


            “Any male Caucasian that I see coming up to me, I'm going to be wary,” she told CNN. “And if he gets within 30 feet of me, he's getting sprayed.”
    


            It's not just residents who are irate. Politicians have voiced opposition since last September when the Antelope Valley was identified as Hubbart's next home by Liberty Healthcare, a state contractor that oversees SVP cases.
    


            “A man who has admitted to raping over 40 women and suspected of raping dozens more is not fit for release or community reintegration at any level,” wrote Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger in a letter to the Superior Court. The district attorney's office also opposed the move.
    


            Hubbart did not respond to a letter sent from CNN prior to his release from the Coalinga State Hospital. Outside his new home, a representative from Liberty declined to submit CNN's request to speak with Hubbart. A Liberty spokesperson referred all questions to DSH.
    


            Hubbart is now neighbor to a mix of about two dozen suburban-style homes and dusty ranches, flanked by the San Gabriel mountains, where many enjoy the peace and pitch black of a country night. “It's the whole reason I moved up here,” Purcell said.
    


            But that isolation now seems like a liability, she admits, as the nearest law enforcement station is at least 15 miles away.
    


            “Half of us don't have reliable cell (service) at all,” Adams agreed. “Our landline goes out frequently, and there's no urgency in repairing it. If (Hubbart) approached my property none of my neighbors would hear me if I needed assistance.”
    


            Neighbors here don't dispute that Hubbart's release happened through proper legal channels. The 1996 Sexually Violent Predator Act allows for treatment and rehabilitation for SVPs who have completed their prison sentence. In Hubbart's case, a Santa Clara County court first deemed him suitable for release from a state hospital in 2014. Placement into his current home has been approved and overseen by a Los Angeles County judge — even if some residents scoff at the process.
    


            “The judge said he would make the decision based on whether he would put (Hubbart) across from his own family,” Adams said. “So, he must hate his family.”
    


            The case played out in a mental health court in hearings livestreamed to the public. However, the case files remain sealed.
    


            In its fact sheet on the SVP program, DSH says a court can only approve conditional release when it has determined “the individual would not be a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is not likely that the person will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior due to the person's diagnosed mental disorder if under supervision and treatment in the community.”
    


            It continued that treatment was given after someone seeking release had completed their criminal sentences. “In making its determination, the court generally considers treatment records, assessments, and information provided by mental health professionals and forensic evaluators.”
    


            Others who live in this high desert section of the county say what stings even more is that this is the third sex criminal released to this region.
    


            The Los Angeles County District Attorney, Nathan Hochman, accused the state of treating the Antelope Valley as a “dumping ground” for sexually violent predators.
    


            DSH countered, telling CNN it must legally consider factors like proximity to schools and parks, which “significantly limit(s)” suitable options to “outside of dense, urban areas.”
    


            In an email, the department said: “DSH does not place individuals designated as SVP into the community until a court has determined it is safe and appropriate to do so.  It is also the court that ultimately approves the placement location.”
    


            That's not good enough for Mary Jeters, a local resident who operates the Facebook page “No SVP's in the Antelope Valley.”
    


            “My frustration has gone past the point where I'm going to scream about it,” Jeters said. She disputes the notion that rural areas equate to safer locations.
    


            “These SVPs are not going to be restricted to being in their house all the time,” Jeters said. “They bring them out to go to doctors' appointments, they go shopping. People don't know who they're standing next to in line, you don't know who's talking to your daughter.”
    


                    I just don't trust that he can be trusted
                


                    Mary Jeters, resident
                


            Citing patient privacy laws, DSH declined to speak specifically about Hubbart's case but confirmed there are several safeguards at the home of any released prisoner placed in the community. They include 24-hour GPS monitoring, covert surveillance, unannounced and scheduled home visits, and advanced approval — including routes of travel — for scheduled outings.
    


            “The close supervision is there to guard against the individual committing any new crimes,” DSH said in a statement.
    


            Security cameras are also visible at Hubbart's home and residents say a private security guard has been posted at the home around the clock.
    


            “They're just watching that we don't bother him,” said Purcell, a neighbor, adding her view was that “the security is to protect him, not to keep him locked up.”
    


            Jeters said some residents have been the target of restraining orders by other former inmates in the area who felt harassed, but that the goal is to protest peacefully. She held a public gathering Sunday on vacant land next to Hubbart's new home.
    


            “I just don't trust that he can be trusted,” Jeters said, noting this is Hubbart's second attempt at a successful release in the area.
    


            The first came in 2014, but two years later Hubbart was sent back to a state hospital for violating his release terms. DSH declined to confirm details of the violation, again citing privacy laws.
    


            In 2016, Hubbart's former parole officer praised his return to custody.
    


            “Christopher Hubbart is a waste of a human heart,” John Bays, then retired, told the Los Angeles Times. “He never should have gotten out.”
    


            Swick, the next-door neighbor, wonders why this time would be any different. She feels her community is being piled on and that in addition to safety issues, the neighborhood has been affected by depressed property values in the wake of 2020's Bobcat fire.
    


            “We lost our barn, we lost a tractor, we lost a shed. And I would much rather go through a fire than what's going on here,” Swick said. “This sense of not knowing what's going to happen. Nobody wishes a fire on anybody, and I feel this is worse.”
    


            Los Angeles County is not the only area dealing with backlash from the SVP conditional release program. Just over 160 miles to the south of the Antelope Valley, in Borrego Springs, residents were informed in February by the sheriff that another rapist, Alvin Ray Quarles, was being placed in their community. Quarles served time for multiple rapes in the San Diego area dating back to 1988.
    


            “Now that there's two or three sexually violent predators in that small community of 3,000 people, with one grocery store … how do you protect that community?” asked Republican state Senator Brian Jones of San Diego.
    


            Jones believes sex criminals should only be released to structures such as prefab homes on state-owned and operated land.
    


            “Outside the perimeter of a state institution… in a fire camp, any other area that the state is responsible for the safety and condition of that area,” Jones said.
    


                    Very few make it through, it's hard to do
                


                    Michael Aye, lawyer who has represented some sexual predators seeking release
                


            But in its statement to CNN, DSH said placing released inmates on state-run property would not fulfill its legal obligation under the SVP Act to “safely reintegrate” individuals so they can achieve “unconditional release.”
    


            Jones wants to change the law. He's proposing two state Senate bills that would ultimately force DSH to sign off on placement locations selected by its contractor, Liberty. “It basically puts it back on the desk of the director of state hospitals and holds (them) accountable,” Jones said.
    


            The bills passed a Senate public safety committee Tuesday though a similar proposal from Jones failed last year. Among the opposition at a committee hearing last April was lawyer Michael Aye, who has represented sexual predators seeking release through the system. He worried a new law would stifle the program altogether.
    


            “Our fear is that… giving the director (of state hospitals) the responsibility, that no one will be authorized release,” Aye told the state Senate standing committee on public safety. “Very few make it through, it's hard to do.”
    


            Those that do make it through to community placement have first spent “an average of 12 years or more” working toward successful completion in the hospital, DSH told CNN.
    


State audit figures also show fewer crimes committed by people in the SVP release program. Of 56 participants in the last 21 years, two were convicted of criminal acts. The same audit found that of 125 sex criminals released unconditionally by the courts, 24 were convicted of subsequent crimes.
    


            Jones, the state Senate minority leader, says the state's current procedure ignores common sense.
    


            “It's not fair for a community, a mom and a dad, a grandma and grandpa, to live next door to these monsters, and be responsible for keeping an eye on them,” he said. “That's the state's job and the state should do its job.”

They're silent on SignalGate","https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/02/politics/hillary-biden-warrants-signalgate-trump-kfile/index.html","Wed, 02 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

            When Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden faced intense scrutiny for their handling of classified material, top officials now serving in Trump's Justice Department and FBI demanded criminal probes and severe penalties.
    


            Yet today, those same figures – including Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, and DC interim US Attorney Ed Martin – have all declined to publicly criticize senior Trump officials who used Signal to share military attack plans in a chat that inadvertently included a journalist.
    


            The Trump administration has denied any classified information was discussed in the text messages released by The Atlantic about plans to bomb rebels in Yemen, but CNN reported that information shared in the chat was highly classified at the time it was sent.
    


            Bondi, now the country's highest ranking law enforcement official, vigorously defended the officials who participated in the Signal chat, including Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and suggested it was unlikely their actions would be investigated criminally. But previously, Bondi argued that both Clinton and her aide Huma Abedin needed to face charges after emails that contained classified information were found on the computer of her ex-husband, former Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner.
    


            “This has everything to do with the security of our country,” Bondi said in January 2018 on Fox News. “When you have the top-secret security clearance that Huma Abedin had – you know when you send those emails that you are violating the law, and there is no objective law enforcement officer in this country that would not charge her based on that. Alright? No one.”
    


            Bondi repeatedly framed the Clinton email investigation as a clear-cut legal issue in her appearances on Fox News reviewed by CNN's KFile, saying that “we live in a nation of laws” and that Clinton “jeopardized our national security.”
    


            On Thursday, Bondi defended the officials in the Signal chat, saying the chat included “sensitive information, not classified.”
    


            “What we should be talking about is it was a very successful mission,” she told reporters. “If you want to talk about classified information, talk about what was at Hillary Clinton's home, the classified documents in Joe Biden's garage.”
    


            A spokesperson for the Department of Justice said Bondi's public comments last week “speak for themselves.”
    


            Similarly, Patel has previously called for harsh prison sentences for leaking classified information.
    


            “A leak of classified information — that's a federal offense punishable by, I think, over a decade in prison, off the top of my head,” Patel said in 2021 when discussing leaks to the media during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. “It's a pretty serious matter. But no one's been prosecuted for a leak of classified information.”
    


            In another interview in September 2024, Patel criticized the decision by special counsel Robert Hur not to charge Biden for allegedly mishandling classified documents.
    


            “They let the guy off the hook,” he said of Biden, who was investigated over classified documents found at his private residence in Delaware. “They just said it doesn't matter … you've made up a new legal standard that applies to exonerate him and to not even charge him.”
    


            Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and now the FBI's second-in-command, frequently also accused Democrats and the Biden administration of mishandling classified information and using encrypted apps to avoid accountability, including the app Signal.
    


            “This was a travesty of justice, there's no other way to look at it,” Bongino said regarding the recommendation by former FBI Director James Comey not to charge Hillary Clinton in 2016. “And having worked as a federal agent for 12 years of my life and as a local police officer before that, I'm intimately familiar with the elements of crimes, the elements of an investigation, and good, solid, packaged federal cases. This thing was in a bow.”
    


            “What Jim Comey laid out yesterday that for 15 minutes what Mrs. Clinton did — in the federal system, you can put forth information in a complaint or an indictment. If that went in front of a judge and jury, he could have convicted Mrs. Clinton just on that information alone.”
    


            In since-deleted tweets, Bongino also took aim at Abedin and questioned if former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe may have used unsecure communications to handle classified information.
    


            “Either Huma knew she was sending classified emails to Weiner, & was doing so illegally, therefore she committed a crime. Or, Huma didn't know sending classified emails was a crime & had absolutely no business having access to the Clinton political machine & insiders in our govt,” he said in a deleted tweet from late 2017.
    


            In a February 2018 tweet Bongino wrote, “Here's the next shoe to drop -> was Andy McCabe using secure comms to send/receive classified information? Someone should check on that.” McCabe, a longtime target of Bongino's, was a part of the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
    


            Patel and Bongino have not publicly criticized the officials involved in the Signal chat. The FBI declined to comment to CNN.
    


            Ed Martin, now the acting US Attorney for the District of Columbia and the official who could oversee any prosecution related to the Signal chat, has previously taken a hardline stance on the handling of classified material.
    


            “When he took them he couldn't have done anything but broken the law, period,” Martin said on his radio show in 2023, referring to Biden's possession of classified documents.
    


            In a 2018 tweet, Martin wrote that “almost anyone” who leaked classified information would “go to jail.”  And in 2024, he asked, “Was it not a crime for a vice president to remove top secret and classified documents from the White House and store them unsecured in his garage…?  If it's not, it should be.”
    


            Martin has not commented publicly on whether the Signal chat warrants investigation.
    


            A spokesperson for the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia declined to comment to CNN.

            The United States has approved the potential sale of 20 F-16 fighter jets to Manila, giving the key US ally in the Indo-Pacific a major upgrade to its air force just days after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed to counter “China's aggression.”



            The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced the proposed sale of the F-16s and related equipment, worth an estimated $5.58 billion, in a statement on Tuesday.
    


            “This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a strategic partner that continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in Southeast Asia,” DSCA said.
    


            The announcement comes less than a week after Hegseth visited the Philippines, his first trip to Asia as defense chief, and said Washington will enhance its military alliance with Manila as it aims to “reestablish deterrence” to counter “China's aggression” in the Indo-Pacific region.
    


            On Wednesday, China cautioned Manila on the deal.
    


            “Any defense and security cooperation that the Philippines engages in with other countries should not target or harm the interests of any third party, nor should it threaten regional peace and security or escalate tensions in the region,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.
    


            “As for who is fueling the flames, who is provoking military confrontation, and who is turning Asia into a powder keg, we believe that regional countries can see the situation clearly.”
    


            The Philippines has been on the front lines of China's increasingly aggressive posture in Asia. Beijing seeks to assert its claim over the bulk of the South China Sea, despite an international ruling denying its sovereignty over the waterway.
    


            Hegseth said Friday the US would deploy additional advanced military capabilities to the US ally for joint training, enhance interoperability for “high end operations” and prioritize defense industrial cooperation.

            In its statement, DSCA said Manila had requested to buy 16 F-16Cs – single-seat, single-engine fighter jets – and four F-16Ds, dual-seat jets that are usually used for training purposes.
    


            The F-16s are the block 70/72 newest variant of the workhorse military warplane, which entered service with the US Air Force in the late 1970s.
    


            Manufacturer Lockheed Martin says the new F-16s are the world's most advanced fourth-generation fighter, touting a “structural service life” of more than 12,000 hours.
    


            The F-16s, along with advanced avionics, radar and weaponry included in the deal, are a significant upgrade to the Philippine Air Force's fighter fleet. Currently, it has only 12 South Korean-made FA-50 jets, a lighter ground attack and fighter jet.
    


            The F-16s have a top speed of more than 1,500 miles per hour, Lockheed Martin says, about 350 mph faster than the FA-50.
    


            Speaking alongside Philippine Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro on Friday, Hegseth called the US-Philippine relationship an “ironclad alliance, particularly in the face of Communist China's aggression in the region.”
    


            The Trump administration has vowed to “truly prioritize a shift” to the Indo-Pacific, Hegseth said, with the “recognition that for the 21st century to be a free century, America needs to stand alongside our allies and partners shoulder to shoulder.”
    


            The American military presence in Asia is seen by allies as a critical counterbalance in a fractious region where China has been rapidly expanding its military might and a belligerent North Korea has been empowered by closer ties with Russia.
    


            Trump has repeatedly questioned the structure of US military alliances and whether the US was getting enough out of such partnerships and basing arrangements, including those in Asia where tens of thousands of troops are stationed in sprawling bases in Japan and South Korea.

            Val Kilmer, a movie star who throughout his career proved he was up for any task, from playing a cocky naval pilot to wearing the Batman suit, died on Tuesday, according to his daughter Mercedes Kilmer, who released a statement to the New York Times and the Associated Press. He was 65.
    


            The cause of death was pneumonia, Mercedes Kilmer told the media outlets.
    


            CNN has reached out to representatives for Kilmer and his family for comment.
    


            Kilmer had recovered from a 2014 throat cancer diagnosis that required tracheotomy surgery that altered his voice.
    


            In recent years, Kilmer largely stepped away from acting, but made a brief return to the craft in “Top Gun: Maverick,” the sequel to the original film that launched him and that cast into superstardom.
    


            The sequel, which released in 2022 after a two-year delay, deftly blended Kilmer's off-screen health issues into the film's story, with his Tom “Iceman” Kazansky, the smug but cool rival to Tom Cruise's Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, ultimately succumbing to an ailment in the film.
    


            As one of Kilmer's last film roles, it concluded one of the most interesting — and bankable — careers in Hollywood history.
    


            Born and raised in California's San Fernando Valley, Kilmer studied at the Hollywood Professional School before heading to New York where, at 21, he became the youngest student at the time to be accepted into Julliard School's drama department.
    


            He began his film career in the 1984 comedy “Top Secret!” and acted in several movies throughout the ‘80s including his breakout role in 1986's “Top Gun.”
    


            Then came an incredible streak of successful genre-spanning movies in the 1990s: A superhero film (with 1995's “Batman Forever,” in which he played the Dark Knight), a Western (1993's “Tombstone,” where he played Doc Holliday), a biopic (1991's “The Doors,” in which he portrayed Jim Morrison) and a crime film (Michael Mann's 1995 masterpiece “Heat”).
    


            One of his less lucrative pursuits included his one-man stage show “Citizen Twain,” about Mark Twain, whose work he deeply admired and referenced frequently in interviews.
    


            In all, Kilmer's films made nearly $2 billion at the global box office, according to Comscore.
    


            Throughout his career, the roles that Kilmer played possessed an iconic quality while underscoring the way his career frequently zigged at the point where it could have zagged, to his detriment if not in terms of the quality of the work but how Hollywood and the public perceived him.
    


            Kilmer enthusiastically agreed to star as Batman, for example, but quickly soured on that experience, passing on another sequel in favor of the forgettable reboot “The Saint.”
    


            Similarly, he took a role in “The Island of Dr. Moreau” in order to play opposite Marlon Brando, only to clash with director John Frankenheimer (exchanges caught on camera) and be disappointed when a detached Brando periodically refused to come to the set, letting a stand-in take his place.
    


            He reflected on his career and life in the 2021 documentary “Val” through interactions he had videotaped with his family and on film sets for years, including behind-the-scenes footage from “Tombstone” and the “Top Gun” cast partying after hours (“We were all at the start of our careers,” Kilmer recalled).
    


            At the time, Kilmer was recovering from throat-cancer surgery, so his son, Jack, read the actor's written narration — sounding uncannily like his father.
    


            Kilmer frequently expressed about his desire to work with certain directors, showing audition videos that he shot for parts he failed to land in “Goodfellas” and “Full Metal Jacket,” seeking to impress directors Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick, respectively. He also documented his laborious auditioning and preparation process for portraying Jim Morrison in “The Doors.”
    


            Ultimately, in the documentary, he expressed excitement about all that would come next.
    


            “I have behaved bizarrely to some. I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed. I am blessed,” he said in the movie.
    


            Kilmer identified as a Christian Scientist, opening up in interviews about his faith and beliefs.
    


            In a 2020 interview with Men's Health, the actor spoke about illness through the lens of his faith.
    


            “Well, something that was reaffirmed to me – on such a level, it was almost shocking – was a sense of universal love, a kind of power and a different sense of love. It was coming into my consciousness and my body while I was at the hospital,” he said, going on to add that he didn't “believe in death.”
    


            Kilmer is survived by his two adult children, Jack and Mercedes, from his marriage to “Willow” co-star Joanne Whalley.
    


            The younger Kilmers are both actors and have been involved in projects with their father.
    


            Kilmer co-starred with Mercedes in the 2020 film “Paydirt” and, in addition to voicing the “Val” documentary, Jack lent his voice to his father's character on the Disney+ “Willow” series.
    


            Despite his condition at the time of the 2021 documentary, and tragedies that included the death of his younger brother at age 15, Kilmer spoke of leading a “magical life.”
    


            He said that he found the silver lining even as he endured fans asking for the same “Top Gun”-inspired “You can be my wingman” autograph over and over at Comic-Con.
    


            “I feel grateful,” he said.

Follow:


            The Pentagon has sent at least six B-2 bombers – 30% of the US Air Force's stealth bomber fleet – to the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, in what analysts have called a message to Iran as tensions once again flare in the Middle East.
    


            The deployment comes as US President Donald Trump and his defense chief Pete Hegseth warn of further action against Iran and its proxies, while US jets continue to attack the Tehran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.
    


            Images taken by private satellite imaging company Planet Labs on Tuesday show the six US bombers on the tarmac on the island, as well as shelters that could possibly conceal others. Tankers and cargo aircraft are also at the island airbase, a joint US-British base which is 3,900 kilometers (2,400 miles) from Iran's southern coast.
    


            Planet Labs images from Sunday show four B-2s and six support aircraft on the Diego Garcia tarmac.
    


            Without mentioning the B-2s directly, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell confirmed that the US military is sending additional aircraft and “other air assets” to the region to improve America's defensive posture in the region.
    


            “The United States and its partners remain committed to regional security … and are prepared to respond to any state or non-state actor seeking to broaden or escalate conflict in the region,” Parnell said.
    


            CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton said the placement of the highly sophisticated, $2 billion warplanes was a signal to US adversaries.
    


            “The deployment of these B-2s is clearly designed to send a message – perhaps several messages – to Iran,” said the former US Air Force colonel.
    


            “One of them could be a warning to cease supporting the Houthis in Yemen.  Another message the Trump administration might be sending to Iran is that it wants a new nuclear deal (to replace the ‘bad' deal Trump withdrew the US from in his first term) and if Iran doesn't start to negotiate with the US the consequences could be the destruction of Iran's nuclear weapons program,” Leighton said.
    


            Trump began ramping up military action against the Houthis in mid-March, with airstrikes that killed at least 53 people and wounded almost 100 others in Yemen, according to the Houthi-run Health Ministry.
    


            Strikes have continued since, as Houthis threaten US warships in the region, in attacks that the militants say are in solidarity with Gaza as it faces bombardment by Israel, a key US ally.
    


            In disclosures that caused a major controversy for the Trump administration, Hegseth shared sensitive information last month on pending military strikes against Houthi militants on an unsecured group chat with top national security officials — a chain to which The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was accidentally added.
    


            Trump, in a Tuesday post on his social media platform Truth Social, on Tuesday threatened more could be coming.
    


            “Stop shooting at U.S. ships, and we will stop shooting at you. Otherwise, we have only just begun, and the real pain is yet to come, for both the Houthis and their sponsors in Iran,” Trump posted.
    


            Trump has also been pushing Iran to make a deal over its nuclear capabilities, saying on March 19 that he would give Tehran two months to come to an agreement or face the consequences.
    


            There “are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal, because I'm not looking to hurt Iran,” Trump told Fox News last month.
    


            But Iran this week rejected any direct negotiations.
    


            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “continues to make clear that, should Iran or its proxies threaten American personnel and interests in the region, the United States will take decisive action to defend our people,” Parnell said.
    


            Military aviation analyst Peter Layton told CNN that the six-bomber deployment to Diego Garcia is likely focused beyond possible Houthi targets.
    


            “Six is a serious number. For Houthi deeply buried targets, two or maybe three, but six B-2s is a major effort,” Layton said.
    


            Leighton, the CNN military analyst, said the B-2 can carry the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, “a 30,000-pound bomb that is designed to destroy what we would call hardened and deeply buried targets.”
    


            “Such targets would potentially include Iranian nuclear and weapons storage facilities,” the former US Air Force officer said.
    


            Layton, the aviation analyst, noted that the six B-2s likely represent the entire deployable fleet of the aircraft.
    


            “I assume there are one or two at home for training and another few standing nuclear alert. Rest in maintenance,” said Layton, a former Royal Australian Air Force pilot and now visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute.
    


            Parnell, the Pentagon spokesperson, said the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, which has been carrying out strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen, will stay in the region through this month, though its deployment there was scheduled to have ended at the end of March.
    


            CNN also previously reported that the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier would move to the Middle East after finishing an exercise in the Asia-Pacific region.
    


            Hegseth “also ordered the deployment of additional squadrons and other air assets that will further reinforce our defensive air-support capabilities,” Parnell said. It's unclear what squadrons or assets will be moving to the region.
    


            Parnell added that the Nimitz Strike Group is deploying to the Western Pacific “to preserve our warfighting advantage in the Indo-Pacific.”
    


            Leighton said that the presence of the B-2s on Diego Garcia would be noted across  Asia.
    


            “It's unlikely the deployment of six B-2s to Diego Garcia is meant to deter actions by other powers, such as China or Russia, but they are surely taking note of this deployment as well. Of course, we can't forget that Iran is an ally of those two countries,” he said.

Follow:


            A new lawsuit filed Tuesday accuses tech billionaire Elon Musk and his super PAC of failing to pay canvassers who helped his pro-Trump political operation in 2024.
    


            During the final stretch of the 2024 campaign, Musk and his political group, America PAC, offered $100 to registered voters in battleground states who signed a petition supporting free speech and gun rights, and another $100 for every additional voter they convinced to sign the petition. The goal was to excite conservative voters and elect then-candidate Donald Trump – who narrowly won Pennsylvania in November.
    


            A man from the Philadelphia suburbs – who filed the lawsuit anonymously because he says he fears retribution – claims he is owed $20,000 for gathering signatures in Pennsylvania. The lawsuit claims there could be at least another 100 victims of Musk's alleged breach-of-contract. This comes after press reports about allegedly late or missing payments from the super PAC around the presidential election.
    


            “This lawsuit is about keeping promises,” the man's attorney, Shannon Liss-Riordan, told CNN. “He was expecting to be able to pay his bills because of this promise.  He was pounding the pavement during the campaign because Elon Musk asked him too. He believed in Elon Musk.”
    


            America PAC spokesman Andrew Romeo denied wrongdoing when asked about the lawsuit.
    


            “America PAC is committed to paying for every legitimate petition signature, which is evidenced by the fact that we have paid tens of millions of dollars to canvassers for their hard work in support of our mission,” Romeo said in a statement, adding that the pro-Trump group is “committed to rooting out fraud” and has “the right to withhold payments to fraudsters.”
    


            In the past week, Musk revived his 2024-style giveaways in Wisconsin, offering $1 million cash prizes as he campaigned in support of a conservative candidate for the state Supreme Court.
    


            Musk and his super PAC denied claims during the 2024 campaign that their cash giveaways to voters violated federal laws against vote-buying or that it operated an illegal state lottery.
    


            The Justice Department warned the super PAC in October about its $1 million sweepstakes for registered voters. And the Philadelphia district attorney, a Democrat, tried and failed in state court to get the daily giveaways shut down because, he claimed, it was an unlawful operation.
    


            Liss-Riordan, who filed the latest lawsuit Tuesday in Pennsylvania federal court, has previously sued X, the Musk-owned social media platform formerly called Twitter, in a case about Musk's takeover of the company. She was also involved in an unsuccessful effort to remove Trump from the 2024 ballot in Massachusetts because of the US Constitution's “insurrectionist ban.”

            Two close associates of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been remanded in custody for three days, following their arrest on Monday by Israeli police in connection with an investigation into suspected unlawful ties between the senior aides and Qatar, a case that has become known as QatarGate.
    


            An Israeli court on Tuesday extended the initial detention of Yonatan Urich, Netanyahu's closest adviser, and former aide Eli Feldstein by three days, saying their release would disrupt an investigation into their suspected involvement in conducting public relations for Qatar. The judge denied the police's original request for a nine-day detention to conduct their investigation.
    


            In court, the judge stated that a review of the classified materials submitted indicated reasonable suspicion that an American company had contacted one of the suspects to spread negative messages about Egypt, and downplay its role in mediation efforts to release all the October 7 hostages and reach a permanent ceasefire.
    


            Court documents show that Yonatan and Feldstein are suspected by prosecutors to have taken bribes and “worked to transfer messages to journalists in a manner that presented sympathetic articles about Qatar in the media, minimizing Egypt's role as a fair mediator in the deal, while dictating the media agenda.”
    


            The judge declared that a previous gag order on the proceedings had been rendered meaningless because it had been widely disregarded.
    


            Israeli police and courts have so far declined to respond to CNN's requests for exact details of the charges.
    


            CNN has reached out to the suspects' defense attorneys for comment.
    


            The Jerusalem Post's editor-in-chief Zvika Klein was questioned by police on Monday as part of the investigation but the “nature of any allegations against him has not been specified,” the Israeli media outlet said on Tuesday.
    


            Klein visited Qatar last year “at the direct invitation” of the country and wrote a series of articles for the Post following his visit, according to the newspaper.
    


            Israeli outlet Channel 13 had claimed in a report last month that Klein's visit to Qatar had been arranged by Feldstein, which Klein denied.
    


            A Qatari government official told CNN the country had been subjected to “a smear campaign” by people who want to see a continuation of the war in Gaza.
    


            “We will continue our mediation efforts, together with the US and our regional partners, and will not be distracted or deterred by those who actively seek to derail the negotiations and prolong the conflict,” the official said.
    


            Netanyahu also gave testimony on the case to police on Monday, according to a video the prime minister released on his Telegram account. He has claimed the case is politically motivated.
    


            “It's a political investigation, a political hunt, that's all this is, there's nothing else,” Netanyahu said.
    


            Netanyahu has also claimed the investigation is aimed at preventing him from dismissing Ronen Bar, head of the country's internal security service Shin Bet.
    


            The agency is reported to have recently opened an investigation into allegations that members of Netanyahu's office inappropriately lobbied on behalf of Qatar – something his office denies.
    


            Israeli media has recently cited Netanyahu's attempt to disrupt an investigation into QatarGate as his reason for seeking the removal of both Bar and Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara.

            Despite naming on Monday former navy commander Vice Adm. Eli Sharvit as his pick for the next Shin Bet chief, Netanyahu's move to dismiss the current head still faces a legal challenge.
    


            The Shin Bet, which monitors domestic threats to Israel, conducted an internal investigation into the October 7, 2023 attacks that determined the agency had “failed in its mission” to prevent Hamas' deadly assault and kidnapping spree. But it also blamed policies enacted by Netanyahu's government as contributing factors.
    


            Among them, the Shin Bet said, were Qatar's years-long payments to Hamas. Those payments were blessed by Israel, whose government believed it was beneficial to drive a political wedge between Gaza and the West Bank.
    


            Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said the arrest of two of Netanyahu's aides “is a breach of trust, a threat to national security, and a severe harm to Israel's credibility and standing in the world,” warning that “Netanyahu cannot absolve himself of responsibility.”
    


            “If he knew – he is complicit in a terrible failure. If he didn't know – he is unfit to continue serving as the Prime Minister of Israel,” Lapid said in a statement Tuesday.
    


            Another opposition figure, Benny Gantz, also criticized Netanyahu, saying: “The more the ‘QatarGate' investigation advances, the more determined Netanyahu becomes in his battle against the institutions responsible for the investigation. The deeper the investigation – the deeper the subversion.”

            With the pedigree of a person who has seen his share of bust-ups in the boardroom and on the ice, Canadian American businessman Graeme Roustan is blunt about the looming trade war and what it will mean for the two countries he calls home.
    


            “It's totally ridiculous,” says Roustan, a prolific entrepreneur and owner of Roustan Hockey in Brantford, Ontario. “This business here has been in place for 178 years and it's been selling product and trading product with the United States since before Canada was a country. It's just ridiculous to insult your neighbor, and as a dual citizen, Canadian American, I don't understand it from the American point of view either, why would we insult Canadians?”
    


            His wooden hockey stick company is one of the last manufacturers of its kind in North America, based in the proud hometown of the man widely seen as hockey's G.O.A.T. (greatest of all time), Wayne Gretzky, known here as simply, “The Great One.”
    


            Roustan's business, the city, and even the hockey legend himself have all been caught in the crossfire of the trade war declared by US President Donald Trump that from April 2 will see the US impose widespread tariffs against Canada and other once-friendly trading nations.
    


            For Roustan, what the president is calling “liberation day,” feels more like “disaster day.” Business has already been impacted and customers are jittery, he says.
    


            “All these are going to the Miracle on Ice Team USA 45th Anniversary Fantasy Camp,” Roustan says, while holding a red, star-spangled hockey stick in his hand. The stick, he says, needs to be shipped to the US in a hurry to avoid tariffs. “The customer wants this to cross the border as soon as possible because they don't want to get a 25% tax on their invoice.”
    


            While similar concerns are being voiced by many in Brantford's business community, the looming disaster for the town's arguably most famous export is about reputation rather than the bottom line.
    


            Hockey legend Gretzky, who has nurtured a long-standing and very public relationship with Trump and has lived in the US for decades, has been taking flak from his fellow Canadians since Trump first announced he wanted America's northern neighbor to be reduced to the 51st state.
    


            Now, with the looming tariffs deepening the sense of betrayal felt across Canada, many of Gretzky's countrymen are directing and distilling their anger toward their once-untouchable hockey hero.
    


            Words like “Traitor,” “MAGA junkie,” and “sell-out” now proliferate in online rants and news columns. Even in Edmonton where Gretzky won four NHL Stanley Cups, a statue honoring him was smeared with fecal matter, according to CNN affiliate CTV News.
    


            Roustan calls Gretzky a friend, and he is astounded that some would think he would ever be a traitor to his Canadian roots.
    


            “To drop Wayne Gretzky's name into the middle of this,” says Roustan, clearly incredulous, “It's a drive-by assassination of a name, a good quality Canadian name, it's just been just completely ridiculous.”
    


            It started with Gretzky attending an election night party with Trump, a social media post of him wearing a MAGA hat, capped with a happy snap of him and his wife, Janet, attending Trump's inauguration in January. Trump, for his part, boasted he counseled Gretzky to run for Prime Minister of Canada, and then quipped he'd rather see Gretzky as “governor” of Canada as America's “51st state.”
    


            Since then, the Gretzky reckoning has been chronicled in Canada with social media riffs, memes and newspaper editorials.
    


            The pages of Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper have weighed in on much of it, starting weeks ago with opinion columnist Cathal Kelly writing, “He'll show up for any gala dinner, but when his best buddy the president is threatening to annex the country? Oh, you wouldn't believe how busy he is then.”
    


            Kelly wrote again last week, wondering why Canadians are so obsessed with Gretzky, concluding, “What most of these people feel is betrayal. Many countries have a great turncoat in their history. Gretzky has become ours.”
    


            As parents and players headed into the Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre on a recent weekend here in Brantford, passing a triumphant statue of the hockey prodigy lifting the Stanley Cup, the anger and contempt does not square with the devotion and donations Gretzky and his family have made to this community over the years.
    


            Rick Mannen took his seat aside the rink to watch the local Brantford Titans take to the ice.  He says he wishes the hockey legend he still admires would say something to his friend, President Trump.
    


            “He's kind of a voice of Canada, he has been that way in the past and he is now if he chose to do that. So I really would like to see Wayne do that, but I still don't feel any ill against Wayne just because he's a friend of Donald Trump.”
    


            When asked what Mannen wishes Gretzky might tell the president: “I wish he would say to Donald ‘back off and treat Canada as a partner instead of trying to take over.'”
    


            Junior hockey coach Terry Corbin has a different take, saying Gretzky hasn't really been a part of Brantford for a long time.
    


            “He hasn't lived here for how many years. I mean, I almost see him as kind of somebody with dual citizenship, but who has chosen United States of America,” says Corbin.
    


            The highway leading to this gritty, working-class city bears the name of its hockey icon, but the Wayne Gretzky Parkway might as well be a free-trade expressway.
    


            Hundreds of warehouses and manufacturing facilities dot the landscape. The city is a little more than an hour's drive from both Toronto and Buffalo and has become a convenient crossroad for Canadian companies and US subsidiaries.
    


            For Brantford, the recessions of the 1980s and 90s gave way to a thriving business and commuter corridor that led to substantial growth in both employment and income.
    


            A recent Canadian Chamber of Commerce analysis found that Brantford is one of the top five cities vulnerable to American tariffs.
    


            The city's mayor, Kevin Davis, says some businesses here sell up to 80% of what they make in the US, but they also buy many of their raw materials from American factories. He describes Brantford as tough and resilient but he says there is no doubt tariffs will affect livelihoods.
    


            “Our local economy is very intertwined and integrated with that in the US and not just in the auto parts industry. We have a lot of food processing here, plastics, pharmaceuticals, that is the essence of the economy here in Brantford. It's a mutually beneficial relationship with the United States,” he says, adding that it would take the city four to 10 years to reimagine its industrial strategy if tariffs are punishing and long-lasting.
    


            “There'll be industries in Brantford that may shut down, they may reduce production, they may have to retool, and – for a year or two – not be producing much and employing less,” warns Davis. “That'll happen and there will be people in our community that will suffer.”
    


            But, he promises, the city will fight back and bounce back.
    


            “You know, we're nice until we're not. And yeah, if you want a war, then it's a war. But it's a, it's a totally meaningless war from my perspective. I really, frankly don't understand it.”
    


            Many bewildered workers and consumers in this city are already preparing by cutting back on spending and cutting out most American products.
    


            Buying American now seems like an act of treason here. Restaurants are scratching Caesar salads from their menus – they won't buy American romaine lettuce – and alcohol from the US, no wines from California.
    


            “Even in our store, we get asked all the time, you know, are these products local? Have they been made in Canada?” says Ines Kowal of family-owned and operated Uniqpol, a grocery, deli and food processer in Brantford.
    


            Before learning of the tariff threat, Uniqpol invested in a significant expansion that is set to come online in a few months.
    


            Kowal says they're already seeing cautious consumers cut back even on staples like groceries, afraid of the impact tariffs will have on the family budget.
    


            “Unfortunately, it's very difficult to absorb all these kinds of costs, so that will have to eventually be reflected in some of our prices as well,” she says.
    


            Back rinkside at Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre, Karen Robb is at her son's game. She wishes Gretzky would say something to the president but acknowledges, like many here, how much he and his family have already done for the Brantford community.
    


            “I think it's just about, you know, we don't want anybody to get hurt,” says Robb adding that some good has come of this. “The upside is we're thinking more Canadian. We're starting to think a little bit more about Canada, you know, supporting our businesses.”

            Shia LaBeouf is approving the release of a new documentary that lifts the veil on his teaching methods at the “experimental theater company” he founded at the Slauson Rec Center in South Central LA.
    


            The trailer for “Slauson Rec,” released Tuesday, documents intense and revealing interactions between LaBeouf and his students, with LaBeouf seen slamming his fist on a table while shouting profanities.
    


            According to a news release, LaBeouf is not creatively involved in the documentary. When reached for comment, a representative for the actor directed CNN to the statement provided to Vanity Fair, which stated he “fully” supports the project's release.
    


            “I gave Leo (Lewis O'Neil, ‘Slauson Rec' director) this camera and encouraged him to share his vision and his personal experience without edit,” the statement read.
    


            “I am aware of the doc and fully support the release of the film. While my teaching methods may be unconventional for some, I am proud of the incredible accomplishments that these kids achieved. Together we turned a drama class into an acting company. I wish only good things for Leo and everyone who was part of The Slauson Rec Company.”
    


            The doc will “examine power dynamics and control within an experimental theater collective,” according to an official synopsis, and will give audiences a deeper look at the complex relationship that developed between the members and LaBeouf.
    


            The footage used in the documentary was captured by its director O'Neil, a first-time filmmaker and a former member of the theater company, which was in operation between 2018 and 2020.
    


            O'Neil opened up to Vanity Fair about his experience as a member of the theater company, saying that the collective became LaBeouf's “whole life.”
    


            “I mean, for all of us it did,” he said, according to the magazine. “We were there every day, and that pressure really just built and built and built, until you had these moments of explosiveness.”
    


            O'Neil also told the publication that LaBeouf participated in an interview featured in the documentary, and personally gave him the OK to move forward with the project after seeing a rough cut of the trailer.
    


            “I don't think he wanted to take this from me,” O'Neil told the magazine. “We both have a lot of love for each other, and he didn't want to betray that.”
    


            LaBeouf has previously faced allegations of physical and emotional abuse. His ex-girlfriend, singer FKA Twigs, sued LaBeouf in 2020 claiming he was physically and emotionally abusive during their relationship between 2018 and 2019, the Associated Press reported at the time.
    


            LaBeouf denied the allegations. Around the time of the filing, he also told the New York Times in a statement, “I have been abusive to myself and everyone around me for years. I have a history of hurting the people closest to me. I'm ashamed of that history and am sorry to those I hurt.”
    


            A trial date in the ongoing dispute is set for this September, according to publicly available court records.

            Nearly a dozen known students and faculty members at colleges across the country have been detained by federal agents amid the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration, which on college campuses, has taken aim at pro-Palestinian student activists and Israel critics.
    


            Many of those detained have been granted the right to live in the US either as permanent residents or through temporary work or student visas. Their rights, however, have been put into question under new, sweeping immigration orders that some legal experts fear may be used liberally to clamp down on dissent.

            Speaking to reporters Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that under his direction, more than 300 visas –– “primarily student visas, some visitor visas” –– have been revoked. Rubio did not specify how many visas belonged to people tied to the pro-Palestinian movement.
    


            “If they're taking activities that are counter to our national interest, to our foreign policy, we'll revoke the visa,” Rubio said.
    


            When asked about freedom of speech concerns, Rubio said international students are “here to study.”
    


            “They're here to go to class. They're not here to lead activist movements that are disruptive and undermine our universities. I think it's lunacy to continue to allow that.”
    


            Here is what we know about the detainment of college activists.
    


            Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate of Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs and one of the school's most prominent pro-Palestinian activists, was among the first students detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
    


            He was arrested by federal agents on March 8 and taken to a detention facility in Louisiana after his lawyer said his green card was revoked by the Trump administration.
    


            The administration ordered for Khalil to be deported after baselessly claiming he is a Hamas sympathizer, a threat to national security, and poses “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

            Officials later said Khalil's deportation was justified because he did not reveal connections to two organizations in his application to become a permanent US resident –– an argument his attorneys call weak.
    


            On March 19, a judge blocked the government indefinitely from deporting Khalil and transferred his case to New Jersey.
    


            While Department of Justice officials have sought to keep Khalil's case in Louisiana since his detention. US District Judge Michael Farbiarz ruled that the case will remain in New Jersey because Khalil was in the state when his attorneys filed a habeas corpus motion seeking to challenge the legality of his detention, according to a 67-page decision filed Tuesday.
    


            “The Petitioner was in custody in New Jersey as of March 9 at 4:40am,” Farbiarz wrote. “And under a federal statute, the Petition, though filed in New York, must be treated as having been filed in New Jersey on March 9 at 4:40am. Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction.”
    


            Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national and Georgetown scholar whose research focuses on peacebuilding in the Middle East was arrested in his Virginia home in mid-March after his J-1 visa was revoked.
    


            A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson alleged Khan Suri was “actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,” and that he had “close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.”
    


            Like other student detainees, Khan Suri has been accused of posing a threat to national security. He is currently being held in detention in Louisiana.
    


            His defense team denies the US government claims and argues Khan Suri's detainment is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to clamp down on individuals “purportedly based on their participation in Palestine-related speech,” according to his court petition.
    


            Khan Suri's attorney also believes he's being targeted because his wife is a prominent Palestinian activist.
    


            Khan Suri's father-in-law, who lived in the US for two decades, served as political advisor to the Prime Minister of Gaza and as Deputy of Foreign Affairs in Gaza until 2010, according to a court filing.
    


            In a statement to CNN, a Georgetown University spokesperson said, “We expect the legal system to adjudicate (Khan Suri's) case fairly.”
    


            Turkish national Rumeysa Ozturk was on her way to break the Ramadan fast in late March when she was arrested and physically restrained by six plainclothes officers near her apartment by Tufts University's Somerville campus.
    


            The arrest, which was captured on surveillance video, was described by Tufts President Sunil Kumar as “disturbing.”
    


            In March 2024, the PhD student cowrote an op-ed in the school's newspaper in which she criticized Tufts' response to a student government group's call for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel because of the conflict in Gaza, among other demands.

            When asked about Ozturk's case, Rubio suggested, without evidence, that the 30-year-old participated in disruptive student protests over Israel's military operations in Gaza.
    


            A DHS spokesperson told CNN that Ozturk “engaged in activities in support of Hamas,” but did not specify what those alleged activities were.
    


            Ozturk is currently being held at a staging facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, according to Homeland Security. While in transit to Louisiana, she suffered an asthma attack, according to an amended habeas corpus petition filed Friday. Ozturk has also not been charged or given the opportunity to speak with a lawyer.
    


            On Friday, a judge in Boston ordered Ozturk not to be deported until she can determine whether the Boston court has jurisdiction to decide if Ozturk was lawfully detained –– a decision that drew praise from Ozturk's lawyers.
    


            In a filing Tuesday, the US Attorney's Office in Boston opposed Ozturk's petition, saying the Boston court does not have jurisdiction in the case because the Tufts student was transferred out of the state shortly after her arrest.
    


            Ozturk's attorneys will file a response to the government's opposition on Wednesday at 5 p.m., according to an order by Judge Denise Casper.
    


            The University of Minnesota said in a campus-wide letter that an international graduate student was detained by immigration officials at an off-campus residence.
    


            The university did not identify the student but called their arrest “a deeply concerning situation.”
    


            DHS initially declined to comment to CNN on the case and deferred questions to ICE. The attorney for the detained student also declined to comment to CNN, saying it's a “highly sensitive situation” and they want to protect their client's privacy.
    


            On Monday, a senior DHS official told CNN the student was taken into custody because of a prior drunken driving incident.
    


            “This is not related to student protests,” the official said in a statement on Monday. “The individual in question was arrested after a visa revocation by the State Dept. related to a prior criminal history for a DUI.”
    


            Detaining an international student over a prior DUI conviction seems to suggest a different approach by immigration officials who, so far, appear focused on students who have participated in protests against the Israel Hamas war.
    


            The unidentified student's detainment has drawn the ire of local, state and national leaders like Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Democratic Minnesota Gov, Tim Walz –– all who are demanding answers from ICE. 



            Outside the US, immigration officials have been ordered to conduct deeper scrutiny of visa applicants.
    


            Over the weekend, the State Department sent out a memo ordering all US embassies and consulates to screen the social media activity of certain student visa applicants for evidence of support for terrorist organizations, two sources familiar with the memo told CNN.
    


            The expansive directive, signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, tasks “Fraud Prevention Units” at the department with taking screenshots of any social media activity that is relevant to the ineligibility of a visa applicant, and to preserve those records in case the applicant deletes the information, the sources said.
    


            Decisions on visas are national security decisions, the memo says while citing executive orders from President Donald Trump to combat terrorism and antisemitism.
    


            CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.

Senegal remains committed to the process of decolonization, and as part of that effort, it plans to exit the France-backed CFA franc monetary union, Aminata Toure, high representative of President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, has stated.

The diplomat made the remarks in an interview with RT, published on Sunday. 

“The CFA franc will soon be ancient history, in my opinion, because it is no longer suited to the ambitions of our economies,” she said.

The CFA franc, introduced by France in 1945, is used in 14 French-speaking nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Critics have long deemed the currency a colonial relic, claiming that it serves as a tool for Paris to continue maintaining influence over the economies and administration of countries in the zone. 

“ECOWAS [West African regional bloc] is thinking about the issue so that the currency, which would be called the Eco, would see the light of day as soon as possible,” Toure said.

The proposed common currency for West African countries is expected to be introduced in 2027 after being postponed four times due to member states' failure to meet convergence criteria set by the West African Monetary Institute.

Faye, who came to power exactly a year ago, has promised radical economic reforms, sovereignty over the country's key industries, and the promotion of peace in Africa. The Senegalese president's administration has since reviewed contracts negotiated by the previous government with foreign partners.

Last November, the EU announced it was ending a 2019 fisheries agreement with Senegal, citing “shortcomings” on Dakar's part. Meanwhile, Dakar has taken a tough stance on the presence of French troops, which are scheduled to leave Senegal by September. This comes amid a regional trend of former colonies severing defense relations with Paris.

Speaking to RT, President Faye's high representative described the canceled EU fisheries deal as a “completely unequal agreement that is no longer acceptable.” 

Commenting on the departure of French forces, Toure said her country has “just returned to normal” with such a decision. “Indeed, the troops should leave by September. I don't know many countries where there are foreign troops, so that was ancient history,” she stated.

The diplomat noted Senegal's intention to diversify its partnerships, including within the BRICS group. “The BRICS are proof that poverty can be definitively eradicated in a human space; you don't need two or three centuries to do it,” she said.

The German military has begun its first permanent deployment of troops on foreign soil since World War II. The 45th Armored Brigade is being positioned in Lithuania, near Russian ally Belarus, as Berlin prepares for a potential conflict in the coming years.

On Tuesday, a ceremony was held outside Vilnius, with Brigadier General Christoph Huber assuming command of the newly established unit, as reported by the German Bundeswehr Association (DBwV) lobby group and state media.

”We have a clear mission. We have to ensure the protection, freedom, and security of our Lithuanian allies here on NATO's eastern flank,” the general said during the ceremony.

Military personnel who arrived in Lithuania last year to prepare for the deployment have been formally integrated into the brigade. Once fully staffed and combat-ready by 2027, the unit will comprise approximately 5,000 military and civilian personnel, equipped with around 2,000 heavy weapons, according to German Army plans.

Moscow views NATO as a hostile entity, describing its expansion in Europe as a direct threat to Russian national security. The bloc's pledge to admit Ukraine as a member and its increasing involvement with the nation have been cited by Russian officials as key causes of Moscow's conflict with Kiev. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, a staunch advocate for troop deployment in Lithuania, has claimed that Russia could launch an attack on NATO by 2029 or 2030 – a claim that Moscow categorically rejects.

In 2023, Berlin and Vilnius signed a stationing agreement, initially designating the new German unit as the 42nd Brigade. Two of its battalions will consist exclusively of German soldiers, while the third will incorporate personnel from other NATO countries. Portions of the brigade will be stationed at the Rudninkai training ground in southeastern Lithuania, only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Belarusian border, while additional units will be stationed near the village of Rukla between Vilnius and Kaunas.

Post-Nazi Germany previously restricted military deployments abroad to temporary assignments, such as contributing to NATO forces following the occupation of Afghanistan in 2001.

The Chinese military has published several videos showcasing a two-day exercise carried out near the self-administered Chinese island of Taiwan earlier this week.

Launched by the Eastern Theater Command (ETC) of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) on Tuesday, the exercise, designated ‘Strait Thunder', drew resources from multiple branches of the Chinese armed forces. Command spokesman Shi Yi stated that the maneuvers were focused on “identification and verification, warning and expulsion, and interception and detention” of various targets. He described the drills as designed to prepare for a potential blockade of Taiwan.

The PLA deployed the Shandong Aircraft Carrier Task Group for the exercise. The domestically produced flagship, commissioned in 2019, carries two dozen Shenyang J-15 naval fighter jets as its primary armament. These were showcased in a video released on Wednesday.

Another clip from the ETC depicted an early morning alert at military barracks, followed by the deployment of rocket launch systems for a live-fire drill. The video suggested that the weapons could be deployed to directly target Taiwan's coastline in the event of an armed conflict.

Footage released on Tuesday also featured PLA Air Force aircraft participating in the drill.

Taiwan is governed by an administration rooted in nationalist forces that were defeated by the Communists during the Chinese Civil War in the 1940s. While Washington officially acknowledges Beijing's sovereignty over the island, it has provided military support to Taipei. Beijing views such arms supplies as encouraging Taiwanese officials to pursue formal independence from China.

“'Taiwan independence' and peace in the Taiwan Strait are incompatible,” Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Zhang Xiaogang emphasized in a statement on Wednesday. “Pursuing ‘Taiwanese independence' will only put Taiwan in a dangerous situation and plunge Taiwan compatriots into dire straits.”

Beijing seeks a peaceful reunification but has warned that it is willing to use force to counteract any separatist efforts. The Defense Ministry labeled the government of incumbent President Lai Ching-te as “crisis makers” and “troublemakers” in its remarks about the ‘Strait Thunder' exercises.

Violent protests took place in Nepal last week as pro-monarchy groups demanded the return of former King Gyanendra Shah to power, 16 years after the monarchy was abolished in the mountainous nation.

Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, saw twin protests on March 28. The rally led by the United People's Movement Committee, a coalition supporting monarchy, devolved into clashes with security forces and resulted in the deaths of at least two people, including a journalist.

Another rally, organized by several republican political parties that formed the Socialist Alliance to “defeat regressive and reactionary forces,” processed peacefully.

Two different locations were allocated for rallies. However, the pro-monarchy rally got out of control. Protesters burned private homes, vehicles, and media houses, and attacked journalists as well as the offices of political parties. Pro-monarchy groups also looted supermarkets, homes, and department stores.

According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, at least 80 people were injured during the protest, including 15 police officers.

The Nepal Police arrested around 111 people, including Rabindra Mishra, the former editor-in-chief of the BBC Nepali Service, who entered Nepalese politics in 2017 and formed the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP). 

Mishra and RPP General Secretary Dhawal Shamsher Rana, who was also arrested during the protest, have been charged with treason by the Kathmandu District Court. Both Mishra and Rana were accused of inciting the protesters.

The chief coordinator of the pro-royalist movement, Nawaraj Subedi, an 87-year-old politician who was a leader in the country's Panchayat system, which was established by King Mahendra in 1960 and remained in force until the 1990s, was placed under house arrest. 

Security agencies also initiated a search of Durga Prasai, labeled by local media as the chief commander of the ongoing royalist movement. Prasai, a controversial businessman who has been implicated in a bank loan fraud, allegedly provoked the crowd and triggering widespread stone-pelting, according to witnesses. Prasai later released a video apologizing for the incident, claiming he was not hiding. 

The committee behind the royalist movement was formed earlier in March, after thousands of people joined a demonstration in the capital in support of restoring the monarchy with the former king, Gyanendra Shah, as its head.

On February 18, the eve of Nepal's Democracy Day, Shah issued a statement from the city of Pokhara where he was staying, expressing concern that the country's long-term peace, stability, and sovereignty have started to erode in recent years. “Even though the reins of the state power have been in the hands of many repeatedly, or even though it has changed, our existing state system does not seem to be able to make any profound contribution to the happiness, peace, and prosperity of the nation,” he was quoted by local media as saying. 

Upon his arrival in Kathmandu, pro-monarchy supporters gathered outside of Tribhuvan International Airport in and welcomed the former royal, giving pro-monarchy forces a signal for a coordinated political action. 



Following the violence, the government led by K.P. Sharma Oli, who was sworn in as Nepal's prime minister in May last year, has signaled its intent to take action against pro-monarchy groups. 

The government has reduced the security detail assigned to Gyanendra Shah and reshuffled the security team. Before the Kathmandu incident, 26 police officers were assigned to his security, but after the violence, the government reduced the number to 16.

According to government sources, further action may be taken against Shah. “The government is taking former King Gyanendra's activities seriously and might take further action within the next few days,” a senior government official told RT.

The ‘Arrest Gyanendra' campaign has gained momentum in social media following the protests. Despite differences on various issues, major political parties of the country share the same stance regarding Gyanendra's activities.

Ram Prasad Shrestha, a former member of the Judicial Council called for investigating former king's involvement in the movement and held accountable for the violence that occurred, if found guilty. “The current crisis has emerged because of the immunity he was granted,” he said.

Journalist Harihar Birahi, who served as a member of the Commission of Inquiry into the suppression of the second people's movement in 2006, also believes that these circumstances provide sufficient grounds to investigate Gyanendra's role in the movement. 

Major political parties have demanded legal action against Shah. The Nepali Congress party, the main coalition partner in the government, has accused him of being responsible for the March 28 violence in Kathmandu. “The kind of activities that took place in the name of royalism – former King Gyanendra Shah is fully responsible for them. He should take responsibility for the actions carried out under his direct influence,” Ram Saran Mahat, a leader of the Nepali Congress, said.

Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda' – the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) and former prime minister – stated that the former king was directly involved in the events that unfolded over the past six months. He added that political parties and the government could not take a lenient stance on him. “Gyanendra Shah cannot be allowed to go unpunished. The Nepali people are not ready for that. The government must take this seriously. It is now very clear that Gyanendra Shah is behind everything that has been happening,” Prachanda said, according to the Kathmandu Post. 

Political analyst Jhalak Subedi, in a conversation with RT, suggested that the main plan was orchestrated under the leadership of the former king, who “has been preparing for the restoration of the monarchy for a couple of years.” Subedi also claimed that Gyanendra has support by “India's Hindus” and that Indian media has been “consistently giving priority” to the movement for the restoration of the Hindu state and monarchy in Nepal.

Indeed, a political controversy arose in Nepal in March, after Gyanendra supporters flashed posters with the image of India's Uttar Pradesh state chief minister Yogi Adityanath during their rallies in Kathmandu. Adityanath is known for viewing the neighboring country as a “Hindu state.” According to Indian media, ties between Nepal's royal Shah dynasty and the Goraksh Peeth, a monastery of the Nath tradition, which is currently lead by monk-turned-chief minister Adityanath, date back centuries. On April 1, days after the deadly unrest Kathmandu, Nepal's ambassador to India, Shankar Sharma, met with Adityanath in India's Lucknow to discuss bilateral relations. 



Gyanendra Shah assumed the crown in 2001 after his brother, then-King Birendra, was killed in a massacre at the Narayanhiti Royal Palace. The attack, allegedly carried out by Crown Prince Dipendra, resulted in the assassination of much of the royal family before Dipendra took his own life.

In February 2005, Gyanendra seized power from the civilian government – a move that made him deeply unpopular. He dissolved the government, banned news reporting, and authorized the army to arrest senior political leaders, journalists, trade unionists, human rights activists, and civil society members. All telephone and internet connections were cut.

In response, the parliamentary political parties and the Maoist rebels – then engaged in armed conflict – joined forces and launched a united movement against the monarchy. Following a 19-day people's uprising, Gyanendra relinquished power to political parties in 2006. Two years later, the Constituent Assembly formally abolished the monarchy, forcing Gyanendra to vacate the Narayanhiti Palace.

The government subsequently allocated Nagarjuna Palace, located seven kilometers west of the capital, as his residence. Since then, he has traveled to various districts, organizing public engagement programs. In recent months, however, he has become increasingly active in campaigning for the restoration of the monarchy.



Only around 5% of Nepal's parliamentarians advocate for monarchism. They belong to the right-wing Rastriya Prajatantra Party, which campaigns for reinstating Nepal as a Hindu kingdom. 



Political analysts suggest that public frustration with the government's poor service delivery, corruption, and unemployment has created dissatisfaction. Yubaraj Ghimire, a senior Nepali journalist, suggested that in recent times, political parties had failed to deliver and have become extremely corrupt.

Tanka Karki, a political analyst and former Nepali ambassador to China, believes, however, that former king wrongly believed he had widespread public support. “The only alternative to democracy is democracy itself; the restoration of the monarchy is not possible,” Karki told RT. “Shah made a daring but unsuccessful attempt.” He suggested that the events of the past week provided lessons to all political parties in the country. 

Subedi believes that former King Gyanendra and his movement weakened after the March 28 Kathmandu incident. “The restoration of the monarchy is not possible. I see it facing suppression once again,” he said.

Members of the US National Security Council (NSC), including National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, have used personal Gmail accounts to discuss sensitive government information, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday, citing obtained emails and three people familiar with the matter.

The report comes after Waltz accidentally added a journalist to a Signal chat group in which Defense Minister Pete Hegseth, Vice President J.D. Vance, and other senior officials discussed US strikes in Yemen. 

According to the Post, a senior Waltz aide used Gmail for “highly technical conversations” with colleagues, which included “sensitive military positions and powerful weapons systems relating to an ongoing conflict.” 

The Post cited officials as saying that Waltz had “potentially exploitable information” sent to his Gmail account and posted parts of his schedule into Signal to coordinate meetings and discussions.

Officials are normally required to use secure government-issued means of communication.

NSC spokesman Brian Hughes told the Post that Waltz “didn't and wouldn't send classified information on an open account.” He added that when “legacy contacts” were emailing Waltz, he always copied the messages to his government email “to ensure compliance with records retention.” Hughes said that NSC staff are instructed to use “only secure platforms for classified information.”

In a statement to Fox News, Hughes said he could not verify the Post's claims because the journalist “refused to share any part of the document reported.”

The Democrats have criticized the administration of President Donald Trump for using the Signal chat app when discussing the bombing of Houthi positions in Yemen last month. According to Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, he was added to a group in which Hegseth shared the timeline of the March 15 strikes, as well as the weapons systems used in the operation.

Hegseth and other White House officials have denied that any classified information was shared in the chat with Goldberg. Trump has rejected the calls to dismiss Waltz. “I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,” he told NBC News on Saturday.

Latest security flap again focuses scrutiny on Waltz after he earlier added journalist to Yemen war-planning chat

Michael Waltz, the embattled national security adviser to Donald Trump, and other members of the national security council have reportedly used personal Gmail accounts to conduct government business.

The apparent use of Gmail, a relatively insecure method of communication for high-level government officials, places further scrutiny upon Waltz, who is already under pressure after adding a journalist to a group chat on the commercial Signal app, where top US officials then planned and celebrated a US airstrike in Yemen last month.

The revelations of the Gmail use come from the Washington Post, which said it has reviewed documents and interviewed three unnamed officials about the apparent security lapse.

Waltz had “potentially exploitable information” sent to his Gmail, such as his schedule and other work documents, the Post reported.

One of Waltz's aides on the national security council, meanwhile, allegedly used Gmail for more sensitive material, such as discussing military positions and weapons systems with colleagues in other government agencies who used their government-issued accounts.

A spokesperson for the national security council denied to the Post that Waltz had used Gmail improperly. “Waltz didn't and wouldn't send classified information on an open account,” the spokesperson said.

This latest episode, however, risks further damage to the standing of Waltz following the revelation last week that he added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine, to a Signal group chat that involved senior figures such as JD Vance, the US vice-president, and Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, that discussed details of an airstrike upon the Houthi rebel group in Yemen.

Waltz has said that Goldberg's number was somehow “sucked in” to his phone, a comment that drew scorn from Goldberg and others. Trump has, however, declined to fire Waltz, instead calling the incident a “glitch”.

Prior to his role as the president's national security adviser, Waltz was highly critical of Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.

Democrats have been pushing for Waltz and Hegseth to resign amid the scandal. “Mike Waltz is totally and completely unqualified to be in a sensitive national security position, as is the case with the Trump national security team,” Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, told Axios.

Jeffries said that Hegseth and Waltz should be fired if they did not resign immediately.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Court hears arguments on whether state can block clinics that provide abortions from receiving Medicaid funds

In its first abortion-related case since Donald Trump retook control of the White House, the US supreme court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case challenging South Carolina's attempt to effectively “defund” Planned Parenthood because the reproductive health giant performs abortions.

The case, Medina v Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, deals with a 2018 executive order from the South Carolina governor, Henry McMaster that blocked clinics that provide abortions from receiving reimbursements via Medicaid, the US government's healthcare program for low-income people, despite the fact that those reimbursements don't actually cover abortions. “Payment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any purpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the denial of the right to life,” McMaster said at the time.

However, federal law bans Medicaid from covering the vast majority of abortions, which only comprised about 4% of Planned Parenthood's activities in fiscal year 2022. Instead, people use Medicaid to cover Planned Parenthood's other services. In the same year, the organization performed nearly half a million Pap tests and breast exams as well as 4.6m STI tests and treatments. It also provided birth control services to more than 2.2 million people.

Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, a Planned Parenthood affiliate that operates two clinics in South Carolina, teamed up with a patient who sought birth control, Julie Edwards, to sue over McMaster's order. Lower courts have since kept the order from going into effect.

The supreme court is currently controlled 6-3 by conservatives. If the court sides with South Carolina, it could pave the way for other states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs as well as devastate South Carolinians' ability to access reproductive healthcare and family planning services.

Of the 2.4 million people treated at Planned Parenthood nationwide each year, nearly half are on Medicaid. About four in 10 women who have sought care at family-planning clinics say those clinics are their only recent source of healthcare.

At the heart of the case is a federal provision that guarantees that people insured by Medicaid can freely choose their own providers as long as they accept the program and are qualified to provide care. The case hinges on a technical argument: South Carolina – which is being represented by the powerhouse Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) – says Medicaid beneficiaries have no right to sue if they believe that guarantee has been violated.

Oral arguments zeroed in on this technicality, as ADF senior counsel John Bursch argued that the guarantee lacks “clear rights-creating language”.

“It does not use the word ‘right' or its functional equivalent,” Bursch said. “Nor does it use word with a deeply rooted, rights-creating pedigree, like the fifth amendment's ‘no person shall'.”

The three liberal justices on the supreme court – Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – appeared ready to reject that argument. It's impossible to describe Medicaid's guarantee, Kagan said, without calling it a “right”.

“The obligation is to ensure that individuals can choose their doctor,” Kagan said. “There's a correlative right. There's an obligation, there's a right. And the right is the right to choose their doctor.”

The conservative wing of the court seemed more split. Justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared particularly worried about leaving patients unable to seek help if their preferred qualified provider was kicked out of Medicaid. “If I want to go see Dr Jones and that's the provider of my choice and the state has disqualified Dr Jones … there's no mechanism, am I right, for the beneficiary to say: ‘Well, you're depriving me of my ability' – we won't call it right, we won't use the loaded word – ‘but the ability to see the provider of my choice'?” she asked.

During arguments, Bursch suggested that, rather than suing, patients could ask the government to intervene administratively.

Ultimately, these seemingly narrow arguments, legal experts warn, conceal the broader consequences of the case. If people can't sue when they believe a state is violating Medicaid, then it will become far more difficult to keep states from discriminating against certain kinds of care, said Nicole Huberfeld, a health law professor at Boston University's School of Public Health.

“Even though the state is trying to claim that it has sole authority to decide who's a qualified provider, this isn't really about whether Planned Parenthood is a qualified provider. It's about a political calculation on abortion,” Huberfeld said. “Really, what's happening here is states making politically driven decisions about access to medical care.”

A decision in the case is expected in June.

More than 1 million people in South Carolina use Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (Chip) – which is closely linked to Medicaid – for their insurance. Almost 40% of South Carolina counties are believed to be “contraceptive deserts”, where there are not enough providers to meet the needs of the people who live there. South Carolina bans abortion past six weeks of pregnancy.

Because Texas terminated Planned Parenthood from its state Medicaid program in 2021, it offers a window into what happens when people lose access to medical provider. The termination affected the healthcare of some 8,000 Texans.

“Planned Parenthood, we heard again and again, was a medical home for people with very few options for providers,” said Anna Chatillon, a research scientist at Resound Research for Reproductive Health, who led a study that interviewed Texans about how the termination affected their lives. “In several different interviews, we heard people talking about showing up for an appointment, finding out that they couldn't use Medicaid any longer, not having any idea where else to go, and experiencing real disruptions to their care based on that very quickly, but also serious emotional ramifications.”

The case is part of a broader, longstanding anti-abortion campaign against Planned Parenthood, which includes an ongoing lawsuit that could bankrupt the organization over allegations that it defrauded Medicaid.

On Tuesday, Planned Parenthood announced that the Trump administration – which helped South Carolina make its case in oral arguments – had notified nine of its affiliates that they would lose funding from Title X, the nation's oldest and largest family-planning program. Politico reported the funds were being withheld as punishment for the organization's diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Comments come after it was revealed judge ignored DoJ recommendations against expelling survivors from panel

Clergy abuse survivors who were ousted from a committee trying to negotiate a settlement resolving the New Orleans Catholic archdiocese's bankruptcy say they have lost their confidence in the judge presiding over the case.

Their comments come after it was revealed that Judge Meredith Grabill ignored federal justice department recommendations against expelling the survivors from the group, delivering the latest twist in a child sexual abuse scandal roiling one of the oldest Roman Catholic dioceses in the US.

“I can honestly say that my faith in … Grabill is greatly diminished,” James Adams said about decisions that at first were largely made in secret against him as well as three of his fellow survivor committee members. “It's shattered.”

Grabill removed Adams, Jackie Berthelot, Theo Jackson and Eric Johnson from the group in question after tasking a justice department office which assists with administering bankruptcy cases to investigate an attorney for the survivors. The lawyer, Richard Trahant, drew Grabill's attention after taking steps to tip off a local high school that its chaplain, Paul Hart, was an admitted molester in early 2022.

Investigators concluded that they believed Trahant had violated the terms of an applicable confidentiality order in what he maintained was an attempt to protect children – but their report to Grabill said the clients should not be punished.

Grabill nonetheless ruled that she was “forced” to kick his four clients off the survivors committee; imposed a $400,000 fine on Trahant; and then ordered the findings of the investigation by the US trustee's office sealed from public view.

The Guardian joined news partner WWL Louisiana in recently obtaining the US trustee's investigative report through a successful public records request seeking files pertaining to the criminal prosecution of serial child molester Lawrence Hecker, who pleaded guilty to child rape and kidnapping charges in December and died in prison a few weeks later.

An article published on Monday by the outlets marked the first time that many learned of the findings of the US trustee report that preceded Grabill's punishments against Trahant and his clients, widely seen as one of the most consequential decisions issued during the New Orleans archdiocese's unusually tortuous chapter 11 reorganization.

Not even Adams, Berthelot, Jackson and Johnson had seen the document, having been barred from accessing it even as they unsuccessfully appealed their removals.

Asked to comment on Grabill's decision to remove them in light of the exposed US trustee investigation, Jackson said: “We were just blindsided … with something that we [had] nothing to do with.”

Johnson added: “It hurts because you're trying to do good for the other survivors. Yet [they're] blaming you for everything.”

Grabill also ignored a US trustee recommendation to hold a court hearing before taking any action after the completion of the Hart investigation. The judge ordered the committee removals one business day after receiving the US trustee report. She has not commented on the Guardian and WWL's recent reporting on Hart.

Trahant's four clients all had Catholic upbringings in the New Orleans area and reported enduring child sexual molestation at the hands of clergymen or lay religious personnel amid the worldwide church's decades-old clerical abuse scandal.

In May 2020, the New Orleans archdiocese filed for bankruptcy protection in an attempt to limit its liability from such abuse claims. It is one of about 40 US Catholic institutions to do so.

The cases reported by Adams and the others became ensnared in the bankruptcy, with Trahant representing them. And they all successfully applied to serve on a committee of abuse survivor claimants whose job it was to aid in settlement negotiations.

In his role as the committee members' attorney, Trahant learned that Hart had been allowed to serve as chaplain of New Orleans' Brother Martin high school despite previously admitting to having sexual contact in the early 1990s with a 17-year-old girl whom he met at a prior assignment.

In 2002, US bishops adopted a policy making 18 the age of consent under canon – or church – law. Before that, 16 was the age of consent. So New Orleans Archbishop Gregory Aymond declined to substantially punish Hart and assigned him to work at Brother Martin beginning in 2017.

Hart was forced to retire after Brother Martin learned of his past, the bulk of which was meant to be kept secret because of confidentiality rules in the archdiocesan bankruptcy.

An investigation into how Brother Martin learned the truth about Hart concluded that Trahant violated the bankruptcy's confidentiality rules simply by making reference to the name and position of the chaplain while communicating with the school's principal. Brother Martin's principal, Ryan Gallagher, was Trahant's cousin and knew Trahant represented clergy abuse survivors. Trahant later testified he knew his cousin would infer Hart was likely an abuser from the mere mention of his name.

Furthermore, the investigation asserted that Trahant violated the secrecy order by telling a journalist who later reported on the circumstances surrounding Hart's forced retirement to keep the clergyman on his “radar”.

But the investigation found it was actually the church itself that informed Brother Martin about the particulars of Hart's abusive past. And it essentially ruled out Trahant as having been the source of the information that the journalist reported about Hart, who has since died.

Trahant asserted to investigators and Grabill that he was careful only to share information about Hart that was publicly available, such as his name and job. That's because the bankruptcy confidentiality order allowed him to do at least that, he argued.

Despite his assertions, Grabill decided Trahant had violated the confidentiality order – and that he and his clients deserved to be sanctioned.

Trahant and his clients appealed. The appeal pursued by Trahant, who had access to the US trustee report but could not legally discuss it with his clients, remained pending as of Tuesday in the federal fifth circuit court. The clients' appeal failed after Grabill's seal on the report impeded them from viewing it.

While the US trustee report opined that only Trahant merited punishment, Grabill said she was “forced” to remove his clients from the survivors committee to ensure the smooth functioning of that entity. Adams, who had been the group's chairperson, pointed out that the US trustee never publicly indicated that the committee removals were against its recommendation.

The expulsions were unnecessary, Adams added. He said virtually every one of the committee's votes during his two years of participation was unanimous.

He said he wondered whether he and his colleagues were ousted – on the morning that they were scheduled to address Aymond as part of settlement negotiations – because they had expressed a commitment to “genuinely investigating how the archdiocese ended up in bankruptcy”.

Even with their removals, Adams and his former colleagues noted how the bankruptcy was unresolved as of Tuesday, nearly three years after their June 2022 removals.

Berthelot, a survivor of Hecker as well as of another abusive clergyman, said he “absolutely” believes Grabill “needs to step down” from the case. He described experiencing health problems and losing friendships amid the bankruptcy's various twists. By Monday, it had all worn him down so much that he resigned his elected office from the city council in the New Orleans suburb of Gretna, which he first joined in 2013.

“Judge Grabill has been compromised,” said Berthelot, whose council term was supposed to last until June. “To me, as a victim, a survivor of clergy abuse, it was extremely shocking.”

Adams said part of him wanted to see Grabill step down from the case after the exposure of the sealed Hart report. But he worried about how much longer something like that might delay the bankruptcy.

Figures associated with Catholic institution bankruptcies settled elsewhere relatively recently suggest the New Orleans archdiocese's reorganization could cost the church and its insurers more than $300m to settle.

As it continued efforts to finance a settlement with survivors, the archdiocese earlier in March agreed to sell a suburban orphanage with a lengthy history of child abuse to local government officials for $3.8m.

Johnson survived abuse at a sister orphanage across the street from the one being sold. He said he hoped officials followed through on stated goals of redeveloping the property into a multi-use facility and building a memorial to all those who survived abuse on those grounds.

“Use it for something positive,” Johnson said. “Use it for the good of the community.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

US president claims tariffs part of a ‘liberation day' that could include levies for China, Brazil, India and the European Union

As part of his so-called “liberation day”, Donald Trump is set to unveil new details of part of his economic plan, including tariffs on multiple countries, at 4pm ET today.

Although exact details have yet to be revealed, Trump has previously entertained the idea of reciprocal tariffs in which the US would reciprocate the tariffs that other countries have levied on US exports.

Countries that Trump has mentioned which would be on the receiving end of reciprocal tariffs include China, Brazil and India, and the European Union.

Also on the table is 25% tariffs on all imports coming into the US from Canada and Mexico.

Trump has already announced an additional 20% tariff on all Chinese imports and a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports. There is also a 10% tariff on energy imports from Canada.

Mike Waltz's team has regularly set up group chats on Signal to coordinate official work on various global issues from different parts of the world including Ukraine, China, Gaza, Middle East policy, Africa and Europe, Politico reports.

According to four people who have been personally added to the chats and who spoke to the outlet, sensitive information was discussed in the chats.

Two of the sources said they were in or have direct knowledge of at least 20 such chats, Politico reports.

Reports of Waltz's team's use of the chat follows a bombshell scandal that broke last week after the Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was accidentally added into a Signal group chat by Waltz regarding US airstrikes on Yemen.

Waltz and the White House have yet to publicly comment on the latest Politico report.

Democrats were tasting unfamiliar triumphalism on Wednesday after the election for a vacant Wisconsin supreme court seat turned into an emphatic repudiation of Elon Musk, Donald Trump's richest supporter and key ally.

Musk endured a wave of gloating on Twitter/X, his own social media platform, after Brad Schimel, a Trump-endorsed judge that he spent $25m supporting lost by 10 percentage points to Susan Crawford, whose victory sustained a 4-3 liberal majority on the court.

On a day that Trump has earmarked as “liberation day” to mark his long-awaited rollout of trade tariffs, Democrats seized on the result as a referendum on Musk – who has spearheaded the president's slashing of federal government workers and spending programmes – while casting it as a platform for a recovery in next year's congressional midterm elections.

For the full story, click here:

The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has pushed back against reports that Donald Trump has told his inner circle that Elon Musk will be taking a step back from the Trump administration.

Calling the Wednesday report from Politico a “‘scoop' [that] is garbage”, Leavitt said:

“Elon Musk and President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at Doge is complete.”

According to three people familiar with the matter who spoke to Politico, Trump remains pleased with Musk's unofficial “department of government efficiency”.

However, both Musk and Trump have agreed in recent days “that it will soon be time for Musk to return to his businesses and take on a supporting role”, Politico reports.

Donald Trump's tariffs plan has received some mixed reactions in New York City, with some people saying, “I believe we were lied to.”

The Guardian's Edward Helmore reports:

Outside Macy's in midtown Manhattan, a couple agreed on their feelings that Trump had misled voters when he vowed during the campaign to make everything cheaper. “Tariffs will affect people across the country,” said the shopper, who offered his name as Tom. “I believe we were lied to,” he said, predicting that Republican voters in red states would soon come to agree. “I think some have changed their views already, and more will continue to do,” he added.

Trump's tariffs threaten to unleash a global trade war – and raise prices for everyone around the world. Some visitors were shocked at how expensive New York already was.

A couple from the Netherlands said they had just paid $18 for two ice-creams. “New York is already very expensive,” said one, Patrick. “Two ice-creams would be like six dollars in the Netherlands.”

A couple visiting from Indiana, who declined to give their names, revealed split thinking on the issue. “I really don't understand the tariffs so I'm just waiting to see,” said the woman.

For the full story, click here:

Vermont's Democratic senator Peter Welch criticized Donald Trump's tariff's plans on the Senate floor.

Saying that the tariffs are not only “going to do direct and immediate economic harm to everyday Vermont families and farmers maple sugar producers”, Welch said that they will also “start eroding the trust that is the benefit of good relations over time” between the US and its neighbors.

“That's what he's embracing, totally bad, totally wrong, doomed. And the only question is, how much pain will he inflict everyday Vermonters, before he comes to his senses and withdraws this tariff policy?” Welch added.

We reported earlier that Donald Trump has told his inner circle that Elon Musk will be taking a step back from the Trump administration, according to Politico.

A White House source has told Reuters that that Musk's work with the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) would be done within his 130-day mandate.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has communicated that to the president multiple times, the source told the news agency.

Musk was not leaving before his Doge work was done “and no one is pushing him out”, the source added.

Mitch McConnell, the Republican senator from Kentucky, has privately indicated to Democratic senator Tim Kaine that he would support Kaine's resolution to undo Donald Trump's tariffs on Canada.

Kaine told reporters that he approached McConnell on the Senate floor yesterday evening. He said:

I said, ‘I want to talk to you about my Canadian tariffs bill.' And, you know, I didn't even get to the question, and he said, ‘I'm with you.'

Kaine added that he had “rock solid support” from four Republican senators: McConnell, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Rand Paul.

The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, said Tuesday's election results in Florida and Wisconsin were a sign of the Democratic party's strength, citing recent special elections in Iowa and Pennsylvania.

“What we've seen every single month this year, Democrats in special elections all over the country win or over perform,” Jeffries said at a news conference on Wednesday.

Despite the effort by some to project this notion that House Democrats, Senate Democrats, the Democratic party is cowering – we're not cowering. We're beating them over and over and over again.

The Democratic House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, has warned that Donald Trump's rollout of new tariffs would increase prices and ultimate drive the US into a recession.

“This is not ‘liberation day',” Jeffries said at a press conference on Wednesday. “It's recession day in the United States of America.” He added:

That's what the Trump tariffs are going to do: crash the economy.

President's plans have rattled global stock markets and triggered heated rows with US's largest trading partners

Donald Trump will announce his latest round of tariffs at the White House on Wednesday, threatening to unleash a global trade war on what he has dubbed “liberation day”.

Trump has rattled global stock markets, alarmed corporate executives and economists, and triggered heated rows with the US's largest trading partners by announcing and delaying plans to impose tariffs on foreign imports several times since taking office.

No details of Wednesday's plans have been made available ahead of the announcement. The president is set to speak at 4pm ET. White House officials said that the implementation of the most sweeping rewrite of US trade policy would be immediate.

Trump has made clear a few goals he wants to accomplish through his tariffs: bring manufacturing back to the US, respond to unfair trade policies from other countries, increase tax revenue, and incentivize crackdowns on migration and drug trafficking.

The implementation of his tariffs has so far been haphazard, with multiple rollbacks and delays and vague promises that have yet to come to fruition. The threats have soured US relations with its largest trading partners. Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, has called them “unjustified” and pledged to retaliate. The European Union has said it has a “strong plan” to retaliate.

Karoline Leavitt, Trump's press secretary, said that Trump was spending Tuesday “perfecting” the trade plan. “He is with his trade and tariff team right now, perfecting it to make sure this is a perfect deal for the American people and the American worker,” Leavitt said.

Ahead of the announcement, Trump repeated the idea of imposing so-called reciprocal tariffs, with the US taxing imports at the same rates that a country uses for US exports. Trump has specifically mentioned countries like South Korea, Brazil and India, along with the EU, as being possible targets for reciprocal tariffs.

“The world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more,” Trump told NBC over the weekend. “All we're doing is being fair.”

Also still on the table are 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada, two of the US's biggest trading partners, which Trump wants to utilize to force the countries to quell migration and drug trafficking into the US. In early March, Trump delayed the start of the tariffs for the second time after negotiating with leaders of the two countries.

Reports have also said that Trump's advisers are also pitching him a 20% across-the-board tariff on all imports, something closer to what Trump promised on the campaign trail.

Any tariffs announced would be on top of the tariffs that Trump has already implemented: an additional 20% tariff on all Chinese imports and a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports. There is also a 10% tariff on energy imports from Canada.

Trump also announced in March a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles and, eventually, imported auto parts, which will start going into effect on Thursday.

The tariff plans have led to stock market sell-offs and are proving unpopular with Americans, according to polls. Multiple reports suggest internal conflicts within the White House over how far and wide the tariffs should go have exacerbated the uncertainty over what the tariffs will be.

Recent reporting from Politico suggests that some within the White House see the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, as the most aggressive about tariffs, pushing across-the-board measures. Meanwhile, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and trade adviser Peter Navarro are both more averse to dramatic tariffs.

But all conflict within the White House has been largely internal, while Trump and his cabinet have spent the last few weeks trying to pitch the tariffs as good for the US economy, even as the US stock market has been sliding downward and consumer and business sentiments have plummeted.

On Monday, the end of the first quarter of 2025, two of the three major stock exchanges saw their worst quarter in over two years as Wall Street has been reeling from the chaos of Trump's trade wars. In March, consumer confidence plunged to its lowest level in over four years.

Economists at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and other banks lowered their forecasts for growth in the US economy in recent days and have noted an increased chance of a recession.

Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, told Bloomberg News that it is “the most dramatic shift in confidence that I can recall, except for when Covid hit”, he said. “It's conceivable that the hit to confidence could have a bigger effect than the tariffs themselves.”

The Trump administration has tried to argue that the drop in confidence has to do with the uncertainty over trade policy, not the impacts of the tariffs themselves. Yet economists say the impacts of tariffs will be another uncertainty in itself, likely leading to higher prices as American businesses, which will have to pay the tariffs on imports, ultimately shifting the cost down to consumers.

“CEOs are consistently saying they want to hike prices,” Alex Jacquez, CEO of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive thinktank and advocacy group, told reporters on Tuesday. “What the major retailers and companies who may be affected by tariffs are already planning to do … is pass these costs along to consumers as much as they possibly can.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

A ‘derivative' of Quentin Tarantino's original, rather than a sequel, will be produced by Netflix, and continues Pitt's relationship with the director of Seven and Fight Club

Brad Pitt is to star in a follow-up to Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. But, having written the script, Tarantino will hand directing duties to David Fincher, according to a report in the Playlist and subsequently confirmed by Deadline.

In Tarantino's 2019 alternative-history drama about the Manson “family” and Sharon Tate, Pitt starred as stunt performer Cliff Booth opposite Leonardo DiCaprio (as washed-up actor Rick Dalton) and Margot Robbie (as Tate). While no plot details of the new project have been officially announced, the Hollywood Reporter is saying it will be “derivative” of the original, rather than a sequel. Tarantino published a “novelisation” of the film in 2021, which included further details of Booth's backstory and life episodes.

Tarantino is also believed to have decided against directing the film, and allowed Pitt to take the script to Fincher, with whom he has had a long working relationship, including starring in Fincher's early films Seven, Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. While Tarantino is now renowned as a director, he sold scripts earlier in his career, notably True Romance (directed by Tony Scott) and Natural Born Killers (directed by Oliver Stone).

In another departure from the original Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, the project will not be produced by Sony Pictures but has been acquired by Netflix, with whom Fincher has made two feature films (Mank and The Killer) and several TV series (including House of Cards, Mindhunter and Voir).

It is not clear whether the project is related to Tarantino's scrapped “final” movie The Movie Critic, in which Booth's character was rumoured to have appeared. It is also unclear if the new script makes room for appearances by DiCaprio and Robbie.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Thousands lost jobs as sweeping cuts reshape public health, leaving experts and lawmakers scrambling 

Experts in everything from mine safety to smoking and infertility were hit by mass layoffs after the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's plan to downsize nearly a quarter of the 82,000-person workforce took effect.

Even as the sprawling nature of layoffs became apparent on Tuesday, a complete accounting was elusive. Layoffs were undertaken with few public details, with even apoplectic congressional lawmakers left in the dark.

The result was a day of desperate crowdsourcing, as employees themselves and experts outside government became aware of programs and positions eliminated – and then processed how it would ultimately affect American lives.

Layoff notices started coming down earlier in the day, embodied by lines of staffers wrapping the sidewalk of the Parklawn building in Maryland – waiting to see if their badges would still work, and employees in building elevators carrying boxes of personal belongings.

But the cuts rippled out far from the DC area. In just one example in Morgantown, West Virginia, the secretary's cuts gutted the respiratory division that protects coal miners from pneumoconiosis, a disease colloquially known as “black lung” – and one condition that has increased astronomically among young coal miners in Appalachia.

The cuts at HHS come alongside others to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, a separate government division that monitors mine safety conditions, housed in the Department of Labor.

“I'm not sure they realize that eliminating these jobs within [the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety] and these offices is going to affect the miners in these offices,” said Erin Bates, spokesperson for the United Mine Workers International.

At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cuts hit an entire branch devoted to infertility – a cause that Donald Trump had championed only days earlier, calling himself the “fertilization president”.

“Following today's layoffs at the CDC, there will be no experts on infertility who will be able to inform public policy, brief members of Congress, publish articles and reports, and advance public awareness on the causes and treatments for infertility,” Barbara Collura, president of Resolve: The National Infertility Association, said in a statement.

The loss stood alongside the CDC's Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice (DEHSP), “slated to be eliminated in its entirety”, according to an internal email from the center's director, Ari Bernstein, obtained by Politico's E&E News.

The division is responsible for preventing exposures to harmful environmental hazards and responding to the climate crisis. It also oversees the CDC's climate health activities and its branches on lead poisoning, asthma and air quality, water, emerging hazards, and environmental public health tracking.

Among the losses at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was the division devoted to crafting tobacco policy. Taxpayers will save no money – it was paid for by tobacco companies themselves.

“These cuts conflict with the repeatedly stated commitments of President Trump and Secretary Kennedy to reduce chronic disease and protect children's health,” said Yolonda C Richardson, president and CEO of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, who said in a statement that smoking is still responsible for 30% of all cancer deaths in the US. “We cannot achieve these goals and make America healthy if our nation backs off its efforts to reduce tobacco use.”

The director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, Brian King, told staff in an email he was placed on administrative leave the same day: “It is with a heavy heart and profound disappointment that I share I have been placed on administrative leave,” the Associated Press reported.

Meanwhile, the Administration for Community Living (ACL) at the health department was hit by significant cuts, in effect dismantling the teams focused on serving the disabled and elderly.

The Autism Society of America opposed that cut as well as those to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration as decisions that could curtail bipartisan support for disabled Americans.

Former CDC director Dr Tom Frieden said the cuts, particularly to programs on smoking and to global health, would not “‘trim the fat' – they will undermine our ability to prevent deaths from tobacco and disease outbreaks”.

Multiple communications teams at the FDA were also cut, including the entire media affairs division and most of the communications team of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, reportedly about 50 people, sources told NBC News. This team was responsible for managing public databases on drug approvals, which includes informing the public about potential risks of FDA-approved drugs, as well as managing the drug-shortages database.

Kennedy announced 10,000 jobs would be cut from the Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday afternoon – offering few specifics beyond the promise that the cuts would “streamline our agency”. The cuts are compounded by losses already made by the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) run by billionaire Elon Musk. All told the $1.7tn health department is expected to lose up to 20,000 people, or one-quarter of its 82,000-person workforce.

On Monday, nearly 2,000 members of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine issued an open letter to warn Americans of the administration's assault on science.

As the cuts came into focus, former leaders of HHS stood in awe of their vast reach.

“The FDA as we've known it is finished with most of the leaders with institutional knowledge and a deep understanding of product development and safety no longer employed,” former FDA commissioner Dr Robert Califf told Mass Device, calling it “a dark day for public health”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

State police anti-terrorism unit investigating whether blaze in Torre Angela was started by anarchists

Italy's interior ministry has written to police forces across the country to increase security at Tesla dealerships after 17 of the electric cars made by Elon Musk's company were destroyed in a fire in Rome.

Italy's state police anti-terrorism unit, Digos, is investigating whether the fire at the Tesla dealership in Torre Angela, a suburb in the east of the capital, was started by anarchists.

Firefighters worked for hours to put out the blaze in the early hours of Monday. Drone images showed a row of the burnt-out remains of the vehicles in a parking area of the dealership. Using his social media platform, X, Musk referred to it as “terrorism”.

There are 13 Tesla dealerships in Italy, all managed by the parent company, the majority of them in Rome, but also in other cities including Florence and Milan.

An interior ministry source said the circular was aimed at “raising awareness” of possible anti-Tesla protesters amid a global wave of vandalism in response to Musk's political activities in the US. If needed, surveillance of dealerships would be increased, it said.

Since the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president in January, Musk has been slashing the federal workforce as chief of the administration's so-called “department of government efficiency”, prompting the emergence of “Tesla Takedown”, a boycott movement that started in the US before spreading to Europe.

Although most protests have so far been peaceful, Tesla dealerships and cars have increasingly been targets of vandalism. Seven vehicles were set alight at a dealership in Ottersberg, Germany, on Saturday, and two Tesla stores in Sweden, one in the capital, Stockholm, and the other in the coastal city of Malmö, were vandalised with orange paint on Monday.

Musk has nurtured close relations with European far-right party leaders including the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who in an interview in early January described him as “a brilliant man”.

Matteo Salvini, who leads the far-right League, a member of Meloni's ruling coalition, expressed solidarity with Musk after the Rome incident.

“Too much unjustified hatred against the Tesla car company,” Salvini wrote on X. “The season of hate and conflict must come to an end as soon as possible. My solidarity goes out to Elon Musk and to all the workers who have been threatened and attacked.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

French President Emmanuel Macron has commented for the first time since Marine Le Pen was found guilty of embezzlement and barred from running in France's next presidential election.

Opening a weekly meeting of French ministers, Macron addressed the court's decision by recalling the three things government spokesperson Sophie Primas said.

They were “that the judiciary is independent”, “that the threats made against judges are absolutely unbearable and intolerable”, and that “the law is the same for everyone”, Politico reports.

Macron also stated that “all defendants have the right to legal recourse,” Primas said.

We are now closing the blog. Here is a round-up of today's events.

Europe is braced for US president Donald Trump to impose sweeping tariffs on global trading partners on Wednesday, threatening cost increases and likely drawing retaliation from all sides. Details of Trump's tariff plans are due to be announced in the White House Rose Garden at 4 pm Eastern Time (10pm CET, 9pm BST).

Donald Trump's planned tariffs will be negative across the world, with the damage depending on how far they go, how long they last and whether they lead to successful negotiations, European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde said on Wednesday.

The effect of US tariffs on Italian companies will be massive – with fashion, pharmaceuticals and the food industry the hardest hit, the head of national industry lobby Confindustria said on Wednesday.

Benedicte de Perthuis, the judge who barred far-right leader Marine Le Pen from running in France's 2027 presidential election is under police protection after facing death threats, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

European visitors to the UK will need a new online entry permit from Wednesday as the British government shakes up longstanding travel rules. Travellers from Europe will now need a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit.

Russian attacks damaged energy facilities in Ukraine's Sumy and Dnipropetrovsk regions, President Zelenskyy said adding that Russia was intentionally attacking Ukrainian energy infrastructure and called on allies to mount pressure on Moscow to halt its invasion.

Russia's Defence Ministry said on Wednesday that Ukraine had attacked Russian energy facilities twice during the past 24 hours. The Guardian could not verify the reported strikes.

The Kremlin said on Wednesday that a visit to the US by President Vladimir Putin's envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, was “possible”, and that contacts with the US were continuing.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to visit Hungary on Wednesday defying an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued over allegations of war crimes in Gaza.

Denmark's prime minister Mette Frederiksen began her three-day visit to Greenland on Wednesday for talks with the territory's incoming government, following US President Donald Trump's repeated expressions of interest in controlling the Arctic island, Reuters reports.

President Emmanuel Macron convened key ministers and experts on Wednesday to discuss Iran, including its nuclear programme, amid growing tensions between Tehran and US President Donald Trump, three diplomatic sources told Reuters.

Nato allies have pledged $21.65bn (more than 20bn euros) in military support for Ukraine in the first three months of the year, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Wednesday.

Norway will not withdraw from the global convention banning anti-personnel landmines as all the other European countries bordering Russia have done, the country's foreign minister said on Wednesday.

Norway will not withdraw from the global convention banning anti-personnel landmines as all the other European countries bordering Russia have done, the country's foreign minister said on Wednesday.

Finland on Tuesday said it planned to quit the 1997 Ottawa Convention as a way to mitigate the military threat posed by Russia, following Poland and the Baltic countries, which announced similar moves last month.

Norway's foreign minister Espen Barth Eide told Reuters: “This particular decision [by Finland] is something that we regret.

“If we start weakening our commitment, it makes it easier for warring factions around the world to use these weapons again, because it reduces the stigma.”

He added: “We have a very modern advanced defence system. We have purchased extremely advanced systems that can attack from land, the air and sea.”

Nato allies have pledged $21.65bn (more than 20bn euros) in military support for Ukraine in the first three months of the year, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Wednesday.

Foreign ministers from the alliance meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday to discuss further support for Ukraine against Russia's three-year-old invasion.

Hungary has deployed soldiers and launched new disinfection measures to help contain an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in a northwestern area bordering Slovakia and Austria, the agriculture minister said on Wednesday.

Hungary reported its first case in more than 50 years of the disease, which often leads to trade restrictions, on a cattle farm early last month, Reuters reports.

Since then, neighbouring Slovakia has detected outbreaks at five locations after reporting its first cases in March. It has also stepped up measures to contain the disease's spread.

Hungarian agriculture minister Istvan Nagy said foot-and-mouth disease was found at two additional farms in Gyor-Moson-Sopron county by Wednesday morning, affecting 3,500 cattle.

French president Emmanuel Macron was convening key ministers and experts on Wednesday to discuss Iran, including its nuclear programme, amid growing tensions between Tehran and US President Donald Trump, three diplomatic sources told Reuters.

Such a cabinet meeting dedicated to a specific subject is rare and highlights mounting concern among Washington's European allies that the United States and Israel could launch air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities unless there is a quick negotiated deal on its nuclear programme.

US defence secretary Pete Hegseth has reinforced US military capability in the Middle East with more warplanes, the Pentagon said on Tuesday, amid a US bombing campaign against the Houthis who control much of Yemen and are supported by Iran.

A senior European official said European strategists were asking themselves whether the campaign could be a precursor to a US strike on Iran in the coming months.

Three Spanish citizens and one Australian have been detained attempting to reach the Russian-operated Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Russian state news agency RIA reported on Wednesday, citing a source.

The outsized role of the United States in the global economy means that economic policy moves there can influence economic decisions in Europe, European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel said on Wednesday in Paris.

The judge who barred far-right leader Marine Le Pen from running in France's 2027 presidential election is under police protection after facing death threats, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Benedicte de Perthuis - the head of a three-judge panel that found Le Pen guilty of embezzling EU funds and handed her a five-year ban on seeking public office - is now receiving police protection at work and at home.

De Perthuis also received threats on social media, with her photo plastered all over X and far-right sites.

Paris police confirmed an investigation was underway into the threats, referring further queries to the Paris prosecutor's office, which did not respond.

Denmark's prime minister is visiting Greenland on Wednesday for talks with the territory's incoming government, following US President Donald Trump's repeated expressions of interest in controlling the Arctic island, Reuters reports.

Mette Frederiksen begins her three-day trip less than a week after a visit to the territory by US vice-president JD Vance received a frosty reception from authorities in Denmark and Greenland.

Greenland's incoming prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who won last month's general election and will form a coalition government, has said he welcomes Frederiksen‘s trip, stating on Monday that Denmark remains “Greenland's closest partner”.

Nielsen told Reuters on Monday that Greenland would strengthen its ties with Denmark until it could fulfil its ultimate wish to become a sovereign nation.

Meanwhile, Greenland wishes to establish a respectful relationship with the United States, he said.

“Talking about annexation and talking about acquiring Greenland and not respecting the sovereignty is not respectful, he said. “So let's start by being respectful to each other and build up a great partnership on everything.”

The introduction of new US tariffs would hit Italian producers hard, Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni said in Rome on Wednesday, adding that every effort should be made to avoid a trade war, Reuters reports.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to visit Hungary today, defying an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued over allegations of war crimes in Gaza.

During the visit, which runs until Sunday, Netanyahu will meet his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orbán, who invited him in November, soon after the ICC issued the arrest warrant.

Orbán said at the time that the warrant would “not be observed”.

All European Union member states, including Hungary, are members of the ICC, which means they are required to enforce its warrants.

Orbán, a right-wing nationalist, has often been at odds with the EU over democratic standards and human rights in Hungary.

The Times of Israel reported a source as saying Netanyahu and Orbán will discuss potential Hungarian support for US President Donald Trump's Gaza plan.

The Kremlin said on Wednesday that a visit to the US by President Vladimir Putin's envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, was “possible”, and that contacts with the US were continuing.

Reuters reported that Dmitriev is expected in Washington this week for talks with US President Donald Trump's administration.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Senators propose ‘hard-hitting' secondary sanctions and say ‘Russia is the aggressor'; ‘coalition of the willing' moves forward. What we know on day 1,134  

Half of the US Senate – 25 Republicans and 25 Democrats – have in a rare bipartisan move put forward sanctions that would be imposed on Russia if it refuses to engage in good faith negotiations with Ukraine and respect an eventual peace deal. The lead sponsors of the legislation, the Republican senator Lindsey Graham and the Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal, said: “The sanctions against Russia require tariffs on countries who purchase Russian oil, gas, uranium and other products. They are hard hitting for a reason.”

“The dominating view in the United States Senate is that Russia is the aggressor, and that this horrific war and Putin's aggression must end now and be deterred in the future,” they said. Companion legislation is being introduced in the House of Representatives, also with the support of both Republicans and Democrats. Backers say it will pass with overwhelming support in both chambers if Congress's Republican leaders allow a vote, but there was no immediate word on when a vote might take place.

It comes as both legislators and the Trump administration appear to recognise the US needs to put pressure on the Kremlin just as it has on Kyiv. US national security council spokesperson James Hewitt said: “There is a deep frustration with the Russian government over negotiations. President Trump was clear he will consider imposing secondary sanctions on all oil coming out of Russia if they are not serious about bringing this conflict to a peaceful resolution.”

The Reuters news agency reported that officials inside the White House and state department have acknowledged Vladimir Putin is actively resisting peace efforts and are discussing how to push Russia closer to a deal. The Kremlin on Tuesday complained that it cannot accept US ceasefire proposals in their current form. On Monday, European foreign ministers lined up to call out Vladimir Putin for, as top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas put it, “playing games and not really wanting peace”.

Speaking in Ukraine alongside Germany's visiting foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the US to ramp up sanctions on Russia after what he said were violations of a ceasefire on energy infrastructure. The Ukrainian president said the US had told Ukraine privately that it had seen the Russian violations. Russia has itself accused the Ukrainians of continuing to strike energy infrastructure, something Kyiv denies. Zelenskyy has for weeks declared Ukraine ready for an unconditional general ceasefire.

Ukraine will hold in-depth talks on Friday with a small group of foreign countries about contributing forces to a contingent that would act as a security guarantee for Ukraine, Zelenskyy said on Tuesday. The contingent would include a land component, an air component and a presence at sea. Britain's prime minister, Keir Starmer, has said British, French and Ukrainian military leaders will meet in the coming days to build on “real momentum” in efforts to boost Ukraine's security. Britain and France are leading efforts to form a “coalition of the willing” of Ukrainian allies.

Russia's advance in Ukraine has slowed for a fourth month, according to the Agence France-Presse news agency, which analysed data from the Institute for the Study of War.

People in Britain working with Russian authorities in any way will have to go on the UK's foreign influence register by 1 July or face five years in jail. The British Home Office minister, Dan Jarvis, told parliament it included “carrying out activity as part of any arrangement” with Russian authorities including government agencies, armed forces, intelligence services and the Moscow parliament. Russian political parties controlled by the Russian government, including the United Russia party, will also need to declare what they are doing before they can carry out activity in the UK.

Polish prosecutors said they had charged a Russian-born Ukrainian with spying on military installations in Poland for Russia's intelligence services. The 47-year-old man could face from five to 30 years in prison. Since the start of the Russian invasion, 44 people – Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians and Poles – have been detained in Poland on suspicions of espionage or sabotage.

The value of Russian assets frozen in Switzerland because of Russia's war on Ukraine has risen by nearly $2bn in the past year to more than $8bn, the Swiss government said on Tuesday. In addition, “14 real estate assets belonging to individuals, companies, or entities subject to sanctions” have been identified, as well as things such as sports cars and luxury cars, aircraft, artworks and furniture. Switzerland, usually neutral, decided four days after Russia invaded Ukraine to align itself with EU sanctions.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The US president made himself explicit this week by saying: ‘I'm not joking' when asked about his ambitions to stay in office

Jokes have a specific relation to Trumpian politics: they are the tip of the spear for introducing illegal or once-unacceptable ideas to the public, under a thick gloss of irony or plausible deniability, to advance a far-right agenda.

In 2016, Donald Trump's support from the young, online “alt-right” was underestimated in part because so much of the profession of love for Trump, and for his racist and authoritarian ambitions, came in the form of supposed jokes. Trump himself, meanwhile, uses humor to charm and titillate, making jokes to demean adversaries, get audiences on his side and hint, with winking coyness, about his next move. This has been his strategy for years.

So when analysts have asked, over the years he has been floating the possibility, whether Trump is joking or serious when he has said that he will seek a third term in office, in defiance of the constitution, the answer was never an either-or. The answer was “yes”: he was both joking, of course, and he was also entirely serious.

For those who still had not caught on to this game, Trump made himself helpfully explicit this week, in an interview with NBC News. “I'm not joking,” he said, when asked to clarify his ambitions to continue in office in violation of the 22nd amendment. “There are methods which you could do it [sic].” He acknowledged that he could possibly run as a vice-presidential candidate – in potential violation of the 12th amendment – and assume office once the presidential candidate on his ticket stepped aside, as one possible way to hold onto power. “But there are others, too,” he said. He refused to elaborate on what those other methods might be.

Constitutional lawyers – a group of people who seemingly cannot help but indulge in clever games of wordplay even when the republic is at stake – seemed to take up Trump's anti-constitutional authoritarian ambitions as something like a fun intellectual challenge.

“Anyone discounting a 3d Trump term per the 22d am + the 12th am is thinking magically,” wrote Larry Tribe, of Harvard Law, on Bluesky. “The 22nd dsn't bar *serving* a 3d term, only being *elected* 3 times. The 12th dsn't bar running for VP unless ‘ineligible to serve as Pres, but Trump isn't ineligible. QED! [sic.]'” This is more or less what the Trump supporters seem to be saying: that somehow, the plain meaning of the 22nd amendment – to prevent a dictator from seizing permanent control of the presidency – is not in effect – at least, not if Trump performs a sufficiently clever formal trick, something like the legal equivalent of a drunken dancer bending over backwards while proceeding underneath a limbo stick. In the event that that doesn't work, Andy Ogles, a Republican representative from Tennessee, has introduced a bill that would nullify the 22nd amendment for Trump's purposes – just in case.

But the wordplay and logical twisting that is taking place should be understood as pretextual, and completely irrelevant to what Trump is actually doing by declaring his intention to stay in office. Trump does not care about meeting the requirements – technical or substantive – of the 22nd amendment. That is because he does not care very much about the constitutional limits on his authority and will at all. Trump already considers himself a dictator. What he is saying, when he declares his intention to illegally run again, is not that he could find a way to do it that is plausibly legal. He is saying, instead, that the law does not apply to him. Trump is declaring that wherever the constitution contradicts his desires, the constitution is moot.

The Trump era has already been one of dramatic constitutional disintegration – one that his own accumulation of power and disregard for the law has accelerated but did not incite. The principle of popular sovereignty has been eroded by the US supreme court's systematic gutting of the 1965 Voting Rights Act – which has made voting more onerous, particularly for racial minorities and groups that tend to vote Democratic – and by their 2010 decision in Citizens United v FEC, which opened a floodgate of money into politics and allowed billionaires and other monied interests to manipulate the political process to their benefit.

Congress's scleroticism and stagnation have made the legislative body into little more than a media platform: Senators and representatives can use their notoriety and sometimes their subpoena power to make a point, but they are rarely in a position of making policy. Instead, much of the work that would have once been called legislating is now done by the federal courts, and by the executive. And that executive's power and prerogatives have expanded far beyond what is imagined by the drafters of article II – now carrying sweeping powers to pursue military acts of aggression abroad and a novel new impunity from prosecution for illegal deeds committed at home. The president – at least with Donald Trump – now looks like something much closer to a king, with the supreme court serving as something like a counsel of scheming viziers or gossiping court eunuchs.

Under such conditions of constitutional rot, it seems almost inevitable, in retrospect, that a failure to grasp the failures of the American political system would lead to the emergence of a strongman dictator. But one need not take such a long view of history to see the obvious truth that Donald Trump does not think that he should have to leave office just because the law says so.

One can look, instead, to recent history. After all, we already know what happens when Trump is supposed to leave the presidency: he holds onto it, refusing to go and encourages violence to try to get his way. Just because the attempted putsch did not work on January 6 does not mean that it did not signal a core feature of his theory of his own power: that any attempt to take it from him, be it by law or by custom or by the ballot box, is illegitimate. The 22nd amendment is hardly the first law that Trump has ignored in pursuit of this principle. He has never been a law-abiding man before. Why should we expect him to start now?

Prime minister says Israel will build a new security corridor to isolate parts of the strip in major escalation 

Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel is “seizing territory” and intends to “divide up” the Gaza Strip by building a new security corridor, amid a major expansion of aerial and ground operations in the besieged Palestinian territory.

“Tonight, we have shifted gears in the Gaza Strip. The [Israeli army] is seizing territory, hitting the terrorists and destroying the infrastructure,” the prime minister said in a video statement on Wednesday evening.

“We are also doing another thing – seizing the ‘Morag route'. This will be the second Philadelphi route, another Philadelphi route,” he said, referring to an Israeli-held corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border.

“Because we are currently dividing up the strip, we are adding pressure step by step, so that our hostages will be given to us,” Netanyahu added.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have seized buffer zones around Gaza's edges totalling 62 sq km, or 17% of the strip, since the war began in October 2023, according to the Israeli human rights group Gisha.

The Netzarim corridor, named for a defunct Israeli settlement, now cuts off Gaza City from the south of the strip.

Morag was a Jewish settlement that once stood between Rafah and Khan Younis, so the use of the name suggests the new corridor is designed to separate the two southern cities.

The Israeli prime minister's announcement follows remarks on Wednesday from his defence minister, Israel Katz, who said the Israeli army would “seize large areas” of Gaza, necessitating large-scale civilian evacuations.

Neither Netanyahu nor Katz elaborated on how much Palestinian land Israel intended to capture in the renewed offensive, but the move is likely to complicate ceasefire talks and inflame fears that Israel intends to take permanent control of the strip when the war ends.

Israel's newly stated intentions to establish another military corridor followed a night of intense airstrikes on Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza, which hospital officials said had killed at least 21 people.

An airstrike on Wednesday afternoon on a Jabaliya health clinic housing displaced people killed at least 19 people, including nine children, according to the civil defence agency.

The IDF said in a statement it had taken precautions to avoid civilian casualties in the bombing of what it said was a Hamas control centre in the Jabaliya refugee camp in the north of the strip. It later said it was aware the target was located in the same building as the clinic.

Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said in a statement that the strike hit “two rooms on the first floor of an Unrwa destroyed health centre” that had been used as a shelter for 160 displaced families.

“Many displaced families have not left the site, simply because they have absolutely nowhere else to go,” the statement said. The agency had shared the building's coordinates with the IDF, it added.

In Khan Younis, the bodies of five women, one of them pregnant, two children and three men from the same family were brought to Nasser hospital on Wednesday morning, medics said. The IDF said it was examining the reports of civilian deaths.

Palestinian media reported bombing and shelling along the Egyptian border, at least two airstrikes on Gaza City, and Israeli troop movement in the Rafah area. The IDF said it had deployed an extra division to southern Gaza early on Wednesday.

The Israeli military issued sweeping evacuation orders last week telling people in Rafah and a swath of land stretching northwards towards Khan Younis to move to al-Mawasi, an area on the shore that Israel has designated as a humanitarian zone but has repeatedly bombed.

Israel renewed intensive bombing across Gaza on 18 March, followed by the redeployment of ground troops, abruptly ending the two-month ceasefire and exchanges of Israeli hostages held by Palestinian militant groups and Palestinians in Israeli jails.

According to the terms of the truce, the sides were supposed to negotiate implementing further phases of the deal during the first 42-day stage, but the Israeli government repeatedly postponed the talks.

The latest UN estimate, from 23 March, suggested approximately 140,000 people had been displaced since the end of the ceasefire. More than 90% of the strip's population of 2.3 million have been forced to flee their homes during the conflict, many of them multiple times.

Hundreds of people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes since it ended the ceasefire. Israel has also cut off humanitarian aid, food and fuel to the strip in an effort to pressure Hamas. The month-long blockade is now the longest in the war to date.

Efforts led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to resume talks aimed at ending the war have not yet led to a breakthrough. The resumption of fighting in Gaza has also fuelled protests in Israel against the government from supporters of the remaining hostages and their loved ones.

The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents most captives' relatives, said it was “horrified to wake up this morning to the defence minister's announcement about expanding military operations in Gaza”.

The group said: “Our highest priority must be an immediate deal to bring ALL hostages back home – the living for rehabilitation and those killed for proper burial – and end this war.”

The 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel, in which Israel says 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, were killed and a further 250 taken captive, was the trigger for the conflict in Gaza, the worst war between Israel and the Palestinians in more than 70 years of fighting.

Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 50,357 people, the majority of them civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

This blog is now closed, you can follow Donald Trump's tariffs announcement live in our US colleagues' live blog

Reeves says the government will respond to the Trump tariffs in a calm way. She says he met big exporters this morning, and they support this approach too.

She says “the prize on offer is an economic agreement” and businesses do not want the government to do anything that would put this at risk.

The UK has “prepared for all eventualities” when it comes to looming US tariffs, with no response ruled out, Keir Starmer has told MPs before Donald Trump's so-called liberation day, which could spark a global trade war.

Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has told MPs that the government does not want to give a hasty response to the Trump tariffs because it does not want to put the “prize” of an economic deal with the US at risk. (See 3.36pm.) But, in evidence to the Commons Treasury committee, she said even with a deal with the US, the UK could still face difficulties. As Bloomberg reports, she said:

If we are able to secure an economic agreement with the United States, which we very much want to secure, and are working hard to secure, even if that is possible, it doesn't mean that somehow we are therefore out of the woods and not impacted by tariffs.

The specific tariffs on the UK are less relevant to the growth and inflation impacts than the global picture because we are an open trading economy and depressed demand from overseas because of tariffs, higher inflation overseas because of tariffs has a direct impact on the UK.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research thinktank has said much the same. In an assessment, it says:

Our estimates also show that the UK economy is vulnerable to the negative effects of US tariffs through both direct and indirect channels. We find that tariffs raise prices and weaken economic activity in the United Kingdom, with the size of the effects depending on the scope of the tariffs. Even if the United Kingdom were exempt from these tariffs, economic activity could still suffer due to broader global disruptions. In a worst-case scenario where high tariffs are applied, UK GDP growth could fall to zero next year.

Keir Starmer has accused the Conservatives of using a “fantasy figure” to claim that families will be £3,500 poorer due to the rise in employer national insurance contributions.

Patrick Harvie, the UK's longest serving parliamentary leader, has announced he is standing down as co-convener of the Scottish Greens after nearly 17 years in the role.

Airlines warned Heathrow about risks to its power supply days before the airport was shut down by a substation fire, a Commons committee has been told.

Greater Manchester offers a model for Britain as to how public services should be delivered and improved, Andy Burnham has said.

In a speech today at the Institute for Government, Burnham said that his city showed why combined authority mayoralties were the best way of delivering services locally. At the heart of this was “a place-first approach”.

The push for elected mayors started when Tony Blair was prime minister, but the concept was extended under the coalition and Conservative governments, with mayors being elected to run combined authorities – not just a single town or city, but a wider area, incorporating several local authorities.

In 2017 Burnham was the first person to be elected Greater Manchester mayor and his combined authority, which covers 10 boroughs, is the most powerful outside London.

In his speech, Burnham paid tribute to George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor, and Sir Howard Bernstein, the former Manchester city chief executive, for their work on the devolution deal that gave his authority its powers.

It had been a great success, he argued.

Since Greater Manchester and the UK government signed the first devolution deal a decade ago, our city-region has been the fastest-growing in the UK, with average annual growth of 3.1% over the last 10 years and the highest productivity growth.

The jury is in: the combined authority model of English devolution, pioneered by Greater Manchester, works. The scale of the achievement is all the more significant when you consider this was a decade of Brexit, Covid and all the shocks since …

The signature achievement is the successful introduction of a new, integrated public transport system, the Bee Network.

But just as significant, although less visible to the public, is the unique, highly-integrated model of public services built in close partnership with the private sector, our universities and the community and voluntary sector. I think we have the most integrated system of public services anywhere in the country.

The Labour government wants to extend the combined authority mayoral model and Burnham said this this approach was right.

In the mayoral combined authority model, the country has stumbled upon the game-changer that the British state has long needed.

It allows a coherent, whole-place approach and, if used properly, could provide the roadmap to a more streamlined and financially sustainable state, breaking down silos, joining the dots around people and places and, in the process, securing more value for public money. Particularly in an era when it is scarce.

And he said a “place-first approach” was at the crucial to making this work.

Combined authorities work best when they operate on the principle of place-first rather than party-first.

Unlike the divisions of party, place is a unifying force. However people vote, they are united by a desire to see the place where they live move forward.

These days, we are lacking things which unite us in common cause. If places have more agency, and a sense of forward direction, and those places are likely to be more cohesive and less divided.

A place-first approach also creates the right conditions for businesses to invest. It creates a long-term stability in direction that Westminster is simply not set up to provide.

Lord Hermer, the attorney general, has criticised MPs who make personal attacks on judges.

Giving evidence to the joint committee on human rights, Hermer said that it was “dangerous” to have a culture where judges are singled out for personal attack, not just on social media but in the House of Commons too.

Hermer seemed to be referring particularly to Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, who yesterday in effect called for Lord Justice William Davis, an appeal court judge, to be sacked as chair of the Sentencing Council.

But Keir Starmer has also been criticised recently for condemning a judicial decision in the Commons.

Hermer told the committee:

We are entering a dangerous moment in which not simply on social media but indeed on the floor of the House of Commons, people are attacking judges on a personal basis. That is entirely unacceptable and creates a huge threat to the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.

Jenrick, who led attacks on the Sentencing Council over guidelines that he described as amounting to “two-tier justice”, told MPs yesterday that he did not see how Davis could continue in office “given that he has brought [the council] into total disrepute”. Jenrick asked Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, if she would sack him.

During the exchanges yesterday, another Conservative, John Hayes, said that all members of the Sentencing Council should resign, and a third Tory, Desmond Swayne, said that Lady Sue Carr, the lady chief justice, should be “rebuked” for her “impertinence”.

He was referring to Carr writing a letter to the PM saying that Keir Starmer, and Kemi Badenoch, were wrong to criticise a decision in an immigration case (without naming the judge involved). Carr said that the government should respect the rule of law and, if it disagreed with a judicial decision, it should appeal it in the courts.

Under the last government ministers were given official legal advice encouraging them to approve policies that might have been unlawful, Lord Hermer, the attorney general, has said.

Hermer made the point in evidence to the joint committee on human rights this afternoon as he explained why he had revised the advice.

He said he had not changed the substance of what the advice said. But he had changed the tone, to prevent ministers being misled, he said. As PA Media reports, he explained:

There is nothing substantively new in the revised guidance that I put out.

The reason I brought it in as a revised guidance, without changing the substance but changing to some degree the tone, is because I had a very real concern on entering government as attorney that a practice had developed in which lawyers were being asked to advise ministers as to whether there was a ‘respectable legal argument' to support the policy or piece of legislation they wanted to introduce.

Hermer said “respectable legal argument” means something is highly likely to be unlawful but not “so bad you'd be struck off”. He went on:

My fear is that it was the default position and ministers were thinking it was respectable without realising it was highly likely to be unlawful.

Hermer said he changed the rules to give ministers an “unvarnished assessment” of the legal risk. He said the threshold “remains exactly the same” but he replaced the word “respectable” with “tenable” to reflect a “change in tone”.

There have been reports claiming some ministers blame Hermer for stopping them introducing bold policies by issuing over-cautious legal advice. But Hermer told the committee he did not accept this.

I don't think in any sense that is blocking or slowing up a government that wants to abide by the rule of law and ministers who want to abide by the ministerial code.

When Suella Braverman was attorney general, she reportedly changed the guidance to government lawyers to make it easier for ministers to put forward policies which were at risk of being found unlawful by the courts.

In his evidence Hermer also defended the government's decision to review the way the courts apply article 8 of ECHR when deciding whether migrants should have the right to remain in the UK. I have beefed up the post on this at 3.15pm to include quotes from him about how he thinks article 8 cases are frequently misreported.

The Labour MP John Grady asks Reeves what she thinks of calls for a wealth tax.

Reeves says he has already increased various taxes that impact particularly on the wealthy. As examples, she cites the non-dom tax, VAT on private school fees, the windfall tax on energy companies, the additional dwelling higher rate for stamp duty, the capital gains tax increase, and the inheritance tax increase.

Asked why the spring statement left the headroom almost exactly the same as it was in the budget last year (£9.9bn), Reeves said that she wanted roughly the same amount of headroom. But she said it was “it was accident, rather than design that it was exactly the same amount of headroom”.

Reeves says the government will respond to the Trump tariffs in a calm way. She says he met big exporters this morning, and they support this approach too.

She says “the prize on offer is an economic agreement” and businesses do not want the government to do anything that would put this at risk.

John Glen (Con) goes next.

Q: At our last hearing you said you would make strong representations to the US government about the importance of free trade. How successful have those been?

Reeves says she has spoken to her opposite number, Scott Bessent, and Jonathan Reynolds has had meeting with his counterparts.

Talks on a trade deal are underway, she says.

Q: But it's fair to say the consequences of what has already been announced are signficiant. The OBR forecast does not take into account any of the tariffs already imposed. Your headroom is very modest. And yesterday the OBR told us that further tariffs, in line with the car ones, will knock out your headroom. Are you still ruling out further taxes?

Reeves says she said the last budget was a once-in-a-generation tax increase.

Q: So you are ruling out further tax rises?

Reeves says she will not write future budgets in advance. She goes on:

I can assure the committee I will not need to repeat a budget on that scale because we have now wiped the slate clean and put our public finances on a firm footing.

The 2024 budget raised taxes by about £25bn.

Meg Hillier, the chair of the Treasury committee, asks Rachel Reeves if she has any message for businesses worried about the impact of the rise in employer national insurance.

Reeves says there are always consequences from a tax change.

Q: Do you worry that it means firms might cut investment?

Reeves says she speaks to businesses regularly.

If she had not taken the decisions in the budget, she would not have retained control of the public finances. And when you lose control, interest rates go up and bond yields go up.

She says the Bank of England has now had the confidence to cut interest rates three times.

Back at the Treasury committee, there is not much news being committed, and Rachel Reeves is having quite an easy time. It is bad news for John Crace, the Guardian's sketchwriter. He says:

Time was when chancellors feared an appearance before Treasury Select Cttee. This one is hopeless. Rachel Reeves is living the dream so far

At the weekend Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said she was reviewing how the courts apply article 8 of the European convention on human rights (ECHR), the right to private and family life, when deciding whether migrants should have the right to remain in the UK.

In evidence to the joint committee on human rights this afternoon, Lord Hermer, the attorney general, said it was “entirely right” to conduct a review like this.

Hermer said there has been a number of decisions at immigration tribunals on the basis of article 8 that are “capable of suggesting that it is not being applied properly or appropriately”. He went on

I want to make clear in all my comments about decisions of any court that I am categorically not criticising judges.

I think there is real merit in checking that article 8 is being properly understood and applied, because, as I've said, you can have a very, very robust but fair process in asylum and immigration context that is entirely compatible with article 8.

We need to just check that there's a right calibration on casework decisions.

We may also need to check … that government is being robust in appealing decisions that we don't like, that there's a litigation strategy that meets that aim.

UPDATE: Hermer said that some of the reporting about article 8 was inaccurate. He said:

There is clearly a lot of information, misinformation, that is being whipped up in the context of asylum and immigration in particular, article 8.

Many of you will have heard banded around the idea that the courts have allowed a foreign national offender to stay here because his child will miss chicken McNuggets.

That is doing the rounds. What is not doing the rounds is that that case went to the upper tribunal, who categorically rejected that as an article 8 argument. They rejected the claim.

Courts are always going to make mistakes. That's why we have appeal courts, and that's what's happened here.

Reeves says it is important to have just one major fiscal event a year. In the last parliament there were many, and that created uncertaintly.

Q: Is it is important to you to have two forecasts every year? Because obviously that constrains you.

Reeves says she does not feel that. She says she chose to update her plans in the light of the OBR forecast. But she goes on:

We could have chosen to say we would address issues of the headroom the budget, but I did think it was important to show how important we take fiscal sustainability, fiscal stability, and so that's why we made the decisions we did.

This is interesting. In his column in the Observer on Sunday Andrew Rawnsley said Keir Starmer now agrees with the many commentators who think having the OBR revise its forecasts every six months is distorting policy making. Rawnsley wrote:

[The OBR] also made life difficult for the chancellor in the short-term by telling her that she'd bust her rules unless she made additional spending reductions. The complaint is that policymaking has become too subservient to satisfying OBR guesstimates about what growth and debt might be in five years. I have it on exceedingly good authority that the prime minister himself has come to the view that it is unhelpful, to the point of being barmy, that the government has to live in dread of an OBR report card every six months, rather than face an annual verdict at budget time.

(I have no idea who Rawnsely's source was, but “on exceedingly good authority” is the sort of thing columnists write when they have recently had a private chat with the PM.)

The Rawnsley column suggests Starmer would like to change the rules so that the OBR only updates its forecasts once a year. Reeves' reply just now implies she is happy with the status quo.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The Real Madrid coach, Carlo Ancelotti, who is on trial for allegedly defrauding Spain's tax office of more than €1m in undeclared earnings from image rights, has told a court he believed his financial affairs were in order and “never thought a fraud could have been committed”.

Prosecutors allege the 65-year-old former Chelsea and Everton manager used shell companies outside Spain to conceal “the real beneficiary of the income from the exploitation of his image rights” in 2014 and 2015. They are seeking a jail term of four years and nine months and a fine of €3.2m.

Giving evidence on Wednesday, the first morning of the two-day trial in Madrid, Ancelotti said he had focused on his salary and had left other financial matters in the hands of his advisers. “I've never been bothered about image rights,” he told the court. “Coaches aren't that important – it's the players who sell shirts. I was only bothered about getting the €6m net for three years and I never realised that something wasn't right and I didn't receive any notification that I was under investigation by tax prosecutors.”

The manager said that when Real Madrid had proposed a payment scheme under which 15% of his salary would be paid from his image rights, he had said yes and had referred the matter to his British adviser. “I thought it was quite normal,” he said, adding that all the players and the previous coach had done the same thing.

“I got in touch with my British adviser and I didn't think any more about it because it all seemed right,” he said. “I never thought a fraud could have been committed. But, given that I'm here, I guess things weren't done that right.”

Prosecutors allege that, despite his status as a Spanish resident for tax purposes, Ancelotti declared only his personal earnings from the club and omitted the income he received from the sale of his image rights. The prosecutors allege that he failed to pay a total of €1,062,079 in tax on the sale of those rights, which amounted to €1.24m in 2014 and €2.96m the following year.

Ancelotti, the most successful manager in Champions League history, denies the charges. “I have total confidence in the law and in justice,” he said on Friday. “I'm not worried but I am obviously annoyed if they say that I've committed fraud, but, once again, I have total confidence in justice.”

The Italian is the latest high-profile football figure to find himself pursued by Spain's tax authorities in recent years. In July 2016, Lionel Messi and his father, Jorge, were sentenced to 21 months in prison for evading tax on Lionel's image rights during his time at Barcelona, with more than €4m owed in back payments. Both were spared jail time because sentences of under two years in Spain do not have to be served, and neither man had a criminal record.

Six years ago, Cristiano Ronaldo admitted committing tax fraud while playing for Real Madrid and agreed to pay an €18.8m fine after striking a deal with prosecutors and tax authorities in return for a 23-month suspended prison sentence.

Here's a recap of the day so far. Israel's military operation in the Gaza Strip is expanding to seize “large areas,” according to defence minister Israel Katz. Officials at hospitals inside the Palestinian territory said Israeli strikes overnight and into Wednesday had killed more than 30 people, nearly a dozen of them children.
Israel says it is expanding its offensive in the Palestinian territory “to crush and clean the area” of militants and to seize “large areas that will be added to the security zones of the State of Israel”.
 The Israeli government has long maintained a buffer zone just inside Gaza along its security fence and has greatly expanded since the war began in 2023. Israel says the buffer zone is needed for its security, while Palestinians view it as a land grab.
 Katz didn't specify which areas of Gaza would be seized in the expanded operation, which he said includes the “extensive evacuation” of the population from fighting areas. His statement came after Israel ordered the full evacuation of the southern city of Rafah and nearby areas.

The Hostage Families Forum, which represents most captives' families, said that it was “horrified to wake up this morning to the defense minister's announcement about expanding military operations in Gaza.” The group said the Israeli government “has an obligation to free all 59 hostages from Hamas captivity — to pursue every possible channel to advance a deal for their release.”

Israel continued to target the Gaza Strip, with airstrikes overnight killing 17 people in the southern city of Khan Younis. Another 15 people were killed in a strike in the north of the strip Wednesday, according to officials at hospitals where the bodies were taken.

Officials at the Nasser Hospital said the bodies of 12 people killed in an overnight airstrike that were brought to the hospital included five women, one of them pregnant, and two children. Officials at the Gaza European Hospital said they received five bodies of people killed in two separate airstrikes.

Officials at the Indonesian Hospital said an Israeli strike on a building of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, in the Jabaliya refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip killed 15 people, including nine children and two women. The Palestinian Civil Defense said the building had been an UNRWA clinic that was now being used to house displaced people.

Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to visit Hungary later today, despite an arrest warrant from the international criminal court (ICC) putting him at risk while visiting states that are signatories to the court. It is unclear what this means for Hungary's membership of the ICC.

Israel's defence minister has said the country intends to “seize large areas” of the Gaza Strip amid a major expansion of aerial and ground operations in the besieged Palestinian territory

Israel Katz said in a statement on Wednesday that “troops will move to clear areas of terrorists and infrastructure, and seize extensive territory that will be added to the state of Israel's security areas”

Katz also said he was calling on Palestinian civilians to flee areas where fighting had returned after the collapse of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas last month and to “act now to overthrow Hamas and return all the hostages”

Israel continued to target the Gaza Strip, with airstrikes overnight killing 17 people in the southern city of Khan Younis. Another 15 people were killed in a strike in the north of the strip Wednesday, according to officials at hospitals where the bodies were taken. Among those killed by the strikes were at five women, one of them pregnant, and two children

The Israeli military issued sweeping evacuation orders last week for people in Rafah and a swath of land stretching northwards towards Khan Younis to move to al-Mawasi, an area on the shore that Israel has designated as a humanitarian zone but repeatedly bombed

Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to travel to Hungary, despite the host country being a signatory to the international criminal court (ICC), which has issued an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister on suspicion of war crimes

Hamas and Jordan's foreign ministry criticised far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir for a visit to Jerusalem's holiest sites on Wednesday morning. Jordan called it “a dangerous escalation, unacceptable provocation, and desecration of the holiness of the al-Aqsa mosque”

A demonstration has taken place in Jerusalem, with protesters calling for the government to enact a new conscription law which would end the exemption ultra-Orthodox Jewish men have on serving in the IDF

Crowds gathered in Nablus for the funeral of a 33-year-old man, Hamza al-Hamash, who was shot and killed by Israeli forces in the Israeli-occupied city earlier on Wednesday. Israeli forces also reportedly made arrests in Hebron, Tulkarm and Nour Shams

A demonstration has taken place in Jerusalem today, with protesters calling for the government to enact a new conscription law, which would end the exemption ultra-Orthodox Jewish men have on serving in the IDF. The march to the Knesset included the families of soldiers killed during the war in Gaza, as well as reservist soldier. The issue has been a political thorn for Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government for some time.

Israel's military has announced that an incident involving the “suspicion of a hostile aircraft infiltration” near Kissufim has concluded. It said no injuries were reported. Kissufim is close to Israel's border with the Gaza Strip, and is to the north-east of Khan Younis.

The sweeping forced displacement orders issued by Israel's armed forces to civilians in Gaza this week have placed increased pressure on the delivery of humanitarian aid to people in the south of the territory.

Crowds have gathered in Nablus for the funeral of 33-year-old man, Hamza al-Hamash, who was shot and killed by Israeli forces in Israeli-occupied Nablus earlier on Wednesday.

Jordan has also criticised far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir for his visit to Jerusalem's holiest sites earlier today.

In a statement Jordan's foreign ministry said “The entrance of the far-right minister into al-Aqsa mosque while accompanied by the occupation's police brings a dangerous escalation, unacceptable provocation, and desecration of the holiness of the al-Aqsa mosque and the historic and legal status quo in place. Israel has no sovereignty over occupied Jerusalem, or Islamic and Christian holy sites.”

Hamas has condemned a visit on Wednesday by Israel's far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir to the al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem, calling it a “provocative and dangerous escalation”.

In a statement reported by AFP, the Palestinian militant group called for Palestinians “and our youth in the West Bank to escalate their confrontation ... in defence of our land and our sanctities, foremost among them the blessed al-Aqsa mosque”.

The disputed site is sacred to both Jews and Muslims.

The Palestinian Civil Defense said the building had been an UNRWA clinic that was now being used to house displaced people.

Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to visit Hungary later today, despite an arrest warrant from the international criminal court (ICC) putting him at risk while visiting states that are signatories to the court. It is unclear what this means for Hungary's membership of the ICC.

In a statement on its official Telegram channel, Israel's military has claimed to have struck at Hamas targets in Jabalia in Gaza.

In the message it claimed that “terrorists were hiding inside a command and control centre that was being used for coordinating terrorist activity and served as a central meeting point for the terrorist organization. Additionally, the compound was used by the Hamas' Jabalia Battalion to plan terror attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops.”

Palestinian sources claim that on Wednesday 19 people had been killed, including nine children, in Israeli stikes on the Jabalia area. Wafa reported that “residents struggled to identify the victims” after the strikes caused a fire.

In his earlier statement, Israel's defense minister Israel Katz said the renewed offensive in Gaza was “expanding to crush and clean the area of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure and capture large areas that will be added to the security zones of the state of Israel.”

Reuters notes that according to the Israeli rights group Gisha, Israel has already taken control of about 62 square kilometres, some 17% of the total area of Gaza, as part of a buffer zone around the edges of the territory.

Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to visit Hungary later today, despite an arrest warrant from the international criminal court (ICC) putting him at risk while visiting states that are signatories to the court. The trip was announced by the Israeli prime minister's office on Sunday.

Yesterday, Human Rights Watch urged Hungary to deny him entry, or carry out an arrest. Liz Evenson, international justice director, said“[Viktor] Orbán invitation to Netanyahu is an affront to victims of serious crimes. Hungary should comply with its legal obligations as a party to the ICC and arrest Netanyahu if he sets foot in the country.”

In November 2024 the international criminal court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Israel's former defense minister Yoav Gallant and the Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif for alleged war crimes relating to the Gaza war.

The visit to Hungary will be Netanyahu's second venture abroad since the warrant was issued. In February he met with US president Donald Trump in Washington. Neither Israel or the US are ratified signatories to the court.

Global children's charity Plan International UK has issued a statement after Israel announced it was planning to seize large areas of Gaza. Kathleen Spencer Chapman said:

We utterly condemn Israel's intention to expand its military violence in Gaza. These are ruthless acts of aggression against a starving and traumatised population. The people of Gaza have no shelter, no means of protecting themselves, and Israel's illegal blockade has left medics without the supplies they need to treat the wounded. This isn't war. This is an atrocity.

World leaders must put a stop to this horror. The ceasefire must be reinstated and aid allowed back into and throughout Gaza. Children and their families are in desperate need of food, water, medical supplies, and shelter. Without a ceasefire and an urgent influx of humanitarian aid, thousands more could die from hunger and related diseases alone.

Plan International UK works across over 80 countries, supporting girls against poverty, violence and discrimination.

In a statement, Germany's foreign office says it has worked with Israeli authorities to assist 19 German citizens and their close family members in traveling from Gaza to Germany, Associated Press reports.

The statement described it as a routine wartime evacuation, adding “Since the beginning of the war in Gaza, the German government has repeatedly and intensively advocated for the departure and safety of German citizens.”

Former hostage Romi Gonen has posted to social media to say that “Every explosion shatters the hostages' hopes a little more. I was there. I know.”

Gonen was released from Hamas captivity on 19 January, having been held for over 15 months since being seized and abducted on 7 October 2023.

She added in the post “I beg of the decision-makers. Don't wait another moment. Bring back all 59 hostages.”

Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Gaza.

In a statement on its official Telegram channel, Israel's military claims it has killed “an armed terrorist … approaching the security fence in southern Gaza.”

The IDF said that he “posed a threat to IDF troops”. The statement added that there were no IDF casualties.

The death toll from Israeli strikes on Gaza in the last few hours has been put at 21 by medical sources who spoke to Al Jazeera. At least 12 Palestinians were killed by a strike on a house in Khan Younis. Here are some of the latest images sent over the news wire.

The father of one of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza, Alon Ohel, has spoken to Hebrew media outlet Ynet, saying that he is “worried” by the announcement that Israel intends to expand its military operation in Gaza again and “capture large areas.”

Kobi Ohel said “I woke up to another day that I am worried and afraid for Alon's fate. From what we know and have seen, fighting did not bring the kidnapped people home, and the way to return them is through a deal. Alon needs to be returned and saved.”

Israeli airstrikes on the southern city of Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip have killed 17 people, Associated Press reports hospital officials have said.
 The bodies of 12 people killed in an overnight airstrike were brought to Nasser hospital, officials said Wednesday, and the victims included five women, one of them pregnant, and two children. Three men from the same family were killed, as were the owners of the house that was bombed, officials said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

But I have a plan to counter it","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/02/donald-trump-elon-musk-capitalism-us-democracy","Wed, 02 Apr 2025 17:46:00 GMT","

The speed with which US democracy is being dismantled is dizzying, but if we organise resistance now we can stop this

Everything is moving too fast. The Trump-Musk administration is tearing through US government, universities and health organisations, firing tens of thousands of employees, eliminating billons in funding. The scope and speed of the attack is dizzying. It is almost impossible to keep up with the ongoing destruction, let alone to organise the resistance. None of this is accidental.

We need to understand the origins of the Trump blitzkrieg to counter it in the US and prevent it from spreading abroad. The speed of the attack can be traced to Trump strategist and “accelerationist” Steve Bannon, and aligns with his information warfare tactic to “flood the zone” to confuse, disengage and disorient. Whether on climate or Covid, rumours, lies and conspiracy theories create a chaotic cacophony, leaving the public disoriented, fearful and prey to oversimple Trumpist messages: blame the woke, migrants, transgender people, Muslims, doctors, scientists. Musk's purchase of Twitter/X supports Bannon's agenda.

What we are seeing is the coming together of two major forces of the Trump world: the fossil fuel-funded Heritage Foundation and the world of tech. The former authored Project 2025, a plan for Trump's first year in office. Curtis Yarvin, PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel's favoured theorist, has expressed the desire to “reboot” a whole country, substituting the outmoded democracy software with something far less accountable and more business-friendly. Together, both industries poured hundreds of millions into Trump's campaign.

So far, regulatory positions have been eliminated, cryptocurrency will be able to bypass democratic oversight, budgets have been cut to allow Musk to cash in with SpaceX and Starlink contracts, and fired government employees are to be replaced with AI products.

Many industries sense the winds of change and no longer even bother with greenwashing or climate commitments, as they drop all pretence of responsibility for a livable world. The climate and ecological implications of this shift are as disastrous as they are deliberate. We need an appropriate name for this new era of fossil and tech bros accelerating attacks on democracy and the planet: cataclysm capitalism.

Cataclysm capitalism is the worthy heir to neoliberalism and its disaster capitalism. As Naomi Klein described in her book The Shock Doctrine, neoliberal economic ideology took advantage of crises to deregulate and privatise public services, hobble trade unions and civil society, and generally create conditions ideal for private wealth accumulation and disastrous for equality, work and welfare. Cataclysm capitalism does all this, and goes further. The pace of change is accelerated, the dismantling of public institutions more complete, the attack on democracy more overt. Perhaps the most frightening aspect is that the industries laughing in the face of planetary and social destruction have made a clear calculus: they don't need prosperous economies to profit. Neoliberalism at least claimed to be serving a form of greater good via winner-takes-all market competition. Cataclysm capitalism dispenses with this illusion altogether.

The fossil fuel companies, the rightwing tech magnates and the financial companies hurrying in their wake have somehow convinced themselves that they don't need prosperous economies to prosper themselves. They have learned to profit from disruption and destruction. They know from experience that immiserated populations will endure exploitative working conditions and go deep into debt to keep themselves and their families alive.

Paradoxically, the creation of vast economic insecurity favours far-right politics. Voters in a constant state of fear and stress, without a clear understanding of the system creating hardships, are an easy prey for far-right rhetoric blaming migrants, woke and trans people. Sadly, since neoliberal ideology has devoured previously centre-left parties (UK Labour and US Democrats), we are left with much less of an organised opposition, and much more of a pipeline to accelerating disaster.

The picture is grim. We are faced with an organised hostile takeover of democracy, coupled with a dismantling of the economy in favour of the sectors and industries most beneficial to the fossil-fuel and tech magnates, to our detriment and the detriment of all life on Earth. What can we do? I propose a three-pronged plan, short and schematic – enough to get started.

First, understanding is power. We need to learn more about the devourers of our world, from the fossil fuel thinktanks to the far-right tech accelerationists. We need to explain to our fellow citizens who we are facing, and what their ultimate plan is. Replace helpless fear with knowledgable anger.

Second, we need to organise, come together, in trade unions, in neighbourhood groups, in any collectives we can form. At this point, we were all raised in neoliberal cultures of individualism and isolation. Organising sounds foreign and difficult. Indeed, our learned organisational helplessness is integral to the endeavour of disaster capitalism.

However, as an exceptionally cooperative species, in reality, we all have impressive innate capacity. Quite literally, organising is what we, as social animals, were born to do. At its most basic forms, organising consists of gathering people, raising awareness of the causes of our common problems, discussing possible avenues of action, putting them into operation. Rinse, repeat; make it part of your life's hobbies and work.

Third, we need to respond to the Trump-Musk project at the strategic level, not blow by blow. We know we can expect nothing but destruction and corruption from them: we have to put forward a positive vision, worth fighting for. From my research, I would describe it as scientifically informed democratic decision-making for the common good. This also means creating our own organisations for mutual aid and protection of vulnerable people. We have everything to lose if we don't act, and everything to gain if we do.

Louise Haigh calls for end to two-tier system over complaints of sexual misconduct or harassment

Bosses should be banned from the “improper” use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) for low-paid workers in the service, retail or hospitality sectors, a former cabinet minister has said, as she calls for an end to a two-tier system for victims.

Louise Haigh, the former transport secretary, has urged MPs to look beyond high-profile cases linked to the #MeToo movement and advocate for workers in insecure employment who may not have “the means and the confidence to pursue their employers through the courts” to be able to challenge the NDAs.

Haigh is due to tell her colleagues in a Westminster Hall debate on Wednesday: “If mental health charities are exploiting this practice to discriminate against people with mental health issues then we have to accept that it is a serious problem in every type of workplace in this country.”

Last month, the Labour MP tabled an amendment to the employment rights bill that would bring an end to the widespread misuse of NDAs. She invoked parliamentary privilege during the debate on the legislation, to reveal the use of NDAs at ITN to cover up cases of workplace harassment.

Haigh is campaigning for the government's policy on NDAs to be changed so it aligns with existing protections those employed in higher education institutions receive.

She noted the Higher Education Act 2023 prevented universities from entering into NDAs with staff, students or visiting speakers in regards to complaints of sexual misconduct or harassment.

Haigh was due to share chilling testimonies from low-paid workers who have been affected by the practice.

She would discuss: “The woman who was raped by a colleague at work but had signed a confidentiality clause that prevented her from discussing the issue even with medical professionals made it impossible to recover from her trauma.

“The employee who signed an NDA on leaving her workplace and has since been effectively blacklisted as her former employer is undermining her to prospective employers whilst she cannot tell her side of the story.

“Or the woman who told about the mental health charity she works for, which has discriminated on disability grounds against at least four people in the last year that she is personally aware of. Three of them have signed an NDA, she is bravely pursuing them through the courts because she believes it's the only way to get justice.”

Statistics from the Can't Buy My Silence campaign found 100% of NDAs or confidentiality clauses were written broadly. It means workers who may not think twice about signing their contracts may unwittingly overlook the broadly drafted confidentiality clauses that Haigh says “go far further than is require to protect commercial confidentiality or trade secrets”.

Haigh is due to say: “Let's not let this opportunity pass us by. Let this Labour government lead the way on protecting victims and survivors in the workplace and finally bring an end to legalised abuse.”

The co-founder of Can't Buy My Silence Zelda Perkins said: “The government has an opportunity to put Labour values into practice by legislating to protect workers' rights and remove barriers to work by taking action on abusive NDAs. The current two-tiered situation, where only workers in higher education are protected from abusive NDAs is untenable – all workers deserve protection from being silenced in the workplace.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Senior doctor who saw bodies says men appeared to have been ‘executed', adding to evidence of potential war crime

Some of the bodies of 15 Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers, killed by Israeli forces and buried in a mass grave nine days ago in Gaza, were found with their hands or legs tied and had gunshot wounds to the head and chest, according to two witnesses.

The witness accounts add to an accumulating body of evidence pointing to a potentially serious war crime on 23 March, when Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance crews and civil defence rescue workers were sent to the scene of an airstrike in the early hours of the morning in the al-Hashashin district of Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city.

International humanitarian teams were only allowed access to the site this weekend. One body was recovered on Saturday. Fourteen more were found in a sandy grave at the site on Sunday and were brought back for autopsies in the nearby city of Khan Younis.

Dr Ahmed al-Farra, a senior doctor at the Nasser medical complex in Khan Younis, witnessed the arrival of some of the remains.

“I was able to see three bodies when they were transferred to the Nasser hospital. They had bullets in their chest and head. They were executed. They had their hands tied,'' Farra said. “They tied them so they were unable to move and then they killed them.”

He provided photographs he said he had taken of one of the dead on arrival at the hospital. The pictures show a hand at the end of a long-sleeved black shirt with a black cord knotted around the wrist.

Another person, an eyewitness who took part in the recovery of remains from Rafah on Sunday, also said they saw evidence of one of the dead having been shot after being detained.

“I saw the bodies with my own eyes when we found them in the mass grave,” the witness, who did not want his name used for his own safety, told the Guardian in a telephone interview. “They had signs of multiple shots in the chest. One of them had legs tied. One was shot in the head. They were executed.”

The accounts add to allegations made by a senior Palestinian Red Crescent official, the Palestinian Civil Defence and the Gaza health ministry that some of the victims had been shot after they were detained and put in restraints by Israeli troops.

The incident came after the Israeli government ended a two-month-old ceasefire and resumed its military campaign against Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza on 17 March, with heavy aerial bombing and ground operations. The people of Rafah were ordered to leave the town on Monday, before Israeli ground operations there.

The international criminal court issued arrest warrants for war crimes in November against the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and the ICC prosecutor has said he is still investigating Israeli forces and Hamas for suspected atrocities.

The victims are believed to have been killed on 23 March, two of them in the early hours when their ambulance came under Israeli fire while on the way to collect injured people from an earlier airstrike. The remaining 13 of the dead were in a convoy of ambulances and civil defence vehicles dispatched to retrieve the bodies of their two colleagues. One of the dead was a UN employee. A Red Crescent paramedic, named as Assad al-Nassasra, is still missing.

The UN said the ambulances and other vehicles were buried in sand by bulldozers alongside the bodies of the dead, in what appears to have been an attempt to cover up the killings. UN video footage taken by the recovery team showed a crushed UN vehicle, ambulances and a fire truck that had been flattened and buried in the sand by the Israeli military.

“This is a huge blow to us … These people were shot,” Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN aid coordination office, said on Tuesday. “Normally we are not at a loss for words and we are spokespeople, but sometimes we have difficulty finding them. This is one of those cases.”

Israel's military has said its “initial assessment” of the incident had found that its troops had opened fire on several vehicles “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”, and has claimed, so far without evidence, that Hamas fighters and other militants had been using the ambulances for cover.

The Israel Defense Forces have so far not responded to questions, first posed on Monday, about the reports that the bodies and their vehicles had been buried or to the allegations that some had been shot after being detained.

Dr Bashar Murad, the Red Crescent's director of health programmes in Gaza, said at least one of the recovered bodies of the paramedics had had his hands tied, and that one of the paramedics had been on a call to the ambulance dispatcher when the attack took place.

On that call, Murad said, gunshots fired at close range could be heard as well as the voices of Israeli soldiers on the scene speaking in Hebrew, ordering the detention of at least some of the paramedics.

“The gunshots were fired from a close distance. They could be heard on the call between signal officer and of the medical crews that survived and phoned the ambulance centre for help. The soldiers' voices were clearly audible in Hebrew and very close, as well as the sound of the gunfire.”

“Gather them at the wall and bring some restraints to tie them,” was one of the lines that Murad said could be heard by the dispatcher. He said the call had not been recorded.

Mahmoud Basal, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defence in Gaza, said the bodies had been found with at least about 20 gunshots in each of them and confirmed that “at least one of them had their legs bound”.

In a statement released on Monday, Gaza's health ministry said: “They were executed, some of them handcuffed and had sustained head and chest injuries. They were buried in a deep hole to prevent their identities from being identified.”

On Monday the IDF issued evacuation orders covering most of Rafah, indicating it could soon launch another major ground operation, eight days after the paramedics and rescue workers were killed.

According to the Red Crescent, an ambulance was dispatched to pick up the casualties from the airstrike in the early hours of 23 March and called for a support ambulance. The first ambulance arrived at hospital safely but contact was lost with the support ambulance at 3.30am. An initial report from the scene said it had been shot at and the two paramedics inside killed.

The Palestinian Red Crescent president, Dr Younis al-Khatib, said the IDF had impeded the collection of the bodies for several days. The IDF said it had facilitated the evacuation of bodies as soon as “operational circumstances” allowed.

“The bodies were recovered with difficulty as they were buried in the sand, with some showing signs of decomposition,” the Red Crescent said.

Their burial had been put off pending autopsies at the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. The autopsies have now been carried out, according to hospital sources, and a full report is due to be delivered to the Gaza health ministry within 10 days.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

American and European leaders are the authors of this latest atrocity by their Israeli colleagues in Gaza

The Guardian reports that Israeli troops “killed 15 Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers one by one”. “One by one” is another way of saying one person after another, which is another way of saying premeditated murder. Fifteen times over.

Dr Bashar Murad, the director of health programs at the Palestine Red Crescent, told reporters that one of the men who was executed by the Israelis was on the phone with colleagues. The victim had been injured and was requesting help.

“A few minutes later, during the call, we heard the sound of Israeli soldiers arriving at the location, speaking in Hebrew. The conversation was about gathering the team, with statements like: ‘Gather them at the wall and bring some restraints to tie them.' This indicated that a large number of the medical staff were still alive.”

The Israeli army, for its part, claimed that the area was “an active combat zone”. Soldiers fired on the ambulances because they were “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”.

No one believes the army's lies at this point. They serve a purpose; like all shoddy propaganda or misinformation, they work to obscure what is heartrendingly clear: the destruction of all Palestinian life is a matter of policy for Israel's army. The genocide is a policy matter in that country.

Isaac Herzog, Israel's president, explained his country's logic early on: “It is an entire nation out there that is responsible. It is not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved. It is absolutely not true.”

For those who support its actions – most of the Israeli public, if polls are to be believed – the army misinformation is a signal that the leadership regards the executions as a non-issue. Carry on – Eurovision is just around the corner.

News of the executions come after an anonymous Israeli soldier wrote a column in the Israeli paper Haaretz entitled, “In Gaza, Almost Every IDF Platoon Keeps a Human Shield, a Sub-army of Palestinian Slaves.”

In it, he describes how widespread the practice of utilizing human shields is in the Israeli army:

“Today, almost every platoon keeps a [human shield] and no infantry force enters a house before a [human shield] clears it. This means there are four [human shields] in a company, twelve in a battalion, and at least 36 in a brigade. We operate a sub-army of slaves.”

I was born in Tal al-Sultan, where the Israeli troops executed the paramedics. I know how far the neighborhood is from the beach, and what the offshore wind feels like in the spring. I remember what the Philadelphi route – the barrier between Gaza and Egypt – looked like the last time the Israelis occupied it. Now, Tal al-Sultan is hell on earth, which is what an Israeli military leader promised to make it at the start of the genocide, 18 months ago.

When I first learned that Israeli men had zip-tied the paramedics before executing them, I thought of their terror – how I would feel in their place. I imagined them in constraints and lined up, facing the unbridled malice of their executioners. Did they think of their wives and children – the pain of being separated from them forever? Did they still their hearts – or find peace in their final moments?

Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif, Mohammed Bahloul, Mohammed Hilieh, Mustafa Khafaja, Saleh Muammar, Rifaat Radwan and Ezzedine Shaat, and their colleagues whose names I haven't been able to find were heroes. They spent their last hours on earth on a mission to render aid, to save people. Instead, we learn that they were in a race to the grave. And for what?

The murderers' state of mind is hinted at by the aftermath of the crime. The Israeli soldiers dug a mass grave to hide their victims' bodies. They crushed an ambulance under a bulldozer and attempted to bury that too. I wondered briefly if their crimes would haunt them, before I realized it didn't matter.

The Israeli men who executed 15 unarmed paramedics got away with it. Whether the Israelis enjoyed themselves as they murdered their victims, or whether they will blitz their brains with drugs to forget doesn't matter. Just as with the men who executed Hind Rajab, a five-year-old child, individually, they will have got away with it because their society offers them safe haven. All of Europe and the US is their playground.

Nor will global leaders intervene to end the mass murder which has been punctuated by this latest obscenity. Some of them – such as Emmanuel Macron, who called for a ceasefire, might appear to want to end the slaughter. After all, dead babies in incubators and paramedics in a mass grave are unpleasant garlands to wear. But 18 months in, they are too deeply implicated. Who can forget Ursula von der Leyen's embrace of Netanyahu? Or Keir Starmer's affirmation of Israel's “right” to starve Palestinians in Gaza?

Today, those who are tasked with upholding international law have been co-opted by the Israeli leadership, whether they like it or not. The logic of gangland drug dealers and criminals – new members commit crimes to join, and are locked in – prevails.

So far from being complicit, US and European leaders are the authors of this latest atrocity by their Israeli colleagues in Gaza.

As for the rest of us, we can take note, and we can remember. There will be no Nuremberg for the Palestinians, but we can honor the memory of all those who fought to live. And who were exterminated for having lived at all.

Indigenous teenager re-admitted to hospital after suffering seizures and ‘in a bad way', doctor tells court

An Indigenous teenager with head injuries was released from a hospital only to be re-admitted hours later in a worse condition, which led to his death, a murder trial has been told.

Cassius Turvey, a 15-year-old Noongar Yamatji boy, died 10 days after prosecutors said he was allegedly chased, knocked to the ground and “deliberately struck to the head” with a metal pole in Perth's eastern suburbs on 13 October 2022.

Emergency doctor William Begg treated Cassius at Midland public hospital in the hours after he was allegedly attacked.

He told the court Cassius had suffered multiple head injuries, including a 5cm laceration on his forehead.

“It penetrated all layers of the skin to expose the skull,” Begg told the West Australian supreme court on Wednesday. “It was quite a clean laceration.”

He also found a bruise near Cassius's temple and a “complex” wound that “penetrated the full thickness of [his] ear”, the court heard.

He observed that Cassius was asking the same questions repeatedly, prompting Begg to order a CT scan of his head. That found bleeding inside Cassius's brain and bleeding between his brain and his skull.

Aleesha Louise Gilmore, 23, her boyfriend Jack Steven James Brearley, 23, and his mates Brodie Lee Palmer, 29, and Mitchell Colin Forth, 26, are on trial, charged with murdering Cassius.

Prosecutors allege Brearley struck Cassius in the head twice with a metal shopping trolley pole while “hunting for kids” because somebody had smashed his car windows. They allege Forth, Palmer and Gilmore helped him and knew his intent before the incident.

The jury heard paramedics took Cassius to the hospital after the alleged attack about 5.30pm and Begg treated him about 9.30pm, a “brief time” after he was triaged. Under cross-examination by Brearley's lawyer, Simon Watters, Begg said he was unaware of the delay.

Cassius was later transferred to Perth Children's hospital and stayed there until 18 October when he was discharged.

He was re-admitted to the Midland hospital hours later at about 2.30am on 19 October. Dr Eugene Henry told the court Cassius had suffered seizures and was “in a bad way”.

A fresh CT scan revealed that the bleeding and pressure inside Cassius's brain had increased. The teen was transferred back to Perth Children's hospital about half an hour later.

The neurologist Snigdha Saha said “the injured side was now pushing against the opposite side”. “It was significant,” she said.

Doctors operated on Cassius but he died four days later.

The forensic pathologist Leana Downs said Cassius's cause of death was complications of head injury. She said there was evidence of increased cranial pressure, strokes, swelling of the brain and pneumonia.

Plan to quit Aim after ‘review of benefits and drawbacks' is further blow to capital's junior market

The leisure group that owns the 126-year-old Brighton Palace Pier is planning to delist from the London stock market and return to life as a private company, in the latest blow to the capital's junior market.

Brighton Pier Group, which also owns several bars and mini-golf sites around the country, told investors it intended to cancel its listing on the capital's Alternative Investment Market (Aim) after more than 11 years, blaming bad weather, falling consumer spending, rising wage costs and higher interest rates.

The news led to shares in the company tumbling by around 60% on Wednesday.

The group, which is chaired by the business veteran and former Pizza Express and Patisserie Valerie boss Luke Johnson, said it had faced “persistent challenging trading conditions” since the coronavirus pandemic, forcing it to cut costs and sell off underperforming assets.

In a statement to the market, the group said it had carried out “a careful review of the benefits and drawbacks” to the company and its investors of remaining listed on Aim, adding that it believed it was in the “best interests” of the business to return to private hands.

Shareholders will be given the chance to vote on the plans at a meeting on 22 April, where approval of at least 75% of investors is required. If they vote in favour, Brighton Pier Group will delist from the London Stock Exchange on 2 May.

Johnson owned 27% of the company's shares, according to its most recent annual report, for the year to 24 December 2023, and was paid a salary of £20,000 for the role.

The delisting would be another setback for the London stock market, which has been hit by a string of departures in recent months.

According to the latest figures from the accountancy group UHY Hacker Young, 71 companies delisted from Aim in the year to 12 February, leaving fewer than 700 companies listed on the market, the lowest level since 2001.

The model train maker Hornby said in March it would cancel its listing and go private, saying it would help to cut costs and reduce its regulatory burden.

Brighton Pier Group, which also owns Lightwater Valley Family Adventure Park in Yorkshire, said it was looking to delist partly because of the “disproportionate” annual costs of between £250,000 and £300,000 connected with remaining listed on the stock market, and said it could use the money to invest directly into growing the business.

The group also blamed lack of liquidity on Aim, which it said meant shareholders could not trade in “meaningful” volumes, and which also resulted in market volatility.

It came as Brighton Pier Group said its results for the year to 29 December 2024 were in line with market expectations.

However, it said the cost of living crisis was having a “material impact” on consumer spending, as people cut back on non-essential purchases. Sales fell slightly over the past 12 weeks compared with a year earlier, although Brighton Pier reported an increase in visitor numbers thanks to warm weather in March.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Exclusive: Former staff tell Guardian Australia some HIV patients have since required acute mental health care, as hospital also loses specialist pain and eating disorder support staff

The resignation of psychiatrists from Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred hospital has led to the closure of an HIV psychiatry clinic with 200 patients, as well as a loss of specialist psychiatrist services for patients in the pain clinic and the most unwell eating disorder patients.

Minutes from a Royal Prince Alfred (RPA) and Balmain hospital medical staff council on 10 February, seen by Guardian Australia, also contain slides from a presentation about psychiatrist resignations that state “there is no HIV psychiatry clinic”.

Dr Suzanna Goodison, a psychiatrist who resigned from the RPA, said there were about 200 patients discharged from the HIV clinic, and that some of those patients have since had contact with acute care mental health services as they have become unwell, while many others had to be discharged to their GPs.

Goodison said the specialty support that was available in the clinic was vital as HIV places greater challenges on the treatment of mental health conditions. “As a group they're not only more at risk because of the psychosocial factors of being a marginalised community, but the virus itself creates cognitive changes.”

Positive Life NSW, the largest peer-led representative body of all people living with HIV in Australia and a partner of NSW Health, said “we understand that psychiatry services were offered as part of a multi-disciplinary team within the RPA Sexual Health Clinic which also includes healthcare services for people living with HIV.

“During the period that the position/s is currently vacant, onward referrals are currently being made to the Marie Bashir Centre Psychiatry Unit at RPA,” the spokesperson said.

John Rule, the director of research at the National Association of People with HIV Australia, said “people living with HIV have higher rates of anxiety, depression and PTSD and therefore the loss of any services would be a very big loss for this population group. There was already a shortage of available support.”

The presentation slides also state there is no psychiatrist in the clinical liaison service for eating disorder inpatients or outpatients. Consultation liaison psychiatrists give advice on the psychiatric care of patients who are admitted in other wards of the hospital.

Goodison said the eating disorder patients who are not admitted in the psychiatric unit who require the consultant liaison psychiatrists are the patients who are so medically unwell they have to be admitted under the endocrinology specialists.

Without concurrent mental health support, Goodison said it places undue pressure on medical teams and means those eating disorder patients don't receive continuity of care.

The slides state the district has lost three consultation liaison psychiatrists and are now left with only 3.3 full-time equivalent staff specialists, and that their ability to care for outpatient clinics in renal, renal transplant and rheumatology have been “significantly curtailed”.

The presentation also states there is no pain clinic psychiatrist. Goodison said depression is highly prevalent in people with chronic pain (up to 60% in some studies) and is a predictor of poorer functioning overall, worse described pain, reduced capacity to work and significantly increased health care costs over the longer term.

“If they are depressed, it can significantly impact on the capacity to engage in pain programs, for example, or rehabilitative approaches and confer the worst prognosis in terms of recovery and impacts on their quality of life,” she said.

The document also notes the potential flow-on effects in the emergency department, increased bed pressures and registrar training due to the resignations.

It also stated that psychiatrists' resignations come in the context of the moral injury they feel – that “public psychiatry has become about risk management rather than providing care based on clinical assessment and need”.

A spokesperson from Sydney Local Health District said “the health and safety of our consumers and staff is paramount”.

“Clinical care is delivered based on priority and escalation processes are in place to always ensure safe care. The district has employed locum psychiatrists to help manage patient needs and we are continuing to recruit to fill vacant positions. We have also employed more allied health staff to provide support,” the spokesperson said.

“It is important for anyone experiencing mental health distress or concerns to understand our services are still available at any time.”

Asmof is seeking a special levy to increase staff psychiatrists pay by 25% to stem the flow of specialist doctors leaving the public system.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

As the 2026 World Cup approaches, the USMNT lack the charisma, underdog charm and striking victories of their predecessors

Imagine the 1980 Miracle on Ice, but with the USA on the other side.

In this scenario, the US men's hockey team aren't a scrappy band of outmatched amateurs playing for the country perceived as the good guys in the cold war. The opponents aren't an aloof, brutally effective Soviet Union team expected to steamroll their way to a gold medal just as their military were attempting to steamroll their way through Afghanistan.

The Concacaf Nations League isn't the Olympics, and there'll be no film starring Kurt Russell as Panamanian coach Thomas Christiansen inspiring his team to a geopolitically charged win over the Goliaths of the competition. But like the Soviet hockey team in 1980, the US men's soccer team in 2025 is an easy team to dislike. And with a World Cup on home soil rapidly approaching, that's a heavy cross to bear.

To use another analogy: In the 2026 World Cup, the US men might find themselves as disliked as Duke in men's college basketball – if Duke had failed to get past the second round of the NCAA Tournament, lacked players as charismatic as Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg, but did have designs on annexing every part of North America that doesn't speak Spanish.

Teams attract support for a few different reasons, and the US men score poorly on all of them:

Underdog status. The US men had this in the past. In the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, a bunch of college kids and semi-professional players challenged the seasoned pros. They continued punching above their weight in the 2000s, upsetting Portugal in the 2002 World Cup, upending the balance of power in the region by beating Mexico in that same World Cup and several other occasions, then ending Spain's 35-match unbeaten streak in the 2009 Confederations Cup final. But now, with a so-called “Golden Generation” of talent spread among elite clubs in Europe, they've traded the “underdog” label for “underachiever” – eliminated in the group stage at last year's Copa América, and losers of two underwhelming games at the Nations League finals.

Brilliant play. We can, at least for now, rule this out.

Provincial identity. Philadelphia roots for the Eagles – maybe a bit too much. Boston gets behind the Red Sox. But such loyalties are shallower if the ties are more transient. In Washington DC, where a lot of people from elsewhere descend on the nation's capital and its suburbs, fans from the “road” team are often numerous and noisy for the local teams. What happens to a team representing the United States if immigrants are feeling less welcome in the country? Or if the intelligentsia are watching their work dismissed and dismantled while some of their colleagues are swept off the streets to be detained and deported?

Personalities. US soccer players have long been marketable. In women's soccer, from Mia Hamm's heyday to that of Megan Rapinoe, players have been a constant presence in TV ads. Men's soccer had its share of recognizable stars – Alexi Lalas had a goatee and a guitar, Landon Donovan projected California Zen and was even married to a TV star for a while. Today? The good news is that a lot of American kids are finally wearing soccer shirts. The bad news? They all say “Messi” on the back.
  To an extent, the US men's image has never recovered from Lalas's blistering “tattooed millionaires” rant when the team was on its way to World Cup qualification failure in 2017. Much of the team has retired since then, but Lalas also singled out “Wonderboy” Christian Pulisic, who should be in his prime.

Lalas's words resonated because the soccer community understood exactly what he was saying. In the past, US men had the excuse of being in a country that didn't take the sport seriously and had scant opportunities for proper development outside the rough-and-tumble world of college soccer. By 2017, most of the US men's team had experience in Europe, and many had been professionals since their mid-teens.

“You are a soccer generation that has been given everything,” Lalas said at the time. “You are a soccer generation who's on the verge of squandering everything.”

Spending much of their careers in Europe adds to the perceived distance between players and supporters, especially because many of the players are breaking through in Italy's Serie A, which has a tiny presence on US TV in comparison to the Premier League, which once boosted the image of players like Tim Howard, relentless target player Brian McBride and the preternaturally crafty Clint Dempsey.

Most of these circumstances are beyond the players' control. Milan and Juventus have been better fits for US players than Chelsea and Leeds. The US team isn't responsible for the US government – and in any case, if geopolitics alone determined fan loyalty, Washington Capitals fans wouldn't be unabashedly cheering for their Russian star, Alex Ovechkin, to wrest the NHL career goalscoring record from Wayne Gretzky.

That said, the lack of an activist akin to Rapinoe or Julie Foudy hasn't gone unnoticed. And the US fanbase isn't shy about showing its disdain for players like Korbin Albert, whose negative attitude toward even the most performative LGBTQ allyship may find a sympathetic audience in parts of the White House but not down the street at Audi Field.

And US players today don't exactly come across as supporters of the proletariat.

In most countries whose players are well-compensated by professional clubs, national team pay is an afterthought. Kylian Mbappé gave away his bonus money for winning the 2018 World Cup. England players typically donate their international match fees, though the sums are not particularly significant in the first place.

Three years ago, US soccer teams reached a historic equal pay agreement by making sure both the men and the women would make quite a lot of money – 80-90% of the Fifa prize money the men and women accumulate at upcoming World Cups. They announced that deal soon after US Soccer president Cindy Cone barely survived a grassroots revolt in which state youth and adult organizers perceived that the federation no longer cared about the game outside the professional ranks. And the players didn't make any grand gestures to smooth over relations with those grassroots organizers, all of whom are smart enough to know that it's not just their personal fiefdoms at stake but also the USA's ability to compete with countries that funnel much of their prize money back into developing the next generations to win it all once again.

US Soccer is only a generation and change removed from the days of their supporters being outnumbered at home matches. Games in California would draw massive support from Mexican fans. Games in Washington, where nearly every nation on the planet has some sort of diaspora, would often turn up crowds that were far from unanimous in supporting the home team. US Soccer wound up hosting World Cup qualifiers against Mexico in Columbus, Ohio, where the lower temperatures and lower diversity would give the USA a true “home” advantage.

Since then, the crowds on US soil have embraced teams that mixed scrappiness and skill to supplant Mexico as the regional power. They found players with whom to identify – journeyman Jay DeMerit fought through non-league English football to reach the national team, Donovan and Jozy Altidore came across as typical US teenagers, and Herculez Gomez was at the vanguard of a group of Mexican-American players who opted to represent the red, white and blue.

Today's US players are commanding transfer fees and big salaries to move to Europe before anyone even knows who they are. Gomez is an ESPN commentator ripping the team's lack of offensive effort.

And if the US men and their marketers want the country to rally behind them next year in what should be a landmark moment for the sport in North America, they'll need to do something to connect with their supporters. Or at least beat Panama.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

A third of the league is tanking with a third of the season remaining, creating a lose-lose situation for the NBA, its fans and TV partners. What's the fix? 

The Toronto Raptors aren't new to losing. But they are new to whatever this is.

After taking over as the Raptors' president of basketball operations in 2013, Masai Ujiri refused to embrace the blatant, in-your-face tanking that Sam Hinkie and the “process” Philadelphia 76ers were busy popularizing during that same era, instead opting to build from the middle. “I'm not sure the karma is great when you do stuff like that,” Ujiri said about tanking. “We're not doing that here,” he later added.

The Raptors made history in 2019 by becoming the first team to win an NBA Championship without a single lottery pick. But after Toronto missed the playoffs in three of the last four seasons and were rewarded with just one top 10 draft pick, Ujiri finally decided to follow in a long line of teams who are taking advantage of the NBA's incentive structure that means bad teams have better odds of landing a top pick in the draft.

Now, the Raptors find themselves in the middle of an embarrassing and unwatchable multi-team tank-off that has come to define the 2024-25 NBA season.

“As a purist of the league, a purist of basketball, we play every game to win,” 15-year veteran and vice-president of the National Basketball Players Association, Garrett Temple, tells the Guardian. “[But] the way the rules are set up, it's advantageous to be the worst team in the league record-wise. I don't think it's a great look for the NBA.”

And the Raptors have given bad looks this season. After leading playoff-bound Orlando Magic by double digits in the fourth quarter on 4 March, Raptors head coach Darko Rajakovic pulled the plug by sitting starters Immanuel Quickley, Scottie Barnes, Jakob Poeltl and RJ Barrett, leaving about $100m in salaries on the bench and less than $10m in rookies and two-way players on the floor. “All I could do was laugh,” Barrett said.

While Rajakovic explained that “for us, it's very, very important now to take a look at different players and young guys and to develop those guys, to give them important minutes,” the reality was that the Raptors were as close to the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings as they were to a playoff spot. Even though about a third of the regular season was still to be played at that point, the team had already decided to prioritize managing its lottery odds over making a push for the playoffs.

And they are not the only ones.

“Right now there are nine teams tanking,” one league executive told ESPN. “And next year's draft is going to have maybe more franchise players than this year's draft. A year from now, you may still have nine teams tanking.”

That's almost one-third of the league that exists somewhere on a spectrum from being comfortable with mediocrity to coming up with increasingly creative ways to lose games. Teams are sitting their best players due to “rest” and quiet-quitting by pulling starters late in games, causing upwards of 20 star players to be in street clothes on any given night in March and April, making the quality of late-season basketball worse than ever.

“Teams can put whatever they want on their injury report, and the league has not policed injury reports,” NBA writer Brian Windhorst said on the Hoop Collective podcast. “So you have situations where guys are truly injured, but listed as out. And other situations where stars are not really injured, but they're listed as out. And so the credibility is all over the place, and the league has let that go down the block and around the corner … it's just a mess.”

While it makes sense for teams to take advantage of the NBA's incentive structure so long as they can get away with it, the popularization of tanking has created a lose-lose situation for the league, the fans who pay large sums to attend games or watch on TV, the players who are missing out on crucial developmental reps and, most importantly, the NBA's TV partners, who recently signed an 11-year agreement worth $76bn.

People have been trying to come up with creative solutions to solve the NBA's tanking problem for more than a decade, ranging from flattening the draft lottery odds so that every non-playoff team has an equal chance of getting the No 1 overall pick, to creating a “play-out” tournament where the worst teams compete for better draft odds at the end of the season, to replacing the draft with rookie free agency.

But each so-called solution comes with unintended consequences, such as teams on the playoff bubble tanking to get in the lottery if the odds are flat or if there is a play-out tournament, and the best rookies hurting parity by signing in big markets in free agency.

We know that the NBA doesn't approve of tanking because it has a long history of railing against it. The league pressured the 76ers to get rid of Hinkie in 2016, and fined Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban $600,000 for admitting to tanking in 2018.

The question, then, is how does the NBA keep a similar incentive structure but discourage the blatant, unethical tanking that has become popular in recent years? The obvious answer is to start by seriously penalizing anything that goes against the integrity of the game.

After all, we usually have a pretty good idea about who the worst teams are by the 50-game mark, with the league sorting itself into tiers of contenders, playoff teams and bottom-dwellers. But at a certain point, some teams rest veterans or quiet-quit to increase their lottery odds. The rest of the bottom-dwellers have no choice but to follow suit, and bam! Unmitigated, unethical tanking ensues.

“When I first came in the league, I don't remember this happening as much,” Temple, who has been around the NBA since 2009, says. “People are trying to take advantage of situations and have their team be the best team they can be. At the end of the day, no team is doing this in order to have a bad team. They're trying to make their team better.”

But what if there was a way to pressure teams to play out the entire season the way they play the first 50 games? That way, the lottery order would sort itself out naturally, and the worst teams would get the best odds without the need to ever lose on purpose.

It may sound extreme, but that's exactly what happens in the NHL, where a culture of competitiveness and power at the hands of head coaches keeps teams from resting players in order to lose on purpose. Instead, the NHL employs a different, more ethical form of tanking where the worst teams choose to offload veteran players at the trade deadline and naturally lose out as a result.

The NBA can't expect the culture to change naturally given that teams have learned how to exploit the system, but the league can make it a significantly harder system to game. This would require the NBA to get serious about discouraging tanking, penalizing teams who are found guilty of resting healthy players with significant fines or the removal of future draft picks in order to get the best players to play all season.

In March, the NBA fined the Utah Jazz $100,000 for violating the league's player participation policy for sitting star Lauri Markkanen for nine straight games when he appeared to be free of significant injury. But the standard $100,000 fine that the league levied against the Jazz this year, the 76ers last year, and Mavericks the year before is a drop in the bucket for team owners like Ryan Smith, who has an estimated net worth of $2.6bn. And when Markkanen did return the following game, he played just 19 minutes and sat the entire second half, showing how seriously the organization took the penalty.

“These next few weeks,” one NBA executive told ESPN. “Could be the worst tanking stretch we've ever seen.”

What the NBA needs is a new set of rules specifically designed to discourage tanking – a “Shame Doctrine” that clearly lays out a set of increasingly significant penalties that will be levied against teams for tanking, with each infraction setting them back millions of dollars and future draft picks.

Of course, it can be complicated to police injuries when almost every player is banged up by the end of the season. But the league already has its own doctors to determine whether a player is healthy enough to play, and enforcing it would be similar to what the NFL does in order to satisfy football's integrity (and the NFL's betting partners).

Plus, common sense should apply here. If a team pulls its starters in the fourth quarter as the Raptors did, they should be penalized. If the Jazz refuse to spread out Markkanen's minutes so that he only plays in the first half, so should they.

The solution isn't to come up with a different incentive structure besides the lottery because they all have flaws. Instead, it's time for the NBA to be proactive and get serious about penalizing tanking violations. Otherwise, teams will continue to find creative ways to game the system, and the product will continue to suffer.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

She left her job when her husband got a shot at VP – only for the couple to be met with the frostiest of receptions in Greenland at the weekend

There are a few people to blame for the fact that JD Vance, a staggeringly unlikable man with a supremely meme-able face, has been thrust into such prominence. The first is Peter Thiel: the tech billionaire who bankrolled Vance's political pivot. The second is Kevin D Roberts, head of the Heritage Foundation and mastermind of Project 2025, who has been an energetic Vance advocate.

And the third is Usha Chilukuri Vance, JD's wife. While Usha kept a low profile during the Trump-Vance campaign, trailing after her other half with a smile on her face and a copy of The Iliad in her hand, JD has made her influence clear. In his memoir Hillbilly Elegy, for example, he wrote that Usha helped him navigate Yale and “always encouraged me to seek opportunities that I didn't know existed”.

Usha has also always sought out opportunities for herself. The 39-year-old has the sort of CV ChatGPT might conjure up if you put “overachiever with political ambitions” as a prompt: Yale, then Cambridge, then back to Yale for law school, where she was an editor of the Yale Law Journal. From there she clerked for high-powered judges including supreme court chief justice John Roberts when he wrote a 5-4 ruling upholding Trump's so-called Muslim ban.

Despite her own ambitions, Usha left her corporate law job when JD got a shot at DC. “She actually quit her job the day that Donald Trump asked me to become the VP nominee because she wants to be on the road with me,” JD Vance said in an interview last August. “That means we got to win, right? She's gonna be mad at me if she quit her job and we don't win.”

They won all right, but pretty much everyone in the US now thinks JD is a loser. He has historically bad favourability ratings and there are memes of him everywhere. I have absolutely no sympathy for Usha – who is far from a victim – but I have to wonder if she is starting to feel a little sorry for herself. As she and JD wandered around freezing cold Greenland over the weekend, unwelcomed by angry local people who didn't want to be photographed anywhere near them, did she start to suspect that aligning herself with Trump – a man her own husband once called “America's Hitler” – might not have been the wisest choice? If not, then perhaps Usha, who has been described as a “bookworm”, needs to put down The Iliad and read the room.

It is a factually inaccurate and totally, utterly wrong to say that undocumented people are ‘illegal' and are ‘criminals'

On 29 January, the second Trump administration held its first White House press briefing. “Of the 3,500 arrests Ice has made so far since President Trump came back into office, can you just tell us the numbers?” asked a reporter in the front row. “How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the country illegally?”

“All of them,” responded the new White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, making her debut in the briefing room, “because they illegally broke our nation's laws, and, therefore, they are criminals, as far as this administration goes.” She continued: “I know the last administration didn't see it that way, so it's a big culture shift in our nation to view someone who breaks our immigration laws as a criminal. But that's exactly what they are.”

Leavitt's answer delighted Maga media and went viral in conservative circles, with a fire emoji from a Daily Wire reporter, a bullseye emoji from the Heritage Foundation, and a mic drop emoji from the Republican Study Committee.

It was also completely, utterly, totally, wrong. Factually inaccurate. A brazen lie.

In the eyes of this administration, immigrants who are undocumented are all “illegal immigrants” and these “illegal immigrants”, ergo, are all “criminals”.

But, on so many levels, it's just not true. It's a popular myth pushed by the right that needs urgent debunking.

First, people are not, are never, illegal. It was the Nobel laureate and former Auschwitz prisoner Elie Wiesel who pointed out how “no human being is ‘illegal'” because it is “a contradiction in terms. People can be beautiful or less beautiful, they can be just or unjust, but illegal? How can a human being be illegal?”

An act can be illegal; people cannot inherently be illegal.

Second, the anti-immigrant right has not only gotten the language wrong but the law wrong, too. Under the US criminal code, as the ACLU has noted: “The act of being present in the United States in violation of the immigration laws is not, standing alone, a crime.” Why? Because illegal entry is considered a misdemeanor not a felony, under 8 US Code § 1325, and is subject to civil, and not criminal, penalties. It is the “reentry of removed aliens”, under 8 US Code § 1326, that is considered a felony and subject to criminal punishment.

Meanwhile, almost half of undocumented immigrants in the United States did not even enter the country illegally to begin with; many of them are “overstays” who arrived with a legal work, student, or travel visa but failed to leave the US, for a multiplicity of reasons, before their visas expired.

The inconvenient truth for the anti-immigrant right is that it is not a crime for immigrants simply to be present in the United States without proper documentation. They are not “illegals”. Don't take my word for it. Or the ACLU's. Take the word – the 5-3 majority ruling! – of the supreme court of the United States. In 2012, in Arizona v United States, the highest court in the land ruled that “as a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain in the United States”.

Got that? Not. A. Crime.

Third, the anti-immigrant right wants to conflate immigrants, especially of the undocumented variety, with criminals – but the evidence is beyond flimsy. Remember in February when the Trump administration claimed that “Guantánamo Bay will hold the worst of the worst” migrants? When the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, insisted that “criminal alien murderers, rapists, child predators and gangsters” were being shipped to Gitmo? It turned out that around one in three of those migrants “had no criminal records”.

Remember in March when the Trump administration sent nearly 300 immigrants to El Salvador because they were, allegedly, “illegal foreign terrorists” and “bad people” who commited the most “heinous crimes”? Ice officials later admitted in court that “many” of the people packed off to El Salvador had no criminal records. More and more reports suggest the apparent justification for sending these immigrants to a foreign labor camp was their possession not of criminal records but of … tattoos. On Monday, the Trump administration admitted in a court filing that it had detained a Maryland father with protected legal status and deported him to El Salvador “because of an administrative error”.

It isn't surprising that this far-right nativist administration, its mendacious press secretary, and its Ice thugs have failed to identify actual criminals, whether violent or otherwise, among the many immigrants they have rounded up, detained, and tried to deport in recent weeks. Despite Maga's obsession with immigrant criminals (Laken Riley's killer!), study after study after study after study confirms that higher immigration does not lead to higher crime rates and, in fact, immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than the native-born population. “Statistically speaking,” the immigration expert Aaron Reichlin-Melnick has observed, “you're measurably safer living in a town filled with average undocumented immigrants than a town filled with average native-born citizens.”

So why can't liberals more broadly, and elected Democrats in particular, say this? And say it loudly and repeatedly? Why can't they reject both the butchering of the English language and the misrepresentation of US criminal law by rejecting the entire “illegal immigrant” framing of the nativist right? And if not now – when a far-right administration is grabbing innocent people off the streets and sending them to be tortured in a foreign gulag – then when? It's past time for liberals and Democrats to make clear to conservatives and Republicans that the facts don't care about their feelings. There is no such thing as an illegal immigrant; undocumented immigrants aren't ipso facto criminals; and higher immigration doesn't lead to higher crime.

You wake to the sound of explosions or the silence of grief, leave your home uncertain if you will return, look at your child and wonder what kind of future awaits.

Yet life goes on. We carry our losses, our broken hearts, our grief, and we continue. Ten years of war, ten years of mourning, of learning to survive with a lump in our hearts.

I remember my childhood: the crackle of the radio, the glow of a cigarette. I see my Grandpa Abu Bakr sitting on a small dirt hill, calling out, “Come, let me teach you the alphabet.”

I leap up and he embraces me, extinguishing his cigarette and turning off the radio. I race him to the house and the door opens to reveal Aunt Aisha, my second mother. She would serve me rice, fish and tomato sauce. Even when I was old enough to eat on my own, she fed me with her hands. “Do you like it, my dear?” she would ask, her voice a lullaby to my soul. Years later, I sat beside her once more, but her eyes, once full of love, were clouded by Alzheimer's, her hands thin and frail.

Grandpa had already left this world, losing his sight after a failed surgery. He once asked me, “Do you know how to make tea?” “Even if I didn't, I'd make it for you,” I answered. That was our last conversation. Aunt Aisha survived memory loss but not cholera. The killer of Yemen. The disease took her like it had already taken thousands more. She died not because of fate, but because war has turned sickness into a death sentence.

Then there's Hussam, my brother. His death stays with me. We tried so hard the night before he passed, but the roads were closed. We couldn't bring him the oxygen he needed. I was right there, watching, helpless. I saw the redness in his cheeks fade. The pimple he had the day before, gone. His soul was leaving his body, and I couldn't stop it.

My mother held him through the night. Humming softly, silently crying as his last breath slipped away. She didn't scream, didn't wail, just held him, as if she could keep him a little longer. It haunts me. I wonder if there was more I could have done. The roads closed, the hospital out of reach, I had to just sit and watch death take him.

Loss in Yemen is everywhere. It follows people like Hayat, a woman who carries more pain than any human should. She has a bachelor's degree, she had dreams. She gave birth in the rain after running for her life from bombing. She no longer sees herself as a woman. She told me she has forgotten what it feels like to wear perfume, to look in the mirror, to exist beyond suffering.

Her son, Hussam – the same name as my brother – suffered a severe head injury. She had nothing. No money, no way to call his father, no one to turn to. She lost consciousness many times from exhaustion, hunger, despair. Then people around her, people who had nothing themselves, started throwing scraps of paper into her lap. She didn't understand. Then she realised the paper was all the money they had in their pockets. They gave her everything they could so she could take her son to the city hospital. The poorest of the poor saved her child.

When I think of places untouched by war, I think of streets where people have never heard a bomb or had the pain of watching someone they love take their last breath. Where families are not hungry day after day, where supermarket shelves are filled with choices. I realise how much of Yemen the world is missing. We are not just war or headlines or suffering.

We are culture, beauty and love. Yemen, where the suffering is endless, but generosity is boundless. Where people with nothing will find something to give because they know what it means to have even less.

            • Trump to unveil sweeping tariffs: President Donald Trump will announce the details of his “Liberation Day” plan at 4 p.m. ET, as he aims to redraw economic agreements with US trading partners. Trump and his team were still weighing options as of late yesterday, with no final decision made yet ahead of the Rose Garden announcement. 



            • Uncertainty remains: The details of the new levies are still unclear, but Trump has teased everything from reciprocal tariffs on all countries; the enactment of delayed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada; as well as tariffs on lumber, copper, pharmaceuticals and microchips. Have questions for us? Ask them here.



            • Markets rattled: The past few weeks of constantly changing and conflicting trade policy have triggered volatility in the stock market, frozen business decision-making and put consumer spending on pause.
    


            The co-founder of an Ottawa-based brewery told CNN that new tariffs from the White House could rapidly increase the costs of brewing beer and ultimately drive down demand for it.
    


            Josh McJannett, co-founder of Dominion City Brewing Co. said independent brewers on both sides of the border will be spending more “for absolutely no reason.”
    


                    “It's one of these moments where you just realize that the underpinning assumptions about everything in our business needs to be reconsidered,” the Canadian business owner told CNN.“A lot of the things that we buy and use in our business are on the way to getting more expensive very quickly,” he said.
                





            Brewers like him have been loading up on can inventory due to US President Donald Trump's aluminum tariffs – which the Commerce Department on Wednesday specified includes beer cans. But that inventory will not last forever, McJannett said, as his can suppliers are already informing him about price increases.
    


            Like many other local businesses, Dominion City has rolled out their own initiatives to “Buy Canadian,” recently producing a beer with 100% Canadian ingredients.
    


            But there are certain items that they simply can't buy from local suppliers. Among them are 16-ounce cans, also known as tallboys. Tallboys are a staple in the craft brewery business but aren't manufactured in Canada at all.
    


            “Because we're such a small-scale operation — we just can't pass along anything like a 25% increase to our consumers without seeing a huge impact on consumption,” McJannett said. “People need to eat; they don't need to drink beer.”
    


            CNN Business anchor Richard Quest says White House aide Peter Navarro's claim that tariffs are a tax cut and not an increase is a contradictory statement.
    


            “They are contradictory goals. Let's be clear about this,” Quest said.
    


            Quest went on to explain:
    


                     “Now, if Peter Navarro is right, and this is all about bringing billions, trillions, into the economy then that is contradictory to the idea that it is designed to improve American production and bring production back because, think about it logically, if you bring American production back then you won't be getting the import tariff, therefore you won't be getting the revenue. You can't have both. They are two sides of the same coin.”
                





            Quest added, that in the short-run there may be an advantage.
    


            “In the short-run you're going to see billions of dollars coming into the US Treasury. Fact. take that to the bank as well. But you're going to have to weigh that against this vast economic experiment, the like of which we've not seen before.”
    


More on tax-cut claim: Navarro said on Sunday that he expects President Donald Trump's tariffs to bring in $6 trillion in revenue in the next decade, which could amount to the largest tax hike in US history.
    


            Even when adjusting for inflation, that amount would be triple the tax increase put in place in 1942 to pay the cost of fighting World War II.
    


            Navarro, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, insists it's not a tax increase but a tax cut — echoing the Trump administration's repeated belief that tariffs will be paid not by American consumers but by businesses in other countries or the countries themselves.
    


            It's been another volatile day on Wall Street, and stocks are fluctuating as President Donald Trump's expected announcement on tariffs nears.
    


            After gradually climbing midday, US stocks have fallen from their peaks, though were holding onto their gains in afternoon trading.
    


            The Dow was higher by 97 points, or 0.23%. The benchmark S&P 500 index was up 0.26%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4%.
    


            The blue-chip Dow rose nearly 400 points in the early afternoon before flirting with sliding back into the red — but ultimately stalled in the green.
    


            Markets have been choppy in the weeks leading up to Trump's announcement on tariffs, set for 4 p.m. ET. As investors have wrestled with uncertainty, some think the market might be oversold.
    


            “I just feel like this is one of those moments where the bark may have been worse than the bite,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. “The [stock] prices have declined to such a degree that the eventual announcement is, you know, less bad than what was anticipated.”
    


            US stock markets will close at 4 p.m. ET, though stock futures trading will continue into the afternoon as investors digest Trump's announcement on tariffs.
    


            “Investors are obviously very concerned about the risks to the US economy from these [tariff] plans,” said JoAnne Bianco, senior investment strategist at BondBloxx.
    


            “We would just love to see more clarity,” Bianco said.
    


John from Florida wonders: “What does Trump hope to gain by imposing tariffs?”



            While the details of President Donald Trump's tariffs plan are largely unknown, CNN's David Goldman has some answers in this analysis:
    


            Trump says he believes tariffs are a panacea: a catch-all economic tool that can restore America's manufacturing prowess, bring foreign nations to heel on key disputes, restore the balance of trade and bring in gobs of money that can help pay off the US deficit and reduce Americans' tax burdens.
    


            Trump is correct that tariffs can help fulfill many if not all of those promises: When used effectively, tariffs can help boost production at home by making foreign goods more expensive. Because America is an enormous and diverse economy that doesn't rely on trade as much as its neighbors, the United States could use tariffs to inflict serious damage on other countries' economies without plunging itself into a recession. Revenue raised by tariffs could help offset some of its deficits.
    


            But, as the saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.
    


            The problem with Trump's plan is that tariffs can't achieve all of those goals at the same time.

            A member of Canadian parliament said his country is united its resolve to take care of its workers and push back against the US as President Donald Trump is set to announce more tariffs later today.
    


            Taylor Bachrach, speaking to CNN from Fort St. James, British Columbia, said many people there are “heavily dependent on the softwood lumber industry” and much of that lumber goes to the United States.
    


            “People who are involved in these trade exposed industries are all very concerned about what today's announcement is going to mean,” he said.
    


            Canada has already threatened retaliation against the US. When it comes to what exactly what that will look like, Bachrach said officials will consider how to make ”an impact with retaliatory tariffs while minimizing the impact on our own economy and on Canadian workers and Canadian jobs.”
    


            He called it a “really critical moment,” adding that Canada has “benefited from so many years as friends and allies and trading partners.”
    


            “This is a very difficult situation and it's forcing Canadians to have some important conversations about where we go from here with our relationship with the United States,” Bachrach said.
    


            Some avocado producers in Michoacan, Mexico, have come to a complete stop as they await word on tariffs. Michoacan is the world's leading avocado-producing region.
    


            “They're cutting, but very little volume,” said Jorge Mendoza, a salesman at Frutas Finas Sanchez, an avocado producer and distributor. “And they're adapting to the prices they're being offered, in this case, lower prices, which would be the main blow to the producer.”
    


            Mendoza said clients in the United States asked to hold any orders this week as a precaution, fearing the product would be shipped and they would face tariffs at the ports of entry.
    


            “There's a lot of uncertainty; everyone is panicking because some of our clients had already paid tariffs last month. So now, they've taken a little more precaution,” Mendoza said. “Very little product is moving in the industry, and we're all in uncertainty, waiting to see what's going to happen.”
    


            President Donald Trump's most robust move yet to transform the global trading system could end up affecting every American, raising prices at a time when family budgets are already stretched.
    


            The president is implicitly asking everyone to buy in to a strategy that promises tantalizing future benefits but requires sacrifice for years to come.
    


            Trump reasons that by imposing tariffs on imports, he'll force firms to relocate manufacturing and supply chains to the United States, thereby creating jobs and reviving regions left destitute by globalization.
    


            The downside, however, is that tariffs will spike prices for consumers weary of the high cost of living. And there's no guarantee firms will bring production back stateside, since such a reorientation would take years and presumably outlast Trump's time in power.
    


            If the president follows through, he'll be taking a huge political risk. But he seems oblivious to the potential impact.

             House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters that President Donald Trump's plan to impose sweeping tariffs on America's trading partners would trigger a recession.
    


            “Trump tariffs are going to make things more costly in the United States,” he said today at a news conference.
    


                    “Republicans are crashing the American economy in real time and driving us to a recession,” Jeffries said. “This is not Liberation Day, it's Recession Day.
                





            Among the many tariff proposals Trump is apparently considering, the worst-case scenario appears to be a 20% universal tax on all US imports.
    


            Research by The Budget Lab, a research center at Yale, found that a 20% across-the-board tariff, along with retaliation by US trading partners, would likely cost the typical middle-class household $3,800 per year in disposable income due to higher prices.
    


            The auto tariffs set to take effect on foreign cars tomorrow could raise the price of some imported cars by up to $20,000, according to new analysis by Michigan think-tank Anderson Economic Group, or AEG.
    


            Cars that are fully imported will see the highest price hikes, anywhere from $8,000-$20,000. That includes brands like Audi, BMW, Jaguar-Land Rover, Mercedes, Genesis, and Lexus. AEG expects cost increases could hit in-demand models within a month.
    


            The imported vehicles highest on the tariff impact list: Full-size SUVs, luxury models, and electric vehicles.
    


            If the Trump administration eventually rolls out tariffs on auto part imports, as it has promised, that will also raise the cost for cars assembled in the US but with parts from Canada, Mexico, and Europe. That's every car built in the US, as every domestic vehicle contains imported parts.
    


            That includes large SUVs, such as the Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon, Cadillac Escalade, which will cost $10,000-$12,000 more. Mid-sized SUV's and pickup trucks could see hikes of $5,000-8,500. Some EV's could see price increases of $15,000.
    


            Even cars assembled in the US but with a low share of foreign parts could see price hikes of at least $2,500.
    


            AEG predicts the tariffs will cost consumers $30 billion in the first year. And while the group expects manufacturers to absorb the tariff cost for the first year, they say eventually it will shift cost entirely to the consumer.
    


                    “If you are in the market for a new car and you find one you like, my advice is to buy it right away. If you have a used car you rely upon, my advice is to make sure it is well maintained as you are likely to use it for a while longer than you had earlier planned,” said Patrick L. Anderson, the CEO of Anderson Economic Group.
                





            Sweeping new tariffs will be rolled out by the Trump administration today, potentially raising the costs for almost everything Americans buy.
    


            With inflation and high interest rates already contributing to vulnerabilities among consumers, CNN is asking you to tell us how all of this is changing your spending decisions and saving habits.
    


            White House aide Peter Navarro said he expects President Donald Trump's tariffs to bring in $6 trillion in revenue in the next decade, which could amount to the largest tax hike in US history.
    


            Even when adjusting for inflation, that amount would be triple the tax increase put in place in 1942 to pay the cost of fighting World War II.
    


            Navarro, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, insists it's not a tax increase but a tax cut — echoing the Trump administration's repeated belief that tariffs will be paid not by American consumers but by businesses in other countries or the countries themselves.
    


            “The message is that tariffs are tax cuts, tariffs are jobs, tariffs are national security,” Navarro said on Fox News Sunday. “Tariffs are great for America. They will make America great again.”
    


            But most economists say US-imposed tariffs are paid by American businesses and consumers in the form of higher prices on imported goods, not paid by foreigners.

            “When other countries enact retaliatory tariffs, don't the people of that country pay for them? They will not affect the US,” Ted from Connecticut asked us.
    


            Hi Ted, great question!
    


            If other countries impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States, you're correct in that people in those countries (i.e. the importers) would pay them.
    


            That's because the prices of imported goods being tariffed will rise unless that country can produce more of that particular item domestically or import it from another country.
    


            But expanding an industry can be a lengthy process, and not all items can be made or grown in every country. And even if they can, it could cost a lot more. That's probably why they chose to import from the US to begin with.
    


            That doesn't mean the US economy won't be impacted by retaliatory tariffs, however. If it ends up being cheaper to get the tariffed goods from outside the US, American businesses can suffer from a loss of revenue, which could force employers to lay off workers.
    


Got questions for us about the tariffs? Get in touch.



            Julio Batista, owner and operator of Teddy Volkswagen in the Bronx, New York, said that increased tariffs will definitely hurt his business.
    


            He hopes President Donald Trump continues to negotiate or change his mind so that they are short-lived.
    


            Most of Volkswagen vehicles, primarily the most popular models — Tiguan and Jetta — are made in Mexico, Batista said. The Tiguan, which is their bestseller ,starts at $30,000 and could increase by $7,000 once the tariffs take effect, he estimated.
    


            Batista said the dealership loaded up on inventory prior to Trump's implementation of tariffs in the hopes they can keep prices steady for a few more months. Customers and inquiries have also doubled in the last few weeks as clients try to buy before tariffs, Batista added.
    


            “I understand what (Trump is) doing, but it's not a good idea. It hurts businesses like ours,” Batista said.
    


            VW has a big plant in Puebla, Mexico, and the CEO of the company has said that despite the tariffs, they are not moving production to US.
    


            President Donald Trump's belief in the almost mystical power of tariffs is rooted in his world view of winners and losers and his conviction that the US has long been ripped off by European and Asian powers that protect their industries.
    


            “We're going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they've been taking over the years,” Trump told reporters last week. “They've taken so much out of our country, friend and foe.”
    


            Tariff policy is as old as the United States. But many economists blame restrictive trade policy for causing immense hardship in the Great Depression in the 1930s, and the post-World War II period saw the gradual lowering of trade barriers before a radical reshaping of global commerce as the 21st century dawned.
    


            But recreating a 1950s-style idyll of American manufacturing is a stretch in an era when the US' competitive edge and economic might is centered on service industries, technology and the rise of jobs and commerce based on artificial intelligence.

            Business owners in North Carolina say they are concerned about the Trump administration's newest planned tariffs — set to be announced later today — and warned that additional levies will impact their prices and customers.
    


            The president and co-founder of Devil's Foot Brewing in Asheville, North Carolina, Benjamin Colvin, said he has already seen production expenses increase due to tariffs on aluminum and steel. His company makes a variety of craft sodas and zero-proof cocktails.
    


            Now, he's worried that trend is going to continue, specifically pointing to lemons and limes that he sources from suppliers in Mexico.
    


            “It's concerning, it's going to be expensive, it's going to require us all to make decisions,” Colvin said at a news conference with other business owners in the state today.
    


            Wendy Brugh, the owner of Dry Ridge Farm in Mars Hill, North Carolina, said tariffs will also affect farmers. She said they could make things like fertilizer, construction materials and animal feed more expensive.
    


            Another farmer, Mary Carroll Dodd, the owner of Red Scout Farm in Black Mountain, North Carolina, said a lot of the supplies they use on small farms come from Canada and Mexico. Things like insect netting and tools, she said, come from the US' neighbor.
    


            Dodd said her supplier for potting soil told her that prices could increase from 8 to 10% because of the tariffs on some of the ingredients.
    


                    “For small farms like mine, where profit margins are already razor-thin, these cost increases hit card,” she said.
                





            The US economy faces a growing risk of a recession as surging tariffs threaten to stunt growth, reignite inflation and lift unemployment, according to Goldman Sachs.
    


            The Wall Street bank warned clients this week that it now sees a 35% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, up from 20% previously.
    


            Goldman Sachs also increased its inflation estimate, slashed its 2025 GDP forecast to just 1% and bumped up its year-end unemployment rate outlook by 0.3 percentage points to 4.5%.
    


            While Goldman Sachs still expects the US economy to avoid a downturn, other forecasters think it's more of a 50/50 call. This is Goldman's highest recession probability since the regional banking crisis two years ago. The catalyst now is the shock from President Donald Trump's trade war, which is set to intensify this week.
    


            Goldman Sachs blamed the “sharp recent deterioration in household and business confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of these policies,” the bank's economists wrote in the report.

            Republican senators warned Wednesday that the short-term impacts of President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy, which he's set to announce the details of later in the afternoon, should not be overlooked, even though they are open to his broader trade vision.
    


            Sen. John Kennedy told CNN's Manu Raju that he understands where Trump is “coming from” with his approach to tariff policy, adding, “the president's saying if you're a business in a foreign country and want to sell to America, move your business here and hire Americans, and in the long run he's right.”
    


                    “As I've said repeatedly, in the long run, we're all dead. Short run matters, too. Nobody knows what the impact of these tariffs is going to be on the economy,” he said, explaining some economists say that tariffs will “lead to the apocalypse,” while others have a rosier outlook.
                





            Trump is set to announce the details of his “Liberation Day” plan at 4 p.m. ET, as he aims to redraw economic agreements with US trading partners. The details of the new levies are still unclear, but Trump has teased everything from reciprocal tariffs on all countries; the enactment of delayed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada; as well as tariffs on lumber, copper, pharmaceuticals and microchips.
    


            Kennedy said that in the “worst case scenario,” tariffs could raise inflation and interest rates, leading to a “slowing economy and a recession.”
    


                    “I'm obviously pulling for the positive, but we're in unchartered waters,” he added.
                





            GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia said reciprocal trade policies sound “sensible” and she wants to see American workers and businesses treated “fairly,” but added, “I think there is some trepidation, worrying about impacts on costs of groceries or other items, and automobiles, in particular, so I'm concerned about that.”
    


            She told Raju she's heard input from constituents mostly about how tariff would affect the products they produce and consume, but ” by and large, I'm supporting the President's efforts.”
    


            Consumer sentiment is plunging. The stock market is off to its worst start in years. Hiring has slowed down. Recession odds are on the rise.
    


            Economists, consumers and Wall Street are lambasting President Donald Trump's trade policy. But not everyone suffers from tariffs.
    


            The United Autoworkers union has praised Trump's auto tariffs after the group has lost thousands of jobs to factories in Mexico and Canada.
    


            “We applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades,” the UAW said in a statement last week.
    


            Free trade has its benefits, typically lowering the costs of goods for American consumers. But it has drawbacks too. It can devastate manufacturing industries, as companies build factories in countries that supply cheaper labor.
    


            So history has shown that there are practical — and sometimes beneficial — use cases for tariffs. They can protect countries' national security interests, address unfair trade practices and shore up domestic industries. Tariffs can also combat monopolization of critical imports.
    


            However, like free trade, tariffs can also sting, particularly when they're applied indiscriminately. Trump's implemented and proposed tariffs would place taxes on trillions of dollars worth of goods, forcing companies to make painful decisions about reshoring production that they can't easily bring back to the United States.
    


            “Tariffs can work,” Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy told CNN's Christiane Amanpour Wednesday. But he argued Trump's tariffs would only achieve chaos.
    


            “He is applying tariffs with absolutely no corresponding domestic industrial incentives,” Murphy said. “And thus all that's going to happen here is prices are going to go way up.”
    


Isaac from Oregon asks, “Realistically how much will cars go up,”?



            In response to your question, Isaac, we'll direct you to some fresh CNN reporting:
    


            With a 25% tariff about to hit every imported car on Thursday, prices could rise between $5,000 to $15,000 per vehicle, depending on the make and model, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. And the Trump administration could further send the automobile industry spiraling if it follows through with its plan to enact tariffs on car parts — since even American-made cars import a significant portion of their parts from Canada and Mexico. That could further slam car buyers if enacted.
    


            For example, cars from Ford, Chrysler, GM and Honda are expected to face cost jumps from $4,000 to $10,000, according to a February estimate from Michigan-based think tank Anderson Economic Group. Electric car buyers are expected to pay at least $12,000 more per vehicle.

Got questions for us about the tariffs? Get in touch. 



            Canada finance minister promised a “strong response” to US President Donald Trump's expected announcement about new reciprocal tariffs on imports later today.
    


                    “There is no one who can claim to know precisely what will arrive today,” Canadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Granby, Quebec. “But we are certain that we are ready to defend (Canadian) industry with a strategic response, a strong response, a targeted response.”
                





            Champagne stressed that Canada would never budge on its supply management system — a regime of production controls and tariffs on poultry, dairy and eggs that the country has had in place for over 50 years. Many farmers in the country credit the system with protecting their livelihoods.
    


            “No matter the nature of the negotiations we will have with the United States of America or other countries, we will never allow supply management to be on the table,” the minister said.
    


            A key part of supply management, and one that's provoked the ire of the Trump administration, is Canada's high tariffs on dairy. Though the tariffs are in some cases over 200%, they rarely kick in. As of March 10, the US had yet to meet even half of its quota for milk exports before Canada would apply its tax.
    


            President Donald Trump's affinity for tariffs is hardly a secret. As he's repeatedly said, it's among his favorite words in the dictionary. But for all his chatter about tariffs, it can be challenging to keep track of which ones are actually in effect versus the ones he has only threatened to implement.
    


            While this will almost certainly change in a matter of hours, here are the tariffs that are currently in effect as of Wednesday morning:
    


            US stocks were higher during a choppy trading session Wednesday as investors shook off uncertainty about President Donald Trump's announcement on tariffs, set for 4 p.m. ET.
    


            The Dow was higher by around 300 points, or 0.73%. The broader S&P 500 rose 0.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.2%.
    


            Similar to Monday and Tuesday, stocks opened lower Wednesday before climbing into the green.
    


            “Regardless of what happens [today], tariff uncertainty is impossible to predict, and so rather than trying to read the tea leaves and adjust investments based on what's going on in Washington, we're focused on investing in companies that have superior cash flow generation during all seasons, and not just seasons when we're worried about tariffs,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at The Bahnsen Group.
    


            While US stocks rebounded, global stocks were mixed. Europe's benchmark STOXX 600 index fell 0.5%. Germany's DAX index sank 0.66%.
    


            In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.28% and Taiwan's benchmark index edged higher by 0.08%. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Sang index edged lower by 0.02%.
    


            The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose to 4.21% Wednesday after settling at 4.156% on Tuesday, which was its lowest level this year. Yields rose Wednesday as investors sold bonds and stocks rallied.
    


            Tariffs could hobble homebuilding efforts in the US, at a time when the country needs to build millions of new homes to meet growing demand.
    


            The sharp decrease in home affordability over the last four years has stung many Americans ­– and President Donald Trump won his bid for office partly on the back of dissatisfaction with the economy.
    


            Trump's tariff plan threatens to significantly increase the price of many raw materials used in construction, like lumber, aluminum, and steel, which could cause the price of new homes to rise.
    


            Lately, the homebuying market has shown signs of life as the spring homebuying season kicks off and mortgage rates have fallen slightly over the past few weeks. But tariffs threaten the fragile recovery of the housing sector, which represents about 15% to 18% of GDP.
    


            The National Association of Homebuilders estimated that $14 billion worth of imported goods were used in the construction of both new multifamily and single-family housing in 2024. The group estimates that new tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico are projected to raise the cost of imported construction materials by more than $3 billion, depending on the specific tariff rates.
    


            Last week, President Donald Trump said he would be implementing a 25% tariff on all cars shipped to the United States as of 12:01 am ET on April 3.
    


            For decades, because of a free trade agreement, automakers have treated Canada, Mexico and the United States as one big country, with no tariffs among them. But Trump wants to grow the domestic automaking industry.
    


            He said he's been in touch with the Big Three US automakers, Stellantis, Ford and General Motors, noting that “If they have factories here, they're thrilled. If you don't have factories here, they're going to have to get going and build them.”
    


            Even if automakers were to shift production to the US, it would take years to accomplish the switch. In the meantime, US consumers look set to face higher prices on their vehicle purchases.
    


            Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine revealed he approached Sen. Mitch McConnell Tuesday evening about signing onto his effort to rebuke President Donald Trump by forcing a vote on blocking tariffs on Canadian imports and the Kentucky Republican pledged to back it before Kaine could even ask.
    


            “I said, I want to talk to you about my Canadian tariffs bill. And you know, I didn't even get to the question, and he said, ‘I'm with you,'” Kaine recounted.
    


            Kaine indicated he has “rock solid support” from four GOP senators — McConnell, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Rand Paul — which would be enough for the Senate to symbolically rebuke Trump on tariffs. He also said there are others “who are thinking about it by haven't declared” their support.
    


            One likely reason for McConnell's expected backing of Kaine's effort is the pushback he has heard from his state's agriculture industry.
    


                    “There's never been a one-sided trade war and they always retaliate when it's agriculture. It hits ag (agricultural) states very, very hard, which includes whiskey,” Kaine said. “Craft distillers in Virginia, my craft brewers are very, very worried about this. And I'm sure he is hearing the same thing … I would imagine he is hearing a mouthful from folks.”
                





            Kaine also said he isn't taking unanimous Democratic support for granted but disagreed with Democratic Whip Dick Durbin that there would be defections on their side.
    


            Beginning at 12:01 a.m. ET on Friday, aluminum used in beer, as well as empty aluminum cans, will be subject to the 25% tariffs that went into effect on all imports of the metal last month, according to a notice published by the Commerce Department on Wednesday.
    


            The move is likely an attempt by the Trump administration to close possible loopholes businesses have uncovered to get around the 25% aluminum tariff.
    


            The problem with a trade war is it doesn't simply end once tariffs are put in place. Countries typically retaliate with higher tariffs of their own, and that's when a tit-for-tat trade war can start to get out of hand.
    


            Even before President Donald Trump has announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs, scheduled to be unveiled at 4 p.m. ET at the White House, a number of America's trade partners are lining up to warn Trump that they'll retaliate quickly:
    


            On top of America's tariffs, retaliation itself could add significantly to US inflation, Yale's Budget Lab said in a report this week.
    


            President Donald Trump pledged during his reelection campaign to rework trade deals with US partners across the globe, citing a need to “put America first on trade.”
    


            Since his return to the White House, he has rolled out a 20% levy on all Chinese imports, added a 25% tariff to all steel and aluminum imports and promised a 25% tariff on most imported cars and auto parts. He has said he plans to introduce additional tariffs on sectors such as pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and semiconductor chips.
    


            But Wednesday's tariff schedule is being touted as his most aggressive trade policy yet, stretching across all trading partners and potentially involving all imported goods.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that April 2 “will go down as one of the most important days in modern American history.”
    


            President Donald Trump has floated the idea of higher tariffs on pharmaceutical products, though he has suggested that life-saving drugs could be spared. If they are not, the impact on many Americans could be unthinkable, according to one CEO.
    


            Speaking to BBC World Service radio, Gareth Sheridan, the Irish CEO of Nutriband, a US health care company, noted that Ireland – which exports a lot of pharmaceuticals – makes a wide range of medications, including those used for chemotherapy and for treating heart conditions and diabetes.
    


            “These types of treatments can't afford a disruption in the global supply chain. You know, as a comparable situation, tariffs on automobiles: You can't afford a BMW now? Okay, you can buy a Ford and you can still get to work,” he said.
    


                    “If you have a 25% hike on chemotherapy and you can't afford your treatment anymore, what's the alternative? I mean, ultimately, people are going to die and they're going to die because they can't afford to live.”
                





Remember: Last year, the United States imported $232.7 billion worth of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, based on official US data.
    


            President Donald Trump has outlined several reasons behind his aggressive tariff policy: Initially, he noted the tariffs could help the US gain leverage over other countries on non-economic matters, such as controlling the flow of fentanyl and immigrants.
    


            And other times, he's touted the potential revenue gains and the industrial revitalization of the United States.
    


            “It can't all be true,” Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview with CNN.
    


            “If you're going to use it as negotiating leverage, then it's not a revenue thing, because it's not going to be permanent,” he said. “And if it's to re-industrialize America, then we're not going to have many imports — because we're going to have re-industrialized — so it isn't going to gain a lot of revenue.”
    


                    “And if we're going to do it for revenue purposes, then we have to continue importing, and that revenue will effectively be a tax on those who consume imports,” he said. 
                





            And that's a “regressive tax,” research has shown, meaning that lower-income consumers will be hit the hardest.
    


            The head of the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that tariffs could raise $800 billion over a period of 10 years. Other Trump administration officials touted much larger gains: in the ballpark of $6 trillion during the next decade.
    


            Noland calls that latter figure “a magical number.”
    


                    “It will raise some money,” he said. “But it won't raise enough money to pay for the tax cuts.”
                





             The UK won't “rush” to retaliate any tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on British goods, the country's finance minister said on Wednesday.
    


            “The government has been really clear that we are going to approach this in a clear-headed way and always represent the national interest,” UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves told lawmakers in parliament.
    


            Reeves said that she met with some major UK exporting businesses Wednesday, just hours before Trump is expected to announce a sweeping set of tariffs on the US's trading partners.
    


            “They don't want government to rush into any response because the prize on offer is an economic agreement,” she added. “We don't want to do anything that undermines that. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves.”
    


            Reeves noted that Britain would wait to see how other countries retaliated to any forthcoming tariffs from the White House before deciding how to respond.
    


            “We won't do anything to put (an economic agreement) in jeopardy,” she said.
    


            The tariff rates President Donald Trump reveals Wednesday will amount to a ceiling, and can be negotiated downward, his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers a day ahead of the announcement, according to a person familiar with the conversation.
    


            Bessent's remarks to members of Congress suggest the administration views the new duties as a negotiating tactic to pressure other countries to lower their own duties on US imports.
    


            Trump has suggested as much, saying he is flexible as other countries adjust their rates. But he's also promised to raise tariff rates if other nations retaliate — a sign the figures announced Wednesday could go up or down.
    


            Bessent was meeting with Republicans to discuss Trump's economic agenda. Many lawmakers have voiced concern about the new tariffs and if they could raise prices for their constituents.
    


            President Donald Trump wants to raise revenue from tariffs to pay down debt and give Americans a tax break. He also wants to boost America's manufacturing and grow jobs at factories.
    


            He could achieve that — but it would be painful, according to Yale's Budget Lab. The drawbacks would almost certainly outweigh the rewards.
    


            The Budget Lab found that the most significant tariff proposal Trump is considering — a 20% across-the-board tariff on all goods coming into the United States — would raise between $3.1 trillion and $4.1 trillion over a decade. And it would raise prices by an alarming rate.
    


                    “Our analysis shows that a 20% broad tariff would generate significant revenue, but it would come at an enormous cost,” Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at The Budget Lab, told CNN in a phone interview Wednesday. “In very short order, it would raise prices by more than a year's worth of normal inflation. And America's economy would be smaller, even in the long run, as a result of this policy.”
                





            Tedeschi, a former economic adviser in the Obama administration, conceded that broad tariffs could “absolutely” make some US factories more profitable and allow them to hire more people.
    


            “But for every factory that can expand its payroll, more businesses and factories will have to lay workers off or even close entirely. Net-net, it ends up being a negative for the United States,” Tedeschi said.
    


            Among the many tariff proposals Trump is apparently considering, the worst-case scenario appears to be a 20% universal tax on all US imports. That would shrink the US economy, lift prices and significantly erode Americans' disposable income, according to research from The Budget Lab at Yale.
    


            The nonpartisan research center finds that a 20% universal tariff, which CNN has reported is an option being considered by President Donald Trump, would raise between $3.1 trillion and $4.1 trillion over a decade. Trump continues to weigh several tariff options and it is not yet known what his final proposal will be.
    


            But those tariffs, along with retaliation by US trading partners, would likely cost the typical middle-class household $3,800 per year in disposable income due to higher prices, The Budget Lab found.
    


            The top 10% of earners would see their inflation-adjusted income drop by $9,500 per year, while the bottom 10% would lose $2,400, researchers said.
    


            Lower-income households would likely get hit the hardest on a relative basis, with their disposable income dropping by 5.5%, compared with 1.9% for the top 10%.
    


            The hit to consumers would come from higher prices, especially on items such as food, clothes and electronics. The Budget Lab finds that a 20% tariff, along with full retaliation, would lift prices by 2.6%. If other nations choose not to retaliate, prices would increase by 2%.
    


            Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she will unveil a broad economic plan on Thursday in response to President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs, but stopped short of providing many details.
    


                    “It is a comprehensive program — what we'll announce,” Sheinbaum said Wednesday in her daily news conference. “It's not an issue of, if you impose tariffs, we'll impose tariffs. Our interest is in strengthening the Mexican economy, including the auto industry among others.”
                





            She pointed to efforts made by former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff to strengthen her country's automotive industry and said it's something her administration is studying.
    


            “The problem is that we're importing many vehicles,” she said. “If we want to strengthen the auto industry … we have to make sure cars that are bought in Mexico are made in Mexico.”
    


            “The program we'll present tomorrow isn't only related to the tariffs that the US could impose,” she added.
    


            Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that increased tariffs on Canadian goods will ultimately hurt American families, adding that President Donald Trump's so-called “Liberation Day” is more like “Termination Day.”
    


            Ford told CNN's Wolf Blitzer a majority of lumber that the US imports to build homes comes from Canada, so “it's going to increase the cost of a house.” Additionally, Ford said that the cost of cars will also increase. “We ship as many autos as we buy, but the cost of a pickup truck or an automobile is going to go up,” he said.
    


                    Ford continued: “So these tariffs is nothing but a tax on Americans and he, President Trump, calls it ‘Liberation Day,' I call it ‘Termination Day,' because a lot of people are going to be terminated from their jobs” as a result of them.
                





            Still, Ford said he does hope that Trump ultimately settles on lower tariff increases.
    


            “I'd like to just go back to the original deal. We had a great deal, he said it was the greatest deal ever. I guess it's not the greatest deal ever now,” Ford said, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, adding that Canada and the US should work together as partners and not adversaries.
    


            US stocks edged into the green Wednesday morning ahead of President Donald Trump's expected announcement on tariffs, which is set for 4 p.m. ET.
    


            The Dow climbed higher by 100 points, or 0.24%. The broader S&P 500 edged higher by 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.15%.
    


            Stocks have been volatile this week. The S&P 500 on Tuesday sank as much as 0.95% before ending the day 0.38% higher.
    


            “We expect volatility to rise given the difficulties of forecasting tariffs and the ultimate impact on the economy and earnings,” said Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.
    


            “Extreme fear” has been the sentiment driving markets since Friday, according to CNN's Fear and Greed Index. Investors are looking to build on a three-day winning streak for the S&P 500 despite the uncertainty around tariffs.
    


            “Markets have oversold the tariff threat and now the risk is a reversal to the upside if the tariff bark turns out to be bigger than the tariff bite,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group.
    


            Several European officials spoke out against tariffs today ahead of President Donald Trump's announcement.
    


                    The president's tariffs will have a “negative impact” around the world, said Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank. “The density and the durability of the impact will vary depending on the scope, on the products targeted, on how long it lasts, on whether or not there are negotiations,” she told Ireland's Newstalk radio, adding that tariff hikes often “prove harmful, even for those who inflict it.”
                





            Similar warnings came from the European Union's executive arm and the French government.
    


            Olof Gill, a spokesperson for the European Commission, warned of looming “pain” both in Europe and the United States.
    


                    “We want to sit down at the table with our American counterparts and find agreements, deals that will allow us to avoid the inevitable pain of these tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic,” he said.
                





            Although the French government does not yet know the details of US tariffs due to be unveiled later, “they risk being pretty powerful,” spokesperson Sophie Primas told reporters.
    


                    “People are speaking of tariffs between 20 and 25%,” she said. “This will obviously lead to quite significant economic disorder on the products impacted, not only in Europe but also in the United States.” 
                





            European officials have been warning against higher tariffs for weeks. “In our interconnected world, increased trade frictions are detrimental to global (economic) growth and welfare,” Lagarde said in a speech last month, noting that such frictions, including tariffs, raised costs and disrupted production.
    


            America's economic engine is running a little rough these days.
    


            Consumer confidence is cratering, debt burdens are growing, people are worrying more about their jobs and they're pulling back on some spending out of caution.
    


            High inflation and high interest rates have contributed to vulnerabilities among consumers, making them all the more susceptible at a time when the sheer unpredictability of the Trump administration's policies are chilling spending and investment plans.
    


            And now, massive tariffs are set to be rolled out, raising the cost on almost everything Americans buy.
    


            “The consumer sees darkening clouds for the economy ahead,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds.
    


            Consumer spending powers more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity; so if that engine falters, the economic consequences can start spiraling.
    


“Prior to Trump, what tariffs has the US put on other countries?” Patrick in Canada asks.



            While we can't list every tariff enacted in US history in this short post, there were some tariffs imposed by the Biden administration on China.
    


            In September 2024, the Biden administration imposed tariff hikes on certain Chinese-made products, meaning the tariff rate went up to 100% on electric vehicles, to 50% on solar cells and to 25% on electrical vehicle batteries, critical minerals, steel, aluminum, face masks and ship-to-shore cranes from September 27, according to the US Trade Representative's Office.
    


            Tariff hikes on other products, including semiconductor chips, were set to take effect in the two years after that date.
    


            Another thing worth noting is that Trump implemented sweeping tariffs on about $300 billion of Chinese-made products when he was first in office. Biden kept those tariffs in place and, after the USTR finished a multiyear review earlier this year, decided to increase some of the rates on about $15 billion of Chinese imports.

            President Donald Trump shared a Fox Business segment in which US Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler praised “Liberation Day,” the term he coined to mark his announcement of sweeping new tariffs.
    


            Trump posted the segment on Truth Social and highlighted the portion of the interview where Loeffler tells Maria Bartiromo that “Liberation Day” is an “exciting day” and “is the single greatest salvation, for not just small businesses, but for America.”
    


                    “This country was traveling down an unsustainable path, and President Trump has been the only president that has a backbone to stand up to our allies and adversaries alike and say, ‘We have to level the playing field.' KELLY LOEFFLER.” Trump's post noted.
                





            The president is expected to announce new tariffs today at 4 p.m. ET from the White House Rose Garden.
    


Here's what we know: It remains unclear what Trump's plans are as he attempts to negotiate new terms for economic agreements. As of late Tuesday, Trump and his team were still reportedly weighing options of what plans will be unveiled today. For months, Trump kept businesses and nations across the globe largely in the dark on his tariff plans that revolve around what he refers to as “reciprocal tariffs.” But on April 2, he's promised to answer at least some of their burning questions.
    


            Today's announcement is unlikely to relieve businesses that have been craving certainty since Trump's November victory. Rather, it'll open a whole new can of worms as countries respond to new tariffs with countermeasures on American goods, setting the stage for a new phase of negotiations that could escalate an already bitter trade war.
    


CNN's Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report. 



            President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are expected to have implications for businesses around the world, especially if foreign countries retaliate, which many have promised.
    


            Trump's tariffs threaten to upend a global trade order that has persisted for decades, and business leaders are worried that tensions will spiral out of control after Trump's big announcement in the Rose Garden.
    


                    “The scope and scale of this tariff hike vastly surpasses the infamous Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930 and would place American exports valued at over $1.6 billion at risk of some form of trade retaliation,” John Denton, secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce, said in commentary issued Wednesday.
                





            “There is a clear systemic risk to the global trading system if the reciprocal U.S. tariffs spark a tit-for-tat trade war involving multiple major trading partners,” he said.
    


            Denton added that “the reciprocal tariff plan could well represent the single largest escalation in U.S. tariffs in the last century.”
    


            The European Union, Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea have all pledged to respond to Trump's latest tariffs.
    


            Softwood lumber — which is sourced from the likes of pine, spruce, firs and other conifers — is prized for its light weight, workability and strength. As such, its applications are vast, but it's a critical ingredient in the US homebuilding industry.
    


            And considering that 30% of the softwood lumber consumed in the US is imported (with Canada accounting for north of 80% of those imports), American homebuilders have been sounding the alarm that the tariffs could further exacerbate the housing affordability crisis.
    


            Builders estimate that tariffs on lumber and other critical homebuilding materials could up the average cost of a home by $9,200, according to the March National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index.
    


            Economists expect that lumber prices could increase in the near-term and caution that expanding the domestic timber and lumber industry could take time.
    


A rosier outlook: However, some within the lumber sector say the new tariffs, especially on imports coming from Canada, would help level the playing the field. They also say the existing US industry has a significant amount of existing capacity that's not currently being utilized.
    


            Jason Brochu, co-president of Pleasant River Lumber in Maine, said his two mills in the Pine Tree State are running at 60% capacity but could increase its workforce and production in a matter of months, if the demand is there.
    


                    “We could ramp up fairly quickly,” Brochu said in an interview with CNN. “The saw mill industry has modernized a lot, and speaking for our location and our region, bringing in the employment isn't a major impediment.”
                





            “It can happen fairly quickly,” he added.
    


            President Donald Trump spent much of yesterday huddled with his top trade advisers, with many friends and allies calling him up until the eleventh hour with ideas on how best to move forward with his tariff plan, sources familiar with the talks told CNN.
    


            The plan will be unveiled in the Rose Garden, his first event in the White House space of his second term, and will include the pomp and circumstance the president expects to accompany an announcement of this magnitude, two White House officials told CNN.
    


            The event was initially scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. ET, but was later moved to 4 p.m.ET, the two White House officials told CNN — notable given it will now kick off after markets close.
    


            The announcement comes as top Trump administration officials struggle to articulate what the president's endgame is. Trump officials, including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday, have repeatedly urged the public to trust Trump and have pointed to the economy during his first term as justification.
    


            Dave Kelleher, the owner of a David Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram car dealership in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, spoke to CNN about how the impending tariffs may impact his business.
    


            Kelleher gave an example of a car that could “go from $30,000 ostensibly to $37,500, and it's that quick,” he said, snapping his fingers. “And that kind of change in price moves that payment $175 a month, and our customers — they're middle-class people — they just can't afford that kind of bump.”
    


            Kelleher also told CNN's Danny Freeman that he has a customer who ordered a $86,000 Ram truck — which will skyrocket in price if it's not shipped today, causing Kelleher to likely take a $20,000 hit.
    


                    “We're trying as hard as we can to get that thing off the line today. If that can on a train today, it'll be without tariff. If it gets on the train tomorrow, it's going to have a 25% tariff. That $86,000 car becomes a $103,000 car overnight and that customer, he's going to turn to me. I'm most likely going to eat that. That's a $20,000 hit that I'm going to take,” he said.
                





            Kelleher said he thinks President Donald Trump's aim to bring more jobs to the US is “admirable.” But he added:
    


                    “I'm telling you right now, the impacts of these tariffs are going to make Americans lose jobs.”
                





Remember: Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports and a 25% tariff on foreign cars that is set to go into effect on Thursday. A 25% tariff on foreign auto parts is set to go into effect by early May. The president said this past weekend that he doesn't care if automakers hike prices because of his tariffs, reiterating, “people are going to start buying American cars.”
    


            President Donald Trump says he believes tariffs are a panacea: a catch-all economic tool that can restore America's manufacturing prowess, bring foreign nations to heel on key disputes, restore the balance of trade and bring in gobs of money that can help pay off the US deficit and reduce Americans' tax burdens.
    


            Trump is correct that tariffs can help fulfill many if not all of those promises: When used effectively, tariffs can help boost production at home by making foreign goods more expensive. Because America is an enormous and diverse economy that doesn't rely on trade as much as its neighbors, the United States could use tariffs to inflict serious damage on other countries' economies without plunging itself into a recession. Revenue raised by tariffs could help offset some of its deficits.
    


            But one major problem with Trump's plan is that tariffs can't achieve all of those goals at the same time:
    


            For example, if tariffs are a pressure campaign, they have to go away once the countries acquiesce — which means there will be no tariffs to restore the trade balance.
    


            If tariffs are designed to promote America's manufacturing sector, they can't also raise revenue to offset deficits.
    


            And if Americans switch to “Made in the USA” goods, then who pays the tariff on foreign products?
    


            As the saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.
    


            Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan said President Donald Trump's expected tariffs on Wednesday are coming out of “either spite or who he's upset with” and will lead to consumers paying for them.
    


                    “Trump's tariffs are taxes on the average person. There's reasons to have tariffs. If someone's dumping cheap steel in this country, we should put tariffs on it to support the American workers and the industry. But that's not what's happening. This is across the board tariffs that somehow Donald Trump does out of either spite or who he's upset with or whatever rationale he's using,” Pocan said Wednesday on “CNN News Central” with John Berman, Kate Bolduan and Sara Sidner.
                





            He continued, “But at the end of the day, the people who pay it are the consumers.”
    


            Pocan said Republicans who agree with Trump's agenda will pay a price at the polls.
    


            “The attacks that we see coming from the Trump administration and from Elon Musk right now are epic, and people don't like them. And Republicans who are complicit are going to pay a price,” he said.
    


            US stocks opened lower Wednesday as investors await President Donald Trump's announcement on tariffs.
    


            The Dow was down 330 points, or 0.78%. The S&P 500 fell 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.43%.
    


            Trump's back and forth on his trade policy has roiled markets, leaving Wall Street eager for clarity, though bracing for continued uncertainty.
    


            “Investor sentiment remains skittish,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Tuesday note.
    


            Analysts at Bank of America Global Research said in a Tuesday note that without relief from uncertainty, stocks could slide further in the short term.
    


            “It's very tough to know what to expect, and we don't even know what the tariffs actually are,” said Michael Green, chief strategist and portfolio manager at Simplify Asset Management.
    


            Sometimes, even bad news can be good news on Wall Street.
    


            Markets have been on a knife's edge this week, awaiting President Donald Trump's tariff announcement this afternoon, and there's a sense among some investors that any news, even if it's bad for the long-term health of the economy, will bring a level of clarity that investors have been craving.
    


            That could spark a brief “relief rally,” Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jones Trading, said in a note late Tuesday.
    


            That's what often happens when Wall Street expects a company to have terrible earnings — once the earnings come out, the stock might rally or remain flat, because at least investors can see what they're dealing with. The anticipation is worse than the event.
    


            But this time may be different, according to O'Rourke.
    


            “There can be a relief rally, but there won't be certainty,” he writes.
    


            Tariffs will likely bring retaliation, and retaliation brings escalation.
    


            “The situation is likely to remain fluid for some time,” O'Rourke said. “Ideally, several key nations would drop tariffs and global trade would benefit. That would be the best-case scenario, but it appears nearly impossible.”
    


“What has been the response from U.S. trading partners and international leaders? Could these tariffs lead to retaliatory measures, and what might these look like?”  are some of the questions asked by Amedee, in California. 



            Many international leaders have been quick to condemn the previewed tariffs, warning that they don't want to enter into a trade war, and saying their countries will take strong countermeasures if they are imposed.
    


Here's what some of them had to say: 



            • Europe: On Tuesday, head of the European Union, Ursula Von der Leyen said bloc had a “strong plan” for striking back at the US, if required. Already, Europe has responded to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs by unveiling countermeasures on up to 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of American goods exports, including tariffs on boats, bourbon and motorbikes.
    


            • Canada, China, Japan and South Korea are also readying retaliation against Trump's looming tariffs. The three Asian countries plan to announce retaliatory tariffs in lockstep, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said Monday. They held economic talks Sunday for the first time in five years, vowing to bolster fair trade and strengthen economic ties among them.
    


            • Canada: Prime Minister Mark Carney told President Donald Trump on Friday that his nation would retaliate against the US with tariffs of its own if Trump pressed forward with his promised levies.
    


            • United Kingdom: Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country would take a “pragmatic approach” to its response and that a “trade war is in nobody's interest.”



We are answering questions from readers on the tariffs. You can submit your questions here.



            President Donald Trump's trade war, which is expected to kick into high gear Wednesday, will undoubtably affect the US economy. Federal Reserve officials are watching closely how everything plays out.
    


            Trump's economic team is still hashing out the details of the new duties in the eleventh hour, but economists widely expect Trump's tariffs in most cases to raise inflation and weaken economic growth. The Fed is tasked by Congress to tame inflation and promote full employment.
    


            Most Fed officials in recent remarks have acknowledged the high level of uncertainty stemming from the dizzying back-and-forth on tariffs. Most have also said that it's still not clear how the economy will ultimately respond to Trump's shock therapy.
    


            Here's what Fed officials have said recently on tariffs.
    


“Who pays the tariffs imposed by the White House: the government of the foreign country? Or, American based businesses that buy goods and services from other countries?,” Ruth, from the Midwest asks. 



            In response your question, Ruth, it has been at times confusing identifying who has to pay the tariff.
    


            President Donald Trump and members of his administration have often shrugged off concerns about the additional cost tariffs present for US businesses, claiming foreign countries are the ones who pay for it. That's not exactly true, though.
    


            Domestic businesses that import products into the country pay the tariffs up front, contrary to Trump's claims that exporting nations foot the bill.
    


            The actual transaction occurs at the 328 points of entry into the US designated by Customs and Border Protection to take in imports, including airports, railways, roads and ports.
    


            At those ports of entry, CBP agents collect tariff revenue from the domestic businesses importing the products, which is calculated based on how the merchandise is classified and where it came from, said Ted Murphy, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who specializes in advising businesses on customs compliance issues told CNN in March.
    


            But Trump isn't entirely wrong in saying that other nations pay for tariffs levied on them, Murphy said. That's because when businesses know they'll have to spend more to import goods from one country versus another, they may decide it makes more financial sense to find a new supplier elsewhere or, in Trump's ideal world, shift their production to the US.
    


            In either case, the economy of the country whose goods are tariffed can suffer from the loss of revenue, potentially resulting in job losses.
    


            But exporting nations often don't just accept tariffs without fighting back.
    


            UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country will take a “pragmatic approach” in its response to looming tariffs from his US counterpart's administration.
    


            “A trade war is in nobody's interest and the country deserves, and we will take, a calm, pragmatic approach,” Starmer said today to Parliament.
    


                    “That is why constructive talks are progressing to agree a wider economic prosperity deal with the US. That's why we are working with all industries and sectors likely to be impacted. Our decisions will always be guided by our national interests, and that's why we have prepared for all eventualities, and we will rule nothing out,” he added.
                





            On Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer said that the British government has been “actively preparing for all eventualities,” according to a Reuters report. The spokesperson told reporters that talks between the UK and US to strike a deal to avoid the tariffs will likely continue beyond Wednesday, Reuters reported.
    


            As President Donald Trump and his team worked Tuesday to “perfect” the tariffs he plans to unveil in the Rose Garden, he continued to weigh ideas that differed dramatically in size and scope — underscoring just how divergent some of his options are in the hours before his announcement.
    


            As of late yesterday, the White House had not arrived at a final decision. These were still under consideration, according to people familiar with the matter:
    


            Trump and his aides were also studying new, additional options, including a more targeted flat-rate option just on certain countries.
    


            The tariffs will go into effect immediately, the White House said yesterday, but added he would be open to negotiation once they're in place.
    


Trump's Rose Garden event is scheduled for 4 p.m. ET, just as US markets close. A number of lawmakers and industry executives have been invited to attend, according to a person familiar with the planning.
    


            Under debate is not only the plans themselves, but what Trump hopes to achieve from them. He has pointed to tariffs both to reorient global trade and as a negotiating tactic, and his aides have also said they will also be revenue raisers to offset planned tax cuts.
    


            China, Japan and South Korea will respond to President Donald Trump's looming tariffs in lockstep, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said Monday.
    


            The three Asian countries held economic talks on Sunday for the first time in five years, vowing to bolster fair trade and strengthen economic ties among them — just days before the United States announces sweeping tariffs on all trading partners.
    


            On Wednesday, Trump will unveil wide-ranging tariffs that match the ones foreign countries impose on the US, so-called reciprocal tariffs. Long-time US allies, such as South Korea, won't be spared, Trump has said.
    


            “South Korea's average tariff is four times higher,” Trump said earlier this month in his joint address to Congress. “Think of that: four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea, but that's what happens.”
    


            Meanwhile, Trump has renewed trade tensions with China, levying 20% duties on the country, on top of the tariffs he already imposed in his first term. China has responded swiftly to Trump's tariffs, imposing 15% duties on chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton imports from the US.
    


            US stock futures were lower Wednesday morning ahead of President Donald Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs, set to be unveiled at 4 p.m. ET.
    


            Dow futures were lower by 311 points, or 0.74%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.95%. Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 slid 1.15%.
    


            Stocks are coming off two volatile sessions this week. The S&P 500 on Monday sank as much as 1.65% in the morning before fluctuating and closing 0.55% higher. The index on Tuesday fell 0.95% in the morning but closed 0.38% higher.
    


            Wall Street is eager for a boost in markets on more clarity about Trump's tariffs, though some investors acknowledge that uncertainty might linger beyond this afternoon's announcement.
    


            “We would anticipate not getting answers to everything [today],” said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management Group.
    


            Hainlin said there's still uncertainty around retaliatory tariffs from other countries and whether the Trump administration could shift its policy.
    


            “Tariff and counter tariff concerns continue to dominate markets,” said Mohit Kumar, chief economist and strategist for Europe at Jefferies, in a Tuesday note.
    


            In response to our call-out asking for any questions you may have about tariffs, we've received a question from one of you: what is it? Let us explain!
    


            Simply, a tariff is a tax on goods coming from another country.
    


            It's typically structured as a percentage of the value of the import and can vary based on where the goods are coming from and what the products are.
    


            Domestic businesses that import products into the country pay the tariffs up front, with the actual transaction taking place at the 328 points of entry into the US designated by Customs and Border Protection to take in imports, including airports, railways, roads and ports.
    


            At those ports of entry, CBP agents collect tariff revenue from the domestic businesses importing the products, which is calculated based on how the merchandise is classified and where it came from, said Ted Murphy, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who specializes in advising businesses on customs compliance issues.
    


            President Donald Trump says today is “Liberation Day” and has floated a number of ideas, proposals and plans ahead of his 4 p.m. ET Rose Garden announcement.
    


            The truth is we don't really know what to expect today. Sources with knowledge of the president's plans tell CNN Trump may not finalize his plans until right before the announcement.
    


            That uncertainty has upended stock markets, consumer sentiment and business' hiring, because it's hard to make a financial decision when you don't know what's coming down the pike.
    


            Despite Trump and his advisers publicly suggesting multiple proposals — including reciprocal tariffs, taxes on particular products and even across-the-board tariffs — we don't know which if any (or all) of those plans Trump will enact, or whether there will be any exemptions, exceptions, carve-outs, or granularity in the plan that could significantly affect the impact of the tariffs that will be implemented.
    


            Trade policy is extraordinarily complex. For example, if we get reciprocal tariffs, will the United States match the complex tariff schedules for literally every single product imported from every nation? Or will America tax particular products or certain nations? Will the United States match graduated tariffs that increase based on import targets?
    


            We may get some clarity today. We may not. We'll find out at 4 p.m. ET.
    


Watch CNN's Alayna Treene's reporting on the announcement: 


President Donald Trump is set to announce the details of his tariff plan at 4 p.m. ET, as he aims to redraw economic agreements with US trading partners. CNN's Alayna Treene reports from the White House.


            Welcome to our coverage of what President Donald Trump has dubbed “Liberation Day,” which is redrawing economic agreements with the US's trading partners.
    


            While the details of the new levies remain unclear, Trump has teased everything from reciprocal tariffs on all countries to the enactment of delayed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada.
    


            There will be a lot of news to sort through today as we learn more details about the expected tariffs, and we'll be working to unpack exactly what these policies will mean for American consumers (and their wallets).
    


            If you have any questions about the tariffs, let us know in the form below. We're bringing you the latest responses and reactions throughout the day right here.
    


            Many Americans say tariffs hurt the nation's economy and they expect President Donald Trump's policies to increase inflation, according to a new Marquette Law School poll released this morning.
    


            A 58% majority say they think that, in general, imposing tariffs on products imported from other countries hurts the US economy, with 28% saying it helps, and 14% that it doesn't make much difference. The survey didn't ask about Trump's specific plans for tariffs, details of which have remained largely up in the air.
    


            Fifty-eight percent also say they think Trump's policy proposals will increase inflation, with 30% saying they expect them to decrease it, and 12% expecting them to have no effect.
    


            The poll puts Trump's overall job approval at 46%, with 54% disapproving, roughly on par with other recent polling.
    


            The Marquette Law School poll was conducted from March 17 to 27 and surveyed 1,021 US adults, using the SSRS Opinion Panel, a nationally representative online panel. Results among the full sample have a margin of sampling error of +/- 3.5 percentage points.
    


            Wall Street is desperate for clarity on tariffs as President Donald Trump prepares to lay out his “Liberation Day” trade strategy on Wednesday.
    


                    “We need the rules of the game, but we don't even know what the playing field is. Is it a soccer pitch, a basketball court or a ping pong table?” Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told CNN in a phone interview.
                





            Trade war fears and confusion have rocked markets for weeks. US stock futures are pointing to a modestly lower open on Wednesday, hours before Trump's Rose Garden event on tariffs.
    


            “I'm not sure we're going to be liberated from all the uncertainty,” Sonders said.
    


            The Schwab executive said that even once the broad trade plan is announced, key questions will remain, including how consumers and businesses will react, what happens to inflation and what the Federal Reserve will do in response.
    


            Still, market veterans told CNN said that if Trump announces tariffs short of the worst-case 20% universal tariff, US stocks could experience a short-term relief rally.
    


            “Better or worse often matters more than good or bad when it comes to short-term market reactions,” Sonders said.
    


            Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN that Wall Street is bracing for a “sledgehammer, not a scalpel” on “Liberation Day.” He said investors have been frustrated by the “haphazard” way tariffs have been rolled out by Trump.
    


            “It seems like they're making the rules up as they go along, and that's probably not far from reality,” Hogan said.
    


            Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in comments published Tuesday by state broadcaster CCTV that Beijing would “counterattack” if the US continues to engage in “blackmail” over tariffs.
    


                    “'America First' should not be American bullying, and it should not build its own interests on the basis of damaging the legitimate rights and interests of other countries,” he was quoted as telling RT, a state-owned Russian news group.
                





            For weeks, President Donald Trump has promoted April 2 as “Liberation Day” in America, when a number of massive tariffs will be announced to fulfill the administration's ambitious economic agenda.
    


            Trump is set to unveil his tariff plan at 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday in the first Rose Garden event of his second term, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.
    


            He posted on Truth Social this morning, previewing his afternoon announcement, saying, “IT'S LIBERATION DAY IN AMERICA!”
    


            “This is obviously a very big day,” Leavitt said. “He is with his trade and tariff team right now, perfecting it to make sure this is a perfect deal for the American people and the American worker.”
    


            Leavitt said it is ultimately up to Trump to decide what tariffs to impose. He and his advisers have contradicted themselves over the past days and weeks as they have tried to set expectations about what would be announced on April 2.
    


            “He has a brilliant team of trade advisers,” Leavitt said Monday, listing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, trade adviser Peter Navarro, senior aide Stephen Miller and Vice President JD Vance.
    


            President Donald Trump's tariff proposals have kept investors in a cloud of uncertainty, and stocks after coming off a dismal first quarter. The S&P 500 fell 4.6% across the first quarter, recording its worst start to a year since 2022 and its worst quarter since September 2022. The Nasdaq Composite fell 10.4% across the first quarter, posting its worst start to a year since 2020 and its worst quarter since June 2022.
    


            The US dollar index, which measures the dollar's strength against six foreign currencies, is down almost 4% this year, its worst start to any year since 2016.
    


            That's because traders had expected Trump to usher in a pro-business boom, enabling the stock market to continue its historic run. But his commitment to an economic agenda that prioritizes tariffs has left investors perplexed.
    


            “The uncertainty level is still high, and nobody really knows what to expect,” said Thomas Martin, a senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments.

Follow:


            Wisconsin voters on Tuesday delivered Democrats their biggest boost since President Donald Trump returned to power, handing liberals a state Supreme Court majority and defying Elon Musk's record-shattering effort to bolster a conservative Trump acolyte.
    


            Liberal Susan Crawford defeated conservative Brad Schimel, winning a 10-year term and retaining the 4-3 liberal Supreme Court majority in a state bitterly divided between a Democratic governor and Republican legislature, where the nominally nonpartisan high court has often functioned as a third, tie-breaking partisan body.
    


            The race was an early — but useful — gut check of the electorate in one of the nation's marquee swing states more than two months into Trump's second presidency.
    


            Crawford's win also fits into a broader picture of Democratic gains in the small number of contests held since Trump took office. Republicans on Tuesday held onto two House seats in ruby-red Florida districts, but saw the huge margins they'd won there in November shrink significantly. A week earlier, a Democratic candidate scored an upset win in a Pennsylvania state Senate seat in a stretch of Republican-leaning suburbs and farming communities.
    


            The biggest elections remaining on 2025's calendar come in November, when Virginia and New Jersey elect new governors.
    


            Here are seven takeaways from Tuesday's elections in Wisconsin and Florida:
    


            Stakes were already high, with control over the Supreme Court in a critical presidential battleground on the line in Wisconsin.
    


            Neither were on the ballot, but Badger State voters were weighing in on Trump (who won Wisconsin in 2016, lost it in 2020 and won it again in 2024, all by slim margins), Musk, and their performance so far.
    


            But the race took on national significance when Trump endorsed Schimel, the conservative candidate, and Musk — the tech billionaire-turned-White House adviser — poured tens of millions of dollars into the race and traveled to the state himself.
    


            “I never could have imagined that I'd be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin. And we won,” Crawford said at her victory party.
    


            The outcome is certain to bolster the spirits of Democrats who are out of power and ideologically splintered after November's losses. It's also an ominous sign for Republicans who are entering a midterm election cycle without Trump on the ballot, and one that comes before the effects of Trump's management of the economy — including tariffs — are fully felt.
    


            Aided by Musk's millions – along with infusions of cash from billionaires of both parties – the Wisconsin race quickly became the most expensive judicial contest in US history as both parties wrestled for control of the court's majority in a key swing state.
    


            But Wisconsin voters voted against Schimel, the candidate preferred by Trump and Musk.
    


            Crawford and her allies worked to turn the election in a referendum on Trump and Musk, in particular. The tech billionaire, together with aligned groups, pumped some $20 million into the race and thrust himself into the center of the election with an appearance – complete with a foam cheesehead – at Sunday rally in Green Bay that Schimel himself skipped.
    


            Trump endorsed Schimel in the final weeks of the campaigns, but did not stump on his behalf, and the result underscored the challenge Republicans faced in persuading voters who backed the president less than five months ago to turn out again for a judicial election in which he was not on the ballot.
    


            “There's about 200,000 voters who voted for Donald Trump last November, who just historically don't vote in spring elections,” Scott Walker, the state's former Republican governor, said on CNN after the race was called for Crawford Tuesday night.
    


            With Crawford's win, liberals will retain their 4-3 advantage on the high court and have final say on key issues looming before the justices, ranging from abortion to voting rules – and potentially – redrawing congressional maps that currently give Republicans in the state 6 out of 8 House seats.
    


            Musk's high-profile gamble – and loss – in Wisconsin raises questions about the effectiveness of his money and brand moving forward as he works to help Republicans next year attempt to buck the trend of the president's party losing ground in the midterms.
    


            The Tesla CEO has previously committed to send $100 million to support Trump-controlled political groups, a source familiar with the plans confirmed. And he recently donated directly to a clutch of House GOP members who have voiced support for impeaching judges who thwart Trump's executive moves.
    


            Democrats involved in House races say Musk's role – and the controversy surrounding his effort to slash federal spending as part of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency – will remain a focus in elections ahead. (Some ads from pro-Crawford groups featured images of Musk wielding a chainsaw this year at a gathering of conservative activists and sought to tie him to cuts to programs that benefit the poor and elderly.)
    


            “He's good foil,” a Democratic strategist involved in House races said of Musk. “Trump is a good foil in many ways, but at the end of the day, a lot of people voted for Trump. Nobody voted for Elon Musk and especially the outsized role he has played.”
    


            A GOP-backed referendum to enshrine Wisconsin's voter ID requirement in the state Constitution passed overwhelmingly Tuesday, even as voters kept the state Supreme Court in liberals' hands.
    


            Wisconsin voters have been required to present a photo ID when requesting an absentee ballot or voting in person since 2011. But Tuesday's referendum will make it harder for any future Democratic majority in the state to repeal those laws and protect the requirement from legal challenges.
    


            Supporters of voter ID laws argue that they prevent fraud and maintain trust in election integrity. Opponents say they make it harder for some – especially low income and disabled voters – to cast ballots and have been used to disenfranchise people. Democrats urged voters to oppose the measure, as did nearly two dozen civil rights groups, including the Wisconsin chapters of the ACLU and the League of Women Voters.
    


            But despite the opposition, voter ID laws are popular in the state. A February Marquette University Law School poll found that 73% of Wisconsin voters supported adding the voter ID requirement to the state Constitution.
    


            Schimel's loss is an embarrassment for Trump – and an even costlier one for Musk. But it's too soon to say what it means for Wisconsin's political future.
    


            For years, Wisconsin Democrats have worked to claw their way back to power after being hammered by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker. In recent years, those efforts have started to bear fruit.
    


            Two years after Trump broke the Blue Wall in 2016, Democrat Tony Evers defeated Walker in 2018. President Joe Biden won the state in 2020, Evers won re-election in 2022 and liberals won control of the state Supreme Court in 2023.
    


            Flipping the state Supreme Court sent shockwaves through the state and led to new maps that allowed Democrats to flip a handful of state legislative seats last year. But it did not preview a blue wave in the state in 2024: though Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin won re-election, Trump narrowly won the state by about 30,000 votes.
    


            In other words: Wisconsin rejected Trump and Musk Tuesday, but it is still a purple state.
    


            Even Tuesday's vote hinted at the nuanced political views in the state. Crawford's victory, in the face of millions in spending by Musk and Trump's endorsement of her opponent, came courtesy of the same voters who enshrined voter ID in the state Constitution.
    


            One thing is clear: Republicans will need to rely on more than Trump's support and Musk's money to succeed in the state in 2026.
    


            For House Speaker Mike Johnson, wins by Republicans Jimmy Patronis in Florida's 1st District and Randy Fine in the 6th District mean more breathing room to advance Trump's agenda.
    


            Johnson's House majority is so slim that Trump was forced to pull his nomination of New York Rep. Elise Stefanik for US ambassador to the United Nations to avoid a special election in a solidly red district.
    


            “We have a slim margin. We don't want to take any chances. We don't want to experiment,” Trump said last week.
    


            Losses in Florida would have ignited full-blown panic on Capitol Hill — and made Johnson's task of keeping together an ideologically fractured caucus even more difficult.
    


            The GOP averted that potential disaster. But the smaller-than-expected margins during Tuesday night's special elections could still leave congressional Republicans nervous, and are likely to serve as a wake-up call for those representing even nominally competitive districts.
    


            Although Republicans won both special elections in Florida and shored up their party's narrow majority in the House, the races grew more competitive than expected in the stretch to election day with the Democrats raising significant sums.
    


            And Tuesday's results offered some warning signs for the party. In districts Trump won by at least 30 points less than five months ago, both Democratic contenders cut those margins by roughly half, early results show.
    


            Fine, in Florida's 6th District, won by fewer than 14 percentage points after being outraised 10-to-1 by his Democratic opponent Josh Weil, a teacher.
    


            “Congratulations Randy, a great WIN against a massive CASH AVALANCHE,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Tuesday night.
    


            For GOP incumbents in battleground seats seeking reelection next year, the narrow margins in these deep-red Florida districts could serve as a potential warning sign of a tough midterm environment if Democrats are able to sustain their enthusiasm in opposition to Trump, Musk and the Republican agenda.
    


            A year after his public and contentious civil war with Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came to an end, Trump once again made clear who controls the GOP in his home state.
    


            Trump dictated the outcome of the Republican races to replace Gaetz and Waltz with his endorsement – elevating two candidates in Patronis and Fine who had loose ties to the districts they were tapped to represent. No matter, both sailed to victory in their primaries. Despite the closer-than-expected outcomes Tuesday, he now has two loyalists in Congress who owe their ascension almost entirely to Trump.
    


            DeSantis, meanwhile, declined to endorse both Trump-backed nominees, didn't lift a finger to help the GOP maintain its majority and trashed Fine as an objectionable candidate just as Republican panic over the race was reaching a crescendo.
    


            Fine and Patronis will now migrate to Washington where Trump has orchestrated a Florida takeover of federal government by leaning on Republicans who two years ago backed the president over their home state governor during the Republican presidential primary. His chief of staff, Susie Wiles, is a former DeSantis operative as is top White House political adviser James Blair. Trump named Waltz his National Security Adviser and the state's ex-Sen. Marco Rubio as his secretary of state. When the nomination for Panhandle Republican Gaetz to lead the Department of Justice faltered, Trump turned to Florida's former attorney general, Pam Bondi. Some of Trump's top fundraisers are Sunshine State lobbyists who are leveraging their connections to sign up a roster of clients looking to sway the new administration.
    


            Publicly, Trump and DeSantis remain on solid terms. But the latest touchstone in their ongoing rivalry comes as the president is already looking to leave his mark on next year's gubernatorial race in Florida. Trump made an early endorsement of Rep. Byron Donalds even as DeSantis' wife, Casey DeSantis, has taken steps toward her own race to succeed her husband.
    


            Tuesday's results make clear Trump's brand remains strong with the state's base. Republicans credited Trump's late involvement for the surge of support for Fine on Election Day that ultimately carried him over the finish line. So did the Democrat.
    


            “The President of the United States had to break into his schedule,” Weil said, “to drag (Fine) across the finish line.”

            A massive wave of job cuts got underway at US health agencies Tuesday, with some employees receiving early-morning emails saying their jobs were eliminated and some unable to access the building when they arrived at work.
    


            It was not immediately clear how many employees had received notice Tuesday morning. The US Department of Health and Human Services has not responded to CNN's request for comment.

HHS cuts 10,000 employees in major overhaul of health agencies



            HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said last week that 10,000 full-time employees would be cut on top of thousands who had already left and probationary employees currently on leave. He said the changes would make fighting chronic disease the priority and reduce “bureaucratic sprawl.” Kennedy promised that the department would do more with less.
    


            After weeks of worry from agency staffers, job cuts — known as a reduction in force, or RIF — were sweeping across offices at multiple agencies, hitting leadership, longtime staffers, scientists, administrators and communications staff.
    


            “It's a bloodbath,” one US Food and Drug Administration employee said.
    


            “These cuts to agency experts and programs leave our country less safe, less prepared and without the necessary talent and resources to respond to health threats,” Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Biden administration, said Tuesday.
    


            In a post on LinkedIn, former US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said, “The FDA as we've known it is finished, with most of the leaders with institutional knowledge and a deep understanding of product development and safety no longer employed.”
    


            Califf told CNN on Tuesday that “If we let down our guard and don't do a good job reviewing, we're going to unleash some things that are really dangerous into the population. Unless there's some super plan, there's going to be an effect on safety, because it takes whole teams of people to monitor safety of products, and the timetables for product review will probably be delayed.”

            Califf said he was dismayed to see how federal workers were being treated.
    


            “This is a sad and inhumane way to treat people,” he said. “It's different when you're a company and you're out of money and you can't pay people, but the federal government can pay people and do things in an orderly, respectful fashion – and not have them end up in line trying to get to work and have their badges not work as a way to fire them.”
    


            Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee announced Tuesday that they were inviting Kennedy to a hearing April 10 about the restructuring of HHS.
    


            “This will be a good opportunity for him to set the record straight and speak to the goals, structure and benefits of the proposed reorganization,” Cassidy said in a statement.
    


            Sanders was also among dozens of senators who wrote a letter to Kennedy on Tuesday to outline areas of the health care system that will be affected by the cuts and to request answers about the number of employees affected, the method of communication and any analysis on the impacts to programs and activities.
    


            “You continue to deny visibility to the American public, despite your oft-repeated commitment to ‘radical transparency.' You have promised that HHS will do more for the American people, at a lower cost to the taxpayer, yet you have not provided anything to substantiate these claims, despite repeated requests from Congress to do so,” the letter says.
    


            Kennedy said in a social media post that the agency is being “recalibrated to emphasize prevention, not just sick care.”
    


            “This is a difficult moment for all of us at HHS. Our hearts go out to those who have lost their jobs,” he wrote. “But the reality is clear: what we've been doing isn't working.”
    


            The totality of the cuts was not clear Tuesday, with many workers waiting for emails — or waiting to get into buildings, uncertain whether their badges would work. Even supervisors weren't sure who was being eliminated, one senior official at the CDC said.
    


            Cuts at the CDC slashed divisions that work on workplace health and safety, HIV, injury prevention, reproductive health, smoking and violence prevention, among others. Despite Kennedy's focus on chronic diseases, CDC employees described broad cuts at the agency's National Center for Chronic Disease and Health Promotion.
    


            The offices at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health that handle Freedom of Information Act requests were also cut. The FDA lost many of its FOIA officers, but a few remained, including some who were working on litigation, according to a source familiar with the circumstances who spoke on the condition that they not not be named for fear of reprisal.
    


             Several senior leaders at the CDC were reassigned to other roles, and some were told they would have to relocate. At NIH, Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was also offered reassignment to the Indian Health Service and would have to move to an area such as Alaska, New Mexico or Minnesota.

Is DOGE actually an agency? The answer could have major ramifications



            At the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the entire Office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights – which handles issues of diversity, civil rights and a supportive work environment – was let go, according to a former HHS employee.
    


            The notices sent to staffers in the office suggested that they contact the former director of the office if they had a complaint — but that director died late last year, Karen Shields, a former CMS executive, posted on LinkedIn on Tuesday morning. CNN has obtained a copy of the notice.
    


            “The dissolution of the office is disturbing but was expected. The referral to a woman who died over four months ago is a result of a significant lack of collaboration and consultation with the career team at the agency who would have helped to prevent this disgrace,” Shields wrote.
    


            Also, CMS cut all or nearly all of the Office of Minority Health, the former HHS employee said. The website of the office, which aims to improve the health of racial and ethnic minority groups through health policies and programs, was not working Tuesday, although it had been operational as recently as Saturday, according to web archives.
    


            The office, which was created by Congress, also focused on rural health, former CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said Friday.
    


            “We have health disparities, and we need to be measuring what is happening so that we can address those,” she said, noting that the office looked at issues such as diet and diabetes.
    


            At the FDA, staffers in the Office of New Drugs, the Office of Policy & International Engagement and the Office of Regulatory Programs were among those receiving notice. The agency's entire press office - the group that shares material with news media - received notice and was put on administrative leave, according to a person familiar with the cut who declined to be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about it.

Job opportunities are shrinking and layoffs in the federal government just hit their highest level in four years



            A RIF notice received by one FDA employee on Tuesday included performance ratings that were incorrectly low, meaning the severance pay offered was lower than it would be for the ratings they previously received, the employee told CNN.
    


            Multiple other colleagues who received the RIF had the same issue, the FDA employee said, making them uncertain whether they should sign the inaccurate paperwork. The employee said they couldn't tell if the inaccuracy was deliberate or an honest mistake.
    


            “Everybody's got families and mortgages and real-life concerns,” the source said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were concerned that being named would hurt their job prospects.
    


            Also terminated was the entire staff of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, according to Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. The program provides about $4 billion to help millions of Americans with their heating and cooling bills.
    


            “It will definitely hamper program operations,” Wolfe said, noting that he doesn't see how the agency can “allocate the remaining $387 million in funds for this year without federal staff. The program could well grind to a halt.”
    


            Staff of the HHS Administration for Children and Families – which provides support for child care, child welfare, early childhood development, family violence prevention, refugee resettlement, homeless teens and Head Start programs, among others – also received notice Tuesday.
    


            “We're devastated for our colleagues and friends who have lost their careers, and we're really feeling primarily devastated for our programs that we care so much about. In the regional offices, we're the ones who work directly with the people — the states, the territories, the tribes, the people that we serve — and we're just abruptly cut off from that work and our relationships,” said one employee in the administration who received notice Tuesday.
    


            “Our concerns are that by gutting these offices, it can make child care less safe, less affordable.”
    


            HHS announced last week that its reduction in force would cut 10,000 full-time employees in addition to 10,000 employees who've left voluntarily, shrinking the workforce from about 82,000 full-time employees to 62,000. About 5,200 probationary workers who have been in their positions less than a year or two were also terminated last month. Most are on temporary administrative leave as their fate winds its way through federal courts.
    


            HHS said last week cuts would include:
    


            Kennedy announced the cuts as part of a sweeping reorganization that would move or cut several parts of the federal health workforce, including the creation of a new Administration for a Healthy America, which it said would combine the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

Anger over the Trump administration's tariffs and rhetoric will likely cause international travel to the U.S. to fall even further than expected this year, an influential travel forecasting company said Tuesday.

Tourism Economics said it expects the number of people arriving in the U.S. from abroad to decline by 9.4% this year. That's almost twice the 5% drop the company forecast at the end of February.

At the beginning of the year, Tourism Economics predicted a booming year for international travel to the U.S., with visits up 9% from 2024.

But Tourism Economics President Adam Sacks said high-profile lockups of European tourists at the U.S. border in recent weeks have chilled international travelers. Potential visitors have also been angered by tariffs, Trump's stance toward Canada and Greenland, and his heated White House exchange with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

“With each policy development, each rhetorical missive, we're just seeing unforced error after unforced error in the administration,” Sacks said. “It has a direct impact on international travel to the U.S.”

The decline will have consequences for airlines, hotels, national parks and other sites frequented by tourists. 

Tourism Economics expects travel from Canada to plummet 20% this year, a decline that will be acutely felt in border states like New York and Michigan but also popular tourist destinations like California, Nevada and Florida. 




The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, has also warned about Canadians staying away. Even a 10% reduction in travel from Canada could mean 2.0 million fewer visits, $2.1 billion in lost spending and 14,000 job losses, the group said in February.

Other travel-related companies have noted worrying signs. At its annual shareholder meeting on Monday, Air Canada said bookings to the U.S. were down 10% for the April-September period compared to the same period a year ago.

Sacks said he now expects foreign visitors to spend $9 billion less in the U.S. compared to 2024, when international tourism to the country rose 9.1%.

“The irony is that the tariffs are being put in place to help right the trade deficit, but they're harming the trade balance by causing fewer international travelers to come and spend money here,” Sacks said.

Sacks said international arrivals had been getting close to returning to 2019 numbers, before the coronavirus pandemic halted most travel. Now he thinks they won't get back to that level until 2029.

As many as four in five immigrants at risk of deportation from the United States are Christian, according to a new report that calls on their fellow believers to consider the impact of the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies.

The report says about 10 million Christians are vulnerable to deportation and 7 million U.S. citizens who are Christian live in households where someone is at risk of deportation.

The report, under the auspices of major Catholic and evangelical organizations, draws on a range of data, including percentages of religious affiliation in various migrant and national populations and on an advocacy group's analysis of U.S. census data on migrants. 

“Though we're deeply concerned about fellow Christians, we're not exclusively concerned with immigrants who happen to share our faith,” said Matthew Soerens, vice president of advocacy and policy at World Relief, an evangelical humanitarian organization that cosponsored the report. 

“As Christians, we believe that all people, regardless of their religious tradition or nationality, are made in God's image with inherent dignity,” Soerens said in a video statement. But he added that many Christians in the U.S. may not realize that most of those who could be deported share their faith.

Other groups that helped produce the report include the National Association of Evangelicals, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration and the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in Massachusetts. While the report doesn't advocate any political positions, it mainly seeks to raise awareness of the issue among Christians, and some of its sponsoring groups have individually advocated for reforms that would give some categories of immigrants a path to legal status. 




Immigrants at risk of deportation range from those who crossed the border illegally to those who may have some sort of legal status that could be revoked. For example, the Trump administration has taken steps to end temporary protected status, held by many from Venezuela and Haiti, as well as humanitarian parole that had been granted for others from those troubled countries as well as Cuba and Nicaragua. 

President Donald Trump enjoyed wide support from certain Christian blocs in all three of his campaigns. In 2024, he was supported by about 8 in 10 white evangelical Christian voters, about 6 in 10 white Catholics and just over half of Latino evangelicals, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters.

While the report doesn't directly refer to that support, it says it seeks to raise awareness of the potential impact of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Even the fear of deportation could cause people to avoid going to public places — such as worship services. In an era when a growing number of people in the U.S. don't have a religious affiliation, many immigrants who are Christian have helped reenergize churches and spur their growth, said Walter Kim, president of the National Association of Evangelicals. 

“They're coming from parts of the world where the church is actually thriving,” Kim said. “Not only are they bringing that thriving faith and contributing to America, they're also contributing to the vibrancy of the church in America.”

Mass deportation would amount to a government-fostered “church decline strategy,” Kim said.

Kim said his organization has long advocated for reforms that would distinguish between those convicted of violent crimes and “the much larger share of immigrants who are contributing to our communities and to our churches, and who are serious and eager” to stay in the country.

Many studies have found immigrants are less drawn to violent crime than native-born citizens.

The recent report said Catholics in particular represent more than half of all those vulnerable to deportation in the United States, noted Bishop Mark Seitz, chair of the Committee on Migration of the bishops' conference.

The deportations would likely separate family members, Seitz said.

“We know the impact of tearing apart the family unity and also the tremendous threats that are faced by people who are summarily deported to their home countries, which they fled in the first place because of the tremendous threats they were living under there,” said Seitz, who heads the Diocese of El Paso, Texas.

They face danger from government oppression and organized crime in their home countries, Seitz said.

“People are going to die if this deportation effort continues at the level it is,” he said.

The report's methodology included calculating the percentages of Catholics, evangelicals and other Christian groups in the countries from which immigrants originated, based on self-reported affiliations. The report then applied those percentages to immigrant populations within various categories of immigrants.

While such methods include numerous assumptions, many regions of origin for major immigrants and refugee groups, including Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and Ukraine, have large Christian populations.

Watch live as U.S. Senator Cory Booker addresses the Senate floor. Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, has promised to speak “as long” as he's physically able on the Senate floor Monday night into Tuesday morning, criticizing the Trump administration.

Today's live coverage has ended. Read what you missed below and stay across the latest politics coverage by signing up for the Ground Game newsletter. 

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker held the Senate floor with a marathon speech that lasted 25 hours and 5 minutes, setting the record for the longest continuous Senate floor speech in the chamber's history. His feat of endurance was aimed at showing Democrats' resistance to President Donald Trump's sweeping actions.

Booker broke a record previously held by Strom Thurmond, a segregationist who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957, according to the Senate's records.

Other news we're following today:

The state's chief financial officer and Trump-backed candidate fended off a challenge from Democrat Gay Valimont. 

Patronis was far outraised and outspent by Valimont, who benefited from the outrage of national donors alarmed by Trump's aggressive second term. 

Patronis will fill the northwest Florida seat vacated by former Rep. Matt Gaetz. Gaetz had been tapped to be Trump's attorney general but dropped out amid allegations of sexual misconduct, which he has denied.

The senator wrapped his speech at 8:05 p.m. Tuesday, 25 hours and 5 minutes after he began.

The chamber had exploded in applause when Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer announced that Booker had broken the record, which was previously held by segregationist Strom Thurmond at 24 hours and 18 minutes.

The arrest rate fell 14% in March from a month earlier, the White House said.

Arrests totaled 7,181 last month, down from 8,347 in February and down 95% from 137,473 in March 2024. The daily average of 232 arrests is the lowest since 1967.

Traffic slowed sharply last year after Mexican authorities increased enforcement within their own borders and the Biden administration introduced severe limits on asylum. Numbers plummeted more when Trump took office and restricted asylum even more as part of a broad immigration crackdown.

He beat Democrat Josh Weil, who had outraised and outspent his counterpart. 

Fine ran in the reliably conservative district with the endorsement of Trump and former U.S. Rep. Mike Waltz. Waltz resigned from the seat to become Trump's national security adviser. 

Fine had faced growing pressure during the race's final days as some Republicans publicly criticized his campaign and fundraising efforts. His victory ends Democratic hopes to score a huge upset in a district that was heavily supportive of Trump in November.

Booker took to the Senate floor Monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was “physically able.” More than 24 hours later, the 55-year-old senator is still going. 

He has set the record for the longest continuous Senate floor speech in the chamber's history, though he was assisted by fellow Democrats who gave him a break from speaking by asking him questions.

It was a remarkable show of stamina as Democrats try to show their frustrated supporters that they are doing everything possible to contest Trump's agenda. 

Yet Booker also provided a moment of historical solace for a party searching for its way forward: By standing on the Senate floor for more than a night and day and refusing to leave, he had broken a record set 68 years ago by then-Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, a segregationist, to filibuster the advance of the Civil Rights Act in 1957.

Sen. Cory Booker has held the Senate floor for 24 hours and is closing in on the record for the longest continuous floor speech held by Strom Thurmond, a segregationist.

Thurmond filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957, according to the Senate's records. As Booker's speech rolled past 24 hours, anticipation is growing in the Capitol.

“Thank you for all the interest in my dinner with the president last night,” TV host Bill Maher posted Tuesday on X. He vowed that “all will be revealed” during his show “Real Time” on April 11, adding that if he offered details on April Fool's Day, “no one would believe what I said.”

That followed Kid Rock, who was at the White House on Monday, offering to help arrange a dinner. He told Fox News Channel that “Bill's obviously a very big liberal” but Trump was nonetheless “so gracious.”

The Democrats are under pressure to show their voters they are doing all they can, even as the minority party in Congress, to block Trump's agenda.

“We are standing together against the GOP tax scam and in defense of the American people,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said at the Capitol steps with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.

Schumer praised fellow Democratic Sen. Cory Booker as a “tour de force” for seizing the Senate floor in a landmark speech as they work to stall action on the GOP agenda.

“Florida and Wisconsin, it's not too late. Go VOTE,” former President Joe Biden posted on X — offering a rare political pronouncement since leaving office.

Wisconsin has a state Supreme Court election, while two Florida districts are holding special elections to replace Republican congressmen who vacated House seats after Trump tapped them for administration posts.

Biden has kept a low profile since leaving office. His words echoed Trump's White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, who also urged Wisconsin residents and Floridians to vote during her briefing with reporters.

The billionaire government adviser told voters that the battle is so close that it could be decided by a single vote.

He made clear the political reasons behind supporting Brad Schimel, the candidate backed by Republicans.

“A judge race, election in Wisconsin will decide whether or not the Democrats can gerrymander Wisconsin in order to remove two House seats from Republican to Democrat,” Musk said during a Fox News interview Tuesday afternoon.

If Republicans lose control of the U.S. House, Musk asserted that Democrats would do “everything possible to stop the agenda that the American people voted for,” Musk said.

“If you know people in Wisconsin, call them right now,” he added.

Trump will hold a Wednesday meeting with aides about possible investors who could buy a stake in TikTok, a deal that could potentially stop the social media site from being banned in the U.S.

The details of the meeting were confirmed by a person familiar with the situation who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

There has been uncertainty about the popular video app after a law took effect on Jan. 19 requiring its China-based parent, ByteDance, to divest its ownership because of national security concerns. After taking office, Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed until April 5 the enforcement of the law requiring a sale or effectively imposing a ban.

Among the possible investors are the software company Oracle and the investment firm Blackstone.

CBS News first reported on the meeting.

Another major international law firm has reached a deal with the White House to dedicate at least $100 million in free legal services to causes including veterans support and combating antisemitism.

The agreement announced Tuesday makes Willkie Farr & Gallagher the third law firm in the last two weeks to cut a deal with the White House. As part of the arrangement, Willkie agreed to disavow the use of diversity, equity and inclusion considerations in their hiring decisions.

The firm is home to Doug Emhoff, the husband of 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, and Tim Heaphy, who was chief investigative counsel to the House of Representatives committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.

The firm had been bracing for an executive order like the one leveled at nearly a half-dozen other major firms over the last month. Those orders have generally targeted firms over their association with attorneys Trump regards as adversaries.

The orders have threatened the security clearances of attorneys at the firms as well as the termination of the firms' federal contracts and access by employees to federal buildings.

The Trump administration has paused $27.5 million for organizations that provide family planning, contraception, cancer screenings and sexually transmitted infection services as it investigates whether they're complying with federal law.

The money isn't allowed to be used for abortion, but much of it goes to organizations that also provide abortions — and that's long made the funding a target for conservatives.

About one-fourth of the grant recipients were told this week that their funding is on hold. That includes all the groups that receive the money for seven states.

As Sen. Cory Booker's speech rolled past 21 hours, it marked the fourth-longest in Senate history.

Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, has surpassed the longest speech time for a sitting senator — the 21 hours and 19 minutes that Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, held the floor to contest the Affordable Care Act in 2013.

Throughout his determined performance Tuesday, Booker has repeatedly invoked the civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis of Georgia.

The longest speech time in Senate records is that of Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Booker would need to hold the floor for almost three more hours to beat that record.

Sen. Bill Cassidy, a doctor from Louisiana, summoned Kennedy to testify about his restructure of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services before the Senate health committee next week.

Cassidy backed Kennedy for the health secretary job after obtaining “serious commitments” from the administration, including that the health secretary would regularly appear before Senate lawmakers.

Cassidy's request comes on the same day thousands of staffers were laid off from the health department.

Dr. Richard Besser, who also previously served as acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said those carrying out the mass firings at Health and Human Services are “systematically and cruelly dismantling our nation's public health system and workforce, which threatens the health and wellbeing of everyone in America.”

The firings “represent an abdication of the department's essential responsibility to promote and protect health,” Besser said in a statement on Tuesday. “And they present a fundamentally different vision of what government can and should do to improve people's lives. Americans deserve better.”

He concluded his statement by saying: “It is clear that political leaders in this administration are neither committed to nor serious about improving everyday people's lives and health.”

Five regional offices for Head Start were closed Tuesday as part of a workforce reduction at the Department of Health and Human Services, according to the National Head Start Association.

Head Start is a preschool program that serves some of the nation's neediest families and children. Parents who otherwise would not be able to afford child care often rely on the program when they go to work or school.

The association's statement said the move was taken without a “clear plan for how the administration intends on supporting Head Start.”

The Office of Head Start had 12 regional offices to provide oversight and support administration of grants. It was not immediately clear which regional offices were closed.

Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney says he had a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to discuss the “importance of building upon the strong trading and investment relationship between the two countries.”

The discussion came in the lead up to Trump's anticipated tariffs on Wednesday. If enacted, the tariffs would deal a hefty economic blow to both nations, which are both in a free trade agreement with the U.S.

In the call, the two leaders spoke about the “challenging times ahead,” safeguarding economic competitiveness in the region and calls by both nations for the U.S. to respect their sovereignty, according to the Canadian government.

The leaders they would remain in “close contact,” and that top government officials would work together to boost trade between the two countries.

A federal judge in California held off Tuesday on granting the request from legal aid groups.

The Republican administration on March 21 terminated a program that provides legal services for unaccompanied migrants under 18, which plaintiffs say puts 26,000 children at risk of losing their attorneys.

Defendants say taxpayers have no duty to pay for direct legal services and the contract has expired.

But plaintiffs said Tuesday they're asking not for contract restoration but for the government to come up with a plan so children as young as five months old will have legal representation in immigration courts as required by Congress.

U.S. District Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín of San Francisco requested further briefing.

House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday exercised his power of the gavel — and tried to bring it down with an unusually aggressive effort to squash a proposal for new parents in Congress to able to vote by proxy, rather than in person, as they care for newborns.

His plan failed, 206-222.

In an unprecedented move, the House Republican leadership had engineered a way to quietly kill the bipartisan plan from two new moms — Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida and Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado. Their plan has widespread support from a majority of House colleagues. Some 218 lawmakers backed the new moms, signing on to a so-called “discharge petition” to force their proposal onto the House floor for consideration.

But Johnson, like GOP leaders before him, rails against proxy voting, as President Trump pushes people back to work in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic work from home trend.

Courage is rooted in love, the first lady said as she helped recognize eight women from around the world with the 2025 International Women of Courage Award.

At a ceremony at the State Department, which created the award, Trump said the “exceptional assembly of brave women” shows their love by refusing to be defined by fear or hardship.

Trump sought parallels with them, saying that, in her own life, she has “harnessed the power of love” as a source of strength during challenging times.

The eight women receiving awards hail from Burkina Faso, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Romania, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Yemen and Israel.

The honorees include Amit Soussana, who was taken hostage by Hamas after the militant group's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Soussana was released after 55 days.

They call the recent executive order unconstitutional and say millions of voters could be disenfranchised.

The “Defending America's Future Elections Act” was filed Tuesday and is likely to face opposition as Republicans maintain majorities in both the House and Senate.

Trump's March 25 order called for several election-related changes, including a documentary proof of citizenship requirement for voter registration and revised voluntary standards for voting machines to prohibit the use of barcodes on ballots. Lawsuits challenging the order have been filed.

Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat who sponsored the bill, calls Trump's order an “illegal and unconstitutional power grab.” Ten other senators co-sponsored the legislation.

They note that proving citizenship would be difficult for millions of Americans who don't have easy access to their birth certificates or who haven't obtained U.S. passports.

It was just hours after thousands of his employees began receiving emailed notices or were told to turn in their badges at HHS offices around the country.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. posted the videos on social media celebrating the swearing in of his two latest hires: Jay Bhattacharya, the NIH director, and Martin Makary, the FDA commissioner.

“The revolution begins today!” Kennedy wrote.

HHS hasn't provided additional details or comments about Tuesday's mass firings.

Hey, Rose. Thanks for your question. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has been holding the Senate floor since Monday night with a marathon speech that's lasted into Tuesday afternoon. It was a remarkable show of stamina as Democrats try to show their frustrated supporters that they are doing everything possible to contest Trump's agenda.

As Booker's speech rolled past 18 hours, it became the sixth longest in Senate history.

AP's Mike Catlini and Stephen Groves wrote about Booker's speech and what it represents. Here's some of what they said:

Booker's speech was not a filibuster, which is a speech meant to halt the advance of a specific piece of legislation. Instead, Booker's performance was a broader critique of Trump's agenda, meant to hold up the Senate's business and draw attention to what Democrats are doing to contest the president. Without a majority in either congressional chamber, Democrats have been almost completely locked out of legislative power but are turning to procedural maneuvers to try to thwart Republicans.

As Democrats search for a next generation of leadership, frustrated with the old-timers at the top, Booker's speech could cement his status as a leading figure in the party's opposition to Trump.

While it's not required for members of Congress to attend, Booker got some help from his Democratic colleagues, who gave him a break from speaking to ask him a question and praised his performance. Booker yielded for questions but made sure to say he would not give up the floor. He stayed standing to comply with Senate rules.

The Ivy League school received notifications Monday and Tuesday that grants were being suspended by agencies including the Department of Energy, NASA and the Defense Department, according to a campus message from President Christopher Eisgruber.

The rationale wasn't fully clear, but Princeton will comply with the law, Eisgruber said.

“We are committed to fighting antisemitism and all forms of discrimination, and we will cooperate with the government in combating antisemitism,” he wrote.

Princeton is the latest Ivy League school to have its federal funding come under scrutiny from the Trump administration amid investigations into campus antisemitism. Columbia University last week agreed to several demands from the administration after the government cut $400 million and threatened to slash billions more.

A federal task force on antisemitism announced Monday that Harvard was facing a “comprehensive review” of almost $9 billion in federal grants and contracts.

Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego announced Tuesday he'll block the confirmation of top leaders at the Veterans Affairs Department, raising the stakes in Democrats' bid to get the Trump administration to back off plans to cut jobs from the sprawling agency that serves millions of military veterans.

Gallego, a Marine Corps veteran, made the announcement just hours before the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs was scheduled to hear testimony from three nominees for the VA who are military veterans themselves. His move was a significant escalation in the Democrats' efforts to counter Trump's plans to slash federal agencies and a sharply partisan move on a committee that's often seen cooperation between Republicans and Democrats.

“Talking to veterans, people that I served with as well as seeing some of what's happening in Arizona, I decided that whatever tool I have to fix the situation, I'm going to use it,” Gallego told The Associated Press. “And this is one of the few tools I have at this point.”

The White House says Trump will head to Saudi Arabia in May. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt offered no further details on the trip.

Trump has signaled he's confident his administration can broker an agreement with ByteDance, the social media app's China-based parent company.

Speaking with reporters on Air Force One late Sunday, Trump said “there's tremendous interest in Tiktok.” He added that he would “like to see TikTok remain alive.” The president's comments came less than one week before an April deadline requiring ByteDance to divest or face a ban in the United States.

“We have a lot of potential buyers,” Trump said.

Trump also said the administration is “dealing with China” who “also want it because they may have something to do with it.” Last week, Trump said he would consider a reduction in tariffs on China if that country's government approves a sale of TikTok's operations in the U.S.

The White House is asserting that the man with protected legal status who was mistakenly sent to an El Salvador prison was a member of the MS-13 gang and alleged he'd been involved in human trafficking.

Officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, acknowledged an “administrative error” in efforts to remove Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia from the U.S.

“The administration maintains the position that this individual, who was deported to El Salvador and will not be returning to our country, was a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang,” Leavitt told reporters at a Tuesday briefing.

Leavitt claimed “credible intelligence” showed he was involved in human trafficking and that he was a leader of the notorious MS-13 gang.

“Foreign terrorists do not have legal protections in the United States of America anymore,” Leavitt said.

In a complaint, Abrego Garcia's lawyers disputed the government's claims.

“Although he has been accused of general ‘gang affiliation,' the U.S. government has never produced an iota of evidence to support this unfounded accusation,” the complaint stated.

With Trump's so-called “Liberation Day” of tariff implementation fast approaching, Senate Democrats are putting Republican support for some of those plans to the test by forcing a vote to nullify the emergency declaration that underpins the tariffs on Canada.

Republicans have watched with some unease as the president's attempts to remake global trade have sent the stock market downward, but they have so far stood by Trump's on-again-off-again threats to levy taxes on imported goods.

Even as the resolution from Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia offered them a potential off-ramp to the tariffs levied on Canadian imports, Republican leaders were trying to keep senators in line by focusing on fentanyl that comes into the U.S. over its northern border. It was yet another example of how Trump is not only reorienting global economics, but upending his party's longtime support for ideas like free trade.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, pressed retired Lt. Gen. Dan Caine on whether he would follow orders from the president to use the military in domestic matters like law enforcement.

Duckworth accused Trump of engaging in “threat inflation” of domestic protests to justify military involvement on issues like protests, immigration or free speech.

“I think there's strong systems in place, legal systems in place, that prevent any missteps there,” said Caine.

Sen. Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat, asked Caine whether he would push back on an order by Trump “to use the military in a way that was unconstitutional.” She argued that Trump had made such orders during his first term and promised to do so during his reelection campaign.

“I will senator. I don't expect that to happen, but I will,” Caine said.

Booker, who's 55, started speaking Monday evening and hasn't left the Senate floor since. As it rolled into Tuesday afternoon, Booker's performance is currently the sixth longest in Senate history.

The record for the longest individual speech belongs to Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

Only one other sitting senators has spoken for longer than Booker. In 2013, Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican of Texas, held the floor for 21 hours and 19 minutes to contest the Affordable Care Act.

The agency is losing more than 1,000 employees.

NIOSH is based in Cincinnati but also has people in Pittsburgh; Spokane and Morgantown, West Virginia.

Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of the union local representing NIOSH employees in Cincinnati, said the union had heard reports that around 850 of the center's employees are receiving notices, including the center's director.

The cuts are hitting mining safety research, work on developing personal protective technology, a firefighter cancer registry, and a lab that's key in the certification of respirators for industry. Niemeier-Walsh called the cuts “a very pointed attack on workers in this country.”

Booker, 55, was born in Washington, D.C., and moved to northern New Jersey when he was a boy. He's spoken about growing up in a Black family in a predominantly white neighborhood and how his parents faced opposition when they tried to buy a house.

He played football in college at Stanford University before attending Yale Law School and then worked as an attorney in nonprofits, giving legal aid to poorer families. Elected to the Newark City Council and then as mayor of the state's biggest city, he served there until 2013.

His time in office coincided with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million donation to the city's public schools, a boon that burnished his status as a Democratic rising star at the time.

Booker also ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2020.

In a Tuesday post on his social media platform, Trump said the pair discussed U.S. military operations against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, as well as the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and “possible solutions” to the conflict, as well as “military preparedness.”

The Tuesday sanctions were against a network of six firms and two people based in Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and China who are allegedly responsible for procuring drone components on behalf of Iranian drone manufacturers.

They mark the second round of sanctions targeting Iranian weapons proliferators since President Trump signed an executive order in February imposing a “restoring maximum pressure” campaign on Iran meant to deny Iran all paths to a nuclear weapon.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Treasury will continue to target Iranian drones “missiles, and conventional weapons that often end up in the hands of destabilizing actors, including terrorist proxies.”

After previously saying Mexico would seek “preferential treatment” with Trump and his tariffs, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum shifted her tone Tuesday to note the tariffs set to go into effect on Wednesday weren't targeting Mexico.

“What they're going to announce on April 2 isn't against Mexico, it's not against Canada. It's a policy of the United States to the entire world,” Sheinbaum said in her morning news briefing.

That said, if tariffs go into effect, Mexico would be dealt a particularly hard blow, as much of its economy is intertwined with the U.S., especially the auto sector.

While other leaders have butted heads with Trump, Sheinbaum has assumed a less confrontational approach, following through on U.S. demands in the hope that doing so will offset the bulk of American populist's threats.

“You have to trust the president's instincts on the economy,” Johnson said.

He said he expects the tariffs to go forward as Trump promised.

“We'll see how it all develops,” he said. “It may be rocky in the beginning. But I think that this will make sense for Americans and help all Americans.”

“There's a constitutional path. You have to amend the constitution to do this, and that's a high bar,” said Johnson, a lawyer who specialized in constitutional issues.

“I think he recognizes the constitutional limitations,” he said.

The Republican speaker says Trump has joked with him about the idea. He said he takes the president “at his word.”

Tuesday's special elections for two Florida congressional seats in heavily pro-Trump districts have become an unexpected source of concern for national Republicans as Democrats have poured millions in fundraising into the races.

Both seats opened when Trump chose their representatives for jobs in his second administration. Matt Gaetz was briefly nominated to be Trump's attorney general before withdrawing, while Mike Waltz became national security adviser.

Florida state Sen. Randy Fine, running for Waltz's seat, and state Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, running to replace Gaetz, are widely expected to hold the seats in their reliably conservative districts, which would give Republicans a 220 to 213 advantage over Democrats in the U.S. House.

But both have been outraised by their Democratic counterparts, and Republicans in Florida and Washington have begun trying to distance themselves from any potential underperformance.

As the trade wars launched by U.S. President Donald Trump continue to escalate, all eyes are on Wednesday. Trump has repeatedly called April 2 “Liberation Day,” with promises to roll out a set of tariffs, or taxes on imports from other countries, that he says will free the U.S. from a reliance on foreign goods. Associated Press reporter Seung Min Kim explains.

As a biting spring wind whipped around them, staffers waited for as long as an hour outside the health department's Washington offices to get scanned into the building.

As many as 10,000 workers are expected to lose their jobs Tuesday and some are finding out as they try to enter the building that they no longer have jobs. Laid off staffers are being asked to immediately turn in their badges and cellphones at the door.

One staffer waiting in line loudly joked: “Is this an April Fool's joke?”

During retired Lt. Gen. John Caine's confirmation hearing for joint chiefs chairman, Sen. Jack Reed asked him whether top uniformed military leaders should have participated in a controversial Signal chat in which U.S. officials discussed battle plans.

“From what I understand of that chat, it was a partisan political chat and so the joint force should not have been represented in there,” Caine said.

Caine declined to comment on whether senior U.S. officials, including the vice president, defense secretary, secretary of state and national security advisor, should have discussed battle plans on an unclassified, commercial application.

“What I will say is we should always preserve the element of surprise,” Caine said. He noted that the Senate Armed Services Committee had requested an inquiry into the matter.

President Trump has told a story about retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan Caine saying he wore one of the hats when the two met some years ago.

When asked about the story during the Senate Armed Services hearing on his confirmation, Caine said, “For 34 years, I've upheld my oath of office and my commitment to my commission. And I have never worn any political merchandise.”

He added that he thinks Trump must have been “talking about somebody else.”

A Chinese national has been sentenced to federal prison for exploiting a little-known loophole in an effort to ferry a dozen illegal migrants to a U.S. territory. 

Zhongli Pang, 36, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to transport illegal immigrants and conspiracy to defraud the United States after attempting to smuggle 12 Chinese nationals to the territory of Guam, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Tuesday.

""The arrest of Mr. Pang is a testament to HSI's continued efforts to deter the extremely dangerous and unlawful movement of illegal aliens within the CNMI,"" Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Special Agent in Charge Lucy Cabral-DeArmas said. ""By holding criminals accountable, HSI works with state and local authorities to thwart future violations, ensuring the safety of our communities through continuing partnerships.""

Pang attempted to exploit a little-known loophole allowing Chinese visitors to travel to the Northern Mariana Islands without a visa, according to prosecutors. 

However, Chinese migrants will occasionally take advantage of the visa waiver to sail to Guam, where a U.S. visa is required. 

In June 2024, Pang, along with several co-conspirators, purchased a boat for $33,000 and plotted to ferry 12 Chinese nationals from the island of Saipan to Guam. Due to Pang's limited boating experience and the risk of traveling approximately 100 miles by sea, the overcrowded vessel ran out of fuel and required rescue by the U.S. Coast Guard.

The DOJ and an attorney for Pang did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

A federal judge sentenced Pang to three months in federal prison with credit for time served and 50 hours of community service. The case comes as U.S. officials are cracking down on the flow of illegal immigrants through U.S. territories, such as Guam.

In 2023, HSI announced the launch of a Mariana Islands Border Enforcement Security Task Force in an effort to combat threats looking to enter the U.S. through the islands. The Mariana Islands and Guam can be an attractive entry point for criminals given their proximity to Asia. 

HSI did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

""We will continue to target illegal aliens unlawfully traveling between the CNMI and Guam,"" U.S. Attorney Shawn Anderson said. ""The risk to personal safety is substantial. Those interdicted also face imprisonment and immigration penalties. We urge PRC nationals to fully comply with the CNMI's parole program and return to China as agreed upon entry to Saipan. Enhanced enforcement efforts by DHS will result in the apprehension of those attempting to evade detection.""

Denise Richards is opening up about the highs and lows of raising children with an ex.

During a recent appearance on the ""Whine Down with Jana Kramer"" podcast, the 54-year-old star discussed what it was like raising her two daughters with her ex-husband, Charlie Sheen, admitting on the show that their relationship could be better.

""Truthfully, it wasn't co-parenting. I parent my way. He parents his way, and there was no co-parenting,"" she said. ""I have kids with him, and I'm not really — I'm friendly with Charlie, but I wish we were friends and that we could talk all the time and be able to be there really for each other with our girls. But that's just not the relationship we have. Maybe one day. But, I mean, right now, there's nothing. There's no discord between he and I, which is great.""

The former couple tied the knot in 2002 and were married for just under three years before Richards filed for divorce in March 2005, when she was pregnant with their second daughter, Lola. They welcomed their first daughter, Sami, one year prior.

Following their divorce, Sheen went on to marry Brooke Mueller from 2008 to 2011, welcoming twin sons, Bob and Max, with her in March 2009. Despite no longer being married to Sheen, Richards made it a priority to make sure her daughters had a relationship with their dad and siblings.

""I was always an advocate of wanting everything to be great and be friends and blend the family because he had two boys with his wife after me,"" she continued. ""I just didn't want the girls to feel like they had to choose sides.""

She went on to say she always made the effort to invite Sheen to their daughters' birthday parties and family holiday celebrations, explaining she ""thinks it's good for the kids to see that too.""

Although their marriage did not work out, she said she ""never talked bad about"" Sheen when her children were around but says ""now that they're older, they're discovering things"" from the past on their own.

In a race that could have changed the makeup of the Wisconsin State Supreme Court, the liberal candidate prevailed with major judicial decisions coming. 

MILWAUKEE — Democrats are celebrating a larger-than-expected victory in a high-profile and historically expensive election in battleground Wisconsin, in the first statewide ballot box contest since President Donald Trump's return to power in January.

Liberal-leaning Judge Susan Crawford topped conservative-leaning Judge Brad Schimel by roughly 10 percentage points – with some votes still being tabulated – to preserve the liberal majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which is likely to rule going forward on crucial issues like congressional redistricting, voting rights, labor rights and abortion.

With a massive infusion of money from Democratic-aligned and Republican-aligned groups from outside Wisconsin, which turned the race into the most expensive judicial election in the nation's history, the contest partially transformed into a referendum on Trump's sweeping and controversial moves during the opening months of his second tour of duty in the White House.

Also front and center in the technically nonpartisan showdown was someone who, along with Trump, was not on the ballot: billionaire Elon Musk, the president's top donor and White House advisor, who inserted himself into the race.

LIBERAL-LEANING CANDIDATE WINS FIRST MAJOR STATEWIDE ELECTION OF THE YEAR

""The people of Wisconsin squarely rejected the influence of Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and billionaire special interests,"" Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin claimed.

And the DNC, looking ahead to next year's bigger contests in the 2026 midterm elections, called the showdown in Wisconsin a ""bellwether race.""

But Republicans came out on top in Tuesday's other marquee contests, holding control of two vacant congressional seats in twin special elections in red state Florida. The double-digit victories by the Republican candidates will give the GOP a little bit of breathing room in the House of Representatives, where the party is holding onto a very fragile majority as it aims to pass Trump's agenda.

REPUBLICANS HOLD CONTROL OF TWO VACANT CONGRESSIONAL SEATS IN THIS RED STATE

""The American people sent a clear message tonight: they want elected officials who will advance President Trump's America First agenda, and their votes can't be bought by national Democrats,"" Republican National Committee chair Mike Whatley argued.

The Democratic candidates in the two special congressional elections vastly outraised their Republican counterparts – a sign that the party's base is angry and energized – which forced GOP-aligned outside groups to pour money and resources into the races during the final stretch. And the Democratic candidates ended up losing by 15 and 14 points in districts that Trump carried by 37 and 30 points in last November's presidential election.

Democrats quickly spotlighted how the party ""overperformed"" in Florida. And the House Majority PAC, the top super PAC supporting House Democrats, touted that the results showed ""that the political headwinds are firmly at our backs heading into 2026.""

But Mike Marinella, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, argued that ""Democrats just lit over $20,000,000 on fire in a doomed-to-fail effort to make two deep-red Florida districts competitive – and got blown out of the water in the most embarrassing way.""

But the results in Florida, and especially Wisconsin, will likely give the Democrats a jolt, and validate their efforts to target Musk.

Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who has taken a buzz saw to the federal government workforce as he steers Trump's recently created Department of Government Efficiency, dished out roughly $20 million in the Wisconsin race through aligned groups in support of Schimel.

And Musk, in a controversial move, handed out $1 million checks at a rally in Green Bay on Sunday evening to two Wisconsin voters who had already cast ballots in the contest and had signed a petition to stop ""activist judges.""

""I never could have imagined that I'd be taking on the richest man in the world, for justice in Wisconsin. And we won,"" Crawford said in her election night victory speech.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber, argued that Wisconsin voters ""sent a decisive message to Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and DOGE by rejecting an extreme Republican for their Supreme Court: our democracy is not for sale.""

""Anyone who counted Democrats out was dead wrong,"" he emphasized.

But Democrats have a serious brand issue right now.

The party's favorable rating sank to all-time lows in separate national polls conducted last month by CNN and NBC News. Those numbers followed a record low for Democrats in a Quinnipiac University survey in the field in February. 

Additionally, the latest Fox News National poll indicated that congressional Democrats' approval rating is at 30%, near an all-time low. And Democratic activists are irate over their party's inability to blunt Trump's agenda.

And when it comes to normally low-turnout off-year elections and special elections, the party in power – which in the nation's capital is clearly the Republicans – often faces political headwinds.

""We'll get up to fight another day. But this wasn't our day,"" Schimel said in his concession speech.

And Wisconsin GOP chair Brian Schimming noted that ""coming off a successful November, we knew the April elections would be challenging.""

Republicans note that Democrats enjoyed a slew of special election victories in 2023 and 2024 before suffering serious setbacks in last November's elections.

""Special elections are special for a reason, and not always useful canaries in the coal mines for what lies ahead,"" veteran Republican strategist Colin Reed told Fox News Digital. ""While they can be used as a barometer for energy, they are also a reflection of the individual candidates whose names are on the ballots.""

Reed argued that ""the bigger challenge for the Democrats looking ahead is the lack of a vision or governing agenda beyond reflexive and blanket opposition to the White House and their continued positioning way outside the mainstream on a slew of commonsense issues.""

An American ICU nurse had a harrowing brush with death after her rental moped crashed during a vacation to Thailand, leaving her with a brain bleed, a broken collarbone and shattered teeth.

Sierra Fairhurst, 23, arrived at Boston Logan International Airport in Massachusetts on March 27 after two weeks in Thailand. According to a GoFundMe, Fairhurst was in a moped crash during a vacation in Thailand.

""Despite the long road ahead for her, this could have been completely different, and I'm so grateful to have her here, alive and her brain in working order,"" Zoe Rose, Fairhurst's mother, said in the most recent GoFundMe update. 

""Her face can be fixed, her wounds will heal, bones can be repaired,"" Rose said. ""She has the strength to overcome all of this.""

Fairhurst rented a moped during her travels in the Southeast Asian country. She told Boston 25 that at one moment they were on the road, and the next they weren't.

She awoke in a foreign hospital with devastating injuries.

""I remember going to see the elephants, and we went zip-lining and all the excursions that we did, but that's it,"" she said. ""My eye socket is broken, I almost lost my eye, my cheek bones and nose were broken, so that's all metal now.""

After the accident, the 23-year-old nurse was taken to Krabi, on southern Thailand's west coast, for treatment. She was eventually transferred to a facility in Bangkok before returning home, according to GoFundMe.

Rose and Fairhurst's brother, J, arrived in Thailand after the accident to help her. Her identification was lost in the aftermath of the accident, which complicated the process. 

""In the confusion of the accident and her friends packing luggage to transfer with her to the next hospital, all of Sierra's identification is missing,"" Rose said. ""She has no ID, social security card, or passport. It is imperative that once she is stable she gets to come home to Boston and receive the best care and recover at home with her family.""

With the help of the U.S. State Department, Fairhurst was given proper documentation to travel back to the U.S.

""I know she's very self-conscious in regard to the scarring on her face and missing teeth, but she still came out of this alive, and her brain is healing and doing well, and she's still beautiful,"" she told Boston 25.

When she returned from her trip, Fairhurst went directly to a Boston hospital to be evaluated, and it was determined she did not need inpatient care.

Fairhurst visited the wound clinic and oral maxillofacial surgeon and has appointments scheduled with her primary care provider, neurologist, ocular plastic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon and cosmetic dentist, according to the GoFundMe.

‘All-Star' panelists Mary Katharine Ham, Sabrina Singh and Josh Holmes discuss the potential impact of President Donald Trump's tariff agenda on ‘Special Report.'

President Donald Trump called out GOP Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in an effort to apply public pressure before the Senate votes on a measure to scuttle his Canadian tariff policy.

The joint resolution would terminate the national emergency Trump declared regarding illicit drugs and Canada; in his executive order, Trump called for slapping tariffs on America's northern neighbor.

In a lengthy Truth Social post shortly before 1 a.m. on Wednesday, the president suggested that the four GOP senators have ""Trump Derangement Syndrome."" 

""Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl, by Tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy,"" Trump declared.

TRUMP'S 11TH WEEK IN OFFICE SET TO FOCUS ON TARIFFS AS PRESIDENT TOUTS ‘LIBERATION DAY'

""They are playing with the lives of the American people, and right into the hands of the Radical Left Democrats and Drug Cartels. The Senate Bill is just a ploy of the Dems to show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the House will never approve it and I, as your President, will never sign it. Why are they allowing Fentanyl to pour into our Country unchecked, and without penalty,"" he continued.

Trump blasted the four lawmakers as ""disloyal"" to the GOP.

""What is wrong with them, other than suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, commonly known as TDS? Who can want this to happen to our beautiful families, and why? To the people of the Great States of Kentucky, Alaska, and Maine, please contact these Senators and get them to FINALLY adhere to Republican Values and Ideals. They have been extremely difficult to deal with and, unbelievably disloyal to hardworking Majority Leader John Thune, and the Republican Party itself. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

Paul is a cosponsor of the joint resolution. 

Murkowski reportedly informed Politico's Lisa Kashinsky that she will vote for the resolution, while Collins has said she is ""very likely"" to back it, according to the outlet.

‘MAHA Mom' and former Sports Illustrated model Kristen Louelle Gaffney expresses her excitement about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. getting confirmed as Health and Human Services secretary on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.'

MAHA mom and Sports Illustrated model Kristen Louelle Gaffney has been outspoken about her support for the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as HHS secretary.

Gaffney told Fox News Digital in an interview that she's excited for RFK Jr. to take a more active approach to healthcare, calling him the ""white horse for moms.""

She said the MAHA movement has created a community of Americans and parents who are ""fed up with the system and seeing their kids sick, having diseases, behavioral issues and want to get to the common denominator of it.""

EVERYTHING TO KNOW ABOUT MAHA

Gaffney is married to Ty Gaffney, a former NFL running back. 

The couple has three children.

""How can we live a proactive lifestyle to avoid things like dementia or cancer or any other diseases relating to behavioral or mental illnesses?"" said Gaffney.

""What can we proactively do to be better so that it's not too late?"" 

The key to living longer, she said, lies in loving oneself by taking care of the mind, body, soul and the gut.

""Everything is connected. You have to follow your gut and heal your gut,"" Gaffney said.

""That's through food and supplementing as well,"" she said. 

""I think a good supplement routine [is] staying active every day, getting sunlight and breathing fresh air. It really is a simple recipe, but the hard part is consistency.""

Gaffney joked that after having three babies, she will never be in the same shape again, but said that healing begins on the inside and impacts other aspects of life.

""When I put in the work, I feel like a better person,"" she said. ""I have more energy. I'm a better mom. I'm a better wife.""

Gaffney said she stays as active as possible and always continues moving.

""If you don't use it, you lose it,"" she said.

Gaffney is a big proponent of cooking at home for herself and her family.

""I think we overcomplicate things and think we need a chef and meal prep and expensive equipment. You just need to get sun and go walk outside for 20 minutes and cook your own dinner.""

""When I put in the work, I feel like a better person.""

Gaffney said that when she is grocery shopping, she avoids seed oils and dyes, making sure to look at each label of products she is purchasing.

""I tell people, 'If you can't pronounce something on the ingredients, you should probably put it back,"" she advised. 

Gaffney decided to lead the effort to combat ultra-processed foods by developing her own line of snacks for kids called Super True.

Gaffney said it is critical to educate children about the different foods they are putting in their bodies. 

""I always try to educate them [about] the 'why' instead of, 'No, you can't have soda.' [I say], 'No, you can't have soda because there's 60 grams of sugar in it and because that's going to lead to yucky cells growing in your body.'""

A Maryland bill to establish a commission to study reparations – including financial restitution – is moving forward, as it is expected to clear its final hurdle in the House of Delegates, while the governor attempts to dodge questions about whether he supports the proposal.

The bill, a priority for the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland, passed the Senate in the middle of last month before Crossover Day, which marks the unofficial deadline for legislative leaders in the General Assembly to move bills to the other legislative chamber that they plan to send to the governor for final approval.

The bill received a favorable vote in its assigned House committee on Friday, WBFF reported. It is expected to be voted on in the full House before the legislative session adjourns next week.

Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready, a Republican, told WBFF he does not understand why the reparations bill is being advanced as the state faces a $3.3 billion deficit, which is expected to increase even more to $6.7 billion by fiscal year 2028.

""We don't have the money right now to be exploring these options, period,"" Ready told the outlet. ""[T]he issue of reparations, I'm sure elicits strong opinions, but the fact is, it's just something that's not financially feasible, whether you think it's a good idea or not.""

""I question whether using taxpayer money would ever be appropriate in this context,"" he added. ""Even going back to when reparations were paid to survivors of the Holocaust, they went after companies that were involved. Not after taxpayers.""

The proposed commission is expected to initially cost Maryland taxpayers $54,500 annually, according to the nonpartisan Maryland Department of Legislative Services.

Similar reparations commissions have been created by state governments in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York and Illinois.

Last year, the California Reparations Task Force released a report following a two-year study in which the state was called on to issue a formal apology for slavery and other racial injustices and to offer financial payouts. The report recommended a financial restitution formula that would provide eligible recipients with up to $1.2 million each, although state lawmakers have not yet held a vote to authorize the first payments.

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, has dodged questions about his state's bill since it was introduced in January. He was asked at the time if he supported the measure, but turned his focus to economic priorities.

""Nah, we are going to work with the Maryland General Assembly on a whole collection of different issues,"" Moore told WBFF at the time. ""Our focus is economic advancement; our focus is economic growth. It's making sure we can really meet people where they are, make life more affordable. That we are modernizing of state government.""

The governor was asked again about the issue during his visit to celebrate the Baltimore Orioles' home opener on Monday afternoon at Pickles Pub. WBFF attempted to speak with him, but the requests were denied. The outlet reached out to the governor's office after his appearance at the pub, but his spokesperson's response did not address the questions about the reparations bill.

Ready told WBFF that the bill could harm the national attention Moore has received over the past year.

""I don't think Gov. Moore would want this on his desk because I think it is a distraction to trying to get real problems solved,"" Ready said. ""[T]here may be some people it motivates, in some way, but a lot of those are kind of on the fringes.""

People on dirt bikes and ATVs were seen driving inside the World War II memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., over the weekend.

Video posted on X showed at least three people driving around the outdoor memorial late Saturday night.

Florida congressional candidate Gay Valimont, D-Fla., discusses the special election in Florida's first congressional district on ‘Fox News Live.'

Republican Jimmy Patronis, the former Florida chief financial officer under Gov. Ron DeSantis, fended off his Democrat opponent and successfully won the race to succeed former Rep. Matt Gaetz in Florida's special election on Tuesday. 

President Donald Trump notably carried the district - which is located in the far northwestern corner of Florida, in the Panhandle region - by 37 points in the 2024 election. 

The 1st Congressional District special election, in addition to the one in the 6th District to replace U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, were viewed by some as early referendums for Trump's second term.

Trump, who held a tele-town hall for Patronis late last week, voiced his support for the candidate on Tuesday morning, urging people to vote. 

""Jimmy Patronis, Chief Financial Officer and Fire Marshall for the Great State of Florida, is running an incredible Campaign for Congress in Florida's 1st Congressional District!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. 

And minutes after the AP projected that the GOP would retain the seat, the president took to social media again to tout ""Jimmy Patronis WINS BIG! Congratulations Jimmy. DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT!""

And Democrats highlighted that their candidate overperformed.

""Democrat Gay Valimont Massively Overperforms in Florida's 1st Congressional District As Warning Signs Flash Blinking Red for Republicans,"" the Democratic National Committee (DNC) argued in an email to supporters.

And DNC chair Ken Martin praised Valimont, emphasizing that ""her massive overperformance in a Trump +37 district is the best performance for Democrats in the district this century.""

A chart shows how current rates dwarf that amount.","https://www.businessinsider.com/credit-card-interest-rate-cap-debt-delinquencies-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-2025-4","Wed, 02 Apr 2025 08:01:00 GMT","

Americans' credit card debt is at an all-time high. Soaring interest rates on credit cards coupled with other economic factors could make the situation worse.

In March, Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Anna Paulina Luna introduced a bipartisan House bill that aims to cap annual credit card interest rates at 10% a year.

""Credit cards with high interest rates regularly trap working people in endless cycles of debt,"" Ocasio-Cortez said in a press statement. ""At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, we cannot allow big banks to shake down our communities for profit.""

The average annual percentage rate on credit balances has nearly doubled in the past decade to 21% in 2024 from 12% in 2003, per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Credit card interest rates can fluctuate with an individual's credit score, but they are ultimately determined by market conditions.

As credit card interest rates have risen, so has the amount of consumer debt, as well as delinquencies on payments.

The total amount of credit card debt has ballooned to $1.2 trillion in Q4 of 2024 up from $720 billion in the same quarter of 2004, per the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. More people are falling behind on their monthly payments and the number of active credit card users only making the minimum payment on their monthly credit card statement has reached a record high, ""showing signs of consumer stress,"" per the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's 2024 Q3 report.

President Donald Trump ran on campaign promises last year that he would temporarily cap credit card interest rates at 10%, to allow Americans to ""catch up"" on their balances, but he hasn't taken executive action or spoken about interest rate caps since entering office.

The bill is now referred to the House Committee on Financial Services, but has yet to be put on the calendar for a vote in the House of Representatives.

Ocasio-Cortez and Luna did not respond to requests for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com?category=business","Elon Musk bet big on the Wisconsin Supreme Court election. He lost.","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-wisconsin-supreme-court-election-schimel-loss-2025-4","Wed, 02 Apr 2025 02:19:00 GMT","

For Wisconsin Republicans, regaining a conservative majority on the state's highest court was a top priority.

Elon Musk, the world's richest man, funneled more than $12 million via his America PAC to sway the pivotal judicial race in one of the country's premier swing states.

It wasn't enough.

On Tuesday, Musk's big bet on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race fell apart, with the Associated Press reporting that Susan Crawford, a liberal judge in Dane County, had defeated Brad Schimel, a conservative judge in Waukesha County, in the most expensive judicial race in US history.

Musk, the face of President Donald Trump's White House DOGE office, has been met with increasingly vocal opposition by voters over the task force's cost-cutting efforts. And the fallout from DOGE is also affecting Tesla, the company that catapulted Musk to international prominence.

Crawford's victory is a significant blow for Musk as DOGE's work continues to face increased scrutiny from the public and could lead to electoral gains for Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections.

Here's how Crawford's win is set to upend Musk's political playbook:

For weeks, scenes of frustrated voters sharply questioning and booing GOP members of Congress have become a defining narrative of DOGE, as many lawmakers have had to defend waves of staffing cuts.

As a guiding force behind efforts to cut costs at critical federal departments — along with efforts to eliminate the US Agency for International Development — Musk has faced mounting pushback over the task force's aggressive tactics to rein in spending.

Musk went all in for Schimel, arguing that the Wisconsin race was ""important for the future of civilization.""

Referring to the potential for Democrats to make gains through a new congressional map, Musk argued that if the Wisconsin Supreme Court ""is able to redraw the districts, they will gerrymander the district and deprive Wisconsin of two seats on the Republican side.""

""Then they will try to stop all the government reforms we are getting done for you, the American people,"" he added.

In a state that narrowly backed Trump over Kamala Harris in November, voters this week made a new choice.

Crawford's win keeps the liberal bloc in the majority. The court could revisit the state's congressional maps, with a redraw likely to offer Democrats an opportunity to pick up additional seats.

With Republicans clinging to a razor-thin 218-213 majority in the US House ahead of what could be a tough midterm cycle, holding the lower chamber will be key for Musk and Trump — especially as it relates to future oversight over DOGE's work.

Musk campaigned heavily for Trump in Pennsylvania in last year's election, with America PAC pouring millions of dollars into the state, much of it for canvassing and other digital-related efforts.

The tech mogul's decision to hand out $1 million checks to select voters who signed petitions at town hall events — similar to what he employed in Wisconsin this time around — drew many people out as he criticized Harris and the media. Trump would go on to win Pennsylvania in the 2024 general election.

Schimel's loss, on the other hand, is a setback for Musk.

Wisconsin Supreme Court races in recent years have become increasingly polarized, with issues like abortion rights, union collective bargaining rights, and voting regulations being used to drive up turnout among base voters. This week, conservatives fell short in their efforts to take the court in a different direction.

Musk is poised to wade into other contests ahead of the midterms, especially with Trump's agenda on the line. But the latest results in Wisconsin show that there's a limit to such an influence.

Ten major firms are under the spotlight as the Trump administration continues its consulting crackdown — but one is taking the most heat.

At least 127 of Deloitte's government contracts have been cut or modified since January, about double the total for the second-hardest-hit consultancy on the Trump administration's list, a Business Insider analysis of data on the White House DOGE office's website found.

The Big Four firm is one of the federal government's 10 highest-paid consultancies, which have come under scrutiny amid the White House's push to cut waste and improve efficiency. The list includes Accenture, Booz Allen Hamilton, IBM, and General Dynamics.

DOGE estimates the Deloitte cuts will save taxpayers about $371.8 million.

This includes $51.4 million in savings from a contract providing IT services to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and $1.1 million in savings from a contract for training on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility that has been running since 2020.

Deloitte US contracts with federal agencies were worth $3.3 billion a year, or almost 10% of its most recent annual revenues, the firm said in a recent earnings report.

Booz Allen Hamilton, which generates almost all of its $11 billion in annual revenue from the public sector, is the second most affected firm on the list, with 61 contracts cut, BI's analysis found.

At least 30 Accenture contracts have been cut, saving $240.2 million, per DOGE's data.

In an annual earnings call last month, Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said that DOGE's cost-cutting efforts had already hit the firm's revenues, and staffers have told BI they're worried about layoffs.

CGI Federal declined to comment and Leidos said it would continue discussions with the administration. The other firms on DOGE's list did not respond to requests for comment about their government contracts.

The General Services Administration, the government's largest procurement arm, is leading the effort to reevaluate federal consulting spend.

The agency, which operates separately from DOGE, said that consulting contracts with the 10 firms were set to generate more than $65 billion in fees in 2025 and beyond.

In March, the GSA asked the consultancies to submit a scorecard containing a detailed breakdown of their pricing and suggestions for where they could reduce costs.

It told the firms to identify which contracts were ""mission critical"" and to use simple terms to do it: ""A 15-year-old should be able to understand what service you provide and why it is important.""

Responses were due by Monday.

A person at the agency told BI that the GSA and federal bodies were now reviewing the scorecards and would decide on further cuts. The goal was to cut waste and move toward a more outcome-based approach instead of open-ended contracts, they said.

CEOs and senior executives at the consultancies appeared aligned with the administration's priorities, the person added.

Here's the list of contracts cut and savings made, according to the DOGE website:

Science Applications International Corp.: five contracts, $7.5 million.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com?category=business","Germany is permanently stationing troops in another country for the first time since World War II","https://www.businessinsider.com/germany-permanent-troops-another-country-first-time-world-war-two-2025-4","Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:02:00 GMT","

Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, announced on Tuesday that they'd created a new brigade, the 45th Armored Brigade, to be stationed in Lithuania.

It will be the first long-term deployment of German soldiers to another country since World War II, the Associated Press reported.

Brig. Gen. Christoph Huber, the commander of the 45th Armored Brigade, said that with its creation, ""we're not only moving toward operational readiness, we're taking responsibility.""

""For the alliance, for Lithuania, for Europe's security,"" he said. ""As a sign of our determination to defend peace and freedom with our partners.""

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked a surge of defense agreements and spending among European countries.

When plans were first made for the 45th Armored Brigade in 2023, Germany described it as part of growing efforts by NATO members to boost both their own security and the security of NATO's eastern borders.

Germany's defense minister, Boris Pistorius, previously said, ""With this war-ready brigade, we're taking on leadership responsibility on NATO's eastern flank.""

The new brigade is made up of several battalions and will have about 5,000 soldiers and civilian staff, the Bundeswehr said this week.

It added that the brigade's command facility was already fully operational and that the aim was to have it at full wartime readiness by 2027.

Lithuania — which borders the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and the close Russian ally Belarus — is one of the countries that has sounded the alarm the loudest that Russia could move beyond Ukraine to attack elsewhere in Europe.

It's also one of NATO's biggest defense spenders by proportion of GDP and one of Ukraine's biggest allies, describing Ukrainian troops as the ones who are protecting all of Europe.

There are already NATO troops in Lithuania, on a rotating basis, with a multinational battle group led by Germany. NATO countries have also deployed assets such as fighter jets and air defenses there.

US troops are among those stationed in Lithuania, though their long-term future is less clear, with President Donald Trump critical of US allies, of NATO, and of assistance to Ukraine.

Dovilė Šakalienė, Lithuania's defense minister, told Business Insider in February that her country wanted US troops to stay and that she expected the US could see ""eye to eye"" with countries who pay their part when it comes to defense.

""We do our part,"" she said, adding that she expected the US to do its part, too.

Lithuania has also been strengthening its border with Russia.

Germany's new brigade is the latest in a series of measures introduced by the country since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

It spent 1.51% of its GDP on defense in 2022, which jumped to an estimated 2.12% in 2024, according to NATO.

The rise in defense purchases by Germany, and Europe more broadly, has been a boon for the continent's defense industries.

The German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall said in March that it expected sales this year to rise by 25% to 30%.

Germany's defense spending has increased less than some of its allies: It ranked 15th out of 31 NATO members for defense spending as a proportion of GDP in 2024, according to NATO estimates.

But it has vowed to do more.

After grappling with its World War I and World War II legacies, which led to an avoidance of heavy militarism, Germany has committed to major military moves.

Lawmakers this month voted to alter the German constitution in a way that would unlock billions of dollars that could be used for defense spending.

Šakalienė, Lithuania's defense minister, told BI in February that Europe ""needs to up our defense spending very fast and very significantly.""

She said Europe needed to be able to match the US and to match Russia, which was escalating its own defense production: ""We need to catch up to the speed of Russia,"" she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com?category=business","'I begin spying for Deel': An ex-Rippling employee details his days of corporate espionage in Ireland court filing","https://www.businessinsider.com/rippling-employee-spying-deel-court-affidavit-2025-4","Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:14:00 GMT","

Your browser does not support the video element.

A man accused of being a corporate spy for a rival HR software company admitted to secretly working for Deel while he was an employee at Rippling.

The now-former employee, Keith O'Brien, wrote in an affidavit made public in an Irish court Wednesday that he was recruited as a corporate spy by Alex Bouaziz, Deel's founder and CEO.

""Alex told me he 'had an idea.' He suggested that I remain at Rippling and become a 'spy' for Deel, and I recall him specifically mentioning James Bond,"" O'Brien wrote in the affidavit.

""About thirty minutes later, I called Alex back over WhatsApp and told him that I was onboard with the plan,"" O'Brien added.

The affidavit is part of legal proceedings in Ireland, where O'Brien worked in one of Rippling's satellite offices.

The San Francisco-based workforce management software company has a long and bitter rivalry with Deel. Each company has been valued at north of $10 billion.

In March, Rippling sued Deel in San Francisco federal court, alleging Deel turned O'Brien — who was not named in the lawsuit — into a corporate spy.

Rippling said O'Brien had collected company secrets on the company's Slack, Salesforce, and Google Drive networks and then passed them on to Deel, giving the rival a competitive edge.

O'Brien said in the newly filed affidavit that he collected the information at Bouaziz's direction. His first conversations with Bouaziz are recounted in a section titled ""I Begin Spying for Deel.""

""Alex was particularly interested in Rippling's strategies around global payroll and expansion efforts, as well as reviewing specific sales, marketing information, and customer details,"" O'Brien wrote. ""Alex would give me direction for what terms to search on Rippling's Slack system in order to yield the information he wanted.""

O'Brien, who was hired in Rippling's Dublin office to oversee payroll issues in Europe, wrote that he first met Bouaziz after he created a payroll consulting company as a side job.

O'Brien, while offering to consult for Deel, told Bouaziz he was considering quitting his day job and consulting full time, he wrote.

O'Brien says Bouaziz suggested he continue working for Rippling and ""spy"" for Deel.

For his work, O'Brien received a monthly payment of $6,000, mostly in cryptocurrency, he wrote. He also communicated with Philippe Bouaziz, Alex's father and Deel's CFO, he wrote in the affidavit.

O'Brien's attorneys at the Irish law firm Fenecas Law attached 47 pages of exhibits to the affidavit, showing records of crypto transactions, notifications of deleted messages, and examples of documents O'Brien says he stole from Rippling on Deel's behalf.

Representatives for Deel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company previously said it denies ""all legal wrongdoing"" and would file a counterclaim against Rippling.

Rippling said in its lawsuit last month that O'Brien was caught after the company devised an elaborate honeypot operation that led him to search for information in a phony Slack channel called ""#d-defectors,"" where Rippling employees purportedly discussed information Deel would find embarrassing.

In the new affidavit, O'Brien wrote his handlers at Deel realized Rippling had set the trap — but not until it was too late.

""I ran the search immediately and began to look at the results,"" O'Brien wrote. ""Within minutes, Alex messaged me again and told me not to run the search because he believed it was a 'trap.'""

""I told Alex that by the time I got his message, I had already done the search and he said 'oh shit,'"" O'Brien continued.

Rippling said in its lawsuit that it brought O'Brien's spying to the attention of an Irish court, which appointed a lawyer to Rippling's office to seize his electronic devices for preservation in potential future litigation. O'Brien's affidavit, dated April 1 and made public Wednesday, came in a court case related to those proceedings.

When O'Brien was confronted by the court-appointed lawyer, he hid in the bathroom and appeared to try to flush his phone down the toilet, Rippling alleged.

In O'Brien's affidavit, he said the lawyer's appearance made him realize ""how serious this was"" and he ""panicked.""

He performed a factory reset on his phone while in the bathroom and ""flushed the toilet a couple of times,"" he wrote.

O'Brien left the Rippling office and contacted Alex Bouaziz, he wrote. A Deel lawyer instructed him to get rid of his phone, he wrote.

""He told me to destroy my old phone by breaking it up and throwing it in the canal,"" he wrote.

The next day, O'Brien ""smashed my old phone with an axe and put it down the drain at my mother-in-law's house, as Deel's lawyer Asif had advised,"" he wrote.

Deel also offered to move O'Brien's entire family to another country, he wrote.

""Deel's lawyer Asif said they would move me and my family to Dubai, and would figure out a mechanism to cover my legal costs,"" O'Brien wrote.

O'Brien said he became frustrated with the people at Deel, who he said wanted to promote a false story accusing Rippling of violating Russian sanctions to ""shift the narrative.""

Deel's attorneys also deleted their messages and made it hard to reach them, he wrote.

After a few days, O'Brien agreed to cooperate with Rippling, he said.

""I was getting sick concealing this lie,"" he wrote. ""I realised that I was harming myself and my family to protect Deel.""

""I was concerned, and I am still concerned, about how wealthy and powerful Alex and Philippe are, but I know that what I was doing was wrong,"" he continued.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com?category=business","It's 'Liberation Day.' Here are all the tariffs Trump is threatening to impose.","https://www.businessinsider.com/liberation-day-trump-tariffs-april-2-canada-mexico-imports-2025-3","Wed, 02 Apr 2025 07:20:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump's big tariff day is here — and it could influence various products Americans rely on.

For weeks, Trump has said that Wednesday will be ""Liberation Day"" for America, during which he intends to impose new tariffs on imports from various countries.

""April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!! For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. ""Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!""

Trump is expected to hold a formal event to announce his tariff plans on Wednesday afternoon, so it's unclear what exactly the president will unveil. He has previously suggested that new tariffs might not be as expansive as originally planned. Trump told reporters on March 23 that tariffs on autos, semiconductors, and lumber would be announced ""down the road,"" adding that while reciprocal tariffs were planned for Wednesday, he ""may give a lot of countries a break.""

""I don't change. But the word flexibility is an important word,"" Trump said.

Here's what we know about the tariffs Trump might have planned for Wednesday.

In early March, Trump paused 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico covered by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

The USMCA covers a wide variety of imports from both Canada and Mexico, including agricultural products, clothing, fruits, vegetables, and dairy. Trump said the tariffs on Mexican goods are intended to crack down on drug and border policy.

Canada's finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, said on March 6 in an X post that Canada would delay retaliatory tariffs until Wednesday ""while we continue to work for the removal of all tariffs.""

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business on March 18 that Trump was planning to retaliate against countries that had imposed tariffs on US goods.

""On April 2, we are going to produce a list of other country's tariffs,"" Bessent said, adding that the Trump administration would tell those countries why it disagrees with their tariff levels. If countries roll back their tariffs, Bessent said, ""we will not put up the tariff wall.""

But if they maintain current policies, Bessent said, ""then we will put up the tariff wall to protect our economy, protect our workers, and protect our industries.""

He didn't provide details other than saying: ""For some countries, it could be quite low. For some countries, it could be quite high.""

And Trump has said that depending on how the countries respond, his administration may not enact the proposed tariffs.

Trump wrote on Truth Social on March 3 that tariffs on ""external"" agricultural products would begin.

""To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States,"" he said.

It's unclear which products would be affected or whether these tariffs would be a part of Trump's broader reciprocal tariffs.

In a Truth Social post on March 24, Trump said he'd impose a ""secondary tariff"" on oil and gas from Venezuela, adding that Venezuela had sent ""criminals"" into the US.

""Any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country,"" he said. ""All documentation will be signed and registered, and the Tariff will take place on April 2nd, 2025, LIBERATION DAY IN AMERICA.""

Trump signed an executive order on March 26 to place a 25% tariff on all cars and car parts imported into the US. The order said the tariff would go into effect on or after Thursday and no later than May 3.

""This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,"" Trump said in the Oval Office before signing the order. ""We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.""

The order said that cars and car parts were being imported into the US ""in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com?category=business","Microsoft is a clear winner from ChatGPT's superviral Ghibli images, analysts say","https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-winner-of-chatgpt-studio-ghibli-images-jefferies-analysts-2025-4","Wed, 02 Apr 2025 04:58:00 GMT","

A new AI trend has taken the internet by storm, and at least one Big Tech giant stands to make a killing.

Last week, OpenAI rolled out GPT-4o, an upgraded image generator that users piled into to create images in the Japanese animation firm Studio Ghibli's style. The trend is helping fuel a record spike in users, so much so that OpenAI is struggling to keep up.

The surge in ChatGPT users should benefit Microsoft because it boosts OpenAI's growth, computing needs, and valuation, Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill said in a note on Tuesday.

Microsoft is a major investor in the artificial intelligence firm and its primary cloud provider. The company also integrates OpenAI's large language models into its products. Last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company may build its own generative-AI capability to complement its partnership with OpenAI.

""We would glean that surging ChatGPT user growth likely indicates surging ChatGPT+ growth i.e. revenue growth for OpenAI,"" the analysts wrote.

The analysts also said OpenAI's most recent funding round was beneficial to Microsoft. On Monday, OpenAI announced it closed the largest private tech funding round on record. The company raised $40 billion from SoftBank and other investors, bringing the company's valuation to $300 billion. The ChatGPT maker was last valued at $157 billion in October.

Jefferies has a buy rating on Microsoft and a price target of $500. The stock closed at $382 on Tuesday. It's down 9.3% over the past year.

ChatGPT has become a household name since its launch in November 2022, but last week's animation trend sent demand soaring.

On Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X that ChatGPT had added 1 million users in the past hour. At its launch two years ago, it took five days to reach that number of users.

Last week, ChatGPT's weekly app downloads, weekly active users, and revenue from subscriptions and in-app purchases reached an all-time high — increasing 11%, 5%, and 6%, respectively, week over week — according to data from the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.

Besides Microsoft, producers of graphics processing units stand to benefit from the Ghibli hype. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel are some of the biggest GPU companies.

""Working as fast we can to really get stuff humming; if anyone has GPU capacity in 100k chunks we can get asap please call!"" Altman wrote Tuesday on X.

The Jefferies analysts said few vendors could deliver this much capacity and estimated that any deal with OpenAI could bring in $1 billion to $2 billion a year for the GPU provider.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com?category=business","A voter sued Elon Musk, alleging the billionaire never paid up after promising cash for petition signatures","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-america-pac-pennslyvania-voter-lawsuit-class-action-2025-4","Wed, 02 Apr 2025 17:40:00 GMT","

A canvasser says Elon Musk and the billionaire's super PAC never paid up after promising Pennsylvania voters cash for their efforts around the 2024 presidential campaign.

The Bucks County, Pennsylvania, voter, who is using the pseudonym John Doe for what he said in court papers was for his ""safety and security,"" filed a class-action lawsuit Tuesday in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

The man says in the lawsuit he's owed at least $20,000 for signatures he collected as part of Musk's massive push to help the then-Republican candidate — and now president — Donald Trump get elected to a second term in the White House.

In the lead-up to the November election, Musk and his America PAC offered to pay registered voters in the swing state of Pennsylvania $100 for signing a petition backing free speech and gun rights — and an additional $100 for each referral of a registered voter who signed the petition.

The offer, which initially started at $47, was also made to registered voters in the other six battleground states.

""Plaintiff and Class Members accepted Defendants' offers by signing or successfully referring Pennsylvania registered voters to the America PAC petition,"" the lawsuit against Musk and his political action committee says. It adds that Musk and the PAC ""have since failed to pay Plaintiff and Class Members in full for their signatures and referrals.""

The lawsuit says the plaintiff worked as a canvasser for Musk's America PAC ahead of the 2024 election and got many voters to sign the petition along the way.

The canvasser alleges that while he was paid his hourly rate for the work and for some referrals for the petition signatures he obtained, he says hasn't been paid at least $20,000 he's owed for his referrals.

""This case is about a broken promise: Elon Musk promised supporters that they would be paid for signing a petition and referring others to do the same,"" the man's attorney, Shannon Liss-Riordan, told Business Insider. ""Our client relied on that promise because he believed in Elon, but unfortunately, that promise was not kept. It appears the promise was broken for many others as well.""

The Pennsylvania man has repeatedly contacted Musk's super PAC, the lawsuit says, ""making multiple attempts to receive full payment for his referrals, but to no avail.""

The complaint says this lack of payment has caused the man ""significant emotional and physical distress.""

""He relied on these payments to pay his bills and suffered damage to his credit and health when the payments did not arrive as expected,"" the court papers say.

The suit, which alleges breach of contract and seeks a jury trial, says more than 100 others could be owed money and that the amount at issue may be over $5 million.

""Plaintiff is in communication with numerous others who referred voters to sign the America PAC petition, who are likewise frustrated that they did not receive full payments for their referrals,"" the lawsuit says.

Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

An America PAC spokesperson, Andrew Romeo, told BI in a statement that the super PAC ""is committed to paying for every legitimate petition signature, which is evidenced by the fact that we have paid tens of millions of dollars to canvassers for their hard work in support of our mission.""

""While we don't yet know who this 'John Doe' plaintiff is and can't speak to their specific circumstances, we can say that we are also committed to rooting out fraud and have the right to withhold payments to fraudsters,"" Romeo said.

During the 2024 campaign, Musk also launched a $1 million-a-day giveaway to encourage voter registration and push swing-state residents to the polls. The move raised legal questions.

At the time, the Department of Justice sent Musk a letter saying that the contest could violate federal law, and Philadelphia's district attorney filed a lawsuit, calling the petition an ""unlawful lottery.""

A Philadelphia judge ultimately allowed the program to move forward, saying it did not meet the criteria for a lottery.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, ahead of a high-stakes state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, Musk doled out $1 million checks to two voters who had signed his super PAC's petition against ""activist judges.""

Companies have warned of rising prices. Markets have plunged. Bad vibes are back. President Donald Trump's tariff plans might not be in full force yet — but Americans are feeling the strain.

Trump's so-called ""Liberation Day"" is here. It's the name he gave April 2, when he's expected to unveil a range of broad tariffs on key trading partners. Leading up to the announcements, the University of Michigan's consumer survey in late March found that Americans' outlook on the economy took a dive — consumer sentiment was down 11.9% from February and 28.2% from one year ago.

Inflation fears largely drove the downturn, and consumers are worried about ""the potential for pain amid ongoing economic policy developments,"" the survey said. One of those developments is Trump's tariff plans; Trump has maintained that his trade policies would bring in revenue and restore jobs but acknowledged in February that Americans would feel ""some pain"" as a result.

That pain has already started taking shape. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said during a March press conference that American consumers' gloomy outlook — particularly around high grocery prices — ""probably has to do with turmoil at the beginning of an administration that's making big changes in policy.""

Powell also said that ""a good part"" of the Federal Open Market Committee's latest inflation projections, which showed higher inflation than its December forecast, was a response to Trump's shifting tariff announcements.

""I do think with the arrival of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed,"" Powell said.

Trade policy experts have said companies might absorb some of the cost of Trump's planned tariffs, but Americans are likely to see higher prices on goods like groceries and cars. While Trump has also said that his plans would promote production in the US, the uncertainty is leaving markets, businesses, and Americans on edge.

Alex Jacquez, an advisor on the National Economic Council under former President Joe Biden, told reporters on a Tuesday press call that uncertainty around Trump's trade policy makes it ""hard for the American people to see that they are going to have a strategy long term for how they should be spending their money and investing.""

""When the president doesn't have a clear strategy or direction, it is extremely difficult for businesses in particular and consumers as well, to plan for the future, and that's why you're seeing so much uncertainty in the consumer market right now and so much uncertainty in the business community,"" Jacquez said.

Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told Business Insider that ""fearmongering by the media and Democrats about President Trump's America First economic agenda isn't going to change the fact that industry leaders have already made trillions in investment commitments to make in America.""

""President Trump used tariffs to deliver historic job, wage, and economic growth with no inflation in his first term, and he's set to restore American Greatness in his second term,"" Desai said.

Joseph Dennis, 73, voted for Trump but previously told BI he was concerned about the administration's decisions on tariffs and federal job cuts and wished they were less extreme. He's one of many retirees watching their investments fluctuate in value under Trump.

""I hope he knows what he's doing, but I'm not so sure,"" Dennis said.

Stock markets worldwide have swung wildly in anticipation of Trump's Liberation Day. Major US stock indexes dropped sharply to start the week before staging a rebound and ended Tuesday's session mostly higher as investors braced for the tariff announcement.

It's not just Liberation Day — markets have been fluctuating for weeks in response to Trump's shifting tariff announcements. Additionally, some companies have been preparing to raise prices in anticipation of Trump's tariff plans. Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in early March that Trump's tariff policy could lead the company to raise prices on produce.

Trump has previously said a range of tariffs would go into effect on April 2, including levies on goods from Canada and Mexico, automobiles, and reciprocal tariffs on the countries that have imposed tariffs on US goods. However, the president told reporters on March 23 that he ""may give a lot of countries a break.""

""I don't change. But the word flexibility is an important word,"" Trump said.

That ""flexibility"" is making it difficult for businesses and consumers to prepare for the future, Heather Boushey, an economist who served on former President Joe Biden's Council of Economic Advisors, told reporters.

""Both businesses and consumers are getting shaken by this approach,"" Boushey said. ""They see it as chaotic. They don't see what the plan is, but there's a concept of a plan, and that expectations are falling and falling rapidly.""

China has taken steps to restrict local companies from investing in the US, according to people familiar with the matter, in a move that could give Beijing more leverage for potential trade negotiations with the Trump administration.

Several branches of China's top economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, have been instructed in recent weeks to hold off on registration and approval for firms that are looking to invest in the US, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing sensitive issues.

Trade-reliant Thailand stands to be the biggest loser in the region given its large exposure to the two sectors most vulnerable to reciprocal tariffs: agriculture and transport.

Thailand pledged to narrow its trade surplus with the US by importing more energy and food products, with officials estimating the hit to the Southeast Asian nation's exports at about $8 billion if the Trump administration raised tariffs by 11%.

Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra's government has prepared a strategy to cope with reciprocal tariffs scheduled to be announced by President Donald Trump on Wednesday, Vuttikrai Leewiraphan, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Commerce, told a briefing in Bangkok. Thailand will adopt a “holistic approach” to trade negotiations to minimize the impact on its economy, he said. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}"

Senator Cory Booker on Tuesday evening set a chamber record by assailing the policies of President Donald Trump in a speech that lasted a little more than 25 hours. 

“I'm heading to the Senate floor because Donald Trump and Elon Musk have shown a complete disregard for the rule of law, the Constitution, and the needs of the American people,” Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, said in a post on X before beginning his marathon address about 7 p.m. on Monday. The speech broke a record set by Senator Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Democrat, who spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes in a failed attempt to defeat the Civil Rights Act of 1957 with a filibuster. He later became a Republican.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}"

When President Donald Trump made it clear that he was serious about implementing dramatic tariffs on top U.S. trading partners, Robin Liss knew her Suvie machines were in trouble.

Suvie's products — kitchen gadgets that can whip up dinner in a matter of minutes — are built in a facility in one of China's largest manufacturing hubs and are comprised of more than 500 components sourced throughout the country.

After running the financial models and tallying the costs associated with the new levies, Liss set off to Asia in March to search for an alternative business plan.  

""I'm going to run out of appliances,"" Liss said, ahead of her two-week trip to Taiwan and Vietnam. ""I've got to figure this out.""

Suvie is among the scores of gadget makers scrambling to stay afloat while managing through President Trump's tariff plans and the uncertainty that they bring. The day-to-day changes in rhetoric from the White House has created volatility on Wall Street, where tech stocks just wrapped up their worst quarter since 2022, and a sense of panic for smaller businesses that have less of a cushion to deal with the added costs of operations and potential supply chain bottlenecks.

Trump slapped additional tariffs on China earlier this year and is now going much bigger, threatening to strain America's relationships with other longtime trading partners. On Wednesday afternoon, President Trump is expected to deliver remarks at a ""Make America Wealthy Again Event"" in the Rose Garden, and to announce reciprocal tariffs that follow a bevy of other import duties on goods from China, Canada and Mexico. Those three countries accounted for over $1.3 trillion, or about 40%, of total imports last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

""Folks who thought they had safely moved their supply chain out of China suddenly find themselves wondering if that was a great decision,"" said Peter Hanbury, a partner at consulting firm Bain. ""There's a lot of different options about where you could move things, but you don't want to make that decision if you don't know exactly where the tariff structure is going to land.""

Liss said her company, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is eating the costs — for now — rather than passing them on to customers. For Suvie, those costs aren't just tied to its appliances, which are about the size of a microwave but offer more than 10 different cooking modes.

She also has to deal with higher food prices, as part of Suvie's business is selling meal kits starting at $11.49. Suvie delivers meals to customers weekly, but also has plans for users who prefer deliveries every two to four weeks.

The problem for Suvie and other consumer-focused businesses is that just as their costs are skyrocketing due to tariffs and other inflationary pressures, Americans are losing their buying power.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged a ""moderation in consumer spending"" during the central bank's March policy meeting and said tariffs could put upward pressure on prices. Financial markets have also sold off in recent weeks in response to the uncertainty.

A recent analysis from the Yale Budget Lab estimates that tariffs could cost the average American household an additional $1,600 to $2,000 a year. Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in March that consumers could see imminent price increases on produce items such as strawberries and avocados.

Liss launched Suvie in 2015 and began shipping products in 2019, a year after a Kickstarter campaign for a ""kitchen robot with multi-zone cooking and refrigeration."" The company has 20 U.S. employees and has avoided layoffs thus far, thanks to 80% growth last year that Liss said brought annual revenue to between $20 million and $30 million.

If not for recent China tariffs, which hiked the levies she pays on goods to 23% from 3%, Liss said Suvie would be operating at a profit.

Liss said that no matter what Trump announces on Wednesday, in what he's calling ""Liberation Day,"" the existing tariffs on goods from China have made it imperative that she find a new country for production. But where the company lands depends on what gets thrown into the mix.

Wherever Suvie goes, the company estimates it can scale up within six months.

""That is incredibly fast and almost unheard of,"" Liss said. ""But if we don't pull it off, we might not have products for the holidays, which is our main sales season.""

For Austere founder Deena Ghazarian, tariffs on products from China as well as Mexico have put her business in peril.

Austere, based in Wilsonville, Oregon, south of Portland, makes cable, cleaning, and surge-protected power products. The 12-person company, founded in 2018, previously moved about half of its operations to Taiwan and Vietnam from China and was in talks to shift production to Mexico. Those discussions stalled in November.

Depending on the item, up to 50% of Ghazarian's components come from China. Half of her products are still made there, while the rest are manufactured in Taiwan and Vietnam. For her cleaning product solution, which is the most reliant on China, she estimates it would take over a year to move production to Thailand.

Ghazarian began stockpiling products last year for the company to get ahead of potential tariffs. She says others have done the same. The inventory investment has diverted many resources she'd otherwise use for hiring, marketing and scaling.

""I'm buying time to figure out my next move,"" she said. ""If I keep having to spend this money to shift to get around it – at some point it's not going to have a return that's worth it financially.""

The final step would be hiking prices for consumers, which Ghazarian said many partners she works with are already planning to implement later this week.

The whole electronic devices market is feeling the pain.

The Consumer Technology Association estimated in January that new tariffs could hike laptop and tablet prices by as much as 68%, and boost smartphone prices by as much as 37%. Video game consoles could rise as much as 58%. Tariffs would reduce consumer spending power by $90 billion to $143 billion annually, it estimates.

""This is just devastating to the U.S. economy,"" said CTA CEO Gary Shapiro. ""It's tremendously inflationary.""

Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary general and global head of policy at the International Chamber of Commerce, said that the cost implications from a 20% to 25% tariff could be severe enough to wipe out a company's entire operating margin, while also complicating it ability to operate abroad.  

""There is a risk if retaliation takes hold in the global economy, that we see a severe worsening of the business environment for the tech sector, and for American firms,"" he said.

The logistics of moving are unrealistic for many companies. Over the years, Chinese cities such Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Dongguan have established themselves as key manufacturing meccas for technology and electronics production.

Those markets have steadily accrued the best component supply base, labor expertise and cost structures, which are difficult to replicate elsewhere, said Terry Arbaugh, chief commercial officer at SEACOMP, which designs and manufactures electronics such as thermostats and video game devices for customers. The company operates facilities in China and Mexico.

""Talk of tariffs is sending more business outside of China, but in a lot of cases, it's also not coming into the U.S.,"" Arbaugh said.

Many larger corporations have managed to pivot production to areas like Taiwan, Thailand and India over the years, but have also exhausted much of the existing supply in those smaller markets, Arbaugh said. And making lower cost consumer and medical electronics in volume in the U.S. is not a viable option for many businesses, he added.  

Suvie isn't considering onshoring its production at the moment, and is currently focused on finding an alternative spot in Asia.

Liss has already booked a flight back to Taiwan in a couple weeks. From there, she'll hop around to other countries in the region for more answers.

""Maybe I'll book the next flight in the air,"" she said from the Detroit airport on the way home from her initial Asia trek.

Tesla shares rose Wednesday after Politico reported that Elon Musk could leave his post at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, paving the way for the CEO to return his focus on the struggling electric vehicle maker.

The White House later called the report ""garbage.""

The stock was last up about 5%. At its session lows, it had dropped as much as 6.4% on the back of weaker-than-expected vehicle deliveries for the first quarter.

The report — which cites Trump insiders — noted that, while President Donald Trump is pleased with Musk and the DOGE spending cuts that have been pushed through, the two decided in recent days that the billionaire would soon return to his businesses. 

NBC News is reporting that Trump told the Cabinet that Musk could leave in the coming months. A senior government official told NBC News that Musk would leave at the end of a 130-day stint as a special government employee. 

Wednesday's report comes during a tough stretch for Tesla. Despite Wednesday's gains, the stock has dropped more than 5% over the past month. Year to date, it has tumbled more than 31%. The shares also shed 36% in the first quarter, marking their biggest quarterly drop since 2022.

Musk's role in the White House is one factor weighing on Tesla's stock. It has sparked waves of protests, boycotts and violent attacks on Tesla stores and vehicles around the world. Trump's automotive tariffs are also a concern as they involve Tesla's key suppliers — notably in Mexico and China.

""My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half,"" Musk said Sunday night at a rally he held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to promote a Republican judge he backed in Tuesday's state supreme court election, Brad Schimel. ""This is a very expensive job is what I'm saying.""

In addition to holding the rally in Wisconsin, Musk spent millions and frequently posted about the race on his social network X. Judge Susan Crawford, who won the seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, was backed by Democrats and progressive groups who criticized Musk, his money and influence on the race as well as his DOGE work in their campaigns.

Separately, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander urged the city to sue Tesla on behalf of NYC pension funds citing Musk's work for the White House.

In a Tuesday statement, Lander's office said: ""The basis of the potential litigation are the material misstatements from Tesla claiming that CEO Elon Musk spends significant time on the company and is highly active in its management, despite his helming the Trump Administration's DOGE initiative, spending little of his time actually managing Tesla, and promoting policies that are actively harmful to Tesla's business.""

CNBC reached out to the White House for comment.

A judge on Wednesday dismissed the federal criminal case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, nearly two months after the Trump administration controversially sought to drop corruption charges against the Democrat.

District Court Judge Dale Ho tossed out the case ""with prejudice,"" which permanently bars the Department of Justice from resurrecting the five-count indictment against Adams in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

In his order, Ho rejected DOJ's request to toss the case ""without prejudice,"" which would have allowed charges to be refiled against the mayor in the future.

""It is important to clarify that the Court's decision today is not about whether Mayor Adams is innocent or guilty,"" Ho wrote.

The DOJ argued the case should be dismissed without prejudice because prosecuting Adams would have interfered with his ability to govern the city and to his ability to cooperate with President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement policies.

Seven federal prosecutors — among them the acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney — quit in protest over the DOJ's demand that they file the dismissal request.

In a stunning rebuke to the DOJ's argument, Ho in his order wrote, ""Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the Indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions"" by Adams.

""Taking a step back from the particulars of this case, DOJ's immigration enforcement rationale is both unprecedented and breathtaking in its sweep,"" the judge wrote.

""DOJ cites no examples, and the Court is unable to find any, of the government dismissing charges against an elected official because doing so would enable the official to facilitate federal policy goals.""

Ho also wrote that the ""DOJ's assertion that it has 'virtually unreviewable' license to dismiss charges on this basis is disturbing in its breadth, implying that public officials may receive special dispensation if they are compliant with the incumbent administration's policy priorities.""

""That suggestion is fundamentally incompatible with the basic promise of equal justice under law,"" the judge wrote.

Ho said that dismissing the case without prejudice ""would create the unavoidable perception that the Mayor's freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration.

He also said it would create the perception that Adams, who is seeking re-election this year, ""might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents.""

""That appearance is inevitable, and it counsels in favor of dismissal with prejudice,"" Ho wrote.

The DOJ's ""request, if granted, would leave Mayor Adams under the specter of reindictment at essentially any time, and for essentially any reason,"" Ho noted.

The judge noted that Adams requested a dismissal with prejudice, and that the DOJ had not opposed that motion, ""effectively waiving any objection to permanent dismissal of this case.""

Ho flatly rejected claims by the DOJ that the prosecution of Adams was tainted by ""appearances of impropriety,"" saying that was ""unsupported by any objective evidence.""

""Rather, the record before the Court indicates that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York prosecutors who worked on this case followed all appropriate Justice Department guidelines,"" Ho wrote.

""There is no evidence — zero — that they had any improper motives.""

But the judge said there were two reasons to dismiss the case: protecting the rights of a criminal defendant, and Ho's lack of power to compel the DOJ to prosecute Adams.

""This case should have never been brought and I did nothing wrong,"" Adams said at a news conference.

""I'm now happy that our city can finally close the book on this to focus,"" he said. ""I want to thank New Yorkers who stood by my side, who prayed for me, who supported me from day one, that stuck with me while we focused on the work at hand.""

The DOJ, in a statement to NBC News, said, ""This case was an example of political weaponization and a waste of resources.""

""We are focused on arresting and prosecuting terrorists while returning the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe,"" the DOJ said.

Adams, who is a former New York City police officer, was indicted in September on charges accusing him of a decade-long campaign contribution scheme, bribery and other allegations.

The indictment accused Adams of accepting illegal donations to his 2021 mayoral campaign and of accepting free luxury travel as far back as 2016, when he was the Brooklyn borough president.

Prosecutors said that a senior official in Turkey's diplomatic establishment facilitated campaign donations to Adams, and also arranged for his and companies to receive free or discounted travel on Turkey's national airline to destinations including France, China, Sri Lanka, India, Hungary and Turkey.

Adams in exchange, later pressured the New York City Fire Department to facilitate the opening of Turkey's new consulate building without a fire inspection in time for a visit by Turkey's president, the indictment alleges.

The case was filed by the DOJ when then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was still in the White House.

After being charged, Adams had curried favor with Trump in what was seen as a bid to have the case dismissed, or to receive a pardon from the Republican.

Former acting U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, who resigned in February rather than follow through with an order to dismiss the case, told Attorney General Pam Bondi in a letter that at Adams' lawyers at a meeting with her and top DOJ official Emil Bove ""urged what amounted to a quid pro quo"" in which the mayor would support Trump immigration enforcement efforts in exchange for dismissal of the case.

Adams' lawyer Spiro has denied Sassoon's allegation.

Trump Media's stock slid on Wednesday after the company disclosed in a securities filing the possibility of significant stock sales, including by insider shareholders such as the president's trust.

The parent company of Truth Social said in a filing dated April 1 that the company could soon sell roughly 8.4 million shares of common stock related to existing warrants issued during the initial public offering. The company said insiders and major stakeholders could also sell up to about 134 million shares ""from time to time.""

That includes the more than 114 million shares held by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust.

The stock was down about 5% in midday trading.

President Donald Trump has previously said he does not plan to sell his stake in the company. His son Donald Trump Jr. is in charge of the revocable trust.

""The sale of the Resale Securities being offered pursuant to this prospectus, or the perception that these sales could occur, could result in a significant decline in the public trading price of our Common Stock,"" the prospectus warned.

The company said the total shares available for resale amounted to 129.2% of the company's public float of shares, which is a measure of the amount of stock currently available for trade.

In a statement, the company said the filing does not indicate that insider sales are planned.

""Legacy media outlets are spreading a fake story suggesting that a TMTG filing today is paving the way for the Trump trust to sell its shares in TMTG. To be clear, these shares were already registered last June on an S-1 form, and today TMTG submitted a routine filing that re-registers them on an S-3 form in order to keep the Company's filings effective. In fact, there currently is no open window for any affiliate to sell shares,"" the statement said.

Trump Media stock has been highly volatile since it went public through a combination with a special purpose acquisition company last year. The stock is down about 70% from its postmerger highs.

Still, the shares are worth a lot of value on paper, especially relative to the company's meager revenue. Shares were trading at around $19 per share Wednesday morning, putting the notional value of the trust's position at more than $2 billion.

The company warned in the filing that insiders could profit from a sale of stock even if doing so drives down the price.

""Selling Securityholders may still experience a positive rate of return on the shares of Common Stock purchased by them due to the lower price per share at which such shares of Common Stock were purchased as referenced above, but public stockholders may not experience a similar rate of return on the Common Stock they purchased if there is such a decline in price and due to differences in the purchase prices and the current market price,"" the prospectus said.

The underlying business of Trump Media is much smaller than other public social media companies. The firm reported less than $4 million in total sales in 2024, with a net loss of about $401 million. The company said earlier this year it plans to expand into financial services.

TKO Group's UFC has struck a multimillion-dollar, multiple-year partnership deal with Meta that will bring the mixed martial arts league closer to Mark Zuckerberg's technology company, UFC told CNBC.

UFC's integration with Meta will span the company's portfolio, including Meta AI, Meta Glasses, Meta Quest, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads. Specific financial terms weren't disclosed.

Meta will become the ""official fan technology partner"" of UFC and will have its branding featured in UFC's Octagon ring for pay-per-view and ""Fight Night"" events.

""Mark and his team at Meta are going to do things that will blow away UFC fans,"" UFC President and CEO Dana White said in a statement to CNBC.

The partnership with Meta is separate from the UFC's media rights discussions, which are set to kick off later in April. UFC's exclusive negotiating window with its current partner ESPN ends April 15. ESPN doesn't plan to renew its deal before the window's expiration, CNBC has previously reported.

The companies first started working on a sponsorship deal in the second half of 2024, according to Grant Norris-Jones, TKO's head of global partnerships. UFC held discussions with a number of potential partners in different business units and realized Meta could provide the league with much of what it wanted, Norris-Jones said in an interview.

""Meta will be our official marketing partner, our official AI glasses partner, our official wearable partner, an official social media partner,"" said Norris-Jones. ""They're making a significant investment into our ecosystem.""

Meta's Threads will feature exclusive UFC content and will be referenced in live UFC broadcasts, Norris-Jones said. Both companies are already working on a series of follow-on announcements to come in the next three to nine months, including more details around a new UFC fighter rankings system that will draw on Meta technology, he said.

While White and Zuckerberg, Meta's founder and CEO, didn't personally hammer out terms of the deal, it's ""nice to have the air cover"" of the executives' close relationship, Norris-Jones said. White joined the Meta board in January.

""I love this sport and I'm looking forward to working with UFC to let fans experience it in new ways,"" Zuckerberg said in the statement to CNBC.

The Meta CEO has attended a number of UFC events and personally participates in mixed martial arts.

Zuckerberg said on Joe Rogan's podcast in January that corporate culture would benefit from more ""masculine energy."" The Meta CEO said in July that President Donald Trump's reaction after getting shot in the ear was ""badass."" Trump is also friendly with White, who endorsed Trump and spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention.

""Having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits,"" Zuckerberg said on the Rogan podcast.

Meta noted Zuckerberg's love of combat sports in its annual report as a potential risk factor.

""We currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg,"" the company said in a corporate filing. ""Mr. Zuckerberg and certain other members of management participate in various high-risk activities, such as combat sports, extreme sports, and recreational aviation, which carry the risk of serious injury and death. If Mr. Zuckerberg were to become unavailable for any reason, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations.""

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is attending Senate Republicans' weekly lunch today before Trump's expected tariff announcement.

The Treasury secretary's visit to Capitol Hill comes a day after he visited with House Republicans. 

There, Rep. Kevin Hern, Okla., told CNBC that Bessent said the tariff rates being announced today would be the top rates, and will go down from here, not up..

Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer (N.J.) is warning that Trump's tariffs are ""regressive"" and will hit ""people on things they buy every day.""

""I don't think people are seeing this, including a lot of Republicans, as a day of liberation, but ... a day of higher costs and a day of chaos,"" Gottheimer told CNBC's 'The Exchange.'

""Regardless where people are on the political spectrum, what they don't like is a lot of uncertainty,"" said Gottheimer, who is currently running for governor of New Jersey.

""I think people are hearing all this noise, they're seeing every day the news change, and they just want some certainty,"" he added.

""They want less chaos in their lives.""

Major averages are trading modestly higher in the volatile session as investors await details about tariffs on key U.S. trading partners.

The S&P 500 last traded up 0.2% after swinging significantly between gains and losses. At its session high, the benchmark was up 1.1%; at its session low, the S&P 500 declined 1.1%.

The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1just 60 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3% as Tesla shares jumped more than 4%.

""Any 'relief' bounce is likely to be short-lived as the absolute effect of the trade agenda remains decidedly negative with downside pressure on growth/earnings and upside risks to inflation,"" Adan Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note.

The Trump administration is adding imports of beer and empty aluminum cans to its 25% tariffs on derivative aluminum products, according to a notice posted Wednesday in the Federal Register.

The notice from the Commerce Department said the adjusted tariffs would take effect after midnight Friday.

One of the two product tariff codes referenced in the notice applies to ""beer made from malt."" The other applies to aluminum casks, drums, cans, boxes and similar containers with a capacity no greater than 20 liters.

The notice does not include a separate code that would encompass beer in glass containers.

The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policy has created panic for smaller businesses grappling with the likelihood of added operations costs and potential supply chain bottlenecks.

""I'm going to run out of appliances,"" said Robin Liss, founder of kitchen gadget company Suvie, ahead of her two-week trip to Taiwan and Vietnam to work out a new business plan. ""I've got to figure this out.""

Trump slapped additional tariffs on China and is threatening to strain America's relationships with other longtime trading partners.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says she does not plan to implement tit-for-tat tariffs on American goods in response to Trump's import duties.  

""It's not about tit-for-tat, but about what is best for Mexico and how to face this situation,"" she said during a morning press conference.

""We do not believe in an eye-for-an-eye, a tooth-for-a-tooth because that always leads to a bad situation,"" she said.

The Senate is poised to vote later today on a Democratic-led resolution to undo the ""national emergency"" that Trump declared in order to create a legal rationale for Trump's tariffs on Canada.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told reporters earlier that Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) indicated that he plans to back the resolution. At least three other Republican senators — Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Susan Collins (Me.) and Rand Paul (Ky.) — have also signaled plans to support the measure.

The resolution is largely symbolic, because it still needs to move through the Republican controlled House and would require Trump's signature to become law.

Nonetheless, Senate passage with the support of some Republicans — on the same day Trump unveils his tariff plan — would mark a rebuke to Trump's tariff policy.

— Erin Doherty

Sen. Peter Welch, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, is slamming Trump's tariff policies, warning that his ""half-baked trade war will only raise prices for consumers.""

""Trump's so-called 'liberation day' will throw the global economy into turmoil and leave Americans holding the bag,"" the Vermont Democrat Welch says in a statement hours before the unveiling of so-called reciprocal tariffs at the White House.

""We should not impose sweeping tariffs on our allies and longtime partners in trade. America's close economic ties with our trading partners are based on trust,"" Welch says.

""These on-again, off-again tariffs are extremely destructive and totally unnecessary,"" he says. ""President Trump is sticking it to our farmers, our businesses, and everyday working people.""

— Kevin Breuninger

Trump has made a final decision on how he wants to proceed with his sweeping reciprocal tariff plans, a White House official told CNBC's Megan Cassella.

The update marks an apparent end to the internal deliberations that were reportedly ongoing in the hours before the Wednesday afternoon announcement event.

— Kevin Breuninger and Megan Cassella

Trump will be joined in the Rose Garden by workers from industries that are likely to be affected by his reciprocal tariffs.

The guest list includes ""steel workers, autoworkers, oil and gas workers, steam fitters, truck drivers, and hardworking Americans from a variety of trades,"" a senior White House official told NBC News.

— Kevin Breuninger and Peter Alexander

Trump has said tariffs on pharmaceutical products imported into the U.S. were coming soon, but it is not clear if they will be announced at the White House event.

Those potential tariffs would likely drive up U.S. drug prices for patients because even if companies moved to produce those medications domestically, it would take years and cost more than producing medicines abroad, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a note last week. 

Predicting the potential impact of tariffs on pharmaceutical companies is difficult since they have vast and complex manufacturing networks with multiple steps, sometimes in different geographies, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said in a note.

But Scala said Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie appear better positioned than others to weather tariffs because they have more major manufacturing plants in the U.S. than internationally. 

The majority of their sites responsible for producing the active ingredients in drugs are also in the U.S., he added. 

Meanwhile, Novartis and Roche ""look more at risk"" because they have few U.S. plants and a higher share of active ingredient sites that are international, Scala said.

Some tequila makers have been warning about how tariffs could hit their businesses, but Colorado-based Suerte Tequila said it won't raise prices to offset tariffs.

""Tequila margins are stronger than ever,"" said Laurence Spiewak, Suerte Tequila CEO.

Still, the industry could see a hit with tariffs on Mexico.

In 2024, the U.S. imported $5.2 billion worth of tequila and $93 million worth of mezcal from Mexico, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S.

Trump is targeting Mitch McConnell and three other Republican senators in a critical Truth Social post, urging them to oppose a bill that would undo U.S. tariffs on Canada.

McConnell, Rand Paul, Ky., Sen. Susan Collins, Me. and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, ""will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change,"" Trump writes. 

He presses the senators to ""fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl, by Tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy."" 

It is not immediately clear what Trump means by ""tariffing the value"" of fentanyl.

Trump calls the Senate bill introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a ""ploy"" intended to ""show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely these four.""

The president also calls on Kentucky, Alaska and Maine voters to call these senators' offices.

""They have been extremely difficult to deal with and, unbelievably disloyal to hardworking Majority Leader John Thune, and the Republican Party itself,"" Trump adds

— Kevin Breuninger

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he stands ready to remove retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products if Trump cancels heavy American import duties on Canadian goods.

""We're willing to take these tariffs off, like in the next minute, if he said he's taking their tariffs off,"" Ford told CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

Canada has imposed 25% tariffs on more than $20 billion worth of U.S. goods in retaliation for the Trump administration's steel and aluminum duties.

In addition, Ottawa has slapped 25% counter-tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods, in response to Trump's imposition of broad-based tariffs on imports from Canada.

— Yun Li

Trump is hyping his reciprocal tariffs in a Truth Social post declaring the day of their unveiling ""LIBERATION DAY IN AMERICA!""

Trump commonly refers to his tariffs in historic terms, raising expectations and concerns about how severe the duties could be.

— Kevin Breuninger

Slovakia, the landlocked country east of Austria, could suffer the most from the new auto tariffs that Trump said will start to take effect Thursday.

""Germany's car industry is in the eye of the storm and by far most exposed in terms of value, with major players like Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes, and Porsche likely getting hit by tariffs,"" economists Inga Fechner and Rico Luman of Dutch bank ING said in a recent research note.

""But Slovakia — home to several car plants — is most exposed in terms of total US export volume,"" they said.

The nation of 5.4 million people produces more cars per capita than any other country in the world. And the ""Detroit of Europe"" relies heavily on U.S. trade, with autos comprising a major chunk of its U.S. exports.

— Kevin Breuninger and Sam Meredith

The U.S. stock market was poised to open lower Wednesday as Wall Street continues to struggle in the face of the looming tariff policies from the Trump administration.

The S&P 500 is now down 4.2% over the past month and is 8.4% below its record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has dropped 7.4% over the past month and is 13.6% below its record high.

Uncertainty about tariffs is not the only reason the stock market has struggled, as some tech stocks that are thought to be relatively insulated from trade war concerns have also fallen.

Other stock moves seem to have a more direct line to concerns about tariffs and their economic impact, such as the 12% decline in the past month for Stellantis.

On the other hand, gold and Treasury bonds have both been rallying in recent days, a sign that investors may be looking to reduce risk. Gold was trading near a record high Wednesday morning.

— Jesse Pound

The scope of new tariffs has yet to be finalized by the White House, the Bloomberg news service reported.

""The White House has not reached a firm decision on their tariff plan,"" Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the plan.

Several options are under consideration at the White House. One is a universal flat tariff rate applied to all trade partners, while another would tailor tariffs to each trade partner.

A third option prepared by the U.S. Trade Representative's office would apply a flat rate to a select group of countries.

— Dan Mangan

Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont said the tariff disagreements between Trump and Democrats go beyond typical party differences, calling it a ""very, very serious situation.""

""We believe what President Trump is doing is, in many cases, lawless and really beyond any norms,"" he said on ""Squawk Box.""

Welch said Congress has tariff authority that can be traced back to the Constitution.

Trump's actions are an ""overreach"" in service of a personal agenda, he said.

""There's a real abdication by Congress of its own authority,"" he said.

— Laya Neelakandan

The U.S. Trade Representative's office has prepared a third option for tariffs, The Wall Street Journal reports.

This tariff structure would set a rate below 20% and apply it only to a small group of trade partners.

There are two other plans under consideration at the White House.

Trump's new tariffs will take effect ""immediately"" after he announces them in the Rose Garden, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.

The timeline offered a morsel of clarity about the reciprocal tariff plan, which remains highly opaque just hours before it is set to be unveiled.

— Kevin Breuninger

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke on the phone in advance of looming U.S. tariffs to reaffirm their ""strong trading and investment relationship,"" Carney's government in Ottawa said.

""With challenging times ahead,"" the two leaders ""emphasized the importance of safeguarding North American competitiveness while respecting the sovereignty of each nation,"" Ottawa said in a statement after Tuesday's call.

Carney also laid out his ""plan to fight unjustified trade actions against Canada"" by the Trump administration.

In separate remarks to reporters Tuesday, Carney said Canada is prepared to retaliate against whatever actions the U.S. takes Wednesday.

""We have held back, but we will not disadvantage Canadian producers and Canadian workers relative to American workers,"" he said.

— Kevin Breuninger

Trump is about to drop a sweeping tariff policy on an economy that already seems to be showing cracks.

Several top analysts have lowered economic growth projections in recent weeks and warned of persistent inflation, dragging the term stagflation back into the conversation.

Strategists and fund managers have also recently raised the probability of a recession, a shift that stems in large part from concerns about the Trump administration's fiscal policies.

These fears coincide with a highly volatile stock market and souring sentiment from consumers and businesses alike.

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on auto imports is expected to hit hard for car brands and countries around the world, with economists warning a small landlocked nation in Europe could feel the worst of the impact.

Trump is poised to unveil the details of his latest round of sweeping tariffs at around 9 p.m. London time (4 p.m. ET) on Wednesday. The measures, which are separate from Washington's levies on the global automotive sector, appear designed to rebalance the economic order in America's favor.

Trump has already announced a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles, with charges on businesses importing vehicles coming into effect as of Thursday. The White House has said a tax for automobile parts is set to start in May.

The president's back-and-forth announcements on tariffs have alarmed global investors, corporate executives and U.S. trading partners in recent months. Germany slammed Trump's 25% auto tariffs as bad news for the U.S., the European Union and global trade.

Inga Fechner and Rico Luman, economists at Dutch bank ING, have said that, while Germany is most exposed to Trump's 25% auto tariffs in terms of value, it is Slovakia that may feel the biggest impact.

""Germany's car industry is in the eye of the storm and by far most exposed in terms of value, with major players like Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes, and Porsche likely getting hit by tariffs,"" ING said in a research note published March 28.

""But Slovakia – home to several car plants – is most exposed in terms of total US export volume,"" they added.

Nicknamed the ""Detroit of Europe"" due to its thriving automotive industry, Slovakia produces more cars per capita than any other country in the world.

The nation of just 5.4 million people relies heavily on U.S. trade, with autos accounting for a sizable chunk of its U.S. exports and the sector indirectly employing more than 250,000 people.

ING's Luman said there has been a frontloading of car shipments to the U.S. ahead of Trump's auto tariffs and that ""this will unwind"" after the measures are imposed.

""Supply chains won't be immediately redirected and redesigned amid high uncertainty for investors, but if it holds a while production will start to shift to the US,"" Luman told CNBC by email on Wednesday.

On the other hand, Luman said Slovakia still has relatively low production costs, as local wages are significantly lower than in Germany.

""So, VW and Stellantis will likely seek to keep occupation rates of their factories in Slovakia up (for ICE models) and as such the export setback could also weigh on production in elsewhere in Europe, which will be replaced,"" Luman said.

Vladimir Vaňo, chief economist at Globsec, a think tank based in Slovakia's capital of Bratislava, has previously described the prospect of Trump tariffs as ""worrisome"" for Slovakia, while suggesting there appeared to be ""very little"" the country could do in the short term.

A spokesperson for Slovakia's government was not immediately available to comment.

Slovakia is Europe's joint-third-largest exporter of passenger cars to the U.S., alongside Sweden, with 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) worth of exports to the U.S. in 2023, according to ING.

Notably, ING said more than 73% of Slovakia's total exports to the U.S. consist of car and car parts, leaving the country acutely exposed to Trump tariffs.

Mortgage rates have barely budged in the last month. That, and a broader concern among consumers about the state of the economy, has also kept mortgage demand muted.

Total mortgage application volume dropped 1.6% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index.

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, decreased to 6.70% from 6.71%, with points increasing to 0.62 from 0.60, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment.

Applications to refinance a home loan dropped 6% for the week and were 57% higher than the same week one year ago. The annual comparison is so large because the total volume is so low. Mortgage rates were 21 basis points higher the same week one year ago. Given how low rates were during the first few years of the Covid pandemic, which sparked a massive refinance boom, there are now precious few borrowers who can benefit from a refinance at the current rates.

Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 2% for the week and were 9% higher than the same week a year ago. Demand from buyers was at its highest level since the end of January, driven by a 3% increase in conventional purchases. Demand for government loans, favored by lower-income borrowers, was down 2%.

""Overall purchase activity has shown year-over-year growth for more than two months as the inventory of existing homes for sale continues to increase, a positive development for the housing market despite the uncertain near-term outlook,"" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA.

Mortgage rates started this week slightly lower but are still moving in a very narrow range as uncertainty over tariffs keeps the markets guessing.

United Airlines plans to add daily flights to Vietnam and Thailand in October, further expanding the network for the U.S. carrier that already has the most Asia service.

In the expansion, United is using a tactic that's unusual in its network: Its airplanes from Los Angeles and San Francisco that are headed for Hong Kong will then go on to the two new destinations. The Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, service is set to begin on Oct. 26.

On Oct. 25, United plans to add a second daily nonstop flight from San Francisco to Manila, Philippines, and on Dec. 11, it will launch nonstops from San Francisco to Adelaide, Australia, which will operate three days a week.

The carrier has aggressively been adding far-flung destinations not served by rivals to its routes, like Nuuk, Greenland, and Bilbao, Spain, which start later this year. Getting the mix right is especially important as carriers seek to grow their lucrative loyalty programs and need attractive destinations to keep customers spending.

Bangkok, in particular, ""is in even more demand now given the popularity of 'White Lotus,'"" Patrick Quayle, United's senior vice president of network and global alliances, said of the HBO show.

He said the carrier isn't planning on cutting any international routes for its upcoming winter schedule.

The dread of something bad happening is usually more severe than the event itself.

This could well be the case for U.S. President Donald Trump's wide-ranging tariff plan. Even though Trump initially described it as ""reciprocal tariffs,"" implying that the U.S. would match other countries' import levies, the White House is reportedly considering a 20% charge on most goods and services. The figure sounds high, but is dramatically lower than, for instance, India's tariff on auto imports — which can go up to 70%, according to Times of India.

Investors' worries were slightly assuaged by the news, pushing up stocks. It is, however, too early to let down your guard. Concrete details of Trump's plans are still unclear. Uncertainty is a bargaining chip for Trump; he could unleash a much more brutal tariff regime than expected.

Other times, experiencing something bad could be worse than dreading it.

T-1 to tariffsU.S. President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal tariffs"" will be announced Wednesday and ""be effective immediately,"" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday. Details of Trump's plans are still unclear, but The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the White House is considering tariffs of around 20% on most imports. Trump's plan to reshape global trade comes at a time when the U.S. economy is looking increasingly shaky.

Volatile tradingU.S. markets mostly rose in a choppy trading session Tuesday. The S&P 500 closed 0.38% up, the Nasdaq Composite added 0.87%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a fractional 0.03%. Asia-Pacific stocks were mixed Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 inched up roughly 0.1%, while South Korea's Kospi index declined around 0.6% amid annual inflation reaccelerating to 2.1% in March, higher than the 2% in February and expected by a Reuters poll.

Freshly listed stocks jumpCoreWeave's stock popped nearly 42% on Tuesday to close at $52.57, bringing the company to a nearly $25 billion market capitalization. The artificial intelligence cloud company listed Friday in the biggest venture-backed tech IPO for a U.S. company since 2021. Separately, shares of conservative cable channel Newsmax soared nearly 180% Tuesday, a day after the stock spiked more than 700% during its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.

Meta's head of AI research departsMeta's vice president of AI research, Joelle Pineau, announced in a LinkedIn post Tuesday her departure from the company. Her last day at the social media company will be May 30. Pineau has led the company's fundamental AI research unit, or FAIR, since 2023. Pineau helped oversee Meta's open-source Llama family of AI models and other technologies like the PyTorch software for AI developers.

[PRO] 'Avoid the tariff tantrum'The U.S., as the world's biggest economy, drives the finances of many international companies. Trump's tariffs are expected to slam the brakes, at least temporarily, on revenue growth of those firms. But there are three stocks that can ""avoid the tariff tantrum,"" according to one investor.

Norway urged to scrap ban on $1.8 trillion wealth fund investing in weapons makers

Norway's Government Pension Fund Global, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, has been prevented from taking stakes in companies that produce critical components for nuclear weapons since the early 2000s.

Under ethical guidelines, the fund has also been barred from investing in firms that are involved in the production of cluster munitions, anti-personnel landmines and tobacco, among other things.

The country's center-right Conservative party said the time has come for the government to lift the ban on taking stakes in certain defense companies, citing Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the ""significant rearming"" of countries such as China in recent years.

Uncertainty surrounding upcoming U.S. tariffs has weighed on global markets over the last month — but President Donald Trump's highly-anticipated Wednesday announcement may not end the turmoil, analysts say.

Trump is expected to flesh out many unknowns in an address on Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET (9 p.m. BST), including exactly which countries and sectors will be impacted, when the measures will come into effect, how high they will be or how they will be calculated, and whether there will be any or many notable exemptions.

Investors have been attempting to parse rhetoric from reality in the run-up to the presidential address. Global stocks suffered their worst month for a year and a half in March, according to the MSCI World Index. Europe's Stoxx 600 dropped 4.18% while the U.S. S&P 500 tumbled 5.75%. Asia-Pacific stocks were slightly more resilient, though China's CSI 300 dipped 0.07%.

Zoe Gillespie, chartered wealth manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said the Wednesday announcement is ""unlikely"" to contain full details — and would still leave a lack of clarity over the outlook.

""The danger is actually, what's going to happen after the announcement, whether we're going to see the European Union coming back with some retaliatory tariffs, and really the kind of the outlook from that,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday. 

""There could still be more uncertainty as this plays out, and [questions on] whether it becomes a bit like the inflation story, more entrenched in the longer term. And I think the danger is that we don't have much clarity for a longer period of time, and the impact on growth, and if we start getting some negativity coming through then it could actually delay any real 'this is the peak bottom' signals.""

The EU — which, as a bloc, is the U.S.'s biggest trading partner across goods, services and investment — has already announced a first tranche of retaliatory tariffs in response to Trump's initial wave of duties on steel and aluminum imports. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday said the EU would ""take firm counter-measures if necessary"" and that ""all instruments are on the table"" in response to further U.S. action.

The U.K., which is hoping to leverage its more balanced trade relationship with the U.S. to strike an economic deal and avoid the worst impact of tariffs, is also keeping all options on the table, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday.

While Trump has branded April 2 ""Liberation Day,"" a better descriptor might be ""Carnage Day,"" Ozan Ozkural, founding managing partner at Tanto Capital Partners, told CNBC on Tuesday.

""This is just classic Trump shock and awe in trying to get counterparts to the negotiation table to try to get a better deal for United States,"" he said.

""The way he is going about doing that, and the fact that there is a continuous news cycle which is sometimes contradictory, is what's making it very difficult to price any asset right now.""

""If you take a look at the commodities markets, it's crazy, because on the one hand you're talking about secondary sanctions on Venezuela oil, potentially a Russia-Ukraine deal, which may bring Russian crude back into the market, which is a completely different game, and now potential secondary sanctions on Russian oils. It is very difficult to price anything at the moment, so we are taking it day by day and hour by hour, sometimes,"" Ozkural said.

He added that he was nonetheless betting on the U.S. outperforming Europe in the long term, despite its rougher start for 2025 in markets. While Europe will benefit from tailwinds including regional commitments to rearmament and Germany's huge new defense, infrastructure and climate fund, the continent will continue to suffer from its innovation gap, he argued.

RBC Brewin Dolphin's Gillespie also said the wealth manager saw the U.S. eventually outperforming, even if it had trimmed its U.S. allocation recently.

""Because of the U.S.'s broad nature and the quality of companies, it's quite difficult to look elsewhere, longer term, and avoid the U.S.,"" she said, citing the impact from artificial intelligence.

But further uncertainties clouding the near- to medium-term outlook for investors include what impact tariffs will have on U.S. growth, inflation and the path for interest rates, Gillespie continued — which in the short term could spur investors to look at more domestically-focused companies avoiding global supply chains.

However, Arnaud Girod, head of economics and cross asset strategy at Kepler Cheuvreux, said Wednesday may mark ""peak uncertainty"" for markets.

He also noted that the U.S. had seen a huge pullback in the first quarter, logging one of the biggest outperformances in Europe on record.

""I'm hoping that there is a sense of moderation tonight, we'll see. Maybe that's too naive, after everything we saw from Trump,"" he told CNBC's ""Street Signs Europe.""

""What's for sure is that a lot of numbers have been shared by analysts, they have been modeling every kind of scenario. So I'm hoping tonight is the worst, is the peak of uncertainty, and from there there will be negotiations, discussions, and hopefully the impact will be slightly less than the worst case... and so hopefully that can help the U.S. markets recover.""

In this article

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong spoke out this week on the need for interest-bearing stablecoins ahead of the House Financial Services Committee's Wednesday markup of its version of stablecoin legislation.

Specifically, he said stablecoins should be able to pay interest to consumers, and that banks and crypto companies should be able to do the same.

""We're supportive of the draft bill that's going through the Senate as it's written but there is a part of it that does concern me a bit, which is this idea that consumers cannot get interest on stablecoins,"" he said on CNBC's ""Money Movers"" Tuesday. ""Many Americans, they're only earning about 0.14% in their savings account, but in Treasurys, you can earn 4.5% right now. That seems unfair to me … we'd like to see legislation that allows that.""

The House STABLE (Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy) Act specifies that permitted issuers ""may not pay interest or yield to holders"" of the stablecoin. Similarly, the Senate's GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) Act's definition of a ""payment stablecoin"" specifies that it ""does not offer a payment of yield or interest."" The latter bill was passed in the Senate in March.

Armstrong's comments follow a lengthy post on his X account that goes into more detail about his view.

""Unlike interest-bearing checking and savings accounts, stablecoins do not currently benefit from the same exemptions under the securities laws that allow issuers to pay interest to users,"" he wrote. ""Stablecoins should be able to pay interest just like an ordinary savings account, without the onerous disclosure requirements and tax implications imposed by securities laws.""

Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC) are backed 1-to-1 by the U.S. dollar and their issuers typically hold reserve assets in cash and short-term Treasury securities. Historically these types of assets have acted as a bridge for traders between traditional financial rails and crypto systems, and crypto investors watch them closely for evidence of demand, liquidity and activity in the market.

In recent years, stablecoins have also become popular for their ability to pay users interest for simply holding them – however, that interest payment is typically an incentive offered by exchanges like Coinbase or Kraken or wallet operators rather than the stablecoin issuer itself.

Coinbase has an agreement with the stablecoin issuer Circle – the company behind USDC, which filed Tuesday evening for an initial public offering with the SEC – to share 50% of the revenue of USDC. A section of the company's prospectus echoed Armstrong's concern:

""Absent federal regulations, there is a possibility that Circle stablecoins may be classified as 'securities,'"" the filing said. ""Any classification of Circle stablecoins as a 'security' would subject us to additional regulation and could materially impact the operation of our business.""

The Securities and Exchange Commission typically views assets as securities if they constitute an investment of money with the expectation of profit from others' efforts. Security status often implies being subject to greater regulatory scrutiny and compliance obligations that are very expensive for companies.

Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research platform DYOR, said allowing issuers to pay users interest would also mark a big shift in who holds profits in crypto.

""Right now, exchanges and platforms capture the yield from stablecoins by investing user deposits and keeping most of the return,"" he said. ""If stablecoin issuers start paying interest directly to users, it flips that model: users benefit more, middlemen get squeezed, and stablecoins become a lot more attractive to hold.""

Traditional, non-yield-bearing, dollar-backed stablecoins have grown their market cap by more than 46% in the past year, according to CryptoQuant. But yield-bearing stablecoins like Ethena's USDe or Ondo Finance's USDY are the fastest-growing cohort within the stablecoin universe, according to JPMorgan.

""This universe of yield-bearing stablecoins has been growing exponentially post the U.S. election, with the market cap of the five biggest surpassing $13 billion, or 6% of the total stablecoin universe,"" JPMorgan's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note last Wednesday.

Over time, yield-bearing stablecoins could replace most of the ""idle cash"" sitting in traditional stablecoins, he added, saying the 6% share it currently has of the total stablecoin market cap will grow ""to a much higher percentage but not more than 50%.""

""Traditional stablecoin issuers such as USDT and USDC do not share reserve yields with users, a practice that could significantly reduce their revenues but more importantly would make stablecoins classified as securities,"" he added. ""That would have subjected stablecoins to additional regulatory restrictions and require compliance with securities law, thus hindering their current seamless and permissionless use as source of collateral in the crypto ecosystem.""

COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Europe's pharmaceutical sector is bracing for the potential impact of U.S. tariffs as hopes of an industry-wide exemption by U.S. President Donald Trump fade.

The pharmaceutical industry has until now been exempt from trade levies, but Trump confirmed last week that he would soon impose tariffs on the sector.

Drugmakers are now lobbying the president for a phased approach to duties on imports to the U.S., Reuters reported Tuesday, citing four sources familiar with the discussions. The sources said the levies may not be announced Wednesday but were likely inevitable.

Gradual implementation of tariffs on the sector could reduce the immediate financial hit and allow companies time to relocate their manufacturing stateside. Nevertheless, some firms have warned that the lack of clarity is already having negative secondary effects.

""For us, what is more important is not only the impact of tariffs, it's also the impact it makes on the market,"" Ester Baiget, CEO of Danish biotech firm Novonesis, told CNBC Tuesday.

""When you bring tariffs, it drives uncertainty, and when you [are] uncertain, you pause, you pause innovation, you post launches, you pause investments,"" said Baiget, whose firm derives around 30% of its sales from the U.S. but has also been boosting its manufacturing presence in the country.

Denmark is one of Europe's largest pharma and biotech hubs, home to companies including Wegovy-maker Novo Nordisk and vaccine-producer Bavarian Nordic — both of which have high exposure to the U.S.

Novo Nordisk's chairman told CNBC last week that the company was not speculating ahead of Trump's tariff announcement and was instead focused on remaining flexible.

""It doesn't make a lot of sense to speculate too much,"" Chairman Helge Lund told CNBC on the sidelines of the Danish pharmaceutical giant's Annual General Meeting. ""We are laser-focused on what we can impact.""

Still, questions have been asked about how tariffs might impact U.S. sales of Novo's hugely popular obesity and diabetes treatments — and the implications for U.S. rival and Zepbound-maker Eli Lilly. Lund would not be pressed on what share of its weight-loss drug sales derived from U.S. plants, instead pointing to the firm's ""very significant"" manufacturing set-up in the U.S.

The threat of tariffs has added to uncertainty within the investment landscape too. Speaking to CNBC Monday, Emily Field, head of European pharmaceuticals research at Barclays, cited tariffs as the ""No. 1 question on investors' minds.""

Morten Bødskov, Denmark's minister for industry, business and financial affairs, told CNBC Tuesday that he was liaising with the country's pharmaceutical industry and corporates more broadly about the potential impact of tariffs on the small, export-heavy economy.

""We are, of course, in close dialog with them,"" Bødskov said. ""It's our job to bring them into discussions on the way the world is changing. Many of them are world-leading companies, so it's our job to help them to see the perspectives of future markets,"" he added.

However, he noted that it was unclear whether the Trump administration could be persuaded to roll back on its protectionist policies, or make allowances for certain sectors.

For companies like Novonesis, meanwhile, Baiget said it was a matter of watching events ""very closely"" — and readying for action if needed.

""There is a lot of volatility, and there is a lot of rapidly moving trends,"" she said. ""It's important that we decouple, and we also learn how to maybe buffer some of them.""

Norway's government is under growing pressure to let the country's $1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund invest in certain defense firms, with opposition parties describing a longstanding ban as ""illogical"" in the current security landscape.

Norway's Government Pension Fund Global, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, has been prevented from taking stakes in companies that produce critical components for nuclear weapons since the early 2000s.

Under ethical guidelines, the fund has also been barred from investing in firms that are involved in the production of cluster munitions, anti-personnel landmines and tobacco, among other things.

The country's center-right Conservative party says the time has come for the government to lift the ban on taking stakes in certain defense companies, citing Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the ""significant rearming"" of countries such as China in recent years.

""We are currently facing the most serious security crisis since World War II. There is an urgent need for increased investment in the Western defense industry to safeguard our own security and that of our allies,"" Tina Bru, deputy leader of the Conservative party, told CNBC via email.

In her view, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre should seek to change the ethical framework of the country's wealth fund to make sure that companies seen as vital to the West's security are not excluded.

A spokesperson for Norway's finance ministry declined to comment when contacted by CNBC, saying the government would first answer a similar question from the Norwegian parliament.

The fund has previously excluded British defense contractor BAE Systems due to the firm's production of key components for nuclear weapons and U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Matin Corp because of cluster munitions.

""Across the West, critical weapons are being procured from companies that are currently excluded from the Petroleum Fund's investments. It's illogical that Norway's Pension Fund is prohibited from investing in the same companies that the government procures from through the state budget,"" Bru said.

Norway's center-left Labour Party is expected to govern alone until new parliamentary elections take place in September. The country's ruling coalition government collapsed earlier in the year amid infighting over European Union energy directives.

A founding member of NATO, Norway is not a part of the EU but works closely with the bloc as a member of the wider European Economic Area.

The debate over how Norway's wealth fund should respond to the evolving security landscape comes at a time of higher defense spending and soaring industry profits as governments respond to elevated geopolitical risk.

Defense stocks have typically been excluded from portfolios based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors due to ethical concerns over the sector's association with warfare.

In recent months, however, ESG fund managers appear to have become increasingly comfortable with holding defense companies.

A spokesperson for Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the wealth fund, declined to comment when asked about calls for a revision of the fund's ethical guidelines.

One of the world's largest investors, Norway's sovereign wealth fund was established in the 1990s to invest the surplus revenues of the country's oil and gas sector. To date, the fund has put money in more than 8,650 companies in over 60 countries around the world.

Hans Andreas Limi, a lawmaker for the Scandinavian country's right-wing Progress Party, recently introduced a private members' bill to remove the fund's nuclear weapons ban, according to The Financial Times. He reportedly described the ban as ""hypocritical.""

Ida Kassa Johannesen, head of commercial ESG at Saxo Bank, said Norway's finance ministry shouldn't be influenced by political pressure to lift the fund's nuclear weapons ban.

""Ultimately the Norwegian ministry of Finance which is responsible for overseeing the work done by Norges Bank Investment Management (which is responsible for the fund's management), has fiduciary duties and will decide the next course of action,"" Johannesen told CNBC via email.

""The ministry actions shouldn't be swayed by public opinions but rather the best interests of the fund's beneficiaries (Norway and its current and future generations) and the laws and regulations that govern the fund's mandate,"" she added.

The U.S. on Wednesday reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Taiwan as China extended to a second day its large-scale military exercises off the coast of the democratically governed island.

""In the face of China's intimidation tactics and destabilizing behavior, the United States' enduring commitment to our allies and partner, including Taiwan, continues,"" Tammy Bruce, U.S. Department of State spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday evening stateside.

China's army, navy and rocket forces on Tuesday launched a joint exercise, with the military describing it as a ""stern warning"" against forces looking to undermine peace in the Taiwan Strait.

""China's aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to exacerbate tensions and put the region's security and the world's prosperity at risk,"" the State Department said, adding that the U.S. ""opposes unilateral changes to the status quo, including through force or coercion.""

Chinese military said it has been practicing assaults on maritime and ground targets and blockade exercises to test the joint operation capabilities of its troops.

On Wednesday, it carried out precision strikes on simulated targets such as ports and energy facilities in the latest exercise code named ""Strait Thunder-2025 A,"" according to PLA's Senior Colonel Shi Yi.

The Defense Ministry in Taipei said it detected 76 aircraft, 15 navy vessels and 4 official ships operating around the island as of 6 a.m. That marked the largest scale of aircraft deployment by PLA since the ""Joint Sword-2024B"" war exercises last October when Taiwan said China used a record number of military aircrafts.

The armed forces in Taiwan have employed aircraft, navy ships and coastal missile systems in response.

Beijing seeks to ""intimidate the Taiwanese by reminding them of China's substantial military power,"" said David Silbey, a professor at Cornell University specializing in military history and policy, adding that the drills will help Beijing prepare for any actual conflict.

The latest maneuvers are viewed by some as signs of Beijing's anger with President Lai. In a speech last month, Lai labelled the mainland as ""foreign hostile forces"" and proposed legal and economic measures to counter Beijing's ""infiltration"" effort in the island.

The delayed timing of the exercises — more than two weeks after the speech — is likely due to a flagship business summit in Beijing over the past two weeks, where Chinese top officials met with multinational firms' executives, analysts at Eurasia Group said in a note.

""An exercise in the Taiwan Strait while foreign CEOs are in town would have produced a chilling effect against Beijing's push to attract foreign investment,"" the advisory firm said.

""Beijing's willingness to moderate cross-strait tensions is eroding,"" the analysts said, cautioning that possibilities for a ""cross-strait crisis"" this year are rising.

China views Taiwan as its own territory — a claim that Taiwan has rejected — and has vowed to retake the island, by force if necessary.

Beijing has held several rounds of military drills around Taiwan and sent fighter jets to enter its airspace since President Lai took office nearly a year ago.

As countries around the world brace for the implementation of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs and with more targeted levies likely impending, the U.K. still hopes it can escape the worse of the import duties.

Britain has touted its far more balanced trading relationship with the U.S. in recent weeks, looking for a more lenient approach from Trump. The White House leader is railing against the States' trade deficits with its biggest trading partners, such as Canada, China, Mexico and the European Union, and has either imposed or threatened (as with the EU) up to 25% tariffs on imports.

The U.K. has a more nuanced commercial relationship with the U.S., with the latest data released in February pointing to almost balanced trade when it comes to the import and exports of goods, along with a surplus over the trade in services.

Keeping Washington sweet is important for Britain — the U.S. was the U.K.'s biggest trading partner in the year to September 2024, accounting for over 17% of total British trade, official data shows.

Trump is seen as having a soft spot for the U.K. and visibly enjoyed a previous state visit to the country. He was recently invited for a second time by King Charles. The president also appears to have a good rapport with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, despite their different ideological backgrounds, and has previously recognized that the U.S.-U.K. trading relationship is less of a problem for him — and stating that he believed a trade deal could be worked out.

Yet Trump's pledge to impose tariffs on ""all countries"" has led to fading hopes in Britain that a specific trade deal with Washington can be worked out before a raft of country-based, sectoral and ""reciprocal"" tariffs are announced by the White House on Wednesday.

A glimmer of hope lingers, however, largely borne from Trump's tendency to oscillate between more lenient and punitive positions.

The Washington Post reported Tuesday that White House aides had drafted a proposal that would levy tariffs of roughly 20% on most imports.

The paper, which cited three people familiar with the matter, noted that advisers cautioned that several options were still on the table, meaning the 20% tariffs may not materialize. Another plan being considered is the country-specific ""reciprocal"" approach, according to the Washington Post. CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Sky News on Tuesday that the UK is ""working hard on an economic deal"" with the U.S. and said ""rapid progress"" has been made but cautioned that a deal could take time.

He conceded that the country was still likely to be subject to new levies, however, with Trump already announcing a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports and on ""all cars that are not made in the United States."" The latter levy came into effect on Wednesday. 

""I don't think anybody wants to see tariffs,"" Starmer told Sky News. ""We're working hard on an economic deal which we've made rapid progress on, and I hope we can make really speedy resolutions on,"" he said.

""The likelihood is there will be tariffs. Nobody welcomes that. We're obviously working with the sectors most impacted at pace on that. Nobody wants to see a trade war. But I have to act in the national interest, and that means that all options have to remain on the table,"" he added.

The U.K.'s Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds insisted to the BBC on Tuesday that ongoing talks with the Trump administration meant Britain was in the ""best possible position of any country"" to have trade duties reversed.

It's still unclear what exactly will be announced on Wednesday, economists note.

""In terms of the upcoming tariff announcement, we still don't know which countries they'll be imposed on and what rate. It's fair to say that the administration might not have the final plan ready as yet,"" Deutsche Bank strategists said in emailed analysis on Tuesday.

""[On Monday], White House Press Secretary Leavitt said a planned Rose Garden announcement would feature ""country-based"" tariffs, with further sectoral duties to come later,"" the analysts added.

The dread of something bad happening is usually more severe than the event itself (such as heading back to work after a holiday).

This could well be the case for U.S. President Donald Trump's wide-ranging tariff plan. Even though Trump initially described it as ""reciprocal tariffs,"" implying that the U.S. would match other countries' import levies, the White House is reportedly considering a 20% charge on most goods and services. The figure sounds high, but is dramatically lower than, for instance, India's tariff on auto imports — which can go up to 70%, according to Times of India.

Investors' worries were slightly assuaged by the news, pushing up stocks. It is, however, too early to let down your guard. Concrete details of Trump's plans are still unclear. Uncertainty is a bargaining chip for Trump; he could unleash a much more brutal tariff regime than expected.

Other times, experiencing something bad could be worse than dreading it (such as when your boss unveils a company-wide restructuring plan).

T-1 to tariffsU.S. President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal tariffs"" will be announced Wednesday and ""be effective immediately,"" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday. Details of Trump's plans are still unclear, but The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the White House is considering tariffs of around 20% on most imports. Trump's plan to reshape global trade comes at a time when the U.S. economy is looking increasingly shaky.

Volatile tradingU.S. markets mostly rose in a choppy trading session Tuesday. The S&P 500 closed 0.38% up, the Nasdaq Composite added 0.87%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a fractional 0.03%. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 index gained 1.07%, receiving a leg up from cooler-than-expected euro zone inflation. Industrial group Thyssenkrupp rose 6% after Kepler Cheuvreux upgraded the stock to ""buy"" from ""hold.""

Shares of CoreWeave jumpCoreWeave's stock popped nearly 42% on Tuesday to close at $52.57, bringing the company to a nearly $25 billion market capitalization. The move follows a lackluster second trading day on the public markets, when shares dropped more than 10% and fell below its initial public offering price of $40. The artificial intelligence cloud company listed Friday in the biggest venture-backed tech IPO for a U.S. company since 2021.

European Union inflation coolsInflation in the euro zone dipped to 2.2% in March on an annual basis, according to flash data from statistics agency Eurostat published Tuesday. That figure is in line with expectations and a touch below the 2.3% final reading in February. Core inflation, which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices, edged lower to 2.4%. March's soft reading boosts expectations of a rate cut by the European Central Bank later this month.

[PRO] 'Avoid the tariff tantrum'The U.S., as the world's biggest economy, drives the finances of many international companies. Trump's tariffs are expected to slam the brakes, at least temporarily, on revenue growth of those firms. But there are three stocks that can ""avoid the tariff tantrum,"" according to one investor.

Stablecoin issuer Circle files for IPO as public markets open to crypto

Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has filed for an initial public offering and plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are serving as lead underwriters, and the company is reportedly aiming for a valuation of up to $5 billion. It will trade under ticker symbol CRCL.

It marks Circle's second attempt at going public. A prior merger with a special purpose acquisition company collapsed in late 2022 amid regulatory challenges. The company's push into public markets reflects a broader moment for the crypto industry, which is enjoying political favor under a more crypto-friendly U.S. administration.

In this article

WASHINGTON — Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg told senators on Wednesday that he's happy with the company's progress improving manufacturing and safety practices following several accidents, including a near catastrophe last year.

Ortberg faced questioning from the Senate Commerce Committee about how the company will ensure that it doesn't repeat past accidents or manufacturing defects, in his first hearing since he became CEO last August, tasked with turning the manufacturer around.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R.-Texas, the committee's chairman, said he wants Boeing to succeed and invited company managers and factory workers to report to him their opinions on its turnaround plan. ""Consider my door open,"" he said.

Ortberg acknowledged the company still has more to do.

""Boeing has made serious missteps in recent years — and it is unacceptable. In response, we have made sweeping changes to the people, processes, and overall structure of our company,"" Ortberg said in his testimony. ""While there is still work ahead of us, these profound changes are underpinned by the deep commitment from all of us to the safety of our products and services.""

Boeing executives have worked for years to put the lasting impact of two fatal crashes of its best-selling Max plane behind it. 

Ortberg said Boeing is in discussions with the Justice Department for a revised plea agreement stemming from a federal fraud charge in the development of Boeing's best-selling 737 Maxes. The previous plea deal, reached last July, was later rejected by a federal judge, who last month set a trial date for June 23 if a new deal isn't reached.

Boeing had agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to defraud the U.S. government, pay up to $487.2 million and install a corporate monitor at the company for three years.

""We're in the process right now of going back with the DOJ and coming up with an alternate agreement,"" Ortberg said during the hearing. ""I want this resolved as fast as anybody. We're still in discussions and hopefully we'll have a new agreement here soon.""

Asked by Sen. Maria Cantwell, the ranking Democrat on the committee, whether he had an issue with having a corporate monitor, Ortberg replied: ""I don't personally have a problem, no.""

Ortberg and other Boeing executives have recently outlined improvements across the manufacturer's production lines, such as reducing defects and risks from so-called traveled works, or doing tasks out of sequence, in recent months, as well as wins like a contract worth more than $20 billion to build the United States' next generation fighter jet.

But lawmakers and regulators have maintained heightened scrutiny on the company, a top U.S. exporter.

""Boeing has been a great American manufacturer and all of us should want to see it thrive,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and chairman of the committee, said in a statement in February announcing the hearing. ""Given Boeing's past missteps and problems, the flying public deserves to hear what changes are being made to rehabilitate the company's tarnished reputation.""

The Federal Aviation Administration last year capped Boeing's production of its 737 Max planes at 38 a month following the January 2024 door plug blowout. The agency plans to keep that limit in place, though Boeing is producing below that level.

Ortberg said at the hearing Wednesday that the company could work up to production rate of 38 Max planes a month or even higher sometime this year, but said Boeing wouldn't push it if the production line isn't stable.

Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau said at a Senate hearing last week that the agency's oversight of the company ""extends to ongoing monitoring of Boeing's manufacturing practices, maintenance procedures, and software updates.""

Correction: Chris Rocheleau is acting FAA administrator. An earlier version misstated his title.

This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets.

Asia-Pacific markets were mixed Wednesday as investors brace for U.S. President Donald Trump to roll out fresh tariffs this week.

Japan's Nikkei 225 traded 0.28% higher to close at 35,725.87 while the Topix declined 0.43% to close at 2,650.29. South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.62% to close at 2,505.86 and the small-cap Kosdaq lost 0.95% to close at 684.85.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 traded 0.12% higher to close at 7,934.5.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index traded flat to close at 23,205.15 while mainland China's CSI 300 slipped 0.08% to end the trading day at 3,884.39.

India's Nifty 50 gained 0.45%.

U.S. stock futures slipped as Wall Street awaits the expected rollout of President Donald Trump's tariffs on Wednesday.

Overnight in the U.S., the three major averages closed mixed. The S&P 500 added 0.38% to close at 5,633.07 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.87% and ended at 17,449.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 11.80 points, or 0.03%, to settle at 41,989.96

While markets are likely to be volatile in the near term, UBS analysts expect news flow to become ""more positive"" toward the second half of the year.

""We think investors can use market swings to build long-term exposure. Investors should therefore consider taking advantage of market dips to buy into broad U.S. equities and companies exposed to AI,"" the investment bank wrote in a note.

— CNBC's Brian Evans and Lisa Kailai Han contributed to this report.

India's 10-year benchmark government bond yield slid to its lowest level since January 2022, data from LSEG showed.

""Foreign funds are getting confident of rupee stability as well as India's macro-economic stability,"" said Anuj Tagra, vice president and portfolio manager of Franklin Templeton's India Fixed Income team.

""Market expectations of RBI's push to focus on growth through rate cuts and infusion of liquidity into the system has brought back attractiveness of debt as an asset class with the foreign investors.""

—Lee Ying Shan

Brent crude prices have climbed back to around $74 amid growing geopolitical concerns tied to potential U.S. actions that may impact oil exports from Venezuela and Iran, noted Citi.

This marks a reversal of the sell-off in early March which notched oil prices down to $69, largely thanks to OPEC+'s announcement to begin easing production cuts in April and rising fears of U.S. tariffs, Citi's analysts wrote.

However, the rally will ""struggle to hold,"" as a result of macroeconomic uncertainties, Fitch Solutions' research unit BMI said. 

""While U.S. President Donald Trump's approach to tariffs has been somewhat erratic, effective tariff rates are rising globally, raising concerns for the health of the global economy and, consequently, the demand for oil,"" said BMI analysts.

Brent futures last inched up 0.04% to $74.51 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate rose $0.04 to $71.23 a barrel. 

—Lee Ying Shan

Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has reportedly warned that U.S. tariffs will have a huge impact on global trade.Speaking to Japan's parliament, his comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to roll out reciprocal tariffs on April 2 stateside, as well as auto tariffs on April 3.In Asia, Japanese automakers are expected to see the most pain from the auto tariffs, with experts telling CNBC Toyota could be the worst hit.

— Lim Hui Jie, Reuters

Thailand's commerce ministry said the country's semiconductor exports could face 25% tariffs from the U.S., and that potential U.S. tariffs could cost the country between $7 billion and $8 billion.

The Thai baht lost 0.2% to trade at 34.22 against the dollar, marking the weakest since February 28, data from LSEG showed.

—Lee Ying Shan

Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.47% to its lowest since September, data from FactSet showed, as investors brace for U.S. President Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs.

Index heavyweight SoftBank slipped 2.22%, while telecom company Kddi, which has the fifth largest weightage in the index, fell 1.68%. Sumitomo Pharma led losses, down 4.4%. 

Japan's Topix declined 1.08%.

— Lee Ying Shan

Shares of Japan and Korean automakers declined after rebounding on Tuesday.

Nissan, which has three plants in Mexico, declined 2.43%. Toyota and Honda fell 0.74% and 0.74% respectively. Mazda Motor lost over 0.51%.

South Korea's Kia Motors, which has a manufacturing plant in Mexico, slipped 0.75%.

—Lee Ying Shan

South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service Governor Lee Bok-hyun wants to step down, local media outlets reported.

""When I told the Chairman of the Financial Services Commission, the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs and the Governor of the Bank of Korea also contacted me and told me that the market situation is very difficult and that I should not act rashly,"" Lee reportedly said on a news show.

South Korea's inflation climbed 2.1% year-on-year in March, higher than the 2% seen in February.

This was also higher than the 2% rise expected by economists polled by Reuters.

Core inflation in the country — which strips out prices of food and energy — increased 1.9% compared to the same period last year.

— Lim Hui Jie

The S&P 500 closed higher on Tuesday in yet another volatile session that saw the broad market index seesaw between gains and losses, as investors anxiously await the rollout of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The S&P 500 added 0.38% to finish the session at 5,633.07, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.87% to 17,449.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 11.80 points, or 0.03%, to close at 41,989.96.

— Brian Evans

Christopher Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, said he remains constructive on the long-term outlook for stocks, but warned investors not to underestimate the potential risks around the April 2nd tariff announcement. 

""We remain constructive on equities longer term given: (1) potential monetary stimulus (i.e., 75+ bps of 2025 Fed rate cuts) starting by mid-year; (2) anticipated tax bill movement (and possible enactment) this summer; and (3) several uber-caps already look oversold (TSLA, AVGO, NVDA),"" Harvey wrote Tuesday. 

""However, the risks are not small and recession is possible. We are worried most about the potential unintended consequences of aggressive tariff moves,"" Harvey said. 

— Sarah Min

Israel announced a major expansion of military operations in Gaza on Wednesday, saying large areas of the enclave would be seized and added to its security zones, accompanied by large-scale evacuations of the population.

In a statement, Defence Minister Israel Katz said evacuations would take place from areas where there was fighting, while urging Gazans to eliminate Hamas and return Israeli hostages as the only way to end the war.

He said the operation would clear out militants and infrastructure ""and seize large areas that will be added to the security zones of the State of Israel"".

The Israeli military had already issued evacuation warnings to Gazans living around the southern city of Rafah and towards the city of Khan Younis, telling them to move to the Al-Mawasi area on the shore, previously designated a humanitarian zone.

Israel's Army Radio said the 36th division, sent to the Southern Command area last month to prepare for operations in Gaza, would take part in the operation, which came after a wave of strikes was reported overnight.

The Palestinian civil defense agency said at least 12 bodies had been recovered by its teams in Khan Younis and Palestinian radio reported that the area around Rafah was almost completely empty following the evacuation orders.

Katz's statement did not make clear how much land Israel intends to seize or whether the move represented a permanent annexation of territory, which would add further pressure on a population in Gaza already living in one of the most crowded areas in the world.

According to the Israeli rights group Gisha, Israel has already taken control of some 62 square kilometres or around 17% of the total area of Gaza, as part of a buffer zone around the edges of the enclave.

Seizing the buffer zone, which contains infrastructure including wells, sewage pumping stations, and wastewater treatment facilities as well as a significant part of Gaza's agricultural land, would also increase pressure on the enclave's ability to sustain itself.

At the same time, Israeli leaders have said they plan to facilitate voluntary departure of Palestinians from the enclave, after U.S. President Donald Trump called for it to be permanently evacuated and redeveloped as a coastal resort under U.S. control.

Katz's remarks came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated calls for Hamas to disarm and said the application of military pressure was the best way to get back the remaining 59 hostages.

Israeli leaders have been encouraged by signs of protest in Gaza against Hamas, the militant group which has controlled the enclave since 2007, and the expanded operation appeared at least partly aimed at increasing civilian pressure on its leaders.

""I call on the residents of Gaza to act now to eliminate Hamas and return all the kidnapped,"" Katz said in his statement, which added that the operation would clear the area of militants and their infrastructure.

""This is the only way to end the war,"" Katz said.

Israel resumed air strikes on Gaza last month and sent ground troops back in, after two months of relative calm following the conclusion of a U.S.-backed truce to allow the exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.

Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since the resumption of the strikes and Israel has also cut off aid to the enclave, saying much of the material going in was taken by Hamas and used for its own members.

Efforts led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to get talks aimed at ending the war back on track have so far failed to make progress and the military's return to Gaza has fuelled protests in Israel by families and supporters of the hostages.

On Wednesday, the Hostage Families' Forum, which represents the families of some of the hostages, said it was ""horrified"" to wake up to news of the expanded operation and said Israel's priority had to be the return of its hostages.

As the operation in Gaza has escalated, Israel has also hit targets in southern Lebanon and Syria, with a strike on a Hezbollah commander in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Tuesday that further strained fraying ceasefire agreements which largely halted fighting in January.

In addition, Israeli troops are still carrying out a major operation in the occupied West Bank, which the military says is aimed at destroying Iranian-backed militant groups in the area's refugee camps.

Israel invaded Gaza following the devastating attack on communities in southern Israel by thousands of Hamas-led gunmen that killed 1,200 people according to Israeli tallies, and saw 251 taken as hostages into Gaza.

The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, and ravaged the Gaza Strip forcing almost the entire population of 2.3 million from their homes, leaving hundreds of thousands in tents and improvised shelters.

A key Kremlin negotiator is expected in Washington this week for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, two sources familiar with the plan said, the most senior Russian official to visit since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.

Kirill Dmitriev, the chief of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, who was appointed by President Vladimir Putin as special investment and international economic envoy, will meet with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Another source said that Dmitriev will meet Witkoff on Wednesday.

Their meeting was reported earlier by CNN, which said Dmitriev and Witkoff will hold talks about strengthening relations between the two countries as they seek to end the war in Ukraine.

""Maybe. The resistance to US–Russia dialogue is real—driven by entrenched interests and old narratives,"" Dmitriev said in a post on X responding to the CNN report.

""But what if improved relations are exactly what the world needs for lasting global security and peace.""

The White House and the U.S. Department of State did not immediately provide comment. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dmitriev's trip comes as Trump is seeking to meet with Putin soon to work on mending damaged relations and follows recent telephone calls between the two leaders that also focused on reaching a peace deal for Ukraine.

But as Trump appears to be growing increasingly impatient with what he has suggested might be Moscow's foot-dragging over a wider Ukraine peace deal and saying he was ""pissed off"" with Putin, Dmitriev's tip may also de-escalate some of the tensions.

After being hit by Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine and capitalizing on Trump's comments about repairing relations, Russia is keen to bring back international investors to diversify its economy driven chiefly by the war in the past three years.

As Dmitriev is still under U.S. sanctions, CNN reported that the Trump administration temporarily lifted the sanctions for his visit.

Dmitriev, considered the most U.S.-savvy member of Russia's elite, has said earlier this week that the two countries have already started talking a joint rare earth metals project, among other deals.

Putin suggested in February that the United States might be interested in exploring joint exploration for the deposits in Russia. Russia has the world's fifth-largest reserves of the metals used in lasers and military equipment.

Russia has also been keen to attract investors to help develop its Arctic region, Dmitriev said last week. Putin wants commerce ramped up via the Northern Sea Route through Arctic waters as Russia shifts trade towards Asia and away from Europe because of Western sanctions.

Focus on the strategic importance of the Arctic for mining, shipping and international security has increased sharply because of repeated statements by Trump that he wants to acquire Greenland.

AppLovin is one of the companies in negotiations to potentially acquire TikTok, sources familiar with the situation told CNBC's David Faber on Wednesday.

The Trump administration, which has been trying to shepherd a deal to shift control of the Chinese-owned app to an American company, is ""fully aware"" of AppLovin's interest in TikTok, the sources said. 

Faber said, based on his reporting, that it's unclear whether any of the U.S. parties interested in TikTok will be able to take control of the non-Chinese part of the company's business.

AppLovin shares briefly popped around 5% following the news, but have since given up most of those gains. AppLovin didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

TikTok could be effectively banned in the U.S. on April 5, because of a national security law originally signed by former President Joe Biden that requires Chinese parent ByteDance to divest the app's American operations. ByteDance originally faced a Jan. 19 deadline to sell TikTok, but Trump signed an executive order instructing the attorney general to not enforce the law, granting the company 75 more days to unload the U.S. portion of its business.

WATCH: AppLovin is the latest bidder of TikTok; decision could be made today, reports say

In this article

The Trump administration will implement a 25% tariff of all imported canned beer and empty aluminum cans starting Friday, according to a notice from the Department of Commerce.

The expansion of U.S. aluminum tariffs comes shortly before President Donald Trump is expected to announce sweeping new levies on imported goods at a Rose Garden event at 4 p.m. ET.

Industry analysts expect the tariffs on canned beer imports to weigh most heavily on Constellation Brands. Constellation imports all of its beer from Mexico, including Modelo and Corona; beer accounted for 82% of the company's sales in its most recent quarter. While Corona is best known for coming in glass bottles, Modelo — the bestselling beer in the U.S. — most commonly comes in cans.

Constellation's shares were down less than 1% in afternoon trading on Wednesday, but concerns about tariffs have weighed on the stock for months. The company's shares have fallen 22% since Trump's election in November.

The updated notice for aluminum tariffs published on Wednesday does not mention levies for imported beer packaged in glass bottles. Aluminum cans accounted for 64.1% of beer distribution in 2023, compared with glass bottles' 26.9% share, according to the Beer Institute.

For years, canned beer has been gaining market share against its bottled counterpart. Brewers can produce and transport cans more easily than glass bottles, which are heavier, leading to cheaper prices on canned beer for consumers.

The U.S. imports most of its aluminum from Canada. China and Mexico, the two other main targets of Trump's trade ire, are also major exporters of aluminum to the U.S.

Gold prices rose towards their record high on Wednesday, supported by safe-haven demand as markets braced for U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariff plans later in the day.

Spot gold was up 0.4% at $3,123.05 an ounce. U.S. gold futures settled 0.6% higher at $3,166.20.

""Risks remain that tariffs could stoke inflation, which has buoyed gold prices. While a U.S. recession is not our base-case scenario, the risk of such has helped maintain strong interest in gold as a safe haven,"" said Standard Chartered analyst Suki Cooper.

""If the tariffs are not as extensive as feared, some positioning could be unwound in gold, in which case the physical market floor will be key in setting the downside.""

Trump, who has been promoting April 2 as ""Liberation Day,"" is expected to introduce sweeping new tariffs on multiple countries at 4 p.m. EDT during an event at the White House.

The U.S. president has said his reciprocal tariff plans aim to equalize the comparatively lower U.S. tariff rates with those imposed by other nations.

""A breach of resistance at $3,147.41/$3,149.84 would bode well for a push to $3,200, and lend confidence to bullish outlooks that highlight $3,300 and $3,500,"" said Peter Grant, vice president and senior metals strategist at Zaner Metals.

Gold, often used as a safe store of value during times of political and financial uncertainty, has risen more than $500 so far in 2025 and hit a record peak of $3,148.88 on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed U.S. private payrolls growth accelerated in March. The biggest jobs data this week will come on Friday with the release of the monthly U.S. employment report.

Among other metals, spot silver was little changed at $33.73, while platinum dropped 0.9% to $970.25 and palladium was down 1.1% to $973.04.

Fidelity Investments rolled out an IRA plan that invests directly in crypto on Wednesday, giving investors another method for tapping this asset class.



The brokerage firm offers bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) to any U.S. citizen over the age of 18. The assets are custodied by Fidelity Digital Assets and held in a cold wallet. The crypto IRA product has no fees, and customers can invest in a Roth IRA, traditional IRA or rollover IRA, according to Fidelity's website.



The new product comes as financial advisors are increasingly offering crypto to their clients. A survey by TMX Vetta Fi recently showed that 57% of advisors plan on increasing their allocations into crypto ETFs, although their biggest focus is in crypto equity ETFs.



“Fidelity is committed to offering investment products and solutions to meet the changing needs and interests of our customers, accompanied by education and support,” a spokesperson told CoinDesk.



Clients of the brokerage firm have increasingly voiced interest in a tax-advantaged way to trade and hold crypto, a person familiar with the matter, said.



Fidelity already offers a number of crypto exchange-traded funds, which let investors track the prices of digital assets without directly investing in them. The company recently filed to list a Solana ETF on the Cboe Exchange.

UPDATE (April 2, 16:15 UTC): Corrects first paragraph to state that the plan was introduced on Wednesday, not Thursday, and clarifies that assets are custodied by Fidelity Digital Assets.

Justin Sun bailed out Techteryx's TrueUSD stablecoin after nearly half a billion dollars of its reserves were rendered illiquid, people close to the matter confirmed, and the stablecoin issuer said in Hong Kong court documents.

After acquiring TrueUSD from TrueCoin in December 2020, Techteryx appointed First Digital Trust (FDT), a Hong Kong-based fiduciary, to manage its stablecoin reserves.

According to documents prepared by U.S. law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel, FDT was instructed to invest the reserves in the Aria Commodity Finance Fund (Aria CFF), a Cayman Islands-registered vehicle. However, court filings allege that approximately $456 million was instead improperly diverted into Aria Commodities DMCC, a separate, unauthorized entity based in Dubai.

Court documents identify Matthew Brittain as controlling Aria Commodity Finance Fund (Aria CFF) through Aria Capital Management Ltd and Cecilia Brittain as the sole shareholder of the separately owned Dubai-based entity Aria Commodities DMCC.

However, emails from Aria's Matthew Brittan are signed with an address in Dubai.

Court documents say that Cecilia is Matthew's wife.

ARIA DMCC engages in trade finance, asset development, and commodity trading, while ARIA CFF finances commodity traders, including ARIA DMCC and third parties, according to Matthew Brittain, who described the relationship between the two companies in an email to CoinDesk.

Attestations produced by Moore CPA Limited show, first published by Protos, that FDT managed $501 million of TrueUSD's reserves by November 2024.

Hong Kong court filings also say Vincent Chok, First Digital's CEO, allegedly directed around $15.5 million in undisclosed commissions to an entity called ""Glass Door"" and separately structured approximately $456 million in unauthorized trade finance loans from FDT to Aria DMCC, later retroactively mischaracterizing them as legitimate fund investments in actions plaintiffs describe as fraudulent misrepresentation and misappropriation.

""The remittances to Aria DMCC were blatant misappropriation and money-laundering,"" a statement of claim reads. ""They were made without the knowledge, authorization or approval of the Plaintiff.""

These statements have not been tried in court as of press time.

Aria DMCC invested funds in global projects that they described as relatively illiquid, such as manufacturing plants, mining operations, maritime vessels, port infrastructure, and renewable energy ventures.

When Techteryx attempted to redeem its investments from Aria CFF between mid-2022 and early 2023 it received little or no funds back, with Aria entities allegedly defaulting on payments and failing to fulfill redemption requests, the court documents say.

Techteryx then took full operational control of TUSD in July 2023, after TrueCoin terminated its involvement. As part of a transitional period following the December 2020 sale, TrueCoin continued running the day-to-day operations of TUSD.

According to the complaint Cahill prepared for the U.S. DOJ, Sun stepped in around this time to provide emergency liquidity support, which was structured as a loan.

The Techteryx team then quarantined 400 million TUSD so that retail redemptions could continue and token holders wouldn't be affected, despite the stablecoin issuer's empty coffers, the court filings said.

In response to a request for comment from CoinDesk, First Digital's Chok, categorically denied any wrongdoing or participation in fraudulent schemes.

Chok told CoinDesk that First Digital Trust acted strictly as a fiduciary intermediary, executing transactions precisely according to instructions provided by Techteryx and its representatives. He asserted that his company was not responsible for independently evaluating or advising on these investment decisions.

""It is our understanding that one of the main blockers voiced by ARIA for early redemptions of funds (as requested by Techteryx) has been their AML/KYC concerns regarding the deal between TrueCoin and Techteryx and the true identity of the ultimate beneficial owner of Techteryx,"" Chok said in an email to CoinDesk, adding that he believed nobody named in the case considers Aria illiquid.

""We have not yet had the opportunity to fully defend ourselves,"" Chok said in an email to CoinDesk. ""We are fully committed to clarifying these matters in due course as the legal and arbitration process continues.""

Aria Group's Matthew Brittain said to CoinDesk that he ""completely rejects Techteryx's claims against ARIA DMCC and any related entities,"" adding that ""a number of false allegations were made in the court proceedings.""

Techteryx was fully aware of term commitments, Brittain said, and these were outlined in contracts that subscribers have agreed to when investing in ARIA CFF, which are clearly set out in the Offering Memorandum.

Brittain also echoed Chok's concerns about Techteryx's beneficial ownership, pointing to Wall Street Journal coverage of the topic.

The Hong Kong writ identifies Li Jinmei as the ultimate beneficial owner of Techteryx. A spokesperson for Techteryx confirmed that this is not the same person as Jennifer Yiyang — the previous ultimate beneficial owner of the company — despite some media reporting to the contrary.

""The subscriber has not resolved these issues,"" Brittain continued, referring to the beneficial ownership concerns.

While this was happening, TUSD's challenges continued in the form of a collapsing banking partner and regulatory scrutiny in the U.S.

In mid-2023, Prime Trust, an independent crypto custodian based in Nevada that is not connected to this case, but which TrueUSD used for its fiat ramps, was put into receivership by state regulators.

State regulators alleged Prime Trust had improperly used customer funds to cover withdrawal requests, raising serious concerns about its financial stability.

Court filings from Nevada showed that Prime Trust owed around $85 million in fiat obligations with only about $3 million available.

This wasn't the last headache for the stablecoin issuer.

In September 2024, TrueCoin and TrustToken (the stablecoin's owners before Techteryx) settled with the SEC over allegations they falsely marketed TrueUSD as fully dollar-backed while secretly investing reserves in risky offshore funds.

Without admitting wrongdoing, or detailing the nature of their offshore investments with Aria's companies, both TrueCoin and TrustToken agreed to pay civil penalties and disgorge profits to the tune of just over $500,000 to resolve charges of fraud and unregistered securities offerings.

For his part, Aria's Brittain said that investing in Aria wasn't the right move to begin with for a stablecoin's reserves.

""ARIA CFF has never held [its] strategy out as highly liquid, or appropriate for the reserves of a stablecoin,"" he said in an email. CORRECTION (April 2, 2025, 16:09 UTC): Corrects reference to court filing versus Department of Justice filing.CORRECTION (April 2, 2025 16:09 UTC): Corrects amount of loans made between Glass Door and FDT.

The spot bitcoin ETFs saw sizable inflows in the first quarter despite the lame price action and at least one analyst sees the next three months as even bigger even if the prices don't recover.



“Even if current market conditions persist in the second quarter, we are seeing strong traction from financial advisors and institutional investors,"" said Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise (whose BITB is among the bitcoin ETFs).



""While retail interest is weak due to the fixation on price action, professional investors are recognizing the global adoption momentum spurred by the Trump administration's embrace of bitcoin, and many are seeing these market conditions as an opportunity to start or increase an allocation,"" Leon added.



The ETFs saw over $1 billion in inflows in the first quarter of the year despite a challenging macro situation that sent the S&P 500 Index into its biggest quarterly loss since 2022 and bitcoin's 13% plunge.



Leon expects inflows to be even stronger in the second quarter — as much as $3 billion or even more as wirehouse platforms unlock and legislative policy progresses.



ETF inflows possibly less than meets the eye



The $1 billion in first quarter net flows — and whatever the second quarter brings — doesn't necessarily reflect investor interest in buying the bitcoin dip. That's because of the so-called basis trade (also known as cash-and-carry). In this, institutional players buy the spot bitcoin ETF while shorting CME bitcoin futures, picking up yield without exposure to price movement.



That yield was well into the double-digits in late 2024 and remained nicely above the risk-free rate throughout much of the first quarter. It's collapsed to the 5% area of late, suggesting arbitrage-related ETF inflows may dry up.



Back to bull case: It's still early



“While a favorable price environment would certainly be a boost, it's important to remember that adoption of spot bitcoin ETFs by these groups is still in its infancy,"" said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, who is also bullish on the outlook for inflows throughout the rest of the year.. ""As they grow more comfortable allocating to bitcoin, this should provide a meaningful tailwind for inflows,” he added..,



While many institutions have indeed already made their first allocations into bitcoin in the past year, it represents only a small fraction of ETF investment, with most of the money still coming from retail investors — something recently noted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, whose IBIT is the asset-gathering leader among the spot ETFs. The more favorable regulatory stance toward the industry, not to mention the government's own potential allocation into bitcoin, however, means that ratio could soon shift significantly.



During an ETF conference in Las Vegas earlier this month, a survey showed that 57% of advisors plan on increasing their allocations into crypto ETFs this year as crypto has lost its “reputational risk” attribute among advisors.



The view that bitcoin could serve as a “safe haven” in times of an economic decline, which investors remain anxious about, could also boost confidence in the asset, especially as fears of a potential recession grow.



“If we see continued rate cut expectations, signs of economic uncertainty, or deepening fears of a potential recession in the US, Bitcoin's role as 'digital gold' will likely support additional inflows,” said David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets. “While some short-term traders may rotate out if price weakness persists, long-term players will continue to keep inflows strong, especially as institutional adoption takes off and drives demand throughout the year.""

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) may be well off their frothy heights, but don't tell that to Jupiter. Solana's top DeFi exchange just brought digital collectibles platform DRiP Haus into its orbit.



The acquisition is part of Jupiter's push to become what Jupiter's Kash Dhanda calls the ""Solana super app:"" a home not only for traders of financial instruments like swaps and perps, but for digital culture connoisseurs too.



""We don't believe it,"" Dhanda said of the NFT doomsayers. ""We think NFTs are here for the long term.""



Built from the bricks of the short-lived Solana store, DRiP Haus survived the NFT market's brutal downturn as a digital collectibles distribution hub. Instead of trading it focuses on disseminating: Startups across Solanaland spin up and send out their visual campaigns on DRiP, according to Dhanda, who estimates it now creates the vast majority of Solana NFTs that ""aren't spam.""



Dhanda and DRiP Labs founder Vibhu Norby both declined to state how much Jupiter paid in the all-cash deal. A person familiar with the deal estimated it at two times the funds raised. The startup previously raised $11.5 million from venture investors.



Jupiter co-founder Meow hinted at the acquisition in late February during his campaign to defer a multi-million dollar token payday, which yields more JUP for him later while funding token incentive programs for acqui-hired teams now. Norby confirmed his team will be getting tokens from the incentives program.



Half of DRiP's eight-person team will continue working on the distribution platform, while the other half will focus on bolstering Jupiter's currently nonexistent NFT capabilities, most critically by adding a swaps router to the DeFi exchange's homepage.



Norby will oversee DRiP from an ""executive, strategic point of view"" from within Jupiter. While the DRiP brand will remain separate, Norby said its visual identity will be reworked to align more closely with the new mothership. He's also working on building a ""really, really excellent NFT experience"" within Jupiter's mobile app.

FDUSD, the stablecoin issued by Hong Kong-based First Digital, has wobbled from its $1 price peg as investor concerns mounted over its reserves, though the company said Wednesday that it was ""completely solvent.""



FDUSD has dropped to 0.87 against Tether's USDT stablecoin and 0.76 against Circle's USDC on Binance, the main exchange where FDUSD is listed. Notably, bitcoin (BTC) also nearly hit 100,000 against FDUSD. The token has stabilized around $0.98-$0.96 later, still trading below its supposed price anchor.





The sudden price action happened as CoinDesk earlier Wednesday reported that some of the TrueUSD stablecoin's reserve assets were stuck in illiquid investments, according to filings. Tron founder Justin Sun bailed out the issuer company. First Digital Trust, a trust company affiliated to First Digital, was appointed to manage TUSD reserves. 



""First Digital Trust (FDT) is effectively insolvent and unable to fulfill client fund redemptions. I strongly recommend that users take immediate action to secure their assets,"" Tron founder Justin Sun claimed in a Wednesday X post. First Digital refuted the allegations in an X post, saying that ""First Digital is completely solvent"" and ""every dollar backing FDUSD is completely, secure, safe and accounted for with US backed T-Bills.""



""This is a typical Justin Sun smear campaign to try to attack a competitor to his business. As we told the reporter at CoinDesk, we have not yet had the opportunity to defend ourselves and instead of letting the TUSD matter be dealt with in court, Justin has instead resorted to a coordinated social media effort to try to damage FDUSD as a business competitor,"" the company said. ""FDT will pursue legal action to protect its rights and reputation.""FDUSD's latest monthly reserve report showed that the $2 billion of reserve assets were held mostly in U.S. Treasury bills and a lesser part in repo facilities and fixed deposits.Stablecoin analytics firm Bluechip told CoinDesk it gave FDUSD a C grade (on a scale from F as least safe to to A+ being safest) and expressed concerns over reserve assets being bankruptcy remote from the issuer company.""FDUSD appears to be backed by reasonably sound reserves. But we concluded that in case of bankruptcy, the reserves could be used to pay off the parent company's debt,"" Garett Jones, Bluechip's chief economist, said in a message. ""It's hard to predict what would really happen in a crisis, but safer stablecoins do exist.""



UPDATE (Apr. 2, 17:58): Added analyst comment from Bluechip. Updated FDUSD price action.

The Bitcoin-Japanese yen (BTC/JPY) pair faced a setback at key trendline resistance Wednesday, as Goldman Sachs (GS) cited the anti-risk yen as the leading hedge against rising U.S. tariff and recession risks.

The BTC/JPY trading on the Japan-based bitFlyer fell 1% after failing to take out the trendline drawn off the record high reached on Jan. 20, data from charting platform TradingView show.

BTC's USD-denominated price faced similar losses. Meanwhile, Asian equity indices and the U.S. equity futures treaded water ahead of President Donald Trump's sweeping new “Liberation Day” reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday that could trigger a global trade war.

The tariff uncertainty has spurred several investment banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, pencil in a higher chance of U.S. recession or consecutive quarterly contractions in the growth rate.

Some crypto observers expect investors to treat bitcoin (BTC) as a haven asset should a tariff-led economic swoon materialize. Goldman, however, sees the Japanese yen, a long-preferred safe haven, as the top hedge against U.S. risks.

""The yen offers investors the best currency hedge should the chances of a US recession increase,"" Kamakshya Trivedi, head of global foreign exchange, interest rates and emerging market strategy at Goldman Sachs, said late Tuesday, according to Bloomberg.

Trivedi added that the yen is also a ""very good hedge"" against U.S. labor market weakness and tends to do best when U.S. real rates [inflation-adjusted yields] and U.S. equities fall together.

While BTC is widely seen as a digital gold or haven asset by crypto market participants, the cryptocurrency has historically moved in tandem with technology stocks. In other words, tariffs-led risk-off on Wall Street could spill over into the crypto market.

Additionally, the yen's strength could prompt the unwinding of risk-on bullish trades financed by inexpensive yen-denominated loans, contributing to overall risk aversion in financial markets. The crypto market experienced this in early August last year when the yen carry trade unravelled, leading to declines in both stocks and BTC. During that period, bitcoin plummeted from approximately $65K to $50K within a week.

Goldman expects the Japanese yen to rise to the low 140s against the U.S. dollar this year. The USD/JPY pair traded at 149.77 at press time. The exchange rate is known to closely track the differential between yields on the 10-year U.S. and Japanese bonds.

The latter recently dropped to its lowest since August 2022, offering yen-bullish cues.

So far, crypto markets haven't behaved as expected under the Trump Administration. Investors hoped that regulatory reform and policies like a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve would drive prices appreciably higher. But it's been the opposite. Bitcoin has fallen from highs well above $100,000 at the beginning of the year to a trough in the mid-80,000s for most of March.



Crypto prices have suffered from being increasingly correlated with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, which have been hit by macroeconomic uncertainty. Tariffs — surcharges the U.S. places on imports from other countries — have Wall Street worried about a global recession. Crypto investors have been steering clear of crypto assets, which are seen as relatively risky. 



“This is all about markets' ‘risk appetite' which continues to deteriorate, and for the time being drives a wedge between crypto assets and gold, which continues to be the ‘safe haven' of choice,” said Marc Ostwald, Chief Economist & Global Strategist at ADM Investor Services International.



“[That's] in no small part driven by central bank FX reserve managers, who are seeking to reduce USD exposure, which has long been a source of concern to them.”



As the global financial and trade system becomes more fragmented, investors are seeking alternatives to riskier assets, including dollars. For now, that means turning to gold, which is up 18% year-to-date.



But that could change, said Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and author of ""The Story of the Blockchain: A Beginner's Guide to the Technology That Nobody Understands."" Bitcoin could be the new gold soon enough. 



“I think the entire [future] is uncertain and in some ways unknowable, because there are many crosscurrents and both crypto and tariffs are new. Some people argue that crypto is just a risk-on tech asset and would sell off due to tariffs. But bitcoin has found footing in some circles as ‘digital gold' and the physical variety is soaring on the tariff news. So which will it be?”



In other words, economic uncertainty could lead investors to seek out bitcoin just as they have sought out gold in recent months.



Another note of positivity: the impact of tariffs on crypto could be “priced in” and the worst might be over already, said Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, a leading crypto asset management firm. 



President Trump is due to announce U.S. tariffs on Wednesday, April 2, at 4 p.m. ET—what's known as “Liberation Day.” According to reports, he'll lay out “reciprocal tariffs” against 15 countries that have levied tariffs against the U.S., including China, Canada and Mexico.

Pandl estimates tariffs have so far taken 2% off economic growth this year. But Liberation Day might actually stop the worst of the pain felt in financial markets. “If we see an announcement [on Wednesday] that is tough but phased, and focused on the 15 countries they seem to be targeting, my expectation is that markets will rally on that news,” Pandl told CoinDesk. 

“Potentially once we get through this announcement, crypto markets can focus back on the fundamentals which are very positive.”



Pandl said announcements like Circle's IPO wouldn't be happening if institutions didn't have a high degree of confidence in the digital assets sector and the policies around it.



Moreover, Pandl, a former macro-economist at Goldman Sachs, believes that tariffs will increase the appetite for currencies that aren't dollars.



“I think tariffs will weaken the dominant role of the dollar and create space for competitors including bitcoin. Prices have gone down in the short run. But the first few months of the Trump Administration have raised my conviction in the longer term for bitcoin as a global monetary asset.”



Pendl still believes that bitcoin will hit new all-time highs this year, despite current pessimism around prices. “I wouldn't have quit my Wall Street job if I didn't think bitcoin will be the winner in the long term,” he said.

XRP, the token closely related to Ripple Labs, is showing signs of a potential breakout as its price chart forms a symmetrical triangle pattern alongside other bullish technical indicators.

XRP has been consolidating within the pattern shown below, characterized by two converging trend lines that suggest a buildup of momentum. Technical analysis from well-followed X user @DefendDark indicates that a breakout from this formation could propel XRP toward a short-term target of $6.

The symmetrical triangle has been forming over recent weeks, with XRP's price action tightening as it approaches the apex of the triangle. This setup, commonly observed in crypto markets, often precedes a sharp move — either upward or downward — depending on the direction of the breakout.

#XRP is heavily compressing. This breakout will create many new millionaires! pic.twitter.com/IIT3XMaMxy

Fibonacci retracement analysis further supports this outlook, identifying $2.04 as a key support level and $2.2 as a critical resistance. A break above $2.2 could confirm the bullish trend, potentially driving XRP toward the $5 to $8 range in the mid term, per @DarkDefend.

Hi all! I hope you are well! #XRP has touched our lowest Fibonacci level. As stated, $2.222 is the key level and should be broken upwards.We set $2.04 as our last Fibonacci level, and we can visit there again! April-May will be hot, and our Targets of Wave 5 stand at… pic.twitter.com/j2JunirCkN

The Elliott Wave framework forecasts price movements in five distinct “waves” based on repeating price patterns, called ""waves."" The five-wave pattern reflects growing optimism, while the three-wave correction shows profit-taking or pessimism. These waves are driven by collective investor psychology and can occur across different timeframes and are considered by followers to be a way to map market behavior.

As such, a bullish technical outlook coincides with growing optimism in the crypto market, driven in part by regulatory developments. The U.S. House will hold a crypto hearing on April 9, termed “The Future of American Innovation and Digital Assets: Adjusting U.S. Securities Law for the Digital Age,” with plans to develop a regulatory framework for digital assets.

That could boost eyes on tokens perceived to be close to the U.S. government, such as XRP and Cardano's ADA, which were named as part of potential crypto stockpile by President Donald Trump earlier in January.

Crypto asset manager Grayscale has listed two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that offer investors a differentiated source of income through bitcoin's (BTC) characteristic volatility.

The two New York Stock Exchange-listed funds will start trading on Wednesday.

The Bitcoin Covered Call ETF (BTCC) and Bitcoin Premium Income ETF (BPI) offer covered call writing strategies, which involves selling call options to generate income on the premium received. 

Call options are derivatives contracts betting on the price of an asset rising. They give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the asset at a predetermined price within a define period of time.

BTCC will write calls very close to spot prices to deliver income for investors seeking regular cash flow, with the options premiums possibly also providing a cushion against market downturns. 

BPI meanwhile will target options with strike prices that are well out-of-the-money, meaning the price is much higher than the spot price. This would allow investors to participate in much of BTC's upside potential while possibly benefiting from some dividend income, according to an emailed announcement from Grayscale on Wednesday.

The options contracts that both ETFs use will track other bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale's own Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC).

Despite the surge in institutional investment into BTC through spot ETFs since their introduction in January 2024, bitcoin's volatility does not appear to be going anywhere for the time being. 

After gaining nearly 48% in the fourth quarter, the largest cryptocurrency kicked off 2025 by losing 12% in the historically bullish first quarter. It rose by 72% and 69% in the first quarters of 2023 and 2024, respectively, according to data tracked by Coinglass.

Therefore, as institutional investors increase their exposure to bitcoin, there may be more demand for products such as Grayscale's that can offer differentiated sources of income to cushion against this volatility.

Wednesday could be a pivotal day for financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, as President Donald Trump is expected to announce sweeping reciprocal tariffs to ""liberate"" the U.S. from the supposed unfair practices of its trading partners.

Ahead of the pivotal announcement, signs of downtrend exhaustion have emerged in the ether (ETH) market. Yes, you read that right: after having lagged BTC by a large margin through the two-year bull crypto bull run, ETH may take the lead if the looming tariffs are more measured than expected.

Ether fell along with bitcoin last week, but the bears failed to penetrate the 16-month low of $1,755 hit on March 11. That's the first sign of seller fatigue or downtrend exhaustion.

Since then, prices have bounced to $1,880, teasing a double bottom formation with the neckline resistance at $2,104. A move through that would confirm the bullish breakout, opening doors for $2,400, the level identified as the next resistance per the measured move method.

While prices revisited the low from March 11 last week, the histogram that represents the spread between the price and its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) did not follow suit and carved put a higher low.

The divergence suggests that although prices fell, the momentum behind the downward price movement weakened.

After a prolonged downtrend that saw prices halve to $2,000, the three-line break chart has now flipped bullish, marking a significant shift in market sentiment. This change is illustrated by the appearance of a green bar on the daily time frame, indicating a potential reversal in price momentum.

The line break's previous bullish signal from early March was short-lived and turned out to be a bear trap. Still, the latest bullish flip appears more reliable as it is accompanied by signs of downtrend exhaustion on candlestick charts discussed above. 

That said, macro factors can single handedly make or break charts, meaning broad-based risk aversion on the back of Trump tariffs could invalidate all the bullish signals discussed above, potentially leading to deeper losses in ether.

Ripple, an enterprise-focused blockchain service closely tied to the XRP Ledger (XRP), said on Wednesday it has integrated its stablecoin to the company's cross-border payments system to boost adoption for Ripple USD (RLUSD).



Select Ripple Payments customers including cross-border payment providers BKK Forex and iSend are already using the stablecoin to improve their treasury operations, the company said. Ripple plans to further expand the token's availability of its token to payments customers.



Additionally, crypto exchange Kraken added RLUSD to its platform, following recent listings on LMAX and Bitstamp.

Ripple entered the rapidly growing stablecoin market with its short-term U.S. government bond-backed cryptocurrency after receiving regulatory approval from the New York New York Department of Financial Services in December.

Since then, RLUSD reached a $244 million market capitalization, growing 87% over the past month and reaching a monthly transfer volume of $860 million, rwa.xyz data shows.



Jack McDonald, Ripple's senior vice president of stablecoins, said in a statement that RLUSD's growth is ""outpacing our internal projections"" with adoption spanning multiple financial sectors. Ripple is also working with NGOs exploring stablecoins for more efficient aid distribution, he added.

The number one question on investors' minds is whether an asset has hit its bottom after being in a sustained downtrend for an extended period of time. 

Recent price action suggests that bitcoin (BTC) may have found its bottom just above $76,000 on March 10. This move has formed a pattern reminiscent of previous bottoming events in recent history.

In this current correction, bitcoin fell 30% from it's all-time high of $109,000 reached on Jan. 20. After hitting a low on March 10, it recorded higher lows on both sides of that date—around $78,000 on Feb. 28 and just above $81,000 on March 31—forming a triangular bottom.

A similar pattern played out during the yen carry trade unwind in August 2024, when bitcoin bottomed near $49,000 on Aug. 5. Again, higher lows were seen on either side: on July 7 and September 7.

Another instance occurred during the launch of the U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Bitcoin experienced a 20% correction, hitting a low just below $40,000 on Jan. 23, with higher lows on both sides of that date as well.

Omkar Godbole, managing editor of CoinDesk Markets, also points to signs that bitcoin could be bottoming out, noting the emergence of a bullish structure. “The latest pattern, indicating a shift from lower lows to higher lows and signifying seller exhaustion, resembles bottoming patterns seen in August and early 2024,”. 

""There's reason to consider the possibility of renewed bullish momentum—though, as always, external risks like Trump's tariffs could disrupt the trend"", Godbole says.

The Trump administration's formation of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve might have China re-thinking its hardline stance against crypto and that could be key for accelerated global adoption of BTC, asset manager Grayscale said in a research report Monday.

""The most important country to watch in this regard is China,"" said Grayscale, adding that if the country eases its crypto restrictions ""it could significantly boost global adoption."" 

President Trump last month directed his administration to form a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to — at a minimum — hold the assets that have been seized by the government.

Grayscale noted that current Chinese government policy bans most crypto activities, such as trading and mining, but permits the holding of digital assets.

Still, ""policymakers have allowed an expansion of crypto-related activity in Hong Kong under the 'one country, two systems' framework,"" Grayscale said.

Local regulators may be taking another look at the legal treatment of cryptocurrencies in the country. China's Supreme Court and other judicial bodies had a discussion in February about how to treat digital assets in future legal cases, the report noted.

President Trump's so-called Liberation Day has arrived, and markets are nervously awaiting developments on U.S. tariffs. Even within the administration, the mood appears far from optimistic. 

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik is reportedly in the crosshairs, with suggestions he may become the scapegoat for favoring overly aggressive tariffs if the U.S. were to head into a recession, according to The Independent, a U.K. online newspaper. 

A recession looks likely according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model, which is projecting a first-quarter contraction of -3.7% for U.S. real GDP. That is a dramatic downward revision from earlier estimates: +3.9% two months ago, +2.3% one month ago and -1.8% just two weeks ago.

While Trump has yet to disclose which country the tariffs will target, an announcement is scheduled for after the stock market closes at 4 p.m.

Bitcoin (BTC), meanwhile, remains unfazed, trading little changed on the day and holding above $85,000. U.S. equities finished higher on Tuesday, although futures are pointing slightly negative heading into Wednesday.

Currently, bitcoin is 25% below its Jan. 20 all-time high of $109,000. This places it in the middle of the performance range of the ""Magnificent 7"" tech stocks. Here's how they compare to their respective all-time highs: Apple is down 17%, Microsoft 22%, Amazon 24%, Meta 25%, Google 26%, NVIDIA 32% and Tesla 50%.

The cryptocurrency's resilience stands out when compared to past cycles. In 2022, BTC fell 75% from its peak to a low of $15,500, more than twice as much as the Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ)'s 34%. This year, bitcoin has dropped 30% versus 16% for QQQ — a relative drawdown of 1.87 times. This relative performance suggests bitcoin has become more resilient over time, even as volatility remains a defining trait.

Still, a lot hinges on the tariff announcement and how markets react. Stay alert!

Crypto enthusiasts might have heard of the ERC-20 token standard, which provides guidelines to ensure that tokens created on the Ethereum smart contract blockchain are compatible and can interact with other tokens and applications within the network.

A similar standard for data-backed tokens, called VRC-20, has now emerged.

Vana, an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain that helps users monetize personal data by bundling it into DataDAOs for AI model training, introduced the new standard early this week to boost trust and transparency in the market for data-backed digital assets.

""For data markets to work, tokens must be reliable, secure, and useful. As a universal standard for data-backed tokens, VRC-20 delivers this by ensuring fair and transparent data token trading,"" Vana announced on X.

The VRC-20 standard design includes specific criteria such as fixed supply, governance, and liquidity rules while ensuring real data access by tying tokens to actual data utility. Additionally, it promotes continuous liquidity through rewards that ensure market stability.

""This isn't speculation. This is real financialization of data,"" Vana noted.

Vana launched its mainnet in December, with VANA as its native cryptocurrency. Since then, the network has onboarded over 12 million data points through multiple DataDAOs, reflecting strong demand for user-owned data.

DataDAOs or data liquidity pools are decentralized marketplaces that bring data onchain as transferable digital tokens. DLPs are where data is contributed, tokenized and made ready for use in applications such as AI model training.

Monday's announcement replaced VANA emissions as DataDAO inventive with a new feature that calls for DAOs to issue VRC-20-compliant tokens to receive liquidity support.

Additionally, the protocol introduced data validator staking, where VANA holders can lock their coins in data validators instead of individual DataDAOs.

""Rewards are based on network security and usage. Stakers earn proportionally to their contribution to network uptime and data availability. No more idle staking. Earnings are tied to real network utility and reliability,"" Vana said.

The VANA token changed hands at $5.58 at press time, the lowest in over two weeks, extending the decline from the recent price high of $8.78 on Binance, according to data source TradingView.

North Korean “IT workers” are increasing illicit cyber activity across Europe with an eye on blockchain projects, Google Cloud warned in a Wednesday report.

Projects built on the popular Solana network, including applications and job boards, are getting hit by the rising attacks. Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) operatives pose as legit remote workers to infiltrate companies, take over critical systems and steal sensitive data which is likely sold to “generate revenue for the regime.”

The increased threat in Europe is a shift from a U.S.-heavy focus as DPRK-linked entities faced heat from DOJ indictments and tighter hiring scrutiny stateside.

The report reveals that one such worker juggled 12 fake personas across the U.S. and Europe and sought employment by fabricating references, building a rapport with job recruiters, and using additional personas they controlled to vouch for their credibility.

It's not like the workers lack coding chops either: Workers were found taking projects ranging from token hosting platform using Next.js, React and CosmosSDK, and Golang, and even created an entire Solana-based job marketplace.

More blockchain-related projects involved Anchor and Rust smart contract development. One worker even developed an artificial intelligence (AI) web application using Electron, Next.js, and blockchain applications.

A key culprit may be workplaces that let employees use their own devices.

“(Google Cloud) believes that IT workers have identified BYOD environments as potentially ripe for their schemes, and in January 2025, IT workers are now conducting operations against their employers in these scenarios,” the report said.

“Global expansion, extortion tactics, and the use of virtualized infrastructure all highlight the adaptable strategies employed by DPRK IT workers.”

DPRK entities and hacking groups are one of the biggest threat actors in the crypto ecosystem, stealing an estimated $1.3 billion from projects in 2024 and conducting a $1.5 billion hack on crypto exchange Bybit in February alone.

Sony customers in Singapore can now use the USDC stablecoin in its online store.

Sony Electronics' Singapore (SES) has integrated cryptocurrency payments in partnership with crypto exchange Crypto.com, the two firms said Wednesday.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a real-world asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. USDC, issued by Circle, is the second-largest dollar-backed token, trailing only Tether's USDT in size.

Headquartered in Singapore, Crypto.com won approval as a provider of Digital Payment Token (DPT) services in the city state in June 2023, allowing it to provide crypto payments to clients.

BlackRock managed to land on the Financial Conduct Authority's tough crypto register on Tuesday, the regulators website showed.

The world's biggest asset manager will be allowed to act as an arranger for iShares Digital Assets AG, which issue Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) — a financial instrument that is pegged an underlying asset, in this case a crypto asset.

Registration on the U.K.'s crypto register is not an easy feat. The FCA's crypto register was set up in 2020 to ensure that crypto firms wishing to serve U.K. clients could only do so after they had registered to comply with the country's anti-money laundering rules. The U.K. has received 368 applications but only 51 firms have been approved.

As an arranger, BlackRock will be able to ""arrange the execution of transactions in cryptoassets to support ETP subscriptions and redemptions"" between issuers and authorized participants but it will not be able to onboard any new customers.

Also, it will not be able to operate a machine that ""utilizes automated processes to exchange cryptoassets for money"" vice versa - without written consent from the regulator.

BlackRock joins the likes of crypto exchange Coinbase who recently managed to get on the register this year, though a new crypto regime awaits.

Need evidence of the drastic change in the crypto market sentiment lately? Look no further than Deribit's options market, where the $80,000 bitcoin (BTC) put option, offering downside protection below the said level, is now the most popular bet.

It's a 180-degree change from early this year when call options at six-figure levels garnered the most interest among traders.

As of writing, the number of open positions in the $80,000 put option tallied 10,278 contracts, equating to a notional open interest of $864.26 million, according to data source Amberdata. That makes it the most popular options play on Deribit, where one contract represents one BTC.

It also marks a significant positioning shift from early January when the call option at the $120,000 strike was the most popular bet with an open interest of nearly $1.5 billion. Last month, the $100,000 call took the crown.

The positioning shift indicates traders have reassessed upside expectations amid the market swoon and lingering economic uncertainty. BTC fell 11.66% in the first quarter, with prices slipping below $80,000 at one point as President Donald Trump's tariffs shook Wall Street. Additionally, disappointment over the lack of fresh purchases in the U.S. strategic reserve weighed over prices.

Later Wednesday, Trump is expected to announce sweeping reciprocal tariffs on its trading partners, which could lead to a full-blown trade war. That has BTC traders chasing downside protection.

""BTC volatility smiles have shifted sharply towards OTM puts, reaching levels not seen since the US Banking Crisis in March 2023. ETH's short-tenor volatility smile skews have partially recovered from their strong tilt toward OTM put,"" analytics firm Block Scholes said in its market update Wednesday.

Less than half of non-U.S. customers of bankrupt cryptocurrency lending firm BlockFi have come forward to claim their assets back with a May 15 deadline looming, the lender said in a blogpost on Wednesday.

BlockFi filed for bankruptcy in November of 2022 as contagion from the collapse of FTX spread through the crypto industry. The firm later emerged from bankruptcy and announced a plan in July of 2024 to distribute 100% of the dollar value of customers' claims at the time of the bankruptcy filing.

So far, 97% of U.S. customers have claimed their distributions, while only 43% of non-U.S. customers have received their distributions. It should be noted that arranging distributions for U.S. customers was more straightforward and began earlier than those for non-U.S., which involved courts in both the U.S. and Bermuda.

A possible reason for the shortfall in claimants could be because people think messages from the BlockFi Estate asking customers to select a payment method are spam or phishing attacks. The firm said it has been working with security experts to reassure customers of legitimacy.

“BlockFi is doing all it can to make final distributions to all former customers,” the blogpost said. “Some customers may need to complete a ‘Know Your Customer' identity verification process to receive their distributions. We strongly encourage all customers who have not received their distributions or finished this process to complete this process by May 15, 2025.”

U.S. and non-U.S. customers had to do KYC in order to use BlockFi in the first place, so this is not likely to be a stumbling block for those still to claim distributions.

The verification process, which requires two forms of ID, takes ten minutes to perform, BlockFi said. Once completed, reviewed, and approved, clients can expect to receive processed payments within 45 days, it said.

The bankruptcy code states that assets that are not claimed by customers by the May 15 deadline will be shared among other unsecured creditors lower down in the pecking order.

 Bitcoin could return to $76,000 lows, analysis warns as risk assets prepare for US trade tariff volatility, but a daily chart breakout is on the cusp of confirming. 

Bitcoin (BTC) reached new April highs at the April 2 Wall Street open as markets braced for US “Liberation Day.”

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed local highs of $86,444 on Bitstamp, the best performance for BTC/USD since March 28.

Volatility remained in the run-up to US President Donald Trump announcing a sweeping round of reciprocal trade tariffs.

The measures would be unveiled in an address from the White House Rose Garden at 4 pm Eastern Time, with Trump then holding a press conference.

While US stocks traded slightly down after the open, Bitcoin managed to claw back lost ground, acting in a key area of interest filled with long-term trend lines.

As Cointelegraph reported, these include various simple (SMA) and exponential (EMA) moving averages, among them the 200-day SMA — a classic bull market support line currently lost.

In his latest observations, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital made additional reference to the 21-week and 50-week EMAs.

“The consolidation between the two Bull Market EMAs continues. However, the 21-week EMA (green) represents lower prices as it declines,” he wrote in a post on X alongside an illustrative chart.

Rekt Capital flagged more bullish news in the making, thanks to BTC/USD attempting to break out of an extended downtrend on daily timeframes.

He confirmed:

Last month, Bitcoin's daily relative strength index (RSI) metric broke free from its own downtrend that had been in place since November 2024.

Continuing on the macro picture, however, trading firm QCP Capital was uninspired.

Risk assets, it told Telegram channel subscribers on the day, were likely to “remain under pressure” following the tariffs announcement.

“In crypto, sentiment remains broadly subdued. BTC continues to trade without conviction, while ETH is holding the line at $1,800 support. Across the board, crypto markets are showing signs of exhaustion with numerous coins down 90% YTD, with some shedding over 30% in the past week,” it summarized. 

Previous tariff moves in Q1 almost unanimously delivered downward BTC price reactions.

Other industry participants were more hopeful, including asset management firm Swissblock, which argued that “no sign of an imminent collapse” occurred on Bitcoin.

“Will $BTC hold as a hedge, or follow TradFi into a pullback?” it queried in an X thread on March 31, describing BTC price action as being “at a crossroads.”

Swissblock saw the potential for a return to $76,000 multimonth lows in the event of a negative reaction — a drop of 11% versus current levels.

 Bitcoin midterm holders — even those with a cost basis at around $3,600 — are still refusing to sell despite major profits and BTC price volatility. 

Bitcoin (BTC) investors who bought BTC in 2020 or later are still waiting for higher prices, new research says.

In findings published on X on April 1, onchain analytics firm Glassnode revealed that $110,000 was not high enough to make many hodlers sell.

Bitcoiners who entered the market between three and five years ago have retained their holdings despite significant BTC price upside.

According to Glassnode, this investor cohort, with a cost basis between the 2020 lows of $3,600 and the 2021 highs of $69,000, is still hodling.

“Although the share of wealth held by investors who bought $BTC 3–5 years ago has declined by 3 percentage points since its November 2024 peak, it remains at historically elevated levels,” it said.

An accompanying chart shows data from the Realized Cap HODL Waves metric, which splits the BTC supply into sections based on when each coin last moved onchain.

Using this, Glassnode is able to draw a distinction between the 2020-22 buyers and those who came immediately before them.

“In contrast, over two-thirds of those who had bought $BTC 5–7 years ago exited their positions by the December 2024 peak,” it reveals, reflecting their lower cost basis.

As Cointelegraph reported, more recent buyers, who form the more speculative investor cohort known as short-term holders (STHs), have proven much more sensitive to recent BTC price volatility.

Episodes of panic selling have occurred throughout the past six months as BTC/USD hit new record highs and then fell by up to 30%.

Continuing, Glassnode said that current STH participation does not suggest a speculative frenzy — something common to previous BTC price cycle tops.

“Short-Term Holders currently hold around 40% of Bitcoin's network wealth, after peaking near 50% earlier in 2025,” it said, alongside Realized Cap HODL Waves data on March 31.

 First Digital Trust has denied Justin Sun's claims of liquidity issues, saying it is part of a ""smear campaign"" to hinder competition. 

The First Digital US dollar-pegged stablecoin (FDUSD) depegged on April 2 following claims of insolvency from Tron network founder Justin Sun, who said that the issuer of the tokenized fiat equivalent, First Digital, is insolvent.

First Digital responded to the claims by assuring users they are completely solvent and said that FDUSD is still fully backed and redeemable with the US dollar on a 1:1 basis.

The firm also said that the ongoing dispute is with TrueUSD (TUSD), another stablecoin. The firm wrote in an April 2 X post:

First Digital also indicated they would be taking legal action against Sun for making the claims on social media. ""This is a typical Justin Sun smear campaign to try to attack a competitor to his business,"" spokespeople for First Digital wrote.

Proof-of-reserve audits are onchain cryptographic verifications that a custodian, crypto firm, or stablecoin issuer has the digital assets it claims to hold.

These proof-of-reserve audits use zero-knowledge tech and Merkle Trees — a data structure used to verify onchain information — as an alternative to audit reports or attestations widely used in the crypto industry.

Despite proof-of-reserve technology not yet tracking liabilities against reserves, the system promises to be better than the current system of audits that do not use real-time, onchain data.

Tal Zackon, founder of the Tres Finance auditing and reporting platform, previously told Cointelegraph that current attestations and third-party audit reports only represent ""snapshots"" of reserves that can be manipulated, exploited, or misconstrued.

Stablecoin issuers will likely need to adopt proof-of-reserve tools as the tokenized fiat equivalents become more integrated into global capital markets and critical financial infrastructure such as stock exchanges, escrow services, and clearinghouses.

This integration will require stablecoin issuers to provide up-to-date, real-time data, which may need to be updated several times per minute as opposed to the monthly audit reports that are typically released by firms to attest to asset reserves.

 GameStop's board had greenlit an investment in Bitcoin and US-dollar-pegged stablecoins using the convertible debt offering and cash reserves on March 25. 

Video game retailer GameStop Corporation (GME) has finished a convertible debt offering that raised $1.5 billion, with some proceeds earmarked for buying Bitcoin.

The offering was initially set to raise at least $1.3 billion, but purchasers opted for an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of notes, GameStop said in an April 1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

""The company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin in a manner consistent with the Company's Investment Policy,"" GameStop added.

The convertible notes are debt that can later be converted into equity and are scheduled to mature on April 1, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.

The conversion rate for the notes will initially be 33 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, according to the filing. 

GameStop shares didn't see a significant move following the close of the convertible debt offering. GME closed the April 1 trading day up 1.34% at $22.61 and only saw an extra 0.5% bump after the bell, Google Finance data shows.

Positive shareholder sentiment saw the stock jump nearly 12% to $28.36 on March 26, the day after GameStop announced its Bitcoin (BTC) plan, but its fortunes reversed the next day, with GME shares dropping nearly 24% to $21.68.

Analysts at the time suggested the chilly reception reflected shareholders' fear of GameStop's deeper problems with its business model. 

On March 25, GameStop confirmed that it had received board approval to invest in Bitcoin and US-dollar-pegged stablecoins using the notes and its cash reserves. Those reserves stood at $4.77 billion as of Feb. 1, compared with $921.7 million a year earlier, according to its 2024 fourth-quarter financial statements. 

GameStop is a relative latecomer among public companies creating Bitcoin treasuries. A slew of others have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in a playbook popularized by Micheal Saylor's Strategy.

The video game retailer previously made forays into the crypto space with a crypto wallet for its users, which it eventually shut down in November 2023 due to regulatory uncertainty.

GameStop is also considered the first example of meme stock success after a short squeeze in 2021 that sent the stock surging over 1,000% in a month as traders flipped the table on hedge funds that had been making money shorting on the company.

 The two new Bitcoin ETFs from Grayscale aim to generate revenue through options strategies, leveraging BTC's volatility to provide alternative income streams. 

Major cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale Investments announced two new Bitcoin outcome-oriented exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

According to an April 2 announcement, the new products are the Grayscale Bitcoin Covered Call ETF (BTCC) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Premium Income ETF (BPI). According to an email sent to Cointelegraph, the two new Bitcoin (BTC) funds are meant to generate revenue by harnessing BTC volatility:

The Bitcoin Covered Call product seeks to capture the highest premiums and maximize potential income. Grayscale suggests that it may serve as a complement to Bitcoin exposure.

The fund's strategy involves systematically writing calls very close to spot prices. The hope is that, due to Bitcoin's historically high volatility, it would generate income through paid call generation.

On the other hand, the Bitcoin Premium Income product seeks to balance upside participation with a degree of income generation. This is meant to act as an alternative to direct Bitcoin ownership and seeks a balance between growth and income generation.

This fund systematically writes calls targeting strike prices well out-of-the-money on Bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC). The announcement reads:

Grayscale Investments promises that both the new products will allow for a differentiated source of revenue that “delivers an uncorrelated source of income for investors.” Furthermore, the new derivatives will feature monthly distributions and systematic options management.

Earlier this week, Grayscale also filed to list an exchange-traded fund (ETF) holding a diverse basket of spot cryptocurrencies. This new product includes Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA).

In late March, the US stock exchange Nasdaq also filed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking permission to list Grayscale Investments' spot Avalanche ETF. Grayscale's website lists 28 crypto products, of which 25 are single-asset derivatives, and three are diversified.

Grayscale is also among the asset managers currently waiting for the approval of its XRP spot ETF, as well as other products. Among those products, we can find the spot Cardano ETF filing and its Litecoin Trust conversion to an ETF.

 Pi Network's token price is nearing its all-time low as over 126.6 million PI tokens are set to be unlocked this month, increasing supply and pressuring demand. 

Social cryptocurrency project Pi Network's price approaches all-time lows as more and more coins are unlocked.

CoinMarketCap data shows that Pi Network (PI) is trading at $0.6722 as of press time, very close to its all-time low of $0.6152 reported on Feb. 20. The price action comes as over 126.6 million PI tokens are expected to be unlocked this month, equivalent to just under 1.87% of the coin's current circulating supply.

Founder of Obchakevich Research, Alex Obchakevich, attributed the price downturn to continued PI unlocks in correspondence with Cointelegraph. He described the event as “inevitable in any case” and said:

“Monthly unlocks exceed demand, which greatly affects the value of the token.“

So far, the network has unlocked 4.9 billion PI, with 1.54 billion more coins being freed in the next 12 months. So far, Pi Network has unlocked an average of 133 million PI per month.

The current downturn follows February's all-time lows following the Pi Network mainnet launch. The project operated with trading restrictions that prevented its listing on any platform until that point and then was listed on Bitget, OKX and MEXC.

Still, Obchakevich also recognized the potential of the Pi Network. He highlighted that the network should now “focus on project development now to increase usage and interest.” Talking about growth potential, he also said:

Pi Network employs a referral-based structure that sees users invite others to join in exchange for token earnings. In late February, Ben Zhou, the CEO of crypto exchange ByBit, challenged the project's legitimacy and accused it of being a scam. He wrote at the time:

 An initial tranche of $50 million will be used to develop Bitfarms' Panther Creek data center in Pennsylvania. 

Bitfarms, a global computer infrastructure company known for its Bitcoin mining operations, has entered into a $300 million loan agreement with Macquarie Group to finance the development of its high-performance computing (HPC) data centers.

According to an April 2 announcement, Macquarie's private debt facility will provide $50 million in initial funding for Bitfarms' Panther Creek data center project in Pennsylvania. 

The remaining $250 million will be released once Bitfarms achieves “specific development milestones at its Panther Creek location,” the announcement said.

Once developed, Panther Creek will have a nearly 500-megawatt capacity fueled by several power sources. 

Panther Creek “will be sought after by HPC tenants once construction of the project is underway,” said Joshua Stevens, an associate director at Macquarie Group. 

Source: Bitfarms

The project is being delivered at a time when AI applications are fueling growing demand for new sources of computational power and data storage capacity. Bitcoin miners are rushing to fill the void — and to secure reliable revenue streams for themselves in a post-halving environment. 

However, Bitfarms disclosed in its recent quarterly report that it continues to face “regulatory challenges in expanding its energy capacity,” with the approval timeline ranging from 12 to 36 months. 

In the meantime, Bitfarms expects its $125 million acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining to do much of the heavy lifting in providing additional capacity, CEO Ben Gagnon told investors.

Bitfarms mined 654 Bitcoin (BTC) in the final quarter of 2024 at an average all-in cash cost of $60,800. 

Like other miners, Bitfarms has elected to retain a significant portion of its mined Bitcoin. Industry data shows it currently holds 1,152 BTC on its books, placing it among the top 25 publicly traded Bitcoin investors.

Miners like Hive Digital have doubled down on their long-term Bitcoin “hodl” strategy as a way to bolster their balance sheet. The company's Bitcoin holdings have swelled to 2,620 BTC. 

Meanwhile, MARA Holdings has accumulated 46,374 BTC and has announced plans for a $2 billion stock offering to acquire more Bitcoin.

Like Bitfarms, Hive Digital, Core Scientific, Hut8 and Bit Digital have also made a strategic pivot toward AI and HPC.

Hive executives told Cointelegraph that the company has repurposed a portion of its Nvidia GPUs for such tasks. They said AI applications can generate more than $2.00 per hour in revenue, compared to just $0.12 per hour for crypto mining activities.

 Kraken obtained a restricted dealer registration in Canada, reaffirming its commitment to the market after the exit of rival exchange Gemini. 

Update (April 2, 1:50 pm UTC): This article has been updated to add official registration data from the Ontario Securities Commission.

Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken obtained a new registration in Canada as its latest compliance milestone.

Kraken secured a restricted dealer registration from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) on April 1, according to official data on the OSC website. 

The registration reaffirms Kraken's commitment to serving Canadian investors as its platform now has more than $2 billion Canadian dollars ($1.4 billion) in combined assets under custody.

In conjunction with the registration, Kraken announced the appointment of Cynthia Del Pozo as general manager for North America. Before joining Kraken in 2025, Del Pozo served as head of strategy at the Winklevoss twins' Gemini, which exited the Canadian market in late 2024.

According to the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), restricted dealer registration is one of the eight-firm registration types in Canada, telling investors what products and services they can offer.

Unlike an investment dealer or investment fund manager, restricted dealer registration is a special classification used for firms that “do not quite fit under any other category” and is subject to specific requirements or conditions by securities regulators.

In the announcement, Kraken said that the registration enables its Canadian clients to benefit from a solid regulatory foundation, ensuring that its platform is supervised by the OSC.

Kraken's strengthening commitment to the Canadian market comes months after rival Gemini exchange departed from the country before the end of 2024.

Gemini's abrupt exit from Canada was unexpected by many, raising questions about the clarity of cryptocurrency regulation policies in the country.

Kraken's new North American general manager, Del Pozo, spent three years working at Gemini Canada, with her most recent position as head of strategy and corporate development, according to her LinkedIn profile.

Despite Gemini's shutdown in Canada, Del Pozo is optimistic about the state of the local crypto market.

“Canada is at a turning point for crypto adoption, with a growing number of investors and institutions recognizing digital assets as a vital part of the financial future,” she said in the announcement, adding:

Kraken's latest registration in Canada marks another milestone in the long story of the company in the jurisdiction.

According to a blog post by the exchange, Kraken's Canada journey began in 2011 with the launch of CaVirtEx, an early local crypto trading platform based in Calgary, which Kraken acquired later in 2016.

 XRP price is holding above $2.05 after modest gains on April 1, while the RSI's bullish divergence signals a potential bottom. 

XRP (XRP) price fell 22% between March 19 and March 31, potentially forming a local bottom at $2.02. The price then increased by 9% to $2.20 before retracing to current levels. 

Has the popular altcoin finally bottomed out, or is there a deeper retracement in the cards? 

The XRP relative strength index (RSI) displays bullish divergence conditions in lower timeframes, according to analyst CasiTrades.

A bullish divergence is when the asset's price prints lower lows and the RSI produces higher lows, indicating that downward momentum is waning.

“After reaching the 0.786 retrace at $2.05, XRP is printing bullish divergences from the 15-min all the way up to the 4-hour chart,” the analyst said in a March 31 post on X. 

CasiTrades notes that these signals are a positive indicator both for short-term bounces and potential macro recovery.

She added that $2.25 remains a key resistance level to watch, as breaching it with strong momentum would signal a convincing bullish breakout. 

“If we break above $2.25 with strong momentum, that would invalidate the need for another support retest, a very bullish sign,” CasiTrades said, adding that the demand zone between “$2.00 and $2.01 remains a support if the $2.05 doesn't hold.”

The analyst projects a bullish month for XRP in April, with targets of $2.70 and $3.80 in the short term.

Related: XRP funding rate flips negative — Will smart traders flip long or short?

Despite XRP's recent recovery from local lows, the risk of a deeper correction remains, according to veteran trader Peter Brandt.

Last week, Brandt said the presence of a “textbook” head-and-shoulders pattern (H&S) could see XRP price as low as $1.07.

This potential H&S pattern is still in play on the daily chart (see below) and will be completed on a break and close below the neckline at $1.90. 

If the price stays below the neckline, the pair could plummet to $1.50 and then to the pattern's target of $1.07.

Brandt said:

Brandt said this bearish chart pattern would be invalidated if buyers push and maintain the price above $3.00.

Meanwhile, macroeconomic headwinds from US tariffs on April 2 may spook traders, pulling the XRP price toward $1.31.

Not everyone agrees. Analyst Dark Defender shared a positive outlook, saying that XRP price is likely to revisit the last Fibonacci level at $2.04 before bouncing back again.

According to the analyst, a key resistance level for XRP is $2.22, which “should be broken” to ensure a sustained recovery toward the Wave 5 target at $8.

 Crypto-friendly Republicans Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine have won Florida's special elections for the 1st and 6th Congressional Districts of the US House. 

Two Republicans who received a combined $1.5 million from the crypto-backed political action committee (PAC) Fairshake will enter the US House after winning special elections in Florida.

Republican Jimmy Patronis won the vacant seat in Florida's 1st Congressional District to replace Matt Gaetz, taking 57% of the vote to defeat Democrat Gay Valimont, according to AP News data.

Randy Fine also took Florida's 6th Congressional District with 56.7% of the vote to beat his Democratic rival, public school teacher Josh Weil, and fill a seat left vacant by Mike Waltz, who took a job as White House national security adviser.

Florida's 1st and 6th Congressional Districts — located in Florida's western panhandle and along the state's northeast coast — have been controlled by Republicans for roughly 30 years, but their lead has narrowed in recent years.

Fairshake, a PAC backed by crypto industry giants including Coinbase, Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz, gave Fine around $1.16 million in advertising spending and funneled $347,000 to Patronis to support his campaign.

Both Republicans have expressed support for the crypto industry, with Fine stating in a Jan. 14 X post that “Floridians want crypto innovation!”

Source: Randy Fine

Fairshake and its affiliates poured around $170 million into the 2024 US presidential and congressional elections to back candidates who committed to supporting the crypto industry.

The wins by Patronis and Fine increased Republican representation in the House to 220 seats, with the Democrats holding 213 seats.

There are two vacant seats to be filled after Texas and Arizona Democrats Sylvester Turner and Raúl Grijalva died on March 5 and March 13, respectively.

The victories for Patronis and Fine likely mean that crypto legislation will continue to see support in the US capital.

The Republican Party would have maintained its House majority even if it lost both seats in Florida, but it would have made it more difficult for some of the recently introduced Republican-backed crypto bills to pass through the House and Senate.

At the Digital Assets Summit on March 18, Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna said he believes Congress “should be able to get” both a stablecoin and crypto market structure bill done this year.

Bills that could eventually make their way to the House include the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which passed the Senate Banking Committee in an 18-6 vote on March 13. 

Senator Cynthia Lummis also reintroduced a Bitcoin reserve bill about a week after the Trump administration announced the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on March 6, with the legislation referred to the Senate Banking Committee on March 11.

 Blockchain and tech trade associations want UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office to follow the US and appoint a special envoy dedicated to crypto. 

Several British trade associations have asked Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office to appoint a special envoy dedicated to crypto and for a dedicated action plan for digital assets and blockchain technology.

In a March 31 letter, the coalition of six UK digital economy trade bodies urged Starmer's special adviser on business and investment, Varun Chandra, for a “greater strategic focus and alignment to deliver investment, growth and jobs” for the crypto industry. 

The group, which consisted of the UK Cryptoasset Business Council, Global Digital Finance, The Payments Association, Digital Currencies Governance Group, the Crypto Council for Innovation and techUK, noted the US policy shift on crypto under President Donald Trump and his appointment of a crypto czar.

Britain's commitment to an economic trade deal focused on technological cooperation with the US “presents a significant opportunity to mirror the United States' ambition in fostering leadership in blockchain, digital assets, and other emerging financial technologies,” the letter stated. 

The group recommended that the UK appoint a blockchain special envoy, similar to the US, to coordinate policy, foster innovation, and position the country competitively in global markets.

The trade bodies also called for the development of a dedicated government action plan for crypto and blockchain technology, including a concierge service to attract high-potential firms.

They added that the government should acknowledge and leverage the commonalities between blockchain, quantum computing and artificial intelligence technologies, including potential applications for government services.

Another recommendation was to create a high-level industry-government-regulator engagement forum to ensure informed decision-making and cross-sector collaboration.

“With deep pools of talent, access to capital, world-class academic institutions, and sophisticated regulators, the UK provides an environment where digital assets and blockchain innovation can thrive,” they stated. 

Related: UK should tax crypto buyers to boost stock investing, economy, says banker

The coalition argues that crypto and blockchain technology could boost the UK economy by 57 billion British pounds ($73.6 billion) over the next decade, with the sector potentially increasing global gross domestic product by 1.39 trillion pounds ($1.8 trillion) by 2030.

Tom Griffiths, the co-founder and managing partner of crypto compliance advisory firm BitCompli, said in response to the letter on LinkedIn that the Financial Conduct Authority “has a lot of talent and a good sight of future plans, but the UK is definitely losing pace with Dubai, Singapore, and other EU jurisdictions.”

“Now is the time for the FCA to act, or the UK will lose out on this huge opportunity, which is digital assets and all the benefits this sector can bring, not only now but over the next 20 years,” he added.

 7-Eleven is participating in the country's CBDC test phase, which started on April 1 and will end on June 30. 

South Korea's 7-Eleven stores will accept payments in the country's central bank digital currency (CBDC) until June, as the retailer participates in the test phase of its CBDC project. 

The convenience store chain will reportedly provide a 10% discount on all products paid for with CBDC during the test period. According to Moon Dae-woo, head of 7-Eleven's digital innovation division, the company is making an effort to incorporate digital technology advancements in its operations. 

The executive added that the company's participation in the CBDC test will help accelerate the firm's digital transformation. 

Many stores will participate in South Korea's CBDC testing phase, which runs from April 1 to June 30. The project also involves 100,000 participants who will be allowed to test payments using CBDC issued by the central bank. 

Central bank digital currencies are digital assets issued by government agencies. Like other digital assets, CBDCs offer faster and more modernized payment features. However, unlike Bitcoin and other privacy-focused tokens that offer certain levels of anonymity, CBDCs are controlled and monitored by governments.

On March 24, government agencies including the Bank of Korea, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) announced the CBDC test. 

Participants can convert their bank deposits into tokens stored in a distributed ledger during the test period. The tokens hold the same value as the Korean won.

The government agencies said citizens aged 19 or older with a deposit account in a participating bank could apply to take part. Registrations were limited to 100,000 participants. KB, Koomin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori, NongHyup, IBK and Busan are among the banks participating in the CBDC tests. 

Apart from 7-Eleven, participants can use their CBDCs in coffee shops, supermarkets, K-Pop merchandise stores and delivery platforms. However, users will be limited to a total conversion limit of 5 million won ($3,416) during testing. 

The Bank of Korea first announced the retail CBDC testing for 100,000 users in November 2023 and was originally scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 2024. The FSS said the country's CBDC test represents a step toward creating a prototype for a “future monetary system.”

 Coreum's blockchain framework is designed for institutional use. It features deterministic fees, compliance integration and interoperability for regulated asset tokenization. A new report by Cointelegraph Research examines the blockchain ecosystem. 

A new report by Cointelegraph Research explores Coreum's role in institutional blockchain adoption. It analyzes the project's technical architecture, compliance framework and its potential impact on regulated asset tokenization. The report presents insights into transaction efficiency, security mechanisms and crosschain interoperability. It also evaluates how Coreum fits into the evolving financial landscape.

The adoption of blockchain technology by financial institutions has been increasing in lockstep, with the value locked in tokenized real-world assets (RWA). The latter grew by 85% in 2024. 

Our report examines how third-generation blockchains, such as Coreum, are addressing the challenges of scalability, regulatory compliance and interoperability. Improvements in the infrastructure on the base layer will lead to more seamless institutional adoption in the future.

Read the full version of the report for free here.

Coreum is structured to support applications that require predictable transaction costs, regulatory oversight and seamless integration with financial infrastructure. Network data indicates that Coreum achieves a transaction throughput in excess of  7,000 TPS and a time to finality of about 1.2 seconds. This positions Coreum well in a crowded and highly competitive layer-1 blockchain landscape. 

Coreum integrates most of its compliance features at the protocol level, a critical factor for institutional adoption. The network includes onchain KYC and AML monitoring in collaboration with AnChain.ai, an AI-driven compliance provider. 

This is unlike conventional blockchains, where compliance tools are third-party application-layer software. Coreum puts compliance at its foundation together with real-time risk assessment and fraud detection.

Our report also analyses Coreum's decentralized exchange (DEX) infrastructure. While many layer-1 blockchains rely on liquidity pools, Coreum features a built-in onchain order book. There are important differences between the models. 

Coreum's order book DEX allows for deterministic trade execution with minimal slippage, which makes it well-suited for institutional trading strategies. In contrast, AMM-based DEXs rely on liquidity pools that sometimes lead to price inefficiencies and higher exposure to impermanent loss. 

Coreum's DEX architecture also supports high-frequency trading, with transaction processing speeds comparable to traditional financial exchanges.

A notable aspect of Coreum's DEX is its advanced API, which enables integration with institutional trading systems. The API is designed to provide low-latency access to order book data, market execution tools and automated trading strategies. 

This infrastructure allows financial firms and market makers to integrate Coreum's DEX into their existing trading workflows. It ensures compliance with industry standards and benefits from blockchain-based settlement efficiencies.

Read the full version of the report for free here.

Coreum's interoperability strategy includes connections with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and the Cosmos/IBC network. These integrations enable crosschain liquidity and asset transfers, which creates support for financial applications that require seamless movement between blockchain ecosystems. 

This integration allows institutional users to leverage XRPL's efficiency in payments and Cosmos' modular interoperability framework with over 100 connected chains. The ability to interact with multiple networks without sacrificing security or compliance aligns with institutional requirements for blockchain adoption.

Networks designed for institutional adoption will need to address compliance, scalability and interoperability challenges. Coreum's technical structure and regulatory considerations provide a case study for how blockchain networks may evolve to meet these requirements. 

With its deterministic fee structure, built-in compliance framework and high-speed trading infrastructure, Coreum represents an example of how third-generation blockchains are positioning themselves at the intersection of crypto and regulated financial markets.

 VanEck has filed to register a Delaware trust company for a potential spot BNB ETF in the United States, marking a first for the crypto asset. 

Investment company VanEck filed to register a Delaware trust company for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking Binance-linked BNB cryptocurrency.

VanEck, on March 31, registered a new entity under the name VanEck BNB ETF in Delaware, according to public records on the official Delaware state website.

In filing 10148820, the entity is registered as a trust corporate service company in Delaware, hinting at a potential spot BNB (BNB) ETF in the United States.

According to social media reports, VanEck is the first company to propose a potential BNB ETF in the US, potentially signaling an expansion of BNB Chain — formerly known as Binance Chain — across traditional financial products in the market.

While VanEck is the first to move toward a potential BNB ETF product in the US, similar products have been trading in Europe for several years.

Prominent European crypto asset manager 21Shares launched a BNB exchange-traded product (ETP) in Switzerland in October 2019, according to TradingView.

TradingView data suggests that 21Shares BNB ETP has only $15 million in assets under management (AUM), a 0.3% share of Switzerland's total crypto AUM of $5.3 billion as of March 28, as reported by CoinShares.

The product reportedly saw a significant drop in fund flows in the past year, totaling 537 million euros, or $580 million.

Formerly known as Binance Coin, BNB is the native digital asset of the BNB Chain, which is now described as a “community-driven and decentralized blockchain ecosystem for Web3 decentralized applications.”

BNB was launched by Binance in July 2017 as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain as a tool to incentivize users to trade on their platform and pay for fees at a discounted rate.

At the time of writing, BNB is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency asset by market capitalization, worth about $88 billion, according to CoinGecko.

VanEck's BNB ETF trust filing is just one of many new US altcoin ETF filings and registrations that have followed Donald Trump's presidential inauguration in January.

In early March, VanEck registered a similar Delaware trust for an ETF tracking the price of Avalanche (AVAX), also becoming one of the first companies to register such a trust.

Many ETF issuers have filed for an XRP (XRP) ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission, with at least nine companies submitting standalone XRP ETF filings as of March 12.

 According to RWA.XYZ, the total stablecoin market cap is currently over $227 billion, with over 155 million holders worldwide. 

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMBC), a Japanese banking and financial services conglomerate, along with business systems firm TIS Inc, Ava Labs — the developer of the Avalanche network — and digital asset infrastructure company Fireblocks, have signed an agreement to explore a framework for commercializing stablecoins in Japan.

Under a Memorandum of Understanding, the companies will focus on developing strategies around issuing and circulating stablecoins pegged to the US dollar and Japanese yen, according to a joint announcement.

Additionally, the collaboration will explore stablecoins as a settlement mechanism for tokenized real-world assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.

Stablecoins continue to be a major focus of crypto regulatory frameworks worldwide, and one of the sectors venture capitalists are eyeing in 2025 as nation-states push stablecoins to the forefront of their digital asset strategies.

Speaking at the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that comprehensive stablecoin regulation was central to President Donald Trump's stated goal to become the worldwide leader in crypto.

Bessent said stablecoins would help protect US dollar hegemony in global markets by expanding the use and scope of the dollar across the world.

Centralized overcollateralized stablecoins rely on short-term US Treasury instruments and fiat money held in banks to back the value of the tokenized real-world assets.

According to Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of stablecoin issuer Tether, the company is now the seventh-largest buyer of US Treasury bills, beating out sovereign countries such as France, Singapore, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.

Stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle accumulate the yield from holding US debt instruments as part of their profit from issuing tokenized fiat assets to buyers.

Recently, calls to share stablecoin yield with customers have escalated, with industry leaders like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong proposing that stablecoin laws change in the US to allow firms to distribute yield to clients onchain.

US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand disagreed with those proposals and warned against stablecoin issuers sharing yield with clients, arguing that it would displace the banking industry and disrupt home mortgage loans, small business loans, and local bank lending.

 Sony Electronics Singapore partnered with Crypto.com to enable USDC payments, highlighting a growing trend of stablecoin adoption in the region. 

The online store of a Singapore-based subsidiary of Japanese tech behemoth Sony is now accepting USDC payments through Crypto.com.

According to an April 2 announcement, Sony Electronics Singapore now accepts USDC (USDC) stablecoin payments through an integration with the Crypto.com exchange. Crypto.com Singapore general manager Chin Tah Ang said:

The Sony subsidiary is not the only high-profile partnership Crypto.com is involved in. At the end of 2024, the mobile-first crypto exchange partnered with Deutsche Bank to provide corporate banking services across Asian-Pacific markets, covering regions such as Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong.

Still, the Singaporean Sony subsidiary allowing stablecoin payments may be the start of a new trend in the region. Late February reports indicated that Metro, a publicly listed department store chain in Singapore, had enabled its customers to pay for products using stablecoins like Tether's USDt.

The initiatives also follow January reports that Singapore is becoming a key destination for Web3 companies after it issued twice as many crypto licenses in 2024 as the previous year. William Croisettier, chief growth officer of ZKcandy, told Cointelegraph at the time:

Pump.fun is launching a lending platform to enable users to buy memecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with borrowed cryptocurrency, the Solana-based memecoin launchpad said. 

Dubbed Pump.Fi, the onchain lending protocol provides “immediate… financing for [any] digital asset,” Pump.fun said in an April 1 X post.

According to Pump.fun, borrowers pay one-third up front and the rest over 60 days. In addition, Pump.Fi will create a marketplace for lenders to buy debt. The protocol did not specify how Pump.Fi — which doesn't do credit checks — plans to ensure repayment of undercollateralized onchain loans.

Pump.fun has been grappling with a sharp drawdown in memecoin trading activity on Solana after several high-profile scandals — such as the LIBRA token's disastrous launch — soured sentiment on memecoins among retail traders. 

Adding onchain lending has the potential to draw more liquidity into the space, which has seen trading volumes stabilize in recent weeks, according to data from Dune Analytics.

Pump.fun has also been expanding its offerings to stay ahead of mounting competition from rival platforms.

Raydium, Solana's largest decentralized exchange (DEX) by volume, plans to roll out its own memecoin launchpad, LaunchLab. 

Other rival protocols — including Daos.fun, GoFundMeme, and Pumpkin — are also vying for a share of Solana's memecoin market.

On March 20, Pump.fun launched its own DEX — known as PumpSwap — to replace Raydium as the final home for tokens that successfully bootstrap liquidity on Pump.fun.

Switching to PumpSwap has streamlined PumpFun's process for listing new tokens and cut costs for users, it said.

PumpSwap also plans to start distributing a portion of trading fees to coin creators, according to Pump.fun co-founder Alon. 

The newly launched DEX has already captured a more than 10% share of Solana's trading volumes and even overtaken Raydium — along with every other Solana app — in 24-hour fees, according to data from Dune Analytics and DefiLlama. On April 1, PumpSwap generated nearly $4 million in fees.

 The Securities and Exchange Commission and Gemini have asked for a 60-day stay of the regulator's lawsuit to “explore a potential resolution.” 

The US Securities and Exchange Commission and crypto exchange Gemini have asked to pause the regulator's suit over the exchange's Gemini Earn program, saying they want to discuss a potential resolution. 

In an April 1 letter to New York federal court judge Edgardo Ramos, lawyers representing the SEC and Genesis requested a 60-day hold on the case and that all deadlines be pulled “to allow the parties to explore a potential resolution.” 

“In this case, the parties submit that it is in each of their interests to stay this matter while they consider a potential resolution and agree that no party or non-party would be prejudiced by a stay,” the letter states.

The lawyers added that a stay was in the court's interest as “a resolution would conserve judicial resources” and proposed that a joint status report be submitted within 60 days after the entry of the stay.

The SEC sued Gemini and crypto lending firm Genesis Global Capital in January 2023, alleging they offered unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program.

In March 2024, Genesis agreed to pay $21 million to settle charges related to the lending program, but the enforcement case against Gemini remains outstanding.

The letter did not specify what a possible resolution would entail, but the SEC has dropped several lawsuits it launched against crypto companies under the Biden administration, including against Coinbase, Ripple and Kraken.

In February, Gemini said the SEC closed a separate investigation into the firm as the regulator winds back its crypto enforcement under President Donald Trump. 

“The SEC cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal bills alone and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation. Of course, Gemini is not alone,” Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss said at the time.

OpenSea, Crypto.com and Uniswap, among others, have also recently reported that the SEC had closed similar probes into their companies that were investigating alleged breaches of securities laws.

 AVAX lost over half its value during the past year despite the new liquidity, but the crypto market may find its bottom by June amid tariff negotiations. 

Avalanche saw a significant surge in stablecoin supply over the past year, but the onchain deployment of this capital points to passive investor behavior, which may be limiting demand for the network's utility token.

The stablecoin supply on the Avalanche network rose by over 70% over the past year, from $1.5 billion in March 2024, to over $2.5 billion as of March 31, 2025, according to Avalanche's X pos

Stablecoins are the main bridge between the fiat and crypto world and increasing stablecoin supply is often seen as a signal for incoming buying pressure and growing investor appetite.

However, Avalanche's (AVAX) token has been in a downtrend, dropping nearly 60% over the past year to trade above $19 as of 12:31 pm UTC, despite the $1 billion increase in stablecoin supply, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.

 In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, the chief investment officer discusses Bitcoin's risks, institutional adoption and why now could be the best time to invest. 

If you've ever wondered when is the right time to invest in Bitcoin (BTC), you won't want to miss our latest interview with Matt Hougan. As the chief investment officer at Bitwise, Hougan provides an in-depth analysis, explaining why, from a risk-adjusted perspective, there has never been a more opportune time to buy Bitcoin.

In our discussion, Hougan lays out a compelling argument: Bitcoin's early days were filled with uncertainty — technology risks, regulatory threats, trading inefficiencies, and reputational concerns. Fast forward to today, and those risks have significantly diminished. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs, adoption by major institutional investors, and even the US government's strategic Bitcoin reserve have all cemented its place in the global financial ecosystem. 

“Bitcoin is only 10% of gold. So just to match gold, which I think is just a stopping point on its long-term journey, it has to ten-x from here,” he said. 

But that's just the beginning. Hougan also touches on Bitcoin's long-term price potential, why institutional adoption is about to accelerate, and how market fundamentals could push Bitcoin to new heights. 

“There's just too much structural long-term demand that has to come into this market against a severely limited new supply,”  he said.

 “AI should belong to the community, not controlled by closed-source corporations,” Sentient's co-founder told Cointelegraph. 

Sentient, an artificial intelligence development platform backed by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, has released an open-source AI search framework that it says outperforms leading closed-source competitors.

The company announced the public release of Open Deep Search (ODS) on April 2, describing it as a high-performance, developer-friendly alternative to platforms like Perplexity AI and OpenAI's GPT-4o.

Sentient's ODS aims to empower developers with open-source “Loyal AI” models, which Sentient says preserve the original intent of their developers.

The firm's fingerprinting technology allows developers to protect intellectual property while maintaining model openness — aiming to solve the biggest issue of open-source AI, the challenges of monetizing a model without centralization.

“AI should belong to the community, not controlled by closed-source corporations,” according to Himanshu Tyagi, co-founder of Sentient and professor at the Indian Institute of Science.

“We're building, monetizing and delivering open-source AI with a key principle in mind: singularity in intelligence but plurality in use cases,” he added.

Sentient's ODS scored 75.3% accuracy on the “Frames” benchmark, which measures factuality, retrieval and reasoning capabilities, used to answer complex “multi-hop questions” that require the integration of multiple sources.

ODS surpassed OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o Search Preview's 50.5% and the Perplexity Sonar Reasoning Pro, which scored 44.4%. 

To prevent potential bias, Sentient ensured that its researchers didn't have access to the Frames testing sets during the benchmarking process.

“Independent verification is only needed for closed-source solutions because open-source solutions have no incentive to falsely report the evaluations,” Tyagi said, adding:

The ODS release follows growing interest in Sentient's platform. The firm said it amassed more than 1.8 million waitlist registrations in the lead-up to the launch.

The release of Sentient's new open-source search framework comes amid a tipping point for open-source AI development.

“We're witnessing a significant shift as open-source AI solutions increasingly challenge closed-source dominance,” Tyagi said.

“Examples such as DeepSeek's advancements in reasoning, Manus's innovations with agents, and now our own contributions to ODS with advanced AI search frameworks highlight this shift,” he added.

“Open-source models can easily outperform closed-source giants with the right architecture,” said Sewoong Oh, Sentient's lead researcher and professor at the University of Washington. “The results of these benchmarks validate our mission to create an open ecosystem that benefits all AI builders and users.”

The launch also builds on Sentient's earlier momentum. In February, the firm completed one of the largest NFT minting campaigns to date, with more than 650,000 participants gaining fractional ownership of its AI models.

 Decentralization involves spreading control and decision-making across a network instead of a single authority. Unlike centralized systems, where one entity controls everything, decentralized blockchains distribute data among participants (nodes). Each node holds a copy of the ledger, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of manipulation or system failure.In blockchain, a decentralized network provides significant advantages:Security: Decentralization reduces vulnerabilities associated with central points of attack. Without a single controlling entity, malicious actors find it more challenging to compromise the network. ​Transparency: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger accessible to all participants, fostering trust through transparency. This openness ensures that no single entity can manipulate data without consensus. ​Fault tolerance: Decentralized networks are more resilient to failures. Data distribution across multiple nodes ensures that the system remains operational even if some nodes fail. ​So, decentralization is good, but it's not a fixed state. It's more of a spectrum, constantly shifting as network participation, governance structures and consensus mechanisms evolve.And yes, there's a ruler for that. It's called the Nakamoto coefficient. 

Decentralization involves spreading control and decision-making across a network instead of a single authority. 

Unlike centralized systems, where one entity controls everything, decentralized blockchains distribute data among participants (nodes). Each node holds a copy of the ledger, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of manipulation or system failure.



In blockchain, a decentralized network provides significant advantages:

So, decentralization is good, but it's not a fixed state. It's more of a spectrum, constantly shifting as network participation, governance structures and consensus mechanisms evolve.

And yes, there's a ruler for that. It's called the Nakamoto coefficient.

 The Nakamoto coefficient is a metric used to quantify the decentralization of a blockchain network. It represents the minimum number of independent entities — such as validators, miners or node operators — that would need to collude to disrupt or compromise the network's normal operation. This concept was introduced in 2017 by former Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan and was named after Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. A higher Nakamoto coefficient indicates greater decentralization and security within the blockchain network. In such networks, control is more widely distributed among participants, making it more challenging for any small group to manipulate or attack the system. Conversely, a lower Nakamoto coefficient suggests fewer entities hold significant control, increasing the risk of centralization and potential vulnerabilities. ​For example, a blockchain with a Nakamoto coefficient of 1 would be highly centralized, as a single entity could control the network. In contrast, a network with a coefficient of 10 would require at least 10 independent entities to collude to exert control, reflecting a more decentralized and secure structure.​Did you know? Polkadot's high score on the Nakamoto coefficient is largely due to Polkadot's nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism, which promotes an even distribution of stakes among a large number of validators.

​Did you know? Polkadot's high score on the Nakamoto coefficient is largely due to Polkadot's nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism, which promotes an even distribution of stakes among a large number of validators. 

 Calculating this coefficient involves several key steps:​Identification of key entities: First, determine the primary actors within the network, such as mining pools, validators, node operators or stakeholders. These entities play significant roles in maintaining the network's operations and security.Assessment of each entity's control: Next, evaluate the extent of control each identified entity has over the network's resources. For instance, in proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin, this involves analyzing the hashrate distribution among mining pools. In proof-of-stake (PoS) systems it requires examining the stake distribution among validators.Summation to determine the 51% threshold: After assessing individual controls, rank the entities from highest to lowest based on their influence. Then, cumulatively add their control percentages until the combined total exceeds 51%. The number of entities required to reach this threshold represents the Nakamoto coefficient.Consider a PoW blockchain with the following mining pool distribution:Mining pool A: 25% (of the total hashrate)​Mining pool B: 20%​Mining pool C: 15%​Mining pool D: 10%​Others: 30%​To determine the Nakamoto coefficient:​Start with mining pool A (25%).​Add mining pool B (25%   20% = 45%).​Add mining pool C (45%   15% = 60%).​In this scenario, the combined hashrate of mining pools A, B and C reaches 60%, surpassing the 51% threshold. Therefore, the Nakamoto coefficient is 3, indicating that collusion among these three entities could compromise the network's integrity. Did you know? ​Despite Bitcoin's reputation for decentralization, its mining subsystem is notably centralized. The Nakamoto coefficient is currently 2 for Bitcoin. This means that just two mining pools control most of Bitcoin's mining power.

 While the Nakamoto coefficient serves as a valuable metric for assessing blockchain decentralization, it possesses certain limitations that warrant careful consideration.​ For example: Static snapshotThe Nakamoto coefficient provides a static snapshot of decentralization, reflecting the minimum number of entities required to compromise a network at a specific point in time. However, blockchain networks are dynamic, with participant roles and influence evolving due to factors like staking, mining power shifts or node participation changes. Consequently, the coefficient may not accurately capture these temporal fluctuations, potentially leading to outdated or misleading assessments. ​Subsystem focusThis metric typically focuses on specific subsystems, such as validators or mining pools, potentially overlooking other critical aspects of decentralization. Factors like client software diversity, geographical distribution of nodes and token ownership concentration also significantly impact a network's decentralization and security. Relying solely on the Nakamoto coefficient might result in an incomplete evaluation.Consensus mechanism variationsDifferent blockchain networks employ various consensus mechanisms, each influencing decentralization differently. The Nakamoto coefficient may not uniformly apply across these diverse systems, necessitating tailored approaches for accurate measurement. ​External InfluencesExternal factors, including regulatory actions, technological advancements or market dynamics, can influence decentralization over time. For example, regulatory policies in specific regions might affect the operation of nodes or mining facilities, thereby altering the network's decentralization landscape. The Nakamoto coefficient may not account for such externalities, limiting its comprehensiveness.To sum up, the Nakamoto coefficient is useful for assessing certain aspects of blockchain decentralization. It should be used alongside other metrics and qualitative assessments to gain a comprehensive understanding of a network's decentralization and security.

 Representative Maxine Waters suggested that any stablecoin bills in Congress should receive no support unless Republicans address Donald Trump's conflicts of interest. 

California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, used her opening statement at a markup hearing to criticize President Donald Trump's business and ethical entanglements with the crypto industry, including the launch of a stablecoin by a family-backed company.

Addressing lawmakers at an April 2 hearing, Waters said Trump had used his position as president to leverage “multiple crypto schemes” for profit, including a US dollar-pegged stablecoin launched by World Liberty Financial (WLFI) — the firm backed by his family. 

The California lawmaker pointed to Trump's memecoin launched in January, his plans to establish a national cryptocurrency stockpile, and “his own stablecoin,” referring to WLFI's USD1 token launched in March.

“With this stablecoin bill, this committee is setting an unacceptable and dangerous precedent, validating the president and his insiders' efforts to write rules of the road that will enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else,” said Waters, adding:

Waters does not stand alone in her criticism of Trump's crypto ventures, with many lawmakers and experts across the political spectrum suggesting potential conflicts of interest. 

Committee Chair French Hill, who spoke on stablecoins before Waters, also reportedly said that the Trump family's involvement in the industry makes legislation “more complicated.”

“If there is no effort to block the President of the United States of America from owning his stablecoin business [...] I will never be able to agree on supporting this bill, and I would ask other members not to be enablers,” said Waters. 

Related: Crypto has a regulatory capture problem in Washington — Or does it?

Representative Bryan Steil, who introduced the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy, or STABLE Act, did not immediately address Waters' concerns about Trump's stablecoin but referred to establishing safeguards for consumers. 

Hill did not mention Trump in his opening statement but said there needed to be a “clear federal framework” for payment stablecoins.

The committee will consider amendments to the STABLE Act, as well as bills to combat illicit finance using emerging financial technologies and blocking the US government from issuing a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. 

The markup hearing was a necessary step before the committee could vote on whether to advance the bills to the House of Representatives.

The flattening 20-day exponential moving average ($85,152) and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint signal the bears are losing their grip. That improves the prospects of a rally above the resistance line. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could climb to $95,000 and eventually to $100,000.

Alternatively, if the price turns down sharply from the resistance line and breaks below $81,000, it will suggest that the bears are back in the driver's seat. The pair may then tumble to $76,606.

Ether (ETH) rebounded off the $1,754 support on March 31, signaling that the bulls are attempting to form a double-bottom pattern.

The bears will try to stall the relief rally at the 20-day EMA ($1,965). If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the possibility of a break below $1,574 increases. The ETH/USDT pair may then collapse to $1,550.

Contrarily, a break and close above the 20-day EMA opens the doors for a rise to the breakdown level of $2,111. If buyers pierce this resistance, the pair will complete a double-bottom pattern, starting a rally to the target objective of $2,468.

XRP's (XRP) weak bounce off the crucial $2 support suggests a lack of aggressive buying by the bulls at the current levels.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

That heightens the risk of a break below $2. If that happens, the XRP/USDT pair will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. This negative setup could start a downward move to $1.27. There is support at $1.77, but it is likely to be broken.

On the upside, a break and close above the 50-day SMA ($2.39) suggests solid buying at lower levels. The pair may then rally to the resistance line, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. A break and close above the resistance line signals a potential trend change.

BNB's (BNB) recovery attempt stalled at the moving averages on April 1, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The bears will try to strengthen their position by pulling the price below $587. If they can pull it off, the BNB/USDT pair could descend to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $575 and later to the 61.8% retracement of $559. The deeper the pullback, the greater the time needed for the pair to recover.

A break above the moving averages is the first sign that the selling pressure has reduced. The pair may rally to $644 and then to $686, which is likely to attract sellers.

Solana (SOL) is getting squeezed between the 20-day EMA ($132) and the $120 support, signaling a possible range expansion in the short term.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

If the price breaks and closes above the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the buyers have overpowered the sellers. The SOL/USDT pair may rise to the 50-day SMA ($145) and, after that, to $180.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down from the moving averages and breaks below $120. That could pull the price to $110, where the buyers are expected to step in.

Dogecoin (DOGE) remains pinned below the 20-day EMA ($0.17), indicating that the bears continue to sell on minor rallies.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA. The DOGE/USDT pair may climb to $0.21, which could act as a strong barrier. If buyers pierce the $0.21 resistance, the pair may rally to $0.24 and later to $0.29.

Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to defend the moving averages and pull the price below $0.16. If they manage to do that, the pair could descend to the $0.14 support. A break and close below the $0.14 level may sink the pair to $0.10.

Buyers are trying to push Cardano (ADA) back above the uptrend line, but the bears are likely to sell near the moving averages.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.71) and the RSI just below the midpoint signal that bears have the edge. If the price turns down and breaks below $0.63, the ADA/USDT pair could plunge to $0.58 and thereafter to $0.50.

Buyers will have to drive and maintain the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.75) to signal a potential trend change in the near term. The pair could rally to $0.84, which may act as a hurdle.

Toncoin (TON) broke above the $4.14 resistance on March 1, but the bulls could not sustain the breakout.

TON/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to slip much below $4.14. That increases the possibility of a break above the overhead resistance. The TON/USDT pair could rally to $5 and later to $5.50.

The 20-day EMA ($3.71) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. If the support cracks, it will signal that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair may slide to the 50-day SMA ($3.48) and then to $2.81.

Chainlink (LINK) tried to rise above the 20-day EMA ($14.32) on April 1, but the bears held their ground.

LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

Sellers will try to pull the price to the support line of the descending channel pattern, which remains the key short-term level to keep an eye on. If the price breaks below the support line, the LINK/USDT pair could descend to $10.

If buyers want to prevent the downside, they will have to push and maintain the price above the 50-day SMA ($15.47). If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $17.50 and subsequently to the resistance line.

UNUS SED LEO (LEO) turned down from the overhead resistance of $9.90 and plunged below the uptrend line on March 30.

LEO/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

However, the bears could not sustain the lower levels, and the bulls pushed the price back into the triangle on April 1. The recovery is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($9.60). If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below the uptrend line, it increases the risk of a fall to $8.

Instead, if the LEO/USD pair breaks above the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the markets have rejected the breakdown. A breakout and close above $9.90 will complete an ascending triangle pattern, which has a target objective of $12.04.

 Google threat intelligence says North Korea's fake workers have also increased extortion attempts as they're under pressure to maintain money streams amid a US crackdown. 

Fraudulent tech workers with ties to North Korea are expanding their infiltration operations to blockchain firms outside the US after increased scrutiny from authorities, with some having worked their way into UK crypto projects, Google says.

Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) adviser Jamie Collier said in an April 2 report that while the US is still a key target, increased awareness and right-to-work verification challenges have forced North Korean IT workers to find roles at non-US companies.

“In response to heightened awareness of the threat within the United States, they've established a global ecosystem of fraudulent personas to enhance operational agility,” Collier said. 

“Coupled with the discovery of facilitators in the UK, this suggests the rapid formation of a global infrastructure and support network that empowers their continued operations,” he added.

The North Korea-linked workers are infiltrating projects spanning traditional web development and advanced blockchain applications, such as projects involving Solana and Anchor smart contract development, according to Collier. 

Another project building a blockchain job marketplace and an artificial intelligence web application leveraging blockchain technologies was also found to have North Korean workers. 

“These individuals pose as legitimate remote workers to infiltrate companies and generate revenue for the regime,” Collier said. 

Along with the UK, Collier says the GTIG identified a notable focus on Europe, with one worker using at least 12 personas across Europe and others using resumes listing degrees from Belgrade University in Serbia and residences in Slovakia. 

Separate GTIG investigations found personas seeking employment in Germany and Portugal, login credentials for user accounts of European job websites, instructions for navigating European job sites, and a broker specializing in false passports.

At the same time, since late October, the North Korean workers have increased the volume of extortion attempts and gone after larger organizations, which the GTIG speculates is the workers feeling pressure to maintain revenue streams amid a crackdown in the US. 

“In these incidents, recently fired IT workers threatened to release their former employers' sensitive data or to provide it to a competitor. This data included proprietary data and source code for internal projects,” Collier said.

In January, the US Justice Department indicted two North Korean nationals for their involvement in a fraudulent IT work scheme involving at least 64 US companies from April 2018 to August 2024.

The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control also sanctioned companies it accused of being fronts for North Korea that generated revenue via remote IT work schemes.

Crypto founders have also been reporting an increase in activity from North Korean hackers, with at least three founders reporting on March 13 that they foiled attempts to steal sensitive data through fake Zoom calls.

 Kentucky's Department of Financial Institutions is the third state-level regulator in the past month to drop its action over Coinbase's staking rewards. 

Kentucky's finance watchdog has dismissed its lawsuit against Coinbase over the exchange's staking rewards program, following its peers in Vermont and South Carolina.

Kentucky's Department of Financial Institutions filed the stipulation to dismiss jointly with Coinbase on April 1, ending the state's legal action against the exchange first filed along with 10 other state regulators in June 2023.

Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal posted to X on April 1, calling for Congress “to end this litigation-driven, state-by-state approach with a federal market structure law.”

Financial regulators from 10 states launched similar suits against Coinbase in June 2023, on the same day the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the exchange — a lawsuit the SEC dropped last month.

Alabama, California, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington and Wisconsin are the seven states that are still continuing with their lawsuits, which all allege Coinbase breached securities laws with its staking rewards program.

Vermont was the first state to end its suit against Coinbase, with its Department of Financial Regulation filing an order to rescind the action on March 13, noting the SEC's Feb. 27 decision to drop its action against the exchange and the likelihood of changes in the federal regulator's guidance.

The South Carolina Attorney General's securities division followed Vermont days later, dismissing its lawsuit in a joint stipulation with Coinbase on March 27.

Kentucky's decision to drop its case against Coinbase follows just days after the state's governor, Andy Beshear, signed a “Bitcoin Rights” bill into law on March 24 that establishes protections for crypto self-custody and exempts crypto mining from money transmitting and securities laws.

The axed state-level lawsuits come amid a stark policy change at the SEC, which has dropped or delayed multiple lawsuits against crypto companies that it filed under the Biden administration.

The federal securities watchdog has also created a Crypto Task Force that is engaging with the industry on how it should approach cryptocurrencies.

 XRP's daily settlement volume in US dollars has risen substantially after Trump's reelection but remains far below Bitcoin and Ethereum despite its price rally. 

XRP (XRP), the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has been touted by proponents as a high-speed, low-cost solution for cross-border payments. But just how much value flows through the network on a daily basis? Let's examine.

Based on recent data from Glassnode, XRP's daily transfer volume settled on its blockchain in US dollars frequently ranges between $300 million and $1 billion. 

However, since November 2024, when Donald Trump won the US presidential election, XRP has settled an average of $2.28 billion per day, signifying heightened network activity likely fueled by XRP's price boom in the same period.

That said, these spikes don't necessarily reflect steady adoption or payment activity; instead, they could further be tied to speculative behavior, Ripple-related transfers, whale moves, and reshuffling between exchanges. 

One important factor behind the spikes in XRP's daily transfer volume is large token sales by Ripple and its co-founder, Chris Larsen.

On Sept. 18, he transferred 50 million XRP (~$29 million) from a wallet inactive for 11+ years.

🚨 🚨  50,000,000 #XRP (29,120,312 USD) transferred from Chris Larsen to unknown wallethttps://t.co/D9iopMqePM

By early 2025, Larsen had sold over $116 million worth of XRP.

These sales reduced XRP reserves on one of his wallets from 500 million to 410 million XRP.

Previously, the SEC estimated Larsen sold ~$453.69 million worth of XRP between 2017 and 2020.

The 2024–2025 sales stand out for their scale and timing during XRP's rally past $3.

Ripple started selling XRP from escrow in 2017, releasing up to 1 billion XRP/month, often returning unsold tokens.

It sold $91.6 million during the cryptocurrency's 30,000% rally in Q4 2017

In Q3 2018, Ripple sold $163 million during volatile markets.

In Q2 2019, the firm sold $251 million in XRP, one of its largest sales.

Sales dropped to $1.75M in Q1 2020, likely due to regulatory pressure from the SEC.

Across 2021, around $1.5B were sold, per Ripple's reports.

This suggests that Ripple tends to ramp up sales during bullish periods and scale back during XRP price downtrends.

In 2017, Ripple locked 55 billion XRP—the majority of the total supply—into a series of escrow contracts. Each contract held 1 billion XRP, set to be released monthly over 55 months.

However, any unused portion is returned to escrow, with a new contract pushed to the back of the queue, i.e., re-locked for 55 months.

During active sale periods, these movements could result in noticeable spikes in total transfer volume, especially when paired with high speculative interest.

Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate XRP in terms of daily transfer volume, highlighting broader adoption and greater trust in these ecosystems.

The overall average daily transfer volume for Bitcoin across the full data set is approximately $23.26 billion, according to Glassnode.

In recent years, the network has settled an average of $64.03 billion per day over the past 30 days, likely due to strong institutional flows, ETF-driven activity, and speculative trading.

Meanwhile, Ethereum's overall daily transfer volume is approximately $2.53 billion. But its recent 30-day average of the same comes to be at around $5.67 billion.

Transfer volume is a key onchain metric, showing how much real value is settled daily via blockchain. High volumes, especially when sustained, indicate greater user activity in moving money onchain. 

Bitcoin and Ethereum see consistent activity from custodians, ETFs, and DeFi apps.

In XRP's case, however, usage appears concentrated around trading cycles. Despite Ripple's efforts to promote XRP in cross-border settlements via On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), onchain volumes suggest limited adoption among enterprise users.

However, XRPL has recently introduced tools for stablecoin issuance, tokenization, and EVM compatibility.

Kyrgyzstan continues to solidify its position as a regional crypto hub. The country is advancing its digital asset regulation, testing legal frameworks, and launching licensed platforms. One of the key steps in this direction is the launch of A7A5 — a stablecoin pegged to the Russian ruble within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The token was issued by the Kyrgyz company Old Vector, in full compliance with local regulatory requirements and with the support of the Kyrgyz government.

As part of the strategic course set by the country's president, Kyrgyzstan has adopted a comprehensive package of laws regulating the cryptocurrency market. For the first time, the country has introduced full legislation on digital assets, covering all major aspects of the industry — from exchanges to token issuers. This has created a new institutional infrastructure that did not previously exist in the market.

Among the unique innovations is the mechanism for registering token issuances under official state supervision. Regulators ensure that token emissions comply with regulatory requirements, have fiat backing, undergo regular audits, and meet obligations to token holders. In essence, Kyrgyzstan provides one of the most transparent and secure tokenization models in the world.

The first issuance of A7A5 (mint) was carried out in complete accordance with the new national legislation — under the control of regulatory authorities and directed to an officially registered, regulated broker.

The A7A5 token is now available for trading on the regulated exchange Meer Exchange and is expected to be listed on decentralized platforms in the future. Its fiat backing is stored in bank accounts, and its volume is audited by an independent firm on a quarterly basis. The key advantage of A7A5 is the opportunity to earn up to 20% annually, driven by its link to the refinancing rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and additional income strategies in DeFi.

The digital asset market is moving toward the integration of traditional finance with decentralized technologies. The emergence of stablecoins has enabled users to:

However, despite the overall growth of the segment, stablecoins denominated in other currencies are still in their early stages.

Although the segment has seen significant capitalization, stablecoins other than the dollar still have very limited trading volumes:

This limits the potential for building robust currency strategies, including FX and carry trades, which are at the core of the global financial market with a daily volume exceeding $7 trillion.

To execute a traditional carry trade strategy in the digital space, several key elements are still missing:

The launch of A7A5, followed by its listing on both CEX and DEX, marks the first step in expanding the range of tools available to crypto investors, including:

A7A5 is designed for investors who are ready to leverage next-generation technologies to achieve higher returns, given the limited alternatives in the world of traditional finance.

The listing on Meer Exchange ensures liquidity, transparency, and institutional access to a new class of digital assets tied to the Russian economy and emerging markets.

Metrics details

Anthropogenic biodiversity decline threatens the functioning of ecosystems and the many benefits they provide to humanity1. As well as causing species losses in directly affected locations, human influence might also reduce biodiversity in relatively unmodified vegetation if far-reaching anthropogenic effects trigger local extinctions and hinder recolonization. Here we show that local plant diversity is globally negatively related to the level of anthropogenic activity in the surrounding region. Impoverishment of natural vegetation was evident only when we considered community completeness: the proportion of all suitable species in the region that are present at a site. To estimate community completeness, we compared the number of recorded species with the dark diversity—ecologically suitable species that are absent from a site but present in the surrounding region2. In the sampled regions with a minimal human footprint index, an average of 35% of suitable plant species were present locally, compared with less than 20% in highly affected regions. Besides having the potential to uncover overlooked threats to biodiversity, dark diversity also provides guidance for nature conservation. Species in the dark diversity remain regionally present, and their local populations might be restored through measures that improve connectivity between natural vegetation fragments and reduce threats to population persistence.

Direct detrimental effects of anthropogenic activity on the biodiversity of natural ecosystems have been extensively documented3,4. For example, conversion of natural forest into urban landcover5 or transformation of grassland into cropland6 causes conspicuous declines in biodiversity. Biodiversity may also decline in ecosystems that are not directly modified but occur in regions in which human activities have caused habitat fragmentation7 or exert diffuse effects on natural areas—through pollution, for example8. Although compelling case studies show the influence of human activities on surrounding natural vegetation, beyond a direct area of impact8,9,10, there is no empirical evidence demonstrating the generality of regional-scale anthropogenic effects on local biodiversity in natural vegetation. Comparisons of relatively undisturbed vegetation inside and outside protected areas have revealed no discernible differences in local biodiversity11, but this overlooks the possibility that biodiversity has declined systematically in both settings12,13. The lack of empirical evidence might stem from the masking effect of high variation in biodiversity across regions and along ecological gradients14,15,16. We hypothesize that anthropogenic impoverishment of natural ecosystems can be revealed by the dark diversity—species that are ecologically suitable and present in a region but currently absent from a given site2. Dark diversity allows estimation of community completeness, a biodiversity metric that represents the proportion of all suitable species in a region that are actually present at a site17. This metric is globally comparable because it accounts for natural variation in potential biodiversity. Estimating the ecological suitability of species that are absent from a site is challenging, but methodological advances offer a solution based on species co-occurrences18.

The notion of dark diversity aligns with Whittaker's classic alpha–beta–gamma diversity framework19—a cornerstone of modern biodiversity research (Fig. 1). In Whittaker's work, alpha diversity represented the number of species at a particular site, gamma diversity comprised all species found in the surrounding region and beta diversity described changes in community composition along environmental gradients. The dark diversity concept is taxon-oriented, because it considers the suitability of each absent species for a study site. When aggregated, alpha and dark diversity together constitute the site-specific species pool, which includes only those species from the region that are suitable for a given site on the basis of its ecological conditions. In this context, beta diversity, as first defined by Whittaker, can be articulated as the change in site-specific species pools within gamma diversity. This is sometimes referred to as ‘structured' beta diversity, whereas ‘unstructured' beta diversity represents the variation in species composition among sampled sites within an ecologically similar area20,21. The dark diversity concept enhances the alpha–beta–gamma framework by providing a site-specific toolbox that complements alpha diversity at a site with the set of suitable yet absent species (dark diversity), the biodiversity potential of the site (species pool size) and the degree to which this potential is realized (community completeness).

a, Data included a local study site where certain species were present, but many species sampled elsewhere in the region were absent. To estimate the probability that a species that is absent from the site but present in the region belongs to the dark diversity of the site, we used information about species co-occurrences at other sites in the region. b, We calculated an indicator matrix in which each present species indicated the ecological suitability of each absent species for the study site. We compared the observed number of co-occurrences with the number of co-occurrences expected at random (according to the hypergeometric distribution) and standardized the difference using the standard deviation from the hypergeometric distribution. c, By averaging across all observed species, each absent species was assigned a probability of belonging to the dark diversity for the study site. Consequently, the dark diversity was a fuzzy set to which species belonged to varying degrees. d, Several biodiversity metrics were characterized for each site in the region. Alpha diversity was the number of species recorded at the site, and gamma diversity was the total number of species recorded in a region. The size of dark diversity was estimated as the sum of the probabilities of absent species belonging to the dark diversity of the study site. Alpha and dark diversity together formed the site-specific species pool, and gamma diversity not falling into this category was considered the unsuitable part of gamma diversity; that is, belonging to the species pools of other sites. We investigated the percentage of the species pool that was present among the alpha diversity (community completeness) and the turnover of species pools in the region, expressed as the percentage of gamma diversity that was unsuitable for the study site (beta diversity).

Alpha diversity is the most commonly used biodiversity metric, but it depends on variation in natural biodiversity potential between regions (for example, boreal versus temperate regions; North America versus East Asia) and ecological conditions within regions (for example, wetlands versus forests; south-facing versus north-facing slopes). Speciation, large-scale dispersal, species sorting and stochastic variation have produced site-specific species pools of considerably different sizes22. Community completeness accounts for such variation by quantifying the extent to which the biodiversity potential (that is, the site-specific species pool) is realized locally17. Even in natural ecosystems, some suitable taxa might be absent owing to natural processes that cause local extinction or limit recolonization. Such limiting processes vary along environmental gradients, reflected in the global patterns of plant persistence strategies23 and interactions with other organisms; for example, seed predators24. Consequently, there is likely to be natural variation in community completeness across broad environmental gradients25. In addition, regions with high geodiversity or a mosaic of vegetation types (that is, high structured beta diversity) might have lower community completeness because the isolation of natural habitat fragments and the likelihood of local extinction increase26. Furthermore, climatic conditions leave some regions prone to extreme events, such as natural fire, that cause local species loss27,28. Nevertheless, in addition to natural variation, human activities might strongly influence community completeness by reducing the persistence of local populations; for example, by promoting highly competitive taxa (through eutrophication, for instance8) or by restricting mutualistic interactions (reducing pollinators, for instance29). Similarly, human activities might hinder the recolonization of suitable sites through habitat fragmentation7 and loss of seed-dispersing animals30.

To determine whether anthropogenic impoverishment of natural vegetation is a worldwide phenomenon, we established DarkDivNet, a global collaborative research network31. Using a standardized methodology, we assessed both the alpha and the dark diversity of vascular plants across 5,415 sites with relatively intact natural or semi-natural vegetation, in 119 regions, spanning a wide range of vegetation types and representative of most global climatic conditions on all vegetated continents (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2).

In our study, ‘site' refers to a 100-m2 area in which vegetation was sampled, and ‘region' represents the surrounding area of approximately 300 km2. Each region encompasses at least 30 sites, representing the natural and semi-natural vegetation typical of the region. We first confirmed that the sampling area of 100 m2 provided highly similar estimates of dark diversity to those obtained from a considerably larger area of 2,500 m2 (Extended Data Fig. 3). We assessed alpha diversity as the number of all vascular plant species found at each site. To estimate dark diversity, we used a fuzzy set approach in which all species occurring in the region but absent from the site were assigned a probability of inclusion in the dark diversity on the basis of an established co-occurrence methodology18. The use of probabilities maximizes the amount of information used for estimating dark diversity. Specifically, co-occurrences were based on the species composition of 30 randomly selected sites in the region (Fig. 1a). Using a subset of regions in which 60 sites were available yielded highly similar outcomes, indicating that 30 sites were sufficient for estimating co-occurrence patterns among species (Extended Data Fig. 3). We estimated the degree to which each species present in a region but absent from a site co-occurred with species found at the site, and compared it with random expectation, mathematically described by the hypergeometric distribution (Fig. 1b). If an absent species co-occurred with a present species more than would be randomly expected, they probably shared ecological requirements, and the present species provided a positive indication of the site's suitability for the absent species. The overall suitability of the site for the absent species was estimated by averaging the suitability indications from all species present at the site (Fig. 1c). The magnitude of dark diversity at a site was then estimated as the sum of these suitability estimates (probabilities of absent species belonging to the dark diversity of the site, ranging between 0 and 1) across all absent species. The unsuitable fraction of gamma diversity reflects the species belonging to different site-specific species pools in the same region. Using alpha diversity, dark diversity and the unsuitable diversity found in the region, we calculated other biodiversity metrics for each site to have a full description of biodiversity (Fig. 1d): site-specific species pool size as the sum of alpha and dark diversity; gamma diversity as the total set of species found in a region (this value was the same for each site within a region); community completeness as the proportion of the site-specific species pool size represented by alpha diversity; and beta diversity as a quantification of the extent to which gamma diversity exceeds the site-specific species pool size (that is, the proportion of gamma diversity that is unsuitable for the study site and is more likely to be associated with different site-specific species pools in the region). In this way, we specifically quantified the ‘structured' beta diversity, or turnover in site-specific species pool composition due to environmental gradients. In the statistical analyses, community completeness and beta diversity were included as log-ratios (logit transformation of percentages) to improve the distribution of the data. We used two independent datasets (expert assessments and examination of species found in the close vicinity of the site) to ensure that the co-occurrence method provided consistent estimates of species suitability for dark diversity (Extended Data Fig. 2). We also determined that, for this particular dataset, the hypergeometric method outperformed an alternative approach—joint species distribution modelling32 (see Supplementary Methods).

The median community completeness of sites across all regions was 25% (95% confidence interval 15–46%), highlighting a frequent absence of suitable species despite their presence in surrounding regions (Fig. 2a). The existence of relatively high dark diversity is clearly a general phenomenon, but the large variation meant that sometimes much fewer species were present locally than might be expected from the specific site conditions. To understand how much variation in alpha diversity was explained by community completeness besides beta and gamma diversity, we used variation partitioning. We found that 33% (26–43%) of the variation in alpha diversity was explained by community completeness. Consequently, if human activities reduce the colonization and persistence of suitable species, resulting in lower community completeness, this could substantially affect alpha diversity. The largest proportion of variation in alpha diversity, 52% (40–61%), was explained by gamma diversity, reflecting the well-known match of local and regional diversity33, whereas 14% (9–21%) was explained by beta diversity, reflecting how gamma diversity is distributed across different site-specific species pools. The strong dependence of alpha diversity on regional richness is clearly sufficient to mask the negative effect of human activities on alpha diversity.

The prediction line from a multiple linear regression model is shown with the 95% confidence intervals. Note that community completeness values on the y axis are back-transformed from the logit scale. The symbol tones indicate forest cover (0–100%). R² value of the model and two-tailed P value of the relationship are shown; n = 116 regions. The distribution of community completeness is shown in the histogram on the right (median, 25%). b, Left, model summaries linking community completeness to the human footprint index and its components across spatial scales. Human influence was averaged over various spatial scales around the study regions (radii 10 km, 50 km, 100 km, 200 km, 300 km and 400 km), and the respective models were compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Filled symbols indicate significant relationships (P < 0.05), and the large symbol indicates the set of best significant models (ΔAIC < 2). Right, from the best model (the smallest scale at which ΔAIC < 2), the effect of the human footprint index or one of its components is shown as a standardized coefficient (dot) with a 95% confidence interval (CI; line); n = 116 regions. Filled symbols and bold confidence interval lines indicate significant effects. c, Map of sampling regions, with community completeness indicated by symbol size and the underlying map showing the global variation in the human footprint index34 (the highest value within each grid cell of around 0.25° × 0.25°). The inset shows part of Europe containing a large number of study regions. Triangles indicate regions in which only woody species were sampled. Symbol tones indicate the percentage of forests in regions.

We tested the hypothesis that impoverishment of natural vegetation is related to anthropogenic influence in the surrounding region by building a series of models with various biodiversity metrics (community completeness, alpha diversity, beta diversity, gamma diversity, dark diversity and species pool size) as response variables. To estimate the intensity of human activities in the surrounding regions, we used the human footprint index from 2018 (the year our sampling began)—a well-established cumulative metric of human influence34—along with all of its eight components, including human population density and various human infrastructure layers. We averaged human influence at various spatial scales around the study region (radii from 10 km to 400 km), because human influence can reach far from mapped features. For example, poaching and logging can occur tens of kilometres from human settlements35 and are facilitated by many unmapped ‘ghost roads' that start from documented roads and lead into natural areas36. Similarly, anthropogenic ignition of fires can occur hundreds of kilometres from main roads37. Aerial pollution is often deposited several hundreds of kilometres from its source35, and land use can change local climate over similar scales38. To account for the effects of natural processes on biodiversity (for example, geodiversity, habitat patchiness and likelihood of natural fires), we included in our statistical models variables describing climatic, soil and topographic conditions, which we derived from global GIS layers and summarized using four principal component axes. Using fivefold spatial block cross-validation, we determined that linear models produced lower prediction errors with test data, compared with nonlinear alternatives (around 20% versus 40%). We therefore used linear models in further analyses.

The human footprint index and community completeness exhibited a robust negative linear relationship (Fig. 2a), which was already significant when the average human footprint index within a 50-km radius around the site was used, but became even more pronounced when radii of 300 km or larger were considered (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Table 1). In the sampled regions with minimal human footprint index values (close to zero), an average of 35% of suitable species were found in the 100-m2 sites, but this proportion declined to less than 20% in regions with high human impact. However, there was still variation in community completeness at both the low and the high ends of the human footprint index, showing that sites do not respond uniformly. In contrast to community completeness, alpha diversity was not strongly related to the human footprint index, and nor were the other tested metrics, except beta diversity (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Extended Data Table 1). These results are consistent with our hypothesis that local biodiversity is lower in natural vegetation surrounded by regions with more human activity, but this effect was evident only when we considered community completeness. Raw estimates of alpha diversity were strongly influenced by the wide natural variation in diversity potential determined by the specific biogeographical history of each region. Our results were consistent for six of the eight individual components of the human footprint index: human population density, the extent of electric infrastructure, railways, roads, built environments and croplands all exhibited negative relationships with community completeness (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Table 2). The extent of pasture was an exception to this pattern, because it was not negatively related to community completeness. This could be due to the influence of semi-natural grasslands, in which long-term moderate human influence, including grazing of domestic animals, cultural burning and haymaking, has resulted in highly diverse and well-functioning ecosystems, exemplifying how certain human activities can actually promote native biodiversity39. We found that the effect of the human footprint index was strongest when averaged over a range of several hundred kilometres. Besides incorporating far-reaching human influence, larger scales might also more accurately capture cumulative human influence in a particular region over long time periods40. However, including in the model a variable representing change in the index between 2000 and 2013 did not reduce the Akaike information criterion (AIC) by more than two units, which suggests that anthropogenic effects have operated over longer timescales. To account for the effects of natural processes on community completeness, our models included environmental variables. We found that community completeness decreased along the first principal component (Extended Data Table 1). Thus, suitable species are more likely to fall into the dark diversity in regions characterized by acidic organic soils and higher precipitation (see correlations of principal component axes in Extended Data Fig. 5). Dark diversity, gamma diversity and species pool size increased along the first axis (representing higher soil carbon content, acidity and precipitation; Extended Data Table 1). Alpha and beta diversities showed no significant relationships with the environmental axes.

The negative effect of human activities on community completeness might be associated with several phenomena. Human activities might have led to the fragmentation or reduction of suitable habitats, resulting in smaller populations that are more susceptible to random extinction9. In addition, habitat loss is likely to have decreased connectivity between remaining patches of natural vegetation, making it difficult for species to move between areas41, and defaunation might have disrupted plant seed dispersal networks30. Beyond habitat loss, some anthropogenic disturbances, such as tree cutting, illegal harvesting of plants and human-induced wildfires, can cause local extinctions in natural vegetation10,42. Moreover, regional human impact can affect natural ecosystems through pollution from roads and other human infrastructure; eutrophication is the most serious threat to plant diversity, because it disproportionally favours a few competitively superior species at the expense of a greater number of other species8.

Using average human influence as an explanatory variable can mask differences between regions. For example, regions that comprise both highly modified areas (for example, cities) and nature reserves, as well as those experiencing moderate human influence throughout (for example, agricultural landscapes with smaller settlements), might both exhibit an intermediate level of average human influence. We therefore tested how the distribution of the human footprint index within regions affected community completeness. Notably, we found that community completeness had an even stronger negative relationship with anthropogenic influence when we used the 30% quantile of the human footprint index values found within regions (Extended Data Fig. 6). This result suggests that completeness is determined mainly by the extent to which the most natural areas in a region already experience human influence. The idea that 30% coverage of natural vegetation in a landscape supports the persistence of many specialist taxa was proposed previously43, and aligns with the global target of the Convention on Biological Diversity to protect 30% of land by the year 2030. Our results therefore underscore the importance of devising regional-scale conservation strategies that include maintaining well-preserved natural areas44.

The turnover of site-specific species pools within regions (structured beta diversity) was significantly positively associated with the human footprint index (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1). This might reflect a human preference for naturally diverse regions with a range of different resources45. Alternatively, human activities could have promoted plant diversity over millennia by expanding semi-natural habitats and modifying natural ecosystems39. Most components of the human footprint index generally exhibited similar relationships, except for the extent of navigable waterways and pastures, which were negatively related to beta diversity (Supplementary Table 1). It is likely that coastal and riverine regions, and those suitable for livestock grazing, naturally exhibit relatively low variation in vegetation types.

The finding that high human footprint index values in a region are associated with low community completeness persisted in several other robustness tests (Supplementary Methods). Statistical interactions between the human footprint index and environmental gradients did not improve the model. Because naturally high beta diversity might decrease community completeness owing to the spatial separation of ecologically similar sites, and because beta diversity was correlated with human influence, we used structural equation modelling to examine the direct and indirect effects of human influence on community completeness. The negative direct effect of the human footprint index on community completeness persisted even if there was an additional negative direct effect of beta diversity. In addition, the effect of the human footprint index on community completeness was consistent across sampling scales (2,500 m2 or twice as many sites for species co-occurrences), when we excluded alien or very rare species, when regions with only woody species records were included and when we considered the proportion of forest cover in regions. Community completeness was slightly lower in more forested regions. The most parsimonious explanation for this might be a scaling effect—fewer large plant individuals can fit into a fixed area46. We also examined the possible effect of geographically uneven sampling by selecting a single study region from each ecoregion (the anthropogenic effect was always negative), adding the European continent as a factor to the model (the negative relationship remained significant) and investigating model residuals (no significant spatial autocorrelation was apparent). Community completeness was slightly lower in Europe than in other regions, which could reflect a cumulative effect of long-term human influence40.

This global-scale study reveals general patterns, and linkage to specific drivers is based on ecological interpretation rather than experimentation. It is also clear that the human footprint index does not provide a proxy for all potentially important processes, such as the disruption of biotic interaction networks, increasingly frequent climate extremes or the habitat destruction and fragmentation caused by war. The plethora of processes affecting biodiversity certainly contributes to variation around the general trends revealed by our models. The significant relationships we identified apply to the sampled range of the human footprint index, whereas index values outside this range might produce different relationships. In addition, even if the uneven distribution of study regions did not produce an effect in statistical models, the under-representation of several parts of Africa, the Americas and Asia might mean that some human impacts on biodiversity were not well represented. Future work should examine the exact patterns and processes of natural vegetation impoverishment in these undersampled regions.

Our finding of a globally consistent negative relationship between human influence and local plant diversity in relatively natural vegetation is alarming, because plants form the foundation of all terrestrial ecosystems. Reduced community completeness indicates that many species present in the region do not inhabit suitable sites, and this can affect local ecosystem functioning47. Although vegetation functioning depends mainly on the traits of co-existing taxa, the presence of a larger proportion of suitable taxa increases the chance that essential functions are represented48. We also found that negative human influence was most evident when considered at a scale spanning several hundred kilometres; in other words, biodiversity in natural ecosystems is reduced far beyond human infrastructure. Therefore, conservation actions and land-use planning should consider not only the observed alpha diversity of a site, but also a broader regional context. Ecology has a rich history of conceptual frameworks for biodiversity across scales, such as species–area relationships49, alpha–beta–gamma diversity19, community saturation and assembly33 and the meta-community concept50. Building on this collective knowledge, the dark diversity concept offers a species-oriented toolkit for evaluating community patterns and explaining the underlying processes. By allowing the estimation of a site's biodiversity potential (site-specific species pool) and its realization (community completeness), it fosters the comparative study of biodiversity across regions, ecosystem types and taxonomic groups2. This improved understanding could help conservation biologists, land managers and policymakers to prevent further losses of biodiversity51. Moreover, while site-specific species pools are not depleted, dark diversity offers a narrow window of opportunity for restoration because it indicates which missing species are still regionally present52,53,54.

In 2018, we launched a global collaborative research consortium to sample both locally observed alpha diversity and dark diversity of terrestrial plant communities using a standardized methodology. A detailed sampling protocol was produced before fieldwork began31. Each study region covered an area of approximately 300 km2, defined by a circle of 20-km diameter with the available area influenced by geographical and practical limitations (coastline, private ownership and other access restrictions). This spatial scale was selected on the basis of the authors' expertise, in the expectation that it would incorporate areas with a relatively uniform biogeographical history while still exhibiting variation in natural vegetation. In addition, mechanisms of long-distance seed dispersal can operate at this scale55. In each region, we defined at least 30 sites, in which we sampled a 100-m2 (10 m × 10 m) area by recording all vascular plant species. Where feasible, we sampled more sites in the region to examine how sampling intensity might affect the results. The sites were selected to proportionally represent the typical natural vegetation types of the region without major human influence. These included semi-natural grasslands, representing habitats that have developed over thousands of years through grazing by domestic animals and mowing, and forests that had been managed with low intensity and had species composition and tree-layer structure similar to old-growth forests. Here we report the results from 5,415 sites in 119 regions for which sampling was completed by 1 February 2024 (Supplementary Table 2).

To assess whether dark diversity methods could predict species that were absent from the 100-m2 area but present in its immediate vicinity, and to estimate the effect of spatial scale on dark diversity, we selected one to three sites per region in which we sampled vascular plants in a 2,500-m2 (50 m × 50 m) area within which the 100-m2 area was nested. In four regions, sampling of the larger area was not possible or the large area had no new taxa, so these regions were omitted from the respective test. In addition, in 76 regions, we had sufficient expertise to assess which of the species found in the region were ecologically well-suited for a selected site (that is, belonging to the site-specific species pool). This information allowed us to test the applicability of dark diversity methods within our sampling framework (see below).

Biodiversity metrics were determined for each site in each region (Fig. 1). Alpha diversity A was defined as the number of vascular plant species found in the 100-m2 area describing a site (Fig. 1a). Dark diversity D was quantified for each site k by examining species co-occurrences within the surrounding region using the hypergeometric method, implemented in the R package DarkDiv (ref. 18). This technique uses information about how each species i that is absent from the study site but present in the surrounding region co-occurs with species j that is present at the study site. If an absent species co-occurs more frequently with observed species than it would do under random expectation, it is likely to belong to the dark diversity. The expected number of co-occurrences is mathematically defined by the hypergeometric distribution. For each pair of absent and present species, we compared the observed number of co-occurrences Mij with the expected value, which is defined as the mean of the hypergeometric distribution:

where ni and nj are the total number of occurrences of species i and j, respectively, and N is the total number of sites sampled in that region. The standardized effect size (SES) was used as an indicator of the suitability of absent species i for site k on the basis of co-occurrences with present species j (Fig. 1b), and was calculated as the difference between the observed and the expected numbers of co-occurrences divided by the standard deviation of the expected number of co-occurrences, as derived from the hypergeometric distribution:

We estimated the suitability of site k for all species i absent from the site but present in the region, by averaging suitability indicator values from all present species j using the number of species found in site k (nk):

The SESki values were subsequently transformed to a 0–1 scale by applying inverse probit transformation, which places the SESki value within the cumulative normal distribution function with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1 (Fig. 1c):

This estimate expressed the probability that species i belonged to the dark diversity of site k. Our estimated dark diversity probabilities were supported by two independent tests, one investigating which absent species were found in the immediate vicinity of a site and another using expert assessment (Extended Data Fig. 2). We also considered how the suitability of absent species might be estimated using an alternative technique—joint species distribution modelling (JSDM)56 (Supplementary Methods).

Dark diversity size for a study site was the sum of the probabilities Pki of all locally absent species found elsewhere in the region (Fig. 1d). For co-occurrences, we always considered 30 sites (each described by a 100-m2 area) within the same region (Fig. 1a), which is the minimum number sampled and generally sufficient for the method18. For regions with more than 30 sampled sites, we used an iterative procedure, each time randomly selecting 30 sites for species co-occurrences. Dark diversity size in those regions was estimated as the median from 100 iterations. Similarly, estimates of gamma diversity G were obtained using iteration, taking the median cumulative species number from 30 sites in a region. To test whether 30 sites was sufficient to estimate the variation in regional richness, we estimated species richness with complete sample coverage using incidence-based extrapolation based on the Bernoulli product model57, implemented within the R iNEXT package58. Gamma diversity from 30 sites correlated strongly with the extrapolated value (Spearman r = 0.95; Extended Data Fig. 3a)

Using alpha, dark and gamma diversities for each site, we calculated: species pool size as the sum of alpha and dark diversity: P = A + D; community completeness as the percentage of alpha diversity among all suitable species for that site: C = A/(A + D) × 100%; and beta diversity as the percentage of gamma diversity belonging to other species pools in the region and unsuitable for the specific site: B = (G – A – D) / G × 100% (Fig. 1d). This metric is identical to Whittaker's effective turnover at the species pool level, expressed as a percentage rather than a ratio (G/P) – 1. In analyses, all biodiversity metrics were transformed to improve distributions: those based on counts or sums (alpha, dark and gamma diversity, species pool size) were log-transformed, and those based on percentages (community completeness and beta diversity) were logit transformed. To aid intuitive understanding, we show untransformed values on graph axes. Because several of the diversity metrics are either subsets or calculated from each other, it is expected that these are closely related. However, bivariate relationships between our study variables (Extended Data Fig. 7) showed that all metrics bear some independent information, and the variability among and within regions is large.

All of our biodiversity metrics depend on the sampling scheme, including characteristics such as sample area or number of sites. To investigate how much our biodiversity metrics change if using a larger sample area, we used 1–3 sites in each region where both 100-m2 and 2,500-m2 areas were sampled. Similarly, we examined the effect of using a larger number of sites to characterize co-occurrences; using 60 sites from 27 regions where they were available. Overall, global variation in our metrics was highly correlated regardless of sample area and the number of sites considered (Spearman correlation > 0.8; Extended Data Fig. 3b–k).

According to the DarkDivNet protocol, in very diverse tropical regions we only sampled woody vascular plant species. Although alpha diversity, dark diversity, species pool size and gamma diversity are evidently smaller when herbaceous species are omitted, community completeness and beta diversity should still be relatively comparable with other regions because these metrics are unitless. To ensure full comparability between biodiversity metrics, we used only the 116 regions in which all vascular plants were sampled in the main analyses, but repeated the main tests for community completeness with all 119 regions within robustness analyses (Supplementary Methods).

Alpha diversity can be seen as a subset of gamma diversity in which the species pool has been filtered according to beta diversity, and the realization of the species pool is defined by community completeness (Fig. 1). We examined how much of the variation in alpha diversity is determined by variation in gamma diversity, beta diversity (these two define the site-specific species pool size) and community completeness. We randomly selected one site from each region in order to have independent local and regional variables (gamma diversity is the same for all sites in a region). The contribution of each source of variation was calculated using hierarchical variation partitioning (function varpart in the vegan package59 in R). This procedure was repeated 100 times to obtain a median and confidence interval.

In further statistical analyses, we used the medians of biodiversity variables across sites per region. We related community completeness and other calculated biodiversity variables (alpha diversity, beta diversity, gamma diversity, dark diversity and species pool size) to the human footprint index from the year 201834. The index ranges from 0 to 50 and is calculated from eight components (human population density, electric infrastructure, railways, roads, navigable waterways, the extent of built-up land, pastures and croplands). The resolution of the human influence data layers was 100 m, and we calculated average values over various spatial extents around the centre of each region (radii 10 km, 50 km, 100 km, 200 km, 300 km and 400 km). The averaging did not include areas representing water bodies. Because all regions included at least some areas less affected by humans, the total range of the averaged human footprint index values used in our analyses was somewhat lower than the maximum value. To test how well our sampled regions captured global variation in the human footprint index, we generated 500 random points worldwide using the discrete global grid system (which maintains uniform point density across the globe). From random points, we omitted glaciated regions of Antarctica and Greenland. We averaged the human footprint index in the surroundings of these random points in the same manner as we did with our empirical data. This revealed a high degree of correspondence between the average human footprint index ranges around sampled and randomly generated points at different scales: at radii of 50 km (sampled range 1.1–25.4, random 0.0–24.5), 200 km (sampled range 0.3–20.7, random 0.0–20.7) and 400 km (sampled 0.2–17.7, random 0.1–16.6).

To account for natural processes affecting community completeness, we included environmental variables in the multiple linear regression models. We used mean annual temperature and annual precipitation from the CHELSA database (resolution 1 km)60,61, soil pH, organic carbon content, sand fraction proportion from SoilGrids (resolution 250 m)62 and the topographic ruggedness of the terrain (resolution 250 m)63. Environmental factors were averaged within a 100-km radius to describe the broader region and consolidated through principal component analysis (PCA). For PCA, variables with only positive values were log-transformed if this resulted in a distribution closer to normal, and all variables were standardized. We kept the four first principal components, which described more than 90% of the variation. The first component was positively correlated with soil organic carbon content, acidity and precipitation; the second with temperature; the third with soil sand content; and the fourth with topographic ruggedness (Extended Data Fig. 5).

We fitted both linear and nonlinear (generalized additive models, function gam in the R package; ref. 64) models, incorporating the 116 regions in which all vascular plants were sampled. The estimates of the human footprint index at the different spatial scales were inherently strongly related to each other. Therefore, we constructed models for each scale at which the human footprint index (or its components) was averaged. We examined which scales produced the best models (ΔAIC < 2) and selected the smallest scale, which is most directly related to the study region. We compared linear and nonlinear models using spatial block validation, implemented in the R package blockCV (ref. 65). We used fivefold cross-validation across hexagons (Extended Data Fig. 2). To estimate the variation in model predictive power we further implemented a bootstrap approach66 by selecting bootstrap samples within each fold and then performing cross-validation. We used the normalized root mean square error (normalized by minimum and maximum values) to compare the predictive error of linear and nonlinear models, and found that linear models had much lower error in test sets (around 20% of the range compared with around 40% of the range; see Extended Data Fig. 8). Linear models were therefore used as a more general option.

We report the results of the best linear model (the smallest spatial scale at which ΔAIC < 2) for each biodiversity metric and note significant relationships (P < 0.05). We used the variance inflation factor (VIF) to confirm that correlations between environmental gradients and human impact (Extended Data Fig. 5) were not confounding in the models (VIF < 2). We applied type III model testing. Consequently, the effect of human impact was tested only after the environmental effects were accounted for. We visualized the results of the fitted models in terms of how the predictor variable human footprint index affects the outcome of community completeness using the visreg function and package67 in R. Model summary tables can be found in Extended Data Tables 1 and 2.

Besides the human footprint index from 2018, we also examined whether including change in the human footprint index during recent years improved the model68. Specifically, we tested whether a model including human footprint index change yielded a lower AIC value (by more than two units) compared with the model without change. We derived the measure of human footprint index change from a source that used a consistent methodology69 during a temporal range 2000–2013. Change in human footprint index was quantified as log(human footprint index value from 2013/human footprint index value from 2000).

We tested whether community completeness is better described by certain quantiles of the human footprint index at different scales around study regions. Compared with the mean, considering quantiles allowed us to determine the extent to which it is important to maintain a certain proportion of area with lower human influence. We compared models incorporating as predictor variables the 10–90% quantiles of the human footprint index using AIC and recorded cases in which the quantiles yielded a better model than the mean (models with AIC lower by more than two units were considered superior).

We also tested the robustness of the relationship between community completeness and the human footprint index by looking at statistical interactions between human influence and the environment, indirect effects, the role of sampling scale, alien or rare species; by including areas in which only woody species were recorded and considering forest cover in regions; and by examining the effect of geographically uneven sampling (see Supplementary Methods).

Lines indicate ranges within a radius of 100 km. Approximate broad biomes are shown. Triangles indicate regions in which only woody species were sampled.

We used two tests. In the Vicinity test, we examined whether species absent from the site (100 m2) but present in the immediate vicinity (2500 m2) have higher estimated suitabilities than absent species found further away. The sample area and vicinity area are assumed to share relatively similar ecological conditions. In the Expert test, we compared whether species absent from the site but assessed by expert opinion to be ecologically suitable (i.e., belong to the site-specific species pool) have higher calculated suitabilities than those absent species that were evaluated as unsuitable. In both cases, we calculated the log response ratio of the mean suitability of species in the respective groups. Positive log response ratios indicate agreement between assessments of suitability calculated from co-occurrences and from the independent information considered in the tests. The length of the lines (vertical for the Vicinity test and horizontal for the Expert test) shown at study region locations indicates the magnitude of the log response ratio; negative values are in red and positive values are in blue. Both tests comprised data from a subset of study regions. The box plot on the left (centre line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, the range, excluding outlying points that exceed the quartiles by more than 1.5× the interquartile range) shows the results of single-sample two-sided t-tests (difference from zero), with log response ratios significantly larger than zero in both cases, n = 115 regions for the Vicinity test and n = 76 regions for the Expert test. Hexagons on the map (made with Natural Earth; free vector and raster map data; https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) delimit the spatial blocks used in cross-validation.

The 1:1 lines are shown as diagonals. Estimates of Spearman correlation for each comparison are shown above the panels. Comparisons where the alternative sampling method did not influence the metric (i.e. gamma diversity when using a larger sample area or alpha diversity when using more sites) are not shown.

For each metric, the relationships from the spatial scale producing the best multiple linear regression model is shown (n = 116 regions, see Extended Data Table 1 for details of the models). The prediction lines are shown with 95% confidence intervals. The solid line indicates a significant relationship (two-tailed p < 0.05); the dashed lines indicate non-significant trends.

Several metrics are inherently related (see Fig. 1), and strong relationships are expected. However, variation within regions can be large, indicating the importance of site-specific metrics.

Metrics details

Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia1,2,3,4,5. Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects6,7,8,9. Here we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the occurrence of dementia diagnoses. To provide causal as opposed to correlational evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual's exact date of birth. Those born before 2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine. Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine, individuals born just 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to differ systematically from those born 1 week later. Using these comparison groups in a regression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6–7.1, P = 0.019), corresponding to a 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5–33.4) relative reduction. This protective effect was stronger among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population (England and Wales's combined population), with a different type of data (death certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia by the healthcare system10. Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing associational evidence.

Recently, evidence has grown that neurotropic herpesviruses may have a role in the pathogenesis of dementia1,2,3,4,5. One approach to targeting herpesviruses is vaccination. However, vaccines are also increasingly being recognized as eliciting a broader immune response that can have important off-target effects, particularly in the case of live-attenuated vaccines6,7,8,9. Such effects have frequently been observed to differ strongly by sex7.

To date, studies in cohort and electronic health record data on the effect of vaccination receipt on dementia have simply compared the occurrence of dementia among those who received a given vaccination and those who did not11. These studies have to assume that all characteristics that are different between those who are vaccinated and those who are not (and that are also related to dementia) have been sufficiently well measured and modelled in the analysis, such that no factors confound the relationship between vaccination receipt and dementia12. This assumption of no confounding bias is often implausible because it has to be assumed that the study has detailed data on factors that are difficult to measure, such as personal motivation or health literacy13. It is also an assumption that cannot be empirically verified.

We used a fundamentally different approach that takes advantage of the fact that, in Wales, starting on 1 September 2013, those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for herpes zoster vaccination for at least 1 year, while those born earlier never became eligible14. Using detailed large-scale electronic health record data, we were able to compare adults who were ineligible for the vaccine because they were born immediately before the eligibility cut-off date with those born immediately after who were eligible. Importantly, individuals who are only a few weeks apart in age are not expected to differ systematically from each other. That is, all potential confounding variables are in expectation balanced between our comparison groups. By taking advantage of this unique natural experiment, we were able to avoid confounding more credibly than all existing studies on the topic15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24, which have simply compared vaccine recipients to non-recipients while trying to control for the myriad of differences between these groups.

Adults born immediately after the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility cut-off had a 47.2 percentage point higher probability (from 0.01% to 47.2%) of ever receiving the herpes zoster vaccine than those born immediately before this cut-off date. As expected, other than this abrupt change in herpes zoster vaccination uptake, patients were balanced across the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility threshold in their uptake of other preventive health services, past common disease diagnoses and educational attainment. We then used this ‘quasi-randomization' in a regression discontinuity analysis to first replicate the known finding from clinical trials that the herpes zoster vaccine reduces new diagnoses of shingles. Second, we extended this approach to an outcome—dementia—that was never assessed in clinical trials of the herpes zoster vaccine, and find that the vaccine reduces the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a seven-year follow-up period by approximately one-fifth. Third, we show that the herpes zoster vaccine did not affect the occurrence of any other common causes of mortality or morbidity other than shingles and dementia. Similarly, we show that receipt of the herpes zoster vaccine did not lead to increased uptake of other vaccinations or preventive health measures. Fourth, we provide evidence that no other intervention (such as health insurance eligibility) in Wales used the identical date of birth (2 September 1933) as eligibility cut-off as was used to define eligibility for the herpes zoster vaccine. Fifth, we show that all findings remain similar when using a different analysis approach. Sixth, we show that changes in healthcare pathways as a result of a shingles episode are unlikely to explain our findings. Seventh, we provide exploratory evidence from our electronic health record data on the mechanism through which herpes zoster vaccination could affect dementia. Our study focuses on the live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax; hereafter, zoster vaccine), because the newer recombinant subunit zoster vaccine (Shingrix) became available in the UK only after our follow-up period ended25.

We used the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank26, which contains detailed electronic health record data on primary care visits from approximately 80% of primary care providers in Wales, linked to secondary care records and the country's death register data. The study population for our primary analyses consisted of all adults born between 1 September 1925 and 1 September 1942 who were registered with a primary care provider (which is the case for over 98% of adults residing in Wales27), resided in Wales and did not have a diagnosis of dementia at the time of the start of the zoster vaccine program in Wales (on 1 September 2013). Basic sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the sample of 282,541 adults in our primary analysis cohort are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

In Wales, individuals born between 2 September 1933 and 1 September 1934 (16,595 adults in our data) became eligible for the zoster vaccine for at least 1 year on 1 September 2013. Eligibility was then progressively extended to younger, but not older, age cohorts annually on the basis of their exact date of birth (Methods).

We find that being born just 1 week after 2 September 1933, and therefore being eligible for the zoster vaccine for at least 1 year, caused an abrupt increase in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine from 0.01% to 47.2% (P < 0.001; Fig. 1). This provides a unique opportunity to avoid confounding concerns because it is unlikely that individuals born immediately around the date-of-birth eligibility threshold systematically differ from each other by anything but a one-week difference in age and a large difference in the probability of receiving the zoster vaccine. We substantiate this empirically by showing that, at the time of the start date of the zoster vaccination program, neither the prevalence of common disease diagnoses (including having been diagnosed with dementia before the vaccination program rollout), dementia risk as predicted from a series of clinical and sociodemographic variables, nor the prevalence of preventive behaviours (other than zoster vaccine uptake) display a discontinuity at the date-of-birth eligibility threshold for the zoster vaccine (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1–4). Thus, after flexibly controlling for age, our two comparison groups (one with a low and one with a high probability of receiving the zoster vaccine) born immediately on either side of the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility threshold are probably exchangeable with each other on all observed and unobserved potential confounding variables.

a–f, The date-of-birth eligibility cut-off led to a large discontinuity in zoster vaccine receipt (a), but there is baseline exchangeability across the cut-off for uptake of other preventive interventions (flu vaccine (d), pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) (e) and statin medications (f)) as well as past shingles (b) and dementia (c) diagnoses. The data source for this analysis was the SAIL database for Wales. All analyses were run on the same sample as those for the effect of the zoster vaccine on dementia occurrence. The exception is c, for which we did not exclude individuals with a diagnosis of dementia before the start of the zoster vaccine program. The grey dots show the mean value for each 10-week increment in week of birth. The grey shading of the dots is proportionate to the weight that observations from this 10-week increment received in the analysis.

Our analysis approach primarily compares those who were ineligible for zoster vaccination because they had their 80th birthday immediately before the program's start date with those who were eligible because they had their 80th birthday immediately after the start date. As is standard practice in regression discontinuity analyses28,29, the effect of actually receiving the vaccine (as opposed to merely being eligible) was determined using a two-stage least-squares regression, which divides the magnitude of the abrupt change in the outcome at the date-of-birth eligibility threshold by the magnitude of the abrupt change in vaccine uptake at this threshold (Methods). Thus, the fact that not all those who were eligible received zoster vaccination does not bias our analysis.

We first demonstrate that our approach successfully reproduces the known causal effect from clinical trials that the vaccine reduces the occurrence of shingles30. Specifically, using a regression discontinuity design28,29, we compared the occurrence of shingles between adults born close to either side of the date-of-birth eligibility threshold for the zoster vaccine. Consistent with the approach used by clinical trials of the zoster vaccine30, our outcome was whether or not an individual had at least one shingles diagnosis during the follow-up period. During our follow-up period of 7 years, a total of 14,465 among 296,324 adults in our sample had at least one diagnosis of shingles. Over the same follow-up time, we find that being eligible for the vaccine reduced the probability of having at least one shingles diagnosis by 1.0 (95% CI = 0.2–1.7; P = 0.010) percentage point (Fig. 2a), corresponding to a relative reduction of 18.8% (95% CI = 8.8–28.9). When calculating the effect of actually receiving the zoster vaccine, we find a reduction in the probability of having at least one shingles diagnosis of 2.3 (95% CI = 0.5–3.9; P = 0.011) percentage points over the seven-year follow-up period (Fig. 2b); an effect (37.2% (95% CI = 19.7–54.7) in relative terms) that is similar in size to that observed in clinical trials of the live-attenuated zoster vaccine (Zostavax)30.

a–c, Effect estimates of being eligible for (a), and having received (across different follow-up periods (b) and across different grace periods (c)), the zoster vaccine on the probability of having at least one shingles diagnosis during the follow-up period. For a, the MSE-optimal bandwidth is 145.7 weeks (95,227 adults). The grey dots show the mean value for each 10-week increment in week of birth. The grey shading of the dots is proportionate to the weight that observations from this 10-week increment received in the analysis. For b and c, the MSE-optimal bandwidth for our primary specification is 116.9 weeks (76,316 adults). The triangles (rather than points) depict our primary specification. The red (as opposed to white) fillings denote statistical significance (P < 0.05). Grace periods refer to time periods since the index date after which the follow-up time is considered to begin. The grey vertical bars show the 95% CIs around the point estimate of the regression coefficient (two-sided t tests).

We show that our estimated effect is not sensitive to the chosen functional form of the regression used to model the relationship of shingles occurrence with week of birth (Supplementary Fig. 5), the width of the week-of-birth window (bandwidth) around the date-of-birth eligibility cut-off that defines our analysis sample (Supplementary Fig. 6a) or to different grace periods (Fig. 2c). With ‘grace periods', we refer to time periods since the index date after which the follow-up time is considered to begin (Methods). There was also a strong indication that the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of having at least one diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia (a common complication of shingles), although this effect did not reach statistical significance in all specifications (Supplementary Fig. 7).

Given the neuropathological overlap between dementia types and the difficulty in distinguishing dementia types clinically31, as well as our reduced statistical power when studying less-common outcomes, we defined dementia as dementia of any type or cause as our outcome. We considered an individual to have developed dementia if there was a new diagnosis of dementia in our electronic health record data (which includes all diagnoses made in primary or secondary care) or dementia was listed as a primary or contributory cause of death on the death certificate. The Read and ICD-10-codes used to define dementia are listed in the Supplementary Codes. During our seven-year follow-up period, 35,307 among 282,541 adults in our sample were newly diagnosed with dementia.

Using our regression discontinuity approach, we estimate that the effect of being eligible for the zoster vaccine is a 1.3 (95% CI = 0.2–2.7; P = 0.022) percentage points absolute and 8.5% (95% CI = 1.9–15.1) relative reduction in the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over 7 years (Fig. 3a). Scaled to account for the fact that not all those who were eligible received the vaccine, we find that actually receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis by 3.5 (95% CI = 0.6–7.1; P = 0.019) percentage points, corresponding to a relative reduction of 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5–33.4) (Fig. 3b). The effect estimates were generally not sensitive to different grace periods (Fig. 3c), the functional form of our regressions (Supplementary Fig. 8) nor the width of the week-of-birth window (bandwidth) drawn around the date-of-birth eligibility cut-off (Supplementary Fig. 6b). We also find significant effects of the zoster vaccine on reducing dementia diagnoses if a diagnosis is defined solely as a new prescription of a medication (donepezil hydrochloride, galantamine, rivastigmine or memantine hydrochloride) that is frequently prescribed to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease (Supplementary Table 2 (column 2)). Similarly, the effects remain similar when adjusting for all input variables to the Dementia Risk Score32 (as recorded before 1 September 2013) (Supplementary Table 2 (column 7)).

a–c, Effect estimates of being eligible for (a), and having received (across different follow-up periods (b) and across different grace periods (c)), the zoster vaccine on new diagnoses of dementia. For a, the MSE-optimal bandwidth is 134.4 weeks (83,167 adults). The grey dots show the mean value for each 10-week increment in week of birth. The grey shading of the dots is proportionate to the weight that observations from this 10-week increment received in the analysis. For b and c, the MSE-optimal bandwidth for our primary specification is 90.6 weeks (56,098 adults). The triangles (rather than points) depict our primary specification. The red (as opposed to white) fillings denote statistical significance (P < 0.05). Grace periods refer to time periods since the index date after which the follow-up time is considered to begin. The grey vertical bars show the 95% CIs around the point estimate of the regression coefficient (two-sided t tests).

The key strength of our study is that a confounding variable can bias our analysis only if the variable changes abruptly at the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth threshold28,29. Thus, confounding bias could occur if another intervention also used the date of birth cut-off of 2 September 1933 as an eligibility criterion. Such an intervention is unlikely to affect only the risk of developing dementia without also influencing other health outcomes. We therefore implemented the same regression discontinuity approach as we did for shingles and dementia for the ten leading causes of disability-adjusted life years and mortality for the age group 70+ years in Wales in 201933, and all conditions that are part of the Charlson Comorbidity Index34. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10, we generally do not detect effects of zoster vaccination on new diagnoses of these other common health outcomes.

We undertook four additional types of analysis, all of which provide evidence against another intervention having used the identical day-month-year combination (2 September 1933) as was used as the date-of-birth eligibility threshold for the zoster vaccine rollout. First, we show that the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth threshold does not affect the probability of taking up other preventive health interventions (Supplementary Fig. 11). Second, we examined whether the day–month (that is, 2 September) date-of-birth cut-off used for zoster vaccine eligibility was also used by other interventions that affect dementia risk. We did so by implementing the identical analysis as for 1 September 2013 (the actual date on which the zoster vaccine program started) for 1 September of each of the three years before and after 2013. Thus, for example, when shifting the start date of the program to 1 September 2012, we compared those around the 2 September 1932 date-of-birth threshold with the follow-up period starting on 1 September 2012. As an additional check that enabled us to maintain the length of the seven-year follow-up period used in our primary analyses, we shifted the program start date to 1 September of each of the 6 years preceding (but not after) 2013. As expected, for both of these checks, we find a significant effect on dementia occurrence only for the date-of-birth cutoff (2 September 1933) that was actually used by the zoster vaccination program (Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). Third, we find that there is no difference in the seven-year incidence of dementia between age cohorts around the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth threshold for the seven-year period before the zoster vaccine rollout (Supplementary Fig. 14). Fourth, using data from the 2011 Census, we show in Supplementary Figs. 15–17 that there are no discontinuities across the 2 September 1933 threshold in the proportion of individuals in Wales who reached a particular level of education.

As an additional test of the robustness of our findings, we implemented all primary analyses using a difference-in-differences instrumental variable analysis (DID-IV) that takes advantage of the fact that the only 2 September date-of-birth threshold at which we would expect an abrupt change in the outcome is the 2 September threshold in 1933 (that is, the day–month–year combination that was used as eligibility cut-off by the zoster vaccination program). In doing so, our analysis relaxes the continuity assumption of regression discontinuity (that is, the assumption that potential confounding variables do not display a sudden change at the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility threshold), and instead assumes that (in the absence of the zoster vaccination program) a possible discontinuity in the outcome at the 2 September 1933 threshold is not different in size from a discontinuity at the 2 September threshold in previous birth years. Details of our approach are provided in the Methods. Encouragingly, the effect of zoster vaccine receipt on the probability of a new dementia diagnosis during our seven-year follow-up period is remarkably similar between the DID-IV and regression discontinuity approach (−3.1 (95% CI = −5.8 to −0.4, P = 0.024) versus −3.5 (95% CI = −7.1 to −0.6, P = 0.019) percentage points) (Fig. 4). This is also the case for the outcomes of shingles and postherpetic neuralgia (Fig. 4). We conducted the same checks for balance in health characteristics between our comparison groups for the DID-IV as we implemented for our regression discontinuity analyses (Supplementary Fig. 18). We also verified that our DID-IV approach yields significant effects only for the outcomes of dementia, shingles and postherpetic neuralgia, but not for any other common health outcomes (Supplementary Fig. 18).

Comparison of absolute effect estimates of having received the zoster vaccine on new diagnoses of dementia, shingles and postherpetic neuralgia between the DID-IV and the regression discontinuity analyses. The data source for this analysis was the SAIL database for Wales. The sample size for the dementia outcome is 96,767 adults and the sample for the shingles and postherpetic neuralgia outcomes is 105,258 adults. P values were calculated using two-sided t-tests. The P value for the DID-IV effect on shingles is 0.001. The error bars depict the 95% CIs around the point estimate of the regression coefficient (two-sided t-tests).

A protective effect of zoster vaccination on dementia diagnoses could arise from three (non-mutually exclusive) mechanisms: (1) changes in healthcare pathways as a result of a shingles episode; (2) a reduction in reactivations of the varicella zoster virus (VZV); and (3) a VZV-independent immunomodulatory effect (for example, one mediated through heterologous adaptive immunity or trained innate immunity). In this section, we present evidence to examine each of these mechanisms.

Reduced healthcare use resulting averted shingles episodes from zoster vaccination receipt could have translated to fewer opportunities for the health system to (1) diagnose dementia (ascertainment bias); or (2) implement care changes (for example, initiation of a new medication) that increase the risk of being diagnosed with dementia in the future. It is important to point out that this mechanism is unlikely to fully explain our findings, because the size of our effect estimates for reductions in shingles episodes from zoster vaccination were considerably too small to plausibly account for the observed reduction in dementia diagnoses.

We nonetheless conducted five types of analysis to examine this potential mechanism further. First, if shingles episodes presented an opportunity for the health system to diagnose dementia, then they would probably also present an opportunity to diagnose other chronic conditions. We therefore applied the same regression discontinuity approach as for shingles and dementia to all chronic conditions that are either among the ten leading causes of disability-adjusted life years and mortality for the age group 70+ years in Wales in 201933 or part of the Charlson Comorbidity Index34. We plotted our estimates across one-year increments in the follow-up period. With the exception of rheumatological diseases, we show that being eligible for the zoster vaccine did not have an effect on new chronic disease diagnoses (Supplementary Fig. 19). Second, we adjusted our regressions for the frequency of health service use (the number of primary care visits, outpatient visits, hospital admissions and influenza vaccinations received) during the follow-up period, which did not substantially change our effect estimates (Supplementary Table 2 (column 4)). Third, we implemented our analyses when restricting the analysis cohort to the 247,784 (87.6% of the analysis cohort for our primary analyses) patients who visited their primary care provider at least once a year during each of the 5 years before the start of the zoster vaccine rollout. The rationale for this analysis is that, among patients who already interact frequently with the health system, a reduction of one further contact with the health system due to an averted shingles episode is less likely to affect the probability of detecting undiagnosed dementia. The effect sizes among this cohort of frequent healthcare users remain similar to those in our primary analytical cohort (Supplementary Table 2 (column 3)). Fourth, we added whether individuals experienced a shingles episode during the follow-up period as a covariate in our primary regression discontinuity analysis. We found that adjusting our analysis for shingles episodes did not substantially change our point estimate (Supplementary Fig. 20). Fifth, we implemented an event study among those participants in the mean-squared-error (MSE)-optimal bandwidth of our primary regression discontinuity analysis for dementia who received a shingles diagnosis during the follow-up period. To investigate whether episodes of shingles led to changes in healthcare received by patients, we examined the effect of the shingles diagnosis on the following outcomes in each of the 36 months after the diagnosis: (1) the probability of receiving a new dementia diagnosis; (2) a set of indicators of health service use; (3) the probability of receiving a new medication prescription for antiviral drugs, opioid medications, gabapentin or pregabalin, and any of 216 medications that were associated with an increased risk of dementia in another analysis in the SAIL database23; and (4) the probability of being diagnosed with any of the chronic conditions that are part of the Charlson Comorbidity Index34. We found that shingles diagnoses did not increase the probability of receiving a new dementia diagnosis in the months after the shingles diagnosis, and led to only short-term increases in healthcare service use and new medication prescriptions (Supplementary Fig. 21). The increase in the probability of receiving a gabapentin or pregabalin prescription in the months after the shingles episode, while more sustained, was small in magnitude. Similarly, the increase in the probability of being diagnosed with any chronic condition in the month of a shingles episode compared with the month before the episode was less than one percentage point (Supplementary Fig. 21).

As the effect of zoster vaccination on shingles episodes is moderate (Fig. 2), and the five types of analysis in this section document only small and short-lived effects of shingles episodes on healthcare pathways, even the most conservative assumptions about the effect of these care paths on dementia imply that changes in healthcare as a result of a shingles episode cannot explain our findings.

As described in the previous section, adjusting our regression discontinuity analysis for whether a patient had a record of at least one shingles episode during the follow-up period did not change our point estimate substantially (Supplementary Fig. 20). However, conclusions from this analysis regarding reductions in VZV reactivations as the effect mechanism are limited by the fact that (1) zoster vaccination probably reduces both clinical as well as subclinical reactivations of VZV30,35; and (2) having a shingles episode may be an unreliable indicator of the degree of subclinical VZV reactivations experienced during the entire follow-up period, given that shingles episodes may boost immunity for VZV30,35. We therefore conducted the following analyses to further examine reductions in VZV reactivations as the effect mechanism.

First, we examined the time during the follow-up period at which the effect of zoster vaccination on dementia appears to begin. Specifically, among patients who were born in close proximity to the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth threshold, we plotted the Kaplan–Meier and cumulative incidence curves for dementia for those who were eligible versus ineligible for zoster vaccination (Methods). If the effect mechanism is through a reduction in VZV reactivations, then one would expect that the effects of the vaccine on reductions in clinical and subclinical reactivations of the virus would begin before observing an effect on dementia. The live-attenuated zoster vaccine is thought to begin being efficacious within weeks after vaccine administration30,36. Consistent with the principle that the effect on VZV reactivations should precede the dementia effect, we observe that the reduction in the incidence of dementia begins to emerge only after more than one year, both among the full population as well as among women only (Supplementary Fig. 22).

Second, while a shingles episode may boost VZV immunity and, therefore, reduce subsequent subclinical VZV reactivations30,35, individuals who experience multiple episodes as opposed to a single shingles episode during the follow-up period probably experience a greater degree of both clinical and subclinical VZV reactivations during the follow-up period30. Using propensity score matching (Methods), we therefore compared the association with dementia from experiencing multiple versus a single shingles episode. We find a higher incidence of dementia among those who experienced multiple shingles episodes (Supplementary Fig. 23).

Third, if VZV reactivations increase the risk of dementia, then limiting the degree of replication of the virus during a shingles episode through antiviral medication could be expected to decrease dementia incidence. Using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model (Methods), we therefore compared the association with dementia between individuals whose shingles episode was treated with antiviral medication and those for whom the episode was untreated. We find that antiviral treatment of a shingles episode is associated with a reduced incidence of dementia (Supplementary Fig. 23).

To probe this mechanism, we take advantage of two observations on pathogen-independent immunomodulatory effects from vaccination in the literature: they tend to (1) vary strongly by sex, with beneficial effects from live-attenuated vaccination often seen only in female but not male individuals6,7,8; and (2) depend on the receipt of other vaccines before, or at the same time as, receipt of the vaccine in question6,7,8. Consistent with these observations, we find that the effect of zoster vaccination on new diagnoses of dementia was markedly greater among women than men (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 3 (column 1)). There was no significant difference between women and men in the effect of the zoster vaccine on diagnoses of shingles and postherpetic neuralgia (Supplementary Table 3 (columns 2 and 3)). Similarly, the magnitude of the abrupt increase in vaccine uptake at the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility threshold was comparable between women and men (Supplementary Fig. 24), with a slightly larger magnitude among men.

a–f, Effect estimates of being eligible for (a (women) and d (men)) and having received (b and c (women) and e and f (men); across different follow-up periods (b and e) and across different grace periods (c and f)) the zoster vaccine on new diagnoses of dementia, separately for women and men. The data source for this analysis was the SAIL database for Wales. The triangles (rather than points) depict our primary specification. Red (as opposed to white) fillings denote statistical significance (P < 0.05). Grace periods refer to time periods since the index date after which the follow-up time is considered to begin. The grey vertical bars depict the 95% CIs around the point estimate of the regression coefficient (two-sided t-test). The grey dots show the mean value for each 10-week increment in week of birth. For a, among women, the MSE-optimal bandwidth is 95.5 weeks (32,601 women). For b and c, among women, the MSE-optimal bandwidth for our primary specification is 149.1 weeks (50,816 women). For d, among men, the MSE-optimal bandwidth for our primary specification is 121.3 weeks (33,725 men). For e and f, among men, the MSE-optimal bandwidth for our primary specification is 91.8 weeks (25,563 men). The grey shading of the dots is proportionate to the weight that observations from this 10-week increment received in the analysis.

We also find strong effect heterogeneity by receipt of previous influenza vaccination. Specifically, the protective effect of zoster vaccination for dementia was larger among those who did not recently receive the influenza vaccine (Supplementary Fig. 25). Influenza vaccination is the only vaccine that was provided within the 5 years preceding zoster vaccination eligibility to a substantial proportion of individuals in our study population (pneumococcal vaccination is already provided at age 65 years in the United Kingdom37).

Finally, we examined the differences in the effect of the zoster vaccine on dementia incidence between those with versus without an autoimmune or allergic condition. Our reasoning for this analysis was based on the observation that the incidence of shingles is increased among individuals with an autoimmune or allergic condition38,39,40,41, while there do not appear to be major differences in vaccine immunogenicity and its relative effectiveness for shingles prevention between those with versus without such conditions30. Thus, if the protective effect of zoster vaccination for dementia is mainly driven through a reduction of clinical and subclinical virus reactivations, then those with an autoimmune condition will likely benefit equally or more than those without such a condition. However, because autoimmune and allergic conditions are generally characterized by a heightened activation of the (adaptive) immune system42,43, individuals with such a condition might benefit less from further activation of more generalized, VZV-independent, immune system pathways than those without such a condition. Consistent with this second hypothesis, we observe suggestive evidence for stronger effectiveness of the zoster vaccine for dementia among those without an autoimmune or allergic condition than those with such a condition (Supplementary Fig. 25). The patterns that we observe remain largely unaffected by whether or not patients were taking any immunosuppressive medications in the year preceding the start of the zoster vaccination program.

Thus, overall and with the caveat that these exploratory analyses are suggestive only, our analyses indicate that both a mechanism of action through a reduction in clinical and subclinical reactivations of VZV as well as through a VZV-independent immunomodulatory effect are plausible. Importantly, these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.

Here we found that the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis by approximately one-fifth over a seven-year follow-up period. By taking advantage of the fact that the unique way in which the zoster vaccine was rolled out in Wales constitutes a natural experiment, and examining each possible remaining source of bias, our study provides evidence that is more likely to be causal in nature than the existing, exclusively associational15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24, evidence on this topic. Our substantial effect sizes, combined with the relatively low cost of the zoster vaccine, imply that, if these findings are truly causal, the zoster vaccine will be both far more effective as well as cost-effective in preventing or delaying dementia than existing pharmaceutical interventions.

Our quasi-experimental approach reduces the probability of confounding compared with more standard associational analyses. Moreover, we have provided evidence from a series of analyses against any of the possible remaining sources of bias being a likely explanation of our findings. Nonetheless, it is possible (even if statistically unlikely) that our findings are due to chance. Confirmation of our findings in other populations, settings and data sources is therefore critical. Importantly, we have successfully confirmed our findings using country-wide death certificate data from England and Wales10. Specifically, because England rolled out the zoster vaccine in an almost identical way to Wales44, we were able to use the same quasi-experimental approach as in our electronic health record data from Wales to determine the effect of eligibility for zoster vaccination based on one's date of birth on deaths for which the underlying cause was recorded as being dementia. We found that, over a nine-year follow-up period, approximately 1 in 20 such deaths were averted from being eligible for zoster vaccination. This study constitutes an important confirmation of our results because it analysed a different population (England's population accounts for approximately 95% of England's and Wales's combined population45), type of data (death certificates as opposed to electronic health records) and outcome (deaths due to dementia). In addition to this confirmation of our results in mortality data, the probability of a chance finding is further reduced by the fact that we successfully replicate our main findings using a second analysis approach (DID-IV) and that our effect sizes remain stable across a multitude of analysis choices, including choice of grace periods, follow-up periods, study population definitions (for example, restriction to frequent healthcare users), functional form of our regressions, width of the week-of-birth window drawn around the date-of-birth eligibility cut-off and index date definitions.

We observed large differences in the effect of zoster vaccination on dementia between women and men, with women benefitting more than men. In our view, these large differences between women and men are plausible for several reasons. First, we cannot exclude the possibility of substantial reductions in new dementia diagnoses from zoster vaccination among men, especially given the lower incidence of dementia in older age among men than women in our data and, therefore, our wider confidence intervals for analyses among men. Second, off-target effects of vaccines have often been observed to be far stronger among female than male individuals, with female individuals benefiting more from live-attenuated vaccines in particular6,7. Third, there appear to be important sex differences in the immunological response to vaccines more generally46. Lastly, there is a growing body of evidence that there may be differences in the pathogenesis of dementia between women and men47.

Other than investing into randomized trials, investments into basic science research on the potential role of VZV and the immune response to the zoster vaccine in the pathogenesis of dementia could provide critical mechanistic insights. There are already several lines of evidence on plausible mechanistic pathways that link VZV reactivations to dementia. Specifically, VZV reactivations have been found to lead to long-lasting cognitive impairment through vasculopathy48,49, amyloid deposition and aggregation of tau proteins50, neuroinflammation51,52,53,54, as well as a similar spectrum of cerebrovascular disease as seen in Alzheimer's disease, including small to large vessel disease, ischaemia, infarction and haemorrhage51,52,53,54,55,56. As suggested by a recent study57, it may also be the case that reducing subclinical and clinical reactivations of VZV reduces reactivations of the herpes simplex virus-1 in the brain through neuroinflammatory pathways. This mechanism would link VZV to the body of literature on the role of herpes simplex virus-1 in the pathogenesis of dementia1,2,3,4,5. Nonetheless, our exploratory analyses on the effect mechanism that links zoster vaccination to dementia suggest that both a mechanism through reducing clinical and subclinical reactivations of VZV as well as a pathogen-independent immune mechanism are plausible. Some of these possible pathogen-independent immune mechanisms have recently been detailed elsewhere58.

Our study has several limitations. First, our outcome ascertainment probably suffers from some degree of under-detection, both in whether and in how timely a fashion dementia is diagnosed. Importantly, because the probability of under-detecting dementia, as well as the delay in doing so, is unlikely to change abruptly at the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility threshold for zoster vaccination, this outcome misclassification is most likely non-differential. Our effect estimates are therefore likely to be conservative (that is, our absolute effect sizes would be an underestimate of the true absolute effect magnitude). Similarly, changes in the accuracy and timeliness of dementia ascertainment over the years of our follow-period, such as due to changing clinical practice or health system incentives to detect and record dementia, affected those born immediately before versus immediately after 2 September 1933 equally. We would therefore not expect these changes to be a source of bias in our analyses. Second, we are unable to provide estimates for the effectiveness of the zoster vaccine for reducing dementia occurrence in age groups other than those who were weighted most heavily in our regression discontinuity analyses (primarily those aged 79 to 80 years). Third, the COVID-19 pandemic probably affected the timeliness with which dementia was diagnosed. However, the follow-up period used in our primary analyses ended before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, because the pandemic affected those born just before versus just after 2 September 1933 equally, pandemic-related under-detection of dementia is unlikely to bias our relative effect estimates. Fourth, we were limited to a maximum follow-up period of 8 years. Our study can therefore not inform on the effectiveness of the zoster vaccine for reducing dementia occurrence beyond this time period. Lastly, because the newer recombinant subunit zoster vaccine (Shingrix) replaced the live-attenuated zoster vaccine (Zostavax) in the United Kingdom only in September 202325, which is after our follow-up period ended, our effect estimates apply to the live-attenuated zoster vaccine only.

The live-attenuated zoster vaccine (Zostavax) was made available to eligible individuals in Wales through a staggered rollout system starting on 1 September 2013. Under this system, individuals aged 71 years or older were categorized into three groups on 1 September of each year: (1) an ineligible cohort of those aged 71 to 78 years (or 77 years, depending on the year of the program), who became eligible in the future; (2) a catch-up cohort, consisting of individuals aged 79 years (or 78 years, again depending on the year of the program); and (3) those who were ineligible as they were aged 80 years or older and who never became eligible.

Our analysis focused on adults born between 1 September 1925 (88 years old at program start) and 1 September 1942 (71 years old at program start). Those born between 1 September 1925 and 1 September 1933 never became eligible, whereas those born between 2 September 1933 and 1 September 1942 became progressively eligible in a catch-up cohort. Specifically, the vaccine was offered to those born between 2 September 1933 and 1 September 1934 in the first year of the program (1 September 2013 to 31 August 2014); those born between 2 September 1934 and 1 September 1936 in the second year (1 September 2014 to 31 August 2015); those born between 2 September 1936 and 1 September 1937 in the third year (1 September 2015 to 31 August 2016); and those born between 2 September 1937 and 1 September 1938 in the fourth year (1 September 2016 to 31 August 2017). As of 1 April 2017, individuals become eligible for the vaccine on their 78th birthday and remain eligible until their 80th birthday. Our analysis principally compared individuals born on or shortly after 2 September 1933, to individuals who never became eligible as they were born shortly before 2 September 1933. We show in Supplementary Figs. 26–28 that most eligible individuals, especially in the first two eligibility cohorts, which are the focus of our analysis, took up the vaccination during their first year of eligibility (as opposed to during later years) and that vaccination uptake in these first two eligibility cohorts was of a similar magnitude.

Healthcare in Wales is provided through the Welsh National Health Service (NHS), which is part of the United Kingdom's single-payer single-provider healthcare system59. NHS Wales and Swansea University created the SAIL Databank26,60,61,62,63,64, which includes full electronic health record data for primary care visits linked to information on hospital-based care as well as the country's death register data.

SAIL generates a list of all individuals who have ever been registered with a primary care provider in Wales (which is the case for over 98% of adults residing in Wales27) from the Welsh Demographic Service Dataset65. SAIL then links this universe of individuals to each of the following datasets. Electronic health record data from primary care providers is made available in SAIL through the Welsh Longitudinal General Practice dataset66, which contains data from approximately 80% of primary care practices in Wales and 83% of the Welsh population. These electronic health record data use Read codes, which provide detailed information on patients and their care encounters, including diagnoses, clinical signs and observations, symptoms, laboratory tests and results, procedures performed and administrative items67. Zoster vaccination was defined using both codes for the administration of the vaccine as well as product codes (Supplementary Table 1). Diagnoses made and procedures performed in the hospital setting (as part of inpatient admissions or day-case procedures) are provided in SAIL through linkage to the Patient Episode Database for Wales68, which begins in 1991 and contains data for all hospital-based care in Wales as well as hospital-based care provided in England to Welsh residents. Procedures are encoded using OPCS-4 codes69 and diagnoses using ICD-10 codes70. Attendance information at any NHS Wales hospital outpatient department is provided through linkage to the Outpatient Database for Wales71, which starts in 2004. ICD-10-encoded diagnoses of cancers are identified through linkage to the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit72, which is the national cancer registry for Wales that records all cancer diagnoses provided to Welsh residents wherever they were diagnosed or treated. This dataset begins in 1994. Finally, cause-of-death data are provided for all Welsh residents (regardless of where they died in the United Kingdom) through linkage to the Annual District Death Extract73, which begins in 1996 and includes primary and contributory causes of death from death certificates. Dates for deaths were those on which the death was registered, as opposed to when it occurred. Cause-of-death data use ICD-9 coding until 2001 and ICD-10 coding thereafter.

When testing for any discontinuities in educational attainment across the date-of-birth eligibility threshold, we used a dataset provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS)74. This dataset was generated by the ONS from the 2011 UK Census for all usual residents aged 16 or over, born in Wales between January 1925 and December 1950, regardless of their employment status. The data were categorized by the ONS by sex, month and year of birth (January 1925 to December 1950), highest level of qualification and occupation.

Ethics approval was granted by the Information Governance Review Panel (IGRP, application number, 1306). Composed of government, regulatory and professional agencies, the IGRP oversees and approves applications to use the SAIL databank. All analyses were approved and considered minimal risk by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board on 9 June 2023 (protocol number, 70277).

Our study population consisted of 296,603 individuals born between 1 September 1925 and 1 September 1942 who were registered with a primary care provider in Wales on the start date of the zoster vaccine program rollout (1 September 2013). As we only had access to the date of the Monday of the week in which an individual was born, we were unable to determine whether the individuals born in the cut-off week starting on 28 August 1933 were eligible for the zoster vaccine in the first year of its rollout. We therefore excluded 279 individuals born in this particular week. Among the remaining individuals, 13,783 had a diagnosis of dementia before 1 September 2013 and were therefore excluded from the analyses with new diagnoses of dementia as outcome. The size of our final analysis cohort for all primary analyses for new dementia diagnoses was therefore 282,541. This analysis cohort was used for all analyses except those with incidence of dementia before zoster vaccination program start, shingles and postherpetic neuralgia as outcomes; analyses for which we did not exclude individuals with a dementia diagnosis before 1 September 2013.

We followed individuals from 1 September 2013 to 31 August 2021, which allowed for a maximum follow-up period of 8 years. In our primary specification, we selected a follow-up period of 7 years (that is, until 31 August 2020) because this enabled us to include grace periods of up to 12 months while still keeping the follow-up period constant for individuals on either side of the date-of-birth eligibility cut-off. However, we also show all results for follow-up periods from one to eight years in one-year increments. Owing to the unique anonymized NHS number assigned to each patient, we were able to follow individuals across time even if they changed primary care provider. Patients were therefore only lost to follow-up in our cohort if they emigrated out of Wales or changed to one of the approximately 20% of primary care practices in Wales that did not contribute data to SAIL. Over our seven-year follow-up period, this was the case for 23,049 (8.2%) of adults in our primary analysis cohort, with no significant difference in this proportion between those born just before versus just after the 2 September 1933 eligibility threshold. In total, 92,629 (37.8%) of adults in our primary analysis cohort died during the seven-year follow-up period. Our primary analysis approach does not adjust for any competing risk of death for three reasons. First and foremost, in the absence of a zoster vaccination program, there is no reason that the competing risk of death should differ across the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility threshold. Second, not adjusting for competing risk of death in our setting is a conservative choice because eligibility for zoster vaccination may reduce (but is very unlikely to increase) all-cause mortality10,75. Thus, those eligible for zoster vaccination will, on average, be exposed to a longer time period during which they could become newly diagnosed with dementia. Third, to date, no well-established approach exists for survival analysis in a regression discontinuity framework, including the ability to determine the CACE and optimal bandwidth76.

Owing to the neuropathological overlap between dementia types and difficulty in distinguishing dementia types clinically77,78,79, we chose to define dementia as dementia of any type or cause. Dementia was defined as a diagnosis of dementia made either in primary care (as recorded in the primary care electronic health record data), specialist care or hospital-based care, or dementia being named as a primary or contributory cause of death on the death certificate. The date of the first recording of dementia across any of these data sources was used to define the date on which the patient was diagnosed with dementia. Similarly, all other outcomes were defined using a diagnosis made in any care setting or mentioning as a primary or contributory cause of death. For chronic conditions, the date of the first recording across any of these data sources was used to define the date on which the chronic condition occurred. For non-chronic conditions or events (that is, shingles, postherpetic neuralgia, stroke, lower respiratory tract infections, falls, lower back pain, medication prescriptions, influenza vaccination and breast cancer screening), the date of first recording after the program date across any of these data sources was used for defining the occurrence of the outcome during the follow-up. The Read and ICD-10 codes used to define all outcomes are detailed in the Supplementary Codes.

The two authors who analysed the data (M.E. and M.X.) have coded all parts of the analysis independently. Occasional minor differences, resulting from different data coding choices, were resolved through discussion.

We used a regression discontinuity design to analyse our data, which is a well-established method for causal inference in the social sciences80. Regression discontinuity analysis estimates expected outcome probabilities just left and just right of the cut-off, to obtain an estimate of the treatment effect. We used local linear triangular kernel regressions (assigning a higher weight to observations lying closer to the date-of-birth eligibility threshold) in our primary analyses and quadratic polynomials in robustness checks. This is the recommended and most robust approach for regression discontinuity analyses even in situations in which the relationship between the assignment variable (here, date of birth) and the outcome is exponential81. An important choice in regression discontinuity analyses is the width of the data window (the bandwidth) that is drawn around the threshold. Following standard practice, we used an MSE-optimal bandwidth82, which minimizes the MSEs of the regression fit, in our primary analyses. We determined this optimal bandwidth separately for each combination of sample and outcome definition. In robustness checks, we examined the degree to which our point estimates vary across different bandwidth choices ranging from 0.25 times to two times the MSE-optimal bandwidth. We used robust bias-corrected standard errors for inference83.

In the first step, we determined the effect of being eligible for the zoster vaccine (regardless of whether the individual actually received the vaccine) on our outcomes. To do so, we estimated the following regression equation:

where Yi is a binary variable equal to one if an individual experienced the outcome (for example, shingles or dementia). The binary variable Di indicates eligibility for the zoster vaccine and is equal to one if an individual was born on or after the cut-off date of 2 September 1933. The term (WOBi − C0) indicates an individual's week of birth centred around the cut-off date. The interaction term Di × (WOBi − C0) allows for the slope of the regression line to differ on either side of the threshold. The parameter β1 identifies the absolute effect of being eligible for the vaccine on the outcome. Wherever we report relative effects, we calculated these by dividing the absolute effect estimate β1 by the mean outcome just left of the date-of-birth eligibility threshold, that is, the estimate of α.

In the second step, we estimated the effect of actually receiving the zoster vaccine on our outcomes. This effect is commonly referred to as the complier average causal effect (CACE) in the econometrics literature84. As is standard practice84, we used a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to estimate the CACE. Fuzzy regression discontinuity analysis takes into account the fact that the vaccine is not deterministically assigned at the week-of-birth cut-off. Instead, a proportion of ineligible individuals still received the vaccine and a proportion of eligible individuals did not receive the vaccine. To account for this fuzziness in the assignment, the fuzzy regression discontinuity design uses an instrumental variable approach, with the instrumental variable being the binary variable that indicates whether or not an individual was eligible to receive the vaccine, that is, is born on or after 2 September 1933. As we verify in our plot of vaccine receipt by week of birth (Fig. 1a), individuals who were born immediately after the date-of-birth eligibility threshold had a far higher probability of receiving the zoster vaccine compared with those born immediately before the threshold. Other than the abrupt change in the probability of receiving the zoster vaccine, there probably is no other difference in characteristics that affect the probability of our outcomes occurring between those born immediately after versus immediately before the date-of-birth eligibility threshold. Thus, the indicator variable for the date-of-birth eligibility threshold is a valid instrumental variable to identify the causal effect of receipt of the zoster vaccine on our outcomes. To compare the probability of experiencing the outcome between those who actually received the zoster vaccine versus those who did not, the instrumental variable estimation scales the effect size for being eligible for the zoster vaccine by the size of the abrupt change in the probability of receiving the vaccine at the date-of-birth eligibility threshold. The size of the jump is estimated through the following first-stage regression equation:

where Vi is a binary variable indicating whether the individual received the zoster vaccine and θ1 identifies the discontinuous increase in vaccine receipt at the date-of-birth eligibility threshold. All other parameters are the same as in regression (1).

The CACE estimated by rescaling the effect of eligibility with the first-stage effect from equation (2) can be represented as an IV estimate for μ1 from the following second-stage regression:

where \({\hat{V}}_{i}\) is the predicted probability of zoster vaccine receipt obtained from the first-stage estimation from equation (2). This CACE, μ1, represents the (absolute) average causal effect of receiving the vaccine among compliers, that is, patients who take up the vaccine if and only if they are eligible.

To compute relative effect sizes, we first introduce some notation. Let R0,c be the mean outcome among unvaccinated compliers and R1,c the mean outcome among vaccinated compliers just at the threshold. By definition, the absolute CACE is μ1 = R1,c − R0,c and the relative effect is \(\frac{{\mu }_{1}}{{R}_{0,c}}\). To estimate the relative effect, we need an estimate for R0,c. While it is impossible to identify compliers individually, we can estimate means of their observable characteristics, including R0,c (ref. 85). Let R1 denote the mean outcome among all vaccinated individuals (including compliers) at the cut-off. Assuming no defiers exist (patients who get vaccinated if and only if they are not eligible), all vaccinated people are either compliers or always-takers (patients who get vaccinated irrespective of their eligibility). Thus, R1 is equal to the population-weighted average of the mean outcomes among vaccinated compliers and always-takers: R1 = Pc × R1,c + Pa × R1,a, where Pc and Pa are the population share of the compliers and always-takers and R1,a is the mean outcome among always-takers at the cut-off. Solving for R1,c yields \({R}_{1,c}=\frac{{R}_{1}-{R}_{1,a}\times {P}_{a}}{{P}_{c}\,}\). All right-hand-side quantities in this equation can be estimated from data. First, R1 and R1,a can be estimated, respectively, as α + β1 and α from re-estimating regression (1) only among vaccinated individuals. Second, Pa and Pc can be estimated, respectively, as \(\frac{\gamma }{{\theta }_{1}+\gamma }\) and \(\frac{{\theta }_{1}}{{\theta }_{1}+\gamma }\) from regression (2). Finally, we estimate R1,c by the above formula and R0,c = R1,c − μ1. The relative effect is estimated as \(\frac{{\mu }_{1}}{{R}_{0,c}}\). All regressions involved in these steps can be stacked and jointly estimated, so that the relative effect is expressed as a differentiable function of known estimators a 95% confidence interval of the relative CACE can be estimated using the delta method86.

Our analysis can only be confounded if the confounding variable changes abruptly at the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility threshold such that individuals very close to either side of this threshold would no longer be exchangeable with each other. The most plausible scenario of such a confounding variable would be the existence of an intervention that used the exact same date-of-birth eligibility threshold as the zoster vaccine rollout and that also affected the probability of a dementia diagnosis during our follow-up period. We conducted five analyses to demonstrate that the existence of such an intervention is unlikely, by establishing that measures of outcomes and behaviours that would be affected by such an intervention are smooth across the date-of-birth eligibility cut-off.

First, across a range of birthdates around the 2 September 1933 eligibility threshold, we plotted the probability of having received the following diagnoses or interventions before the start of the zoster vaccine program (on 1 September 2013): diagnosis of shingles, influenza vaccine receipt in the preceding 12 months, receipt of the pneumococcal vaccine as an adult, current statin use (defined as a new or repeat prescription of a statin in the 3 months preceding program start), current use of an antihypertensive medication (defined as a new or repeat prescription of an antihypertensive drug in the 3 months preceding the program start), participation in breast cancer screening (defined as the proportion of women with a record of referral to, attendance at or a report from breast cancer screening or mammography), each of the ten leading causes of disability-adjusted life years and mortality for Wales in 2019 as estimated by the Global Burden of Disease Project33, and all comorbidities (except for AIDS, which falls under privacy-protected diagnoses not made available by the SAIL database) that are included in the widely-used Charlson Comorbidity Index34. Moreover, we used each of these conditions, gender, decile of Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation56, as well as all input variables to the Dementia Risk Score (as recorded before 1 September 2013)32, to predict the probability (while imputing a fixed age) of a new dementia diagnosis for each patient in the MSE-optimal bandwidth in our primary regression discontinuity analysis for dementia. In addition to plotting these predicted probabilities across a range of birthdates around the 2 September 1933 eligibility threshold, we also plotted the distribution of these predicted probabilities for patients who were eligible versus patients who were ineligible for zoster vaccination. The Read codes for each of these variables are provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. As is the case for balance tables in clinical trials, these plots provide reassurance that individuals close to either side of the 2 September 1933 eligibility threshold are likely to be exchangeable with each other.

Second, we conducted the same analysis as we did for individuals with birthdays on either side of the 2 September 1933 threshold also for people with birthdays around 2 September of each of the three years of birth preceding and succeeding 1933. For example, when moving the start date of the program to 1 September 2011, we started the follow-up period on 1 September 2011 and compared individuals around the 2 September 1931 eligibility threshold. To ensure the same length of follow-up in each of these comparisons, we had to reduce the follow-up period to 5 years for this set of analyses. Thus, as an additional check, we shifted the start date of the program to 1 September of each of the six years preceding (but not succeeding) 2013, which enabled us to maintain the same seven-year follow-up period as in our primary analysis. If another intervention that affects dementia risk also used the 2 September threshold to define eligibility, we may then expect to observe effects on dementia incidence for these comparisons of individuals just around the 2 September thresholds of other birth years.

Third, we conducted the identical comparison of individuals around the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth threshold as in our primary analysis, except for starting the follow-up period 7 years before the start of the zoster vaccine program rollout. If there was an intervention that used the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility threshold but was implemented before the rollout of the zoster vaccine program, then we may expect to see an effect of the September 1933 threshold on dementia incidence in this analysis.

Fourth, we verified that the effects that we observed in our analyses for dementia incidence appear to be specific to dementia. If an intervention that used the exact same date-of-birth eligibility threshold as the zoster vaccine program indeed existed, it would be unlikely to only affect dementia risk without also having an influence on other health outcomes. We therefore conducted the same analysis as for when using dementia incidence as the outcome but for each of the ten leading causes of disability-adjusted life years and mortality in Wales in 2019 for the age group 70+ years33, as well as all conditions that are part of the Charlson Comorbidity Index34.

Fifth, we tested for discontinuities in educational attainment at the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth threshold using data from the 2011 census in Wales74. If an educational policy had used a 2 September (or specifically 2 September 1933) date-of-birth threshold and the policy was effective in increasing educational attainment, we would then expect discontinuities at the 2 September 1933 threshold in the attained education level between eligible and ineligible individuals. We used the identical analysis approach for this balance test as for our primary analyses in the SAIL database, except that we computed ‘honest' confidence intervals based on the approach by Armstrong and Kolesár because the assignment variable (month of birth) in these data was monthly, and therefore coarser than the assignment variable (week of birth) in our analyses in the SAIL database87,88. This approach guards against potential vulnerability to model misspecification and resulting under-coverage of confidence intervals computed with more standard methods. These honest confidence intervals are conservative in the sense that they have good coverage properties irrespective of whether the functional form in the regression discontinuity analysis is misspecified, provided that the true functional form falls within a certain class of functions. For this class, we considered a function class defined by bounds on the second derivative of the conditional expectation function mapping date of birth to the probability attaining a certain educational level. We used conservative bounds of the respective curvatures by relying on global estimation of higher-order polynomials as proposed by Armstrong and Kolesár88.

We additionally used a difference-in-differences instrumental variable approach (DID-IV) to confirm the findings from our regression discontinuity design because, in contrast to the regression discontinuity analysis, this approach does not rely on the continuity assumption (that is, the assumption that potential confounding variables do not abruptly change at precisely the date-of-birth eligibility threshold for the zoster vaccine program). To do so, we restricted our sample to patients born between 1 March 1926 and 28 February 1934. This sample consists of 96,767 adults, of whom 7,752 (8.0%) were eligible for, and 3,949 (4.1%) actually received, zoster vaccination. We then divided our sample into yearly cohorts centred around 1 September (that is, a cohort is all patients born between 1 March of one year and 28 February of the following year). Finally, we divided each yearly cohort into a pre-September birth season and a post-September birth season. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we then compared the outcome (new diagnoses of dementia) between patients born in pre- and post-September birth seasons and across yearly cohorts. More precisely, we tested whether the difference in outcomes across birth seasons is different for the 1933/1934 cohort than for the other cohorts. In doing so, we exploit the fact that zoster vaccination eligibility only differs between the two birth seasons in the 1933/1934-cohort but not in other cohorts, while accounting for the possibility that pre-September and post-September birth seasons may be systematically different for other reasons.

Our difference-in-differences setup implies that the interaction between the post-September birth season indicator and the 1933/1934-cohort indicator constitutes an instrumental variable for receipt of the zoster vaccine, enabling us to estimate the CACE (that is, the effect of actually receiving the vaccine among the compliers). This DID-IV approach relies on two important assumptions. As per the standard exclusion restriction assumption of IV analyses, the IV component of our DID-IV approach assumes that vaccine eligibility affects the outcome solely through a change in actual vaccine receipt. The DID component of our DID-IV approach assumes that, in the absence of the vaccine eligibility rule, the between-birth-season difference in vaccine uptake and in dementia incidence would have been the same in the 1933/1934 cohort as in the other cohorts. To investigate the validity of this assumption, we plotted the mean vaccine uptake and dementia incidence with 95% CIs by birth cohorts and birth seasons (Supplementary Fig. 29). As expected, we find that the between-birth-season differences in vaccine uptake diverge only in the 1933/1934 birth cohort. The absence of a between-birth-season difference in other birth cohorts supports the validity of our DID assumption.

To estimate the CACE in this DID-IV framework, we used two-stage least-squares regression. In the first stage, we identify the vaccine uptake due to the exogeneous change in vaccination eligibility by the following regression equation:

where Vi is a binary variable indicating patient i actually received the zoster vaccine. Si and Ci are binary variables indicating that patient i is born in the post-September birth season and in the 1933/1934 birth cohort, respectively. γ identifies the vaccine uptake due to the change in eligibility. θ, ηm and ηc are the constant term, birth month (January, February, …, December) and birth cohort (1926/1927, 1927/1928, …, 1933/1934) fixed effect, respectively. ϵi is the error term.

In the second stage, we estimate the effect of vaccine receipt by the following regression:

where Yi is the outcome of patient i. \({\widehat{V}}_{i}\) is the probability of vaccine receipt predicted from the first-stage regression (4). The coefficient β identifies the CACE. α, ηm and ηc are the constant term, birth month and birth cohort (1926/1927, 1927/1928, …, 1933/1934) fixed effect, respectively. ϵi is the error term.

We conducted a series of additional robustness checks. First, instead of starting the follow-up period for all individuals on 1 September 2013, we adjusted the follow-up period to account for the staggered rollout of the program by beginning the follow-up period for each individual on the date on which they first became eligible for the zoster vaccine (as described in the ‘Description of the zoster vaccine rollout in Wales' section) (Supplementary Fig. 30). We controlled for cohort fixed effects in these analyses to account for the one- to two-year (depending on the year of the program) differences between cohorts in the calendar year in which this moving follow-up window started. That is, we defined one cohort fixed effect for ineligible individuals and the first catch-up cohort and then included additional cohort fixed effects for each group of patients who became eligible at the same time. Second, we varied our definition of a new diagnosis of dementia by implementing our analysis when defining dementia as a new prescription of donepezil hydrochloride, galantamine, rivastigmine or memantine hydrochloride. Third, we tested whether our results for the effect of being eligible for zoster vaccination on new diagnoses of dementia, shingles and postherpetic neuralgia hold across grace periods (that is, time periods since the index date after which follow-up time is considered to begin to allow for the time needed for a full immune response to develop after vaccine administration) of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months (Supplementary Fig. 31). Fourth, we show our results with bandwidth choices of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75 and 2.00 times the MSE-optimal bandwidth (Supplementary Fig. 32). Fifth, we verified that our results are similar when using a local second-order polynomial specification instead of local linear regression.

We conducted four analyses to examine this potential effect mechanism, the first three of which are described in detail in the main text. The fourth analysis was an event study that focused on the date of a shingles diagnosis during the follow-up period. Our event study compared the mean outcome in each month relative to the month before the date of the shingles diagnosis. Our regression model controls for changes over time (such as due to ageing of the study population or seasonal patterns in healthcare provider visits) using month-level fixed effects.

To implement our event study, we restricted our study population to those 56,098 individuals born within the MSE-optimal bandwidth of our primary regression discontinuity analysis for dementia. We then aggregated our event-level data into monthly longitudinal data, spanning September 2013 to March 2022. For each outcome of interest (as described in the main text), we then estimated the following event-study regression:

where Yit is the outcome of interest for individual i in period t; shingles is a binary variable equal to one if the individual was diagnosed with shingles during the follow-up period; Dk are indicator variables for the k months before and after the shingles diagnosis (with k = −36, −35,…, 35, 36, and set to zero for individuals who were never diagnosed with shingles during the follow-up period); γk are the coefficients of interest, which capture the difference in the outcome in month k relative to the month before the shingles diagnosis; ηi is an individual-level fixed effect capturing time-invariant differences across individuals; and λt is a month-level fixed effect, capturing differences across periods. We used standard errors that allowed for clustering at the individual level, and therefore for autocorrelation.

We conducted four analyses to examine this potential effect mechanism. First, we implemented the identical regression discontinuity as in our primary analysis, except that we included a binary variable for being diagnosed with shingles during the follow-up period as a covariate. For the resulting estimate to be an unbiased measure of the degree to which the effect of zoster vaccination on dementia incidence is mediated by shingles diagnoses, there must be no variables that are related to both new dementia diagnoses and the probability of being diagnosed with shingles (that is, no confounding of the mediator-to-outcome relationship)89.

Second, to examine when during the follow-up period the dementia-delaying or dementia-preventing effect of zoster vaccination begins to emerge, we plotted Kaplan–Meier plots and (to account for competing risks) cumulative incidence curves among individuals born close to 2 September 1933. This analysis was based on the concept of local randomization28,29, which relies on exchangeability of individuals born immediately before versus immediately after 2 September 1933. To define the bandwidth for our analysis in which we could reasonably assume exchangeability across the threshold while maximizing statistical power, we used the widest bandwidth for which we achieved balance in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals eligible versus ineligible for zoster vaccination. We evaluated bandwidths ranging from 100% to 10% of the MSE-optimal bandwidth (90.6 weeks) in our primary regression discontinuity analysis in 10% decrements. The variables we used for our balance tests were the 14 variables listed in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 (except for the more sex-specific variables of past breast cancer screening, breast cancer and prostate cancer diagnoses) using a significance threshold of P < 0.05, while controlling for the false-discovery rate using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure90. The largest bandwidth that achieved balance across all variables was 54.4 weeks.

Third, to investigate whether antiviral treatment during a shingles episode was associated with a reduction in the risk of dementia relative to not receiving treatment during a shingles episode, we restricted our study population to those individuals who received a diagnosis of shingles at any time after 1 January 2000 and had not received a diagnosis of dementia before 1 January 2000. Our exposure of interest in this analysis was whether or not an individual received a prescription of antiviral medication (acyclovir, famcyclovir, valacyclovir or inosine pranobex) within three months of the first shingles diagnosis. Individuals were followed up from the date of first shingles diagnosis until either the date of death, moving out of Wales, GP deregistration or end of data availability (1 March 2022). We then used a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to regress diagnoses of dementia made after the date of the first recorded shingles episode onto whether or not the patient received an antiviral medication prescription for the first shingles episode. In a robustness check, we required that a new diagnosis of dementia must have been made at least 12 months after the date of the first shingles diagnosis. We adjusted our regressions for gender, restricted cubic splines (with three knots) of age at the first shingles infection, and the 12 variables in Supplementary Fig. 1 (excluding past breast and prostate cancer diagnoses).

Fourth, to explore whether experiencing recurrent shingles episodes was associated with a higher risk of dementia than having only a single episode, we used the same study population as in our analysis for treated versus untreated shingles. We matched individuals (via 1:1 propensity score matching) who had more than one shingles diagnosis (with the diagnosis dates having to be at least three months apart) after 1 January 2000 to individuals who only received a single shingles diagnosis after 1 January 2000. We matched individuals on proximity in the date of their first shingles diagnosis as well as the same list of baseline variables as for our analysis of treated versus untreated shingles, and forced an exact match on week of birth and gender. In each matched pair, we used the date of the second shingles diagnosis of the individual with more than one shingles diagnosis as the start date of the follow-up period. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, we then regressed new diagnoses of dementia made during the follow-up period onto whether or not the individual had received more than one shingles diagnosis. In a robustness check, we again required that a new diagnosis of dementia must have been made at least 12 months after the start date of the follow-up period.

To estimate the treatment effect heterogeneities described under this section in the main text, we fully interacted our fuzzy regression discontinuity model with a binary variable that indicates having the condition in question (for example, an autoimmune condition). Precisely, the fully interacted model was specified as:

where the subscript i indexes individuals. Yi is a binary variable equal to 1 if an individual was newly diagnosed with dementia during the follow-up period. The binary variable Vi indicates receipt of the zoster vaccine. The binary variable Di indicates eligibility for the zoster vaccine (that is, born on or after 2 September 1933). The term WOBi − c0 indicates an individual's week of birth centred around the date-of-birth eligibility threshold. The interaction term Di × (WOBi − c0) allows for the slope of the regression line to differ on either side of the date-of-birth eligibility threshold. The binary variable HETi is equal to one if an individual had the condition in question. Adding the terms (WOBi − c0) × HETi and Di × (WOBi − c0) × HETi allows the slopes to vary by this condition.

Vi and Vi × HETi are instrumented by Di and Di × HETi. Using the two-stage least-squares approach, the parameter β4 identifies the effect heterogeneity, that is, the difference in CACE on the outcome between patients with and without the condition. β1 and β1 + β4 identify the effect among compliers in the reference and comparison group, respectively. The estimates of the effects and heterogeneity are reported in absolute terms. To be consistent with our primary fuzzy regression discontinuity model (that is, without the HETi and interaction terms), we used local linear triangular kernel regressions and the MSE-optimal bandwidth from the primary model of the respective outcome.

For our analyses for autoimmune and allergic conditions, we used the 19 most common autoimmune conditions as defined previously91, and grouped the 11 least common conditions among them into a rare conditions category. We judged those conditions to be rare that had an incidence of less than 1% during the follow-up period in our cohort. These rare conditions included Addison's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, Coeliac disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, primary biliary cirrhosis, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis and vitiligo. For common allergic conditions, we used those defined previously92.

Although it is one of the most arid regions today, the Sahara Desert was a green savannah during the African Humid Period (AHP) between 14,500 and 5,000 years before present, with water bodies promoting human occupation and the spread of pastoralism in the middle Holocene epoch1. DNA rarely preserves well in this region, limiting knowledge of the Sahara's genetic history and demographic past. Here we report ancient genomic data from the Central Sahara, obtained from two approximately 7,000-year-old Pastoral Neolithic female individuals buried in the Takarkori rock shelter in southwestern Libya. The majority of Takarkori individuals' ancestry stems from a previously unknown North African genetic lineage that diverged from sub-Saharan African lineages around the same time as present-day humans outside Africa and remained isolated throughout most of its existence. Both Takarkori individuals are closely related to ancestry first documented in 15,000-year-old foragers from Taforalt Cave, Morocco2, associated with the Iberomaurusian lithic industry and predating the AHP. Takarkori and Iberomaurusian-associated individuals are equally distantly related to sub-Saharan lineages, suggesting limited gene flow from sub-Saharan to Northern Africa during the AHP. In contrast to Taforalt individuals, who have half the Neanderthal admixture of non-Africans, Takarkori shows ten times less Neanderthal ancestry than Levantine farmers, yet significantly more than contemporary sub-Saharan genomes. Our findings suggest that pastoralism spread through cultural diffusion into a deeply divergent, isolated North African lineage that had probably been widespread in Northern Africa during the late Pleistocene epoch.

Following the last glacial period, a climatic transformation in the Sahara desert led to the AHP, which peaked around 11,000 to 5,000 years ago3,4. During this period of increased humidity, the region transformed into a ‘Green Sahara' with savanna-like landscapes, varying tree cover, permanent lakes and extensive river systems5 (Fig. 1). Evidence from ancient lake deposits, pollen samples and archaeological artifacts confirm human presence, hunting, herding and resource gathering in the currently arid desert region1,6,7. However, despite this rich history, much about the genetic history of the human population of the Green Sahara remains unclear due to limited DNA preservation under the current climatic conditions. Ancient DNA data from northwestern Africa points to a stable and isolated genetic population from at least 15,000 to 7,500 years ago2,8. This stability was disrupted by the arrival of early farming groups from southwestern Europe between 7,500 and 5,700 years ago who marked the beginning of the Neolithic in the Maghreb by introducing farming practices to the local foragers9. The earliest herders with their livestock entered Africa probably along the Sinai and the Red Sea routes, after which they rapidly spread into northeastern Africa and reached the Central Sahara around 8,300 years ago10. By 6,400 years ago, further gene flow occurred with the appearance of ancestry associated with Neolithic groups from the Levant, whose archaeological signatures are visible in the Eastern Sahara9,11,12. A previous study13 analysed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from individuals recovered from the Takarkori rock shelter in the Tadrart Acacus Mountains of southwestern Libya—the same individuals examined in this study—providing the first ancient DNA from pastoralists of the Green Sahara. However, non-recombining and therefore effectively single genetic loci like mtDNA have much less statistical power to reveal population dynamics than genome-wide autosomal data. Their origins and whether the arrival of pastoralism into the Green Sahara was linked to the movement of peoples from the Levant or rather cultural diffusion remain a matter of debate10,14.

Here we present first genome-wide data obtained from the same two approximately 7,000-year-old Saharan herders, recovered from the Takarkori rock shelter in the Central Sahara (Supplementary Figs. 1.2–1.5), a site that has yielded an exceptional wealth of data and material remains15,16,17,18,19. Our findings show that these individuals predominantly carry a previously unknown ancestral North African lineage that lacks the Neanderthal admixture typically found outside Africa and appears to have remained largely isolated, with the notable exception of small traces of Levantine admixture. These results support that pastoralism in the Sahara was established through cultural diffusion10 rather than significant human gene flow. Furthermore, the Takarkori individuals exhibit a close genetic affinity to Northwestern African foragers but no substantial ties with sub-Saharan African lineages, implying no detectable genetic exchange across the Green Sahara during the AHP from sub-Saharan to northern Africa. For a non-peer-reviewed Arabic summary of the article, see Supplementary Note 3.

The Takarkori rock shelter—situated in southwestern Libya's Tadrart Acacus Mountains—offers a remarkable glimpse into the Sahara's greener past15,20. The excavations at this archaeological site revealed a timeline of human settlement from Late Acacus hunter-gatherer-fishers from around 10,200 calibrated years before the present (cal. bp) to a long Pastoral Neolithic occupation, dated from approximately 8,300 to 4,200  cal. bp10,21. Data from these latter periods traces the sociocultural trajectories of Neolithic herding societies in Central Sahara, from early livestock introduction to the development of a full pastoral economy characterized by transhumance and the use of secondary product22,23 (Supplementary Note 1). Within the deepest recess of the rock shelter, 15 human burials were unearthed, pertaining to a timeframe between approximately 8,900 and 4,800 cal. bp22, with the majority dating back to the Early (8,300–7,300 cal. bp) and Middle (7,100–5,600 cal. bp) Pastoral period22. Strontium isotope analysis on the remains, primarily of women of reproductive age, children and juveniles, indicated a local geographical origin24. Two naturally mummified adult female individuals, attributed to the Middle Pastoral Period, were selected for our DNA analysis. These individuals were directly radiocarbon dated to 7,158–6,796 and 6,555–6,281 cal. bp (95.4% probability), respectively13 (Supplementary Note 1).

We extracted DNA from the powdered tooth root from individual TKH001 and from two fibula fragments from TKH009. Given their extremely low endogenous human DNA content (0.085–1.363%; Supplementary Table 2.1), we opted for a DNA capture approach to cost-effectively retrieve informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for autosomal analysis. Sampling of other skeletal elements in the future may provide DNA extracts with higher percentage of endogenous DNA that allow for whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Using dedicated ancient DNA protocols (Methods), we prepared DNA libraries and enriched them through a DNA hybridization approach with the Twist Ancient DNA panel25 targeting 1.4 million SNPs for TKH001 and the 1240K panel26 targeting 1.2 million SNPs for TKH009. Despite challenging preservation conditions, sequencing yielded 881,765 SNPs for TKH001 and 23,317 SNPs for TKH009 (Supplementary Table 2.4). For TKH001, we conducted additional enrichment for 1.7 million SNPs, targeting sites informative about Neanderthal and Denisovan admixture (Archaic Admixture SNP capture panel)27. DNA sequences from both Takarkori individuals had a post-mortem degradation pattern typical of ancient DNA and low contamination estimates (Supplementary Figs. 2.1, 2.2 and Supplementary Table 2.3).

To visualize the variation in the genetic ancestry of the Takarkori individuals, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) using genome-wide data from 795 present-day individuals from the whole African continent, the Near East and Southern Europe, all genotyped on the Human Origins SNP panel28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38 (Supplementary Data 1 and 2). We then projected the Takarkori individuals and 117 relevant published ancient genomes2,8,9,35,36,39,40,41,42,43,44 (Supplementary Data 2) onto the first two principal components (PCs). The Takarkori individuals plot broadly intermediate between West African and Near Eastern groups on PC1, albeit closer to West Africans (Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 2.6 and Supplementary Data 3). To obtain a finer-scale view, we restricted the African populations to West Africa, the Sahel and East Africa, while retaining the Near Eastern and Southern European populations (Supplementary Data 3). This PCA captured the geographical distributions of these populations, whereby PC1 separates African from non-African populations and PC2 differentiates within Africa, particularly separating Sahel/West African from East African populations (Extended Data Fig. 2). Both Takarkori individuals maintained a distinct position, intermediate between Sahel/West and East African populations (Fig. 2a), and formed a tight cluster with overlapping 95% confidence interval (CI) ellipses (Supplementary Fig. 2.4). The PCA projections broadly mirror geography, including the placement of Takarkori. For subsequent population genetic analyses, we merged the low-coverage data from the TKH009 individual with the high-coverage data from the TKH001 individual. We note that many of the signals in this group analysis are probably driven by TKH001 owing to its much higher coverage.

To probe for shared genetic drift of Takarkori with other ancient and modern genomes, we computed outgroup f3 statistics30 of the form f3(Takarkori, X; South Africa 2,000 cal. bp), with X representing worldwide ancient and present-day test populations and South Africa 2,000 cal. bp as the deepest modern human outgroup lineage44. We found that the Takarkori individuals share the most genetic drift with Moroccan Palaeolithic and Early Neolithic individuals. Specifically, we observed the highest level with an Epipalaeolithic individual from Ifri Ouberrid and similarly elevated shared drift with the 15,000-year-old foragers from Taforalt and the Early Neolithic individuals from Ifri n'Amr o'Moussa (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2.12). Both Epipalaeolithic and Early Neolithic groups have been previously shown to maintain high genetic continuity with the much older Taforalt group8,9, explaining the similarly elevated shared drift statistics between all three groups and the Takarkori individuals.

The colour gradient from blue to green indicates the genetic proximity to Takarkori, with the bluer colours representing closer genetic relationships. The statistics and their associated s.e. values for the top 70 signals are presented in Supplementary Fig. 2.12. b, No group shares extra affinity with Takarkori genomes compared with Taforalt, as measured by f4 statistics of the form f4(chimpanzee, X; Takarkori, Taforalt). The error bars represent 3 s.e. Group colours follow the same scheme as in Fig. 2. A more extensive list is presented in Supplementary Fig. 2.19. LSA, Late Stone Age; N, neolithic.

When restricting the comparative groups to present-day African and Near Eastern populations, we found that a group of individuals defined as FulaniA in a previous study38, which includes individuals from relatively less admixed Fulani herders from eight Sahelian countries, shows an increased genetic affinity to Takarkori, although less so to Taforalt (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 2.16). This finding aligns with ref. 38, which observed a non-sub-Saharan ancestry component in FulaniA similar to that found in the Taforalt and Late Neolithic Moroccans. To further probe for Takarkori-like ancestry in FulaniA, we conducted an f4 analysis f4(chimpanzee, X; Masai/Datog/Iraqw, Takarkori), using Masai/Datog/Iraqw as baseline references owing to their similar amount of out-of-Africa (OoA) ancestry to Takarkori (Supplementary Fig. 2.20.1–2.20.3). The results indicated that the FulaniA have an increased affinity to Takarkori-like ancestry, as do other Sahelian and West African groups. These findings are consistent with the archaeological evidence of the southward expansion of Pastoral Neolithic groups from Central Sahara. Rock art, ceramic production and funerary practices provide detailed indications of the spread of these herders at the end of the Middle Holocene, probably driven by the progressive aridification of the Central Saharan regions45,46.

Given the high amount of shared genetic drift between the Takarkori and the ancestry first appearing in the 15,000-year-old Taforalt individuals in the outgroup f3 statistics, we subsequently investigated whether the Takarkori genomes share more alleles with other human groups compared to the Taforalt genome. For this analysis, we computed the statistics f4(chimpanzee, X; Takarkori, Taforalt), where X represents ancient and present-day groups from Africa and Eurasia. We obtained significantly positive values for Eurasian and Eurasian-admixed African groups, suggesting that the Taforalt group shares more alleles with these groups than Takarkori does. Conversely, none of the ancient or modern groups tested showed a significantly negative signal, indicating no detected closer affinity with Takarkori than Taforalt. Notably, both ancient and modern sub-Saharan groups, who are mostly unadmixed with Eurasian groups, yielded no significant value (|Z| < 3), suggesting that these groups are equally distant from both the Takarkori and Taforalt groups (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Data 4). Moreover, when running statistics f4(Chimp, Takarkori; X, Taforalt), we found significantly positive values for every population X, indicating that Takarkori shares more alleles with Taforalt than any other group (Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Data 4).

At the mtDNA level, both Takarkori individuals belong to a basal branch of haplogroup N, representing one of the deepest mtDNA lineages outside sub-Saharan Africa and predating present-day N-derived mtDNAs13. Using BEAST analysis for mtDNA dating, which included additional sequences from Upper Palaeolithic individuals and the dataset described previously13, we corroborate the previous findings of ref. 13 that the Takarkori individuals carried a basal N haplogroup lineage13, and refined the molecular split date estimate to 61,343 years old (95% highest posterior density (HPD) = 54,408–69,046) (Extended Data Fig. 6). Notably, the mtDNA lineage of the Oase 1 individual falls more basal to haplogroup N, suggesting an earlier split from the OoA lineage before the divergence of the Takarkori lineage. However, owing to incomplete lineage sorting and mtDNA representing a single lineage, the exact timing of the underlying population splits remains uncertain.

Previous work modelled the Taforalt group's ancestry as a two-way admixture of approximately 63.5% Natufian (ancient Levantine foragers) and 36.5% sub-Saharan African ancestries2. However, this model using the software qpAdm2 could not pinpoint the origin of Taforalt's African ancestry, resulting in unknown ghost ancestry only broadly linked to South, East and Central African groups2. Here we included Takarkori as a possible source of the African ancestry in Taforalt in comparison to several potential sources (namely Yoruba, Dinka, Mota, Cameroon Shum Laka, Botswana Xaro Early Iron Age (EIA) and Tanzania Zanzibar 1,300 cal. bp) through rotation-based qpAdm. We found that Saharan Takarkori provides a much better fit as an African proxy for Taforalt than the sub-Saharan groups, attaining a P value of >0.05, indicative of a much better model fit compared to the other sources (P < 2.84 × 10−34) (Extended Data Figs. 7, 8 and Supplementary Tables 2.6, 2.7). With this revised model, we estimated that the Taforalt ancestry retains a comparable 60.8% (±1.8%) contribution from Natufians, with the remaining 39.2% (±1.8%) derived from Takarkori.

We next explored the direct genetic affinity between Takarkori and the OoA ancestry found in all non-African modern humans, in contrast to African groups. For this, we computed f4 statistics of the form f4(chimpanzee, Zlatý kůň; African, Takarkori). Zlatý kůň, a 45,000-year-old Upper Palaeolithic individual from Czechia, was used as a proxy for OoA ancestry as it is probably the oldest modern human sequenced to date and represents the deepest known human lineage after the OoA lineage splits from the African lineages47. Our results showed positive values for Takarkori, indicating that it is genetically closer to Zlatý kůň than to sub-Saharan Africans, including Mota, a 4,500-year-old genome from East Africa. Nevertheless, various African populations with substantial OoA admixture were still genetically closer to Zlatý kůň than to Takarkori (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Data 5).

These results raise the question of whether Takarkori's ancestors are closely related to OoA groups but remained in Africa, or whether they received later gene flow from OoA groups. If Takarkori experienced such later gene flow, it would carry Neanderthal admixture that is found in all OoA groups. To explore this signal, we used the data generated using the Archaic Admixture SNP panel for Takarkori and the software admixfrog48 that detects Neanderthal segments and included other ancient African and Eurasian groups as well as modern sub-Saharan African populations for comparison (Supplementary Note 2). We detected a total of 12 Neanderthal fragments that surpass 0.05 cM in length (approximately 50 kb), with the longest fragment located on chromosome 1 (Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Fig. 2.32), translating to a low level of Neanderthal ancestry in the Takarkori genome of approximately 0.15% (Fig. 4a). This percentage is less than a quarter of the Neanderthal ancestry in segments longer than 0.05 cM found in Taforalt and Neolithic Morocco individuals (0.6–0.9%), and about tenfold lower than in most OoA groups (1.4–2.36%), yet significantly higher than that in other ancient and contemporary sub-Saharan African genomes, where Neanderthal ancestry was completely absent. This pattern suggests that the Takarkori individuals have received a small amount of ancestry from OoA groups. However, the estimation of admixture dating of this OoA ancestry with DATES49 based on linkage disequilibrium (Supplementary Figs. 2.26.1–2.26.3) indicated very ancient admixture events with substantial uncertainty.

The error bars represent the minimum and maximum estimates from all iterations. b, The geographical locations of groups included in the analysis. c, Admixture graph modelling of Takarkori's ancestral relationship with relevant populations.

Finally, we used the find_graphs() function from the ADMIXTOOLS 250 package to model Takarkori's ancestral relationship with other populations. We used a function for automated graph exploration with a model that includes Mota, Iran Neolithic, Natufian, Taforalt, Takarkori and the outgroup chimpanzee. The model fits with small f-statistic residuals (max |f4,expected − f4,observed| = 0.27 s.e.). The fitted graph suggests that Takarkori traces most of its ancestry (93%) to a hitherto unknown North African population, in agreement with the isolation signature obtained from the f4 statistics mentioned above (Fig. 3b). This unknown North African population is closely related to OoA populations and branches off the lineage leading to OoA later than the ancient individual from Mota Cave, Ethiopia, who represents the sub-Saharan African lineage most closely related to OoA groups identified so far. In our model, the remainder of the Takarkori individuals' ancestry (7%) is derived from a deeply ancient Levantine source. The Levantine gene flow also accounts for the Neanderthal ancestry found in Takarkori as the Levantine Neolithic genomes carry around 1.86% Neanderthal ancestry, aligning with our estimates using admixfrog. The graph also models Taforalt as a mixture of a 40% contribution from a Takarkori-related branch and 60% from a Natufian-related branch, consistent with our qpAdm results (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Data 6).

Our study introduces ancient genome-wide data from humans that inhabited the Green Sahara, providing unique insights into the genomic ancestry of populations in this region. The individuals from the Takarkori rock shelter predominantly carry an ancestral African lineage, representing an ancestry profile that has not been previously described. They share the most genetic drift with Epipalaeolithic and Early Neolithic individuals from Ifri Ouberrid and Ifri n'Amr o'Moussa, as well as the 15,000-year-old foragers from the Taforalt Cave in Morocco, suggesting a long-standing and stable population in North Africa before the AHP (14,500–5,000 bp). Plausibly, this ancestry was present in large parts of Northern Africa after the OoA event, and the Takarkori individuals inherited it from the group that inhabited the area during the final period of the Late Acacus (10,200–8,000 cal. bp). In Southwestern Libya, this period preceded the arrival of domesticates and is characterized by cultural advancements within those hunter–gatherer groups10. This included an increase in sedentism51, and the use of sophisticated material cultures such as pottery, basketry, and bone and wooden tools52,53,54.

We found that individuals from Takarkori exhibit only a marginal amount of genetic admixture from Levantine groups, suggesting that the emergence of pastoralism in the Sahara was primarily driven by the dissemination of cultural practices rather than through large-scale human migration, as suggested on archaeological basis10. Material culture at the onset of the earliest pastoral period shows both continuity and change, reflecting possibly complex assimilation dynamics during socioeconomic transitions10,19. These patterns may further suggest gradual cultural transformations rather than abrupt population replacement. This interpretation is further supported by the comparatively lower levels of Neanderthal genetic admixture found in the Takarkori individuals. Our admixture dating analysis points to events far back in time, suggesting a more heterogeneous spread of pastoralism and food production in the Sahara compared to Morocco and East Africa, where there was a noticeable increase in recent Levantine genetic admixture9,35,39,43. In addition to these findings, a run of homozygosity (ROH) analysis for TKH001 revealed no ROH segments larger than 12 cM, indicating no close-kin inbreeding (Supplementary Fig. 2.28). Several shorter ROH segments over 4 cM suggest an effective population size (Ne) of around 1,000 individuals, reflecting a moderately sized population.

Our research offers insights into the ancestry of the previously published Taforalt hunter-gatherers. While a previous study2 could not precisely ascribe the ‘sub-Saharan' component in the Taforalt genome, we now identify this ancestry as a deep North African lineage, with higher proportions found in the Saharan Takarkori individuals. This refines the earlier model, which proposed a dual admixture of Natufian and broadly sub-Saharan African ancestries. Our updated model suggests that the Taforalt ancestry is composed of a 60% contribution from a Natufian-like Levantine population, with the remaining 40% derived from a Takarkori-like ancestral North African population (Extended Data Fig. 8). Notably, both the late Pleistocene Taforalt and the mid-Holocene Takarkori individuals demonstrate equally distant relationships with sub-Saharan African lineages. This pattern suggests that no substantial genetic exchanges across the Green Sahara occurred during the AHP or other humid periods preceding the Later Pleistocene. The Sahara, spanning around 9 million km2 and housing diverse biomes, such as grasslands, wetlands, woodlands, lakes, mountains and savannas55,56, probably saw fragmented habitats impacting human gene flow. These ecological barriers, combined with social and cultural barriers, spatial structuring of populations, and the selective adoption of specific practices, may have facilitated the widespread dissemination of similar archaeological features57,58, while limiting extensive genetic admixture. This genetic discontinuity is consistent with modern data, which show substantial genetic differentiation across the Sahara beyond just a geographical gap59. Our findings suggest that sporadic Green Sahara events, particularly before pastoralism, were insufficient to allow for considerable genetic exchange, mirroring the Sahara's persistent role in limiting human genetic flow, as reflected in both ancient and modern population structures.

Our findings represent an important initial step, and future genetic studies could reveal more refined insights into human migration and gene flow across the Sahara. As sequencing costs continue to fall, whole-genome sequencing could enable more unbiased estimates regarding OoA events and other key aspects of human evolution.

The present-day communities of the Tadrart Acacus region, the Kel Tadrart pastoral group, have been actively engaged in both the excavation activities at the site (field assistance, sieving and so on) and in the decision-making processes and actions related to its conservation efforts. Other local community members contributed to the logistical management of the mission's tented camp, performing various specialized labour roles.

Although these communities maintain centuries-long connections to the territory, they do not express a specific cultural or historical affinity with the prehistoric burials uncovered there. This sentiment extends to the broader archaeological contexts and local rock art, which are viewed as expressions of ancient, pre-Islamic times, for which no direct cultural link is recognized or claimed.

Despite the lack of a perceived direct connection, ethical considerations and the implications of analysing and handling human remains have been thoroughly discussed with the Department of Antiquities (DoA) in Libya, with substantial input from M.F.M.A.-F. and M.T., both affiliated with the same institution. After the excavation concluded, and in subsequent years, the results were shared in meetings held at the local governorate office in Ghat. Unfortunately, the onset of the Libyan Revolution in 2011, shortly after the excavation activities ended, disrupted further contact. However, over the past year, coinciding with the preparation of this manuscript, online meetings with these co-authors and other DoA representatives have resumed, fostering a renewed dialogue on these issues. These inclusive approaches have ensured that both scientific research and conservation practices are aligned with local values and ethical standards, promoting a collaborative framework for heritage management and scientific collaboration.

Takarkori rock shelter counted 15 burials, varying in phases and preservation states, predominantly from the Early and Middle Pastoral periods, spanning the eighth and the seventh millennium  cal. bp16,22. The burials, found immediately adjacent to the rock wall and with scarce grave goods, appear to only consist of women and children13,22,61 (Supplementary Note 1). Osteological information is reported and discussed elsewhere22, although, in brief, age estimation for subadult individuals was based on methodologies for skeletal development62,63 and dental maturation and eruption64 developed previously. For adult individuals, sex determination was based on the observation of morphological traits of the skull and the pelvis, as synthesized previously65, whereas estimation of age at death was based on the modifications of the pubic symphysis as proposed previously66, cranial sutures closure67 as well as patterns of occlusal dental wear68, which took into account the possible role of the sandy environment. Detailed layouts of the excavation areas, along with the stratigraphic and chronological insights, are depicted in Supplementary Fig 1.4. Standard stratigraphical techniques were used in the excavation of skeletal remains, with strict adherence to precautions for the sampling of biological materials. Sediments associated with the remains underwent sieving using a 2 mm mesh, and samples for laboratory-based studies were collected. The excavation and handling of human remains have been extensively discussed with the Department of Antiquities (DOA) in Tripoli, Libya (formerly the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), particularly concerning ethical issues. Approval for the archaeological excavation was granted on 28 January 2004, under the reference number  (translated as H98-10000 TATM 49463). Currently, the human remains are curated at the Museum of Anthropology of the University of Rome, La Sapienza.

Tooth root from individual TKH001 and fibula fragments from individual TKH009, both previously labelled as TK H1 and TK H9, respectively13, were sourced for this study. The sampling and DNA extraction procedures were carried out in a specialized ancient DNA facility at the University of Florence's Molecular Anthropology department, as outlined previously13. DNA was extracted according to the protocol described previously69. From the extracted DNA, a double-stranded DNA library was prepared in the same Florence facility, without undergoing uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG) treatment. An additional single-stranded DNA library, better at capturing short fragments, was prepared at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology (formerly Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, MPI-SHH) and/or the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (MPI-EVA). The prepared DNA libraries underwent shotgun sequencing to a depth of 3–5 million reads, using 75 bp single-end and/or 50 bp paired-end configurations on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 system at MPI-EVA for initial quality assessment (Supplementary Table 2.1). Both TKH001 and TKH009 libraries underwent in-solution capture targeting over a million SNPs using the Twist Ancient DNA25 and 1240k26 panels, with an additional specialized ‘archaic ancestry' panel applied to the single-stranded library from TKH001. After enrichment, all of the libraries were sequenced to 20 million reads on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 system at MPI-EVA. Read adapters were removed using AdapterRemoval70 v.2.3.0 as part of the EAGER (v.1.92.56)71, and the genome-wide captures were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) using a mapping quality filter of 25 with BWA aligner72 v.7.12. Duplicate reads were eliminated using DeDup (v.0.12.2), which can be found at GitHub (https://github.com/apeltzer/DeDup). The contamination of the single-stranded library from TKH001 was evaluated with AuthentiCT73 v.1.0 and hapCon_ROH (https://haproh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hapROH_with_contamination.html), and Schmutzi74 was used for the mtDNA-captured double-stranded library from TKH009 (Supplementary Table 2.3). The damage pattern was assessed with DamageProfiler75 v.1.1.

Double-stranded 1240k-captured sequences from TKH009 and single-stranded Twist-captured sequences from TKH001 were genotyped using Samtools v.1.3 and pileupCaller from SequenceTools v.1.4.0.2 (https://github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools). TKH001 has a total of 881,765 SNPs on the 1240k panel, and TKH009 libraries showed lower coverage of 22,484 SNPs. We merged the genotype data from TKH009 and TKH001. We then ran all the analyses throughout the manuscript (including PCA, f3 and f4 statistics, qpAdm, admixture graph, DATES and ADMIXTURE), except for admixfrog and hapROH, which, as individual analyses, use only the higher-coverage data from TKH001. To prevent potential artifacts from affecting the results, additional versions of the genotyped data for the TKH001 sample were generated. These included data from only the single-stranded library, data restricted to transversions only and data filtered using PMDtools (v.0.6)76 (Supplementary Table 2.4).

Using smartpca77 v.16000 from EIGENSOFT package v.8.0 with lsqmode enabled, PCAs were conducted on present-day individuals from Africa, Middle East and Southern Europe, genotyped on the Human Origins SNP panel28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38, alongside pertinent ancient groups from these regions2,8,9,35,36,39,40,41,42,43,44. All f3 and f4 statistics were calculated using the ADMIXTOOLS30 package v.5.1, using qp3pop v.435 for f3 statistics and qpDstat v.755 for f4 statistics. For the f3 outgroup test, the topology f3(outgroup; X, Takarkori) was used. When the outgroup was set as South Africa 2000 cal. bp, the ‘inbreed' option was enabled for qp3pop. On the other hand, when the outgroup was chimpanzee, the ‘outgroupmode' option was activated in qp3pop. This particular configuration was used to set a constant denominator of 0.01, as the inbuilt heterozygosity normalization in qp3pop does not function correctly when the outgroup is haploid, as in the case of the Chimpanzee. Furthermore, we used the Affymetrix Human Origins 1 Array, which comprises 13 unique SNP sets, to investigate potential sub-Saharan ancestry in the Takarkori and Taforalt populations. We conducted separate f4 statistics for Mbuti and Yoruba ascertained SNPs (Supplementary Figs. 2.21 and 2.22).

The Taforalt group was modelled as a two-way admixture between the Natufian population (left source) and variable African groups (right source) using qpAdm78 v.810 from ADMIXTOOLS package v.5.1. For every run, a consistent outgroup set was arranged, comprising Onge, Han, Papuan, Ust'-Ishim, Kostenki14, MA-1 and Iran_N. Every African group (Yoruba, Dinka, Mota, Cameroon Shum Laka, Botswana Xaro EIA, and Tanzania Zanzibar 1,300  cal. bp) was examined as a potential right source population in individual runs, while being omitted from the outgroup set (Supplementary Table 2.6). This methodology enabled the exploration of various admixture scenarios for the Taforalt group.

Neanderthal ancestry was inferred using admixfrog48 v.0.7.1 on single-stranded Takarkori and Taforalt libraries captured with the Archaic Admixture SNP panel27. The analysis included high-quality ancient shotgun sequencing data and present-day sub-Saharan genomes from the Allen Ancient Genome Diversity Project/John Templeton Ancient DNA Atlas (https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/ancient-genome-diversity-project) and the Human Genome Diversity Project32. Genomes were subsetted to positions in the Archaic Admixture SNP panel, with filters for mapping quality and base pair length. Libraries with insufficient SNP coverage or contamination were excluded (Supplementary Table 2.8). High-coverage genomes were subsetted to the positions covered by the Takarkori genome for direct comparison. The reference panel included three high-coverage Neanderthals79,80,81, one high-coverage Denisovan33 and the chimpanzee genome (panTro4) as the ancestral allele, along with Sub-Saharan African 1000 Genomes sequences82 for the African state.

The BEAST analysis of mitochondrial genomes involved 216 mtDNA sequences, aligned using MAFFT83 v.7.508 and adjusted by removing specific poly-C regions. The Hohlenstein–Stadel Neanderthal84 was the outgroup, and mtDNA sequences not in GenBank were processed using a specialized pipeline (mitoBench-ancientMT)85. The sequence consensus was determined using snpAD86 v.0.3.9, with haplogroups assigned by HaploGrep287 v.2.1.19. BEAST88 v.2.6.7 used these alignments, incorporating radiocarbon dates from Supplementary Table 2.9 as priors. Model suitability was assessed with bModelTest89 v.1.2.1, determining a combination of TIM(21) + I + G model, strict clock rate and ‘coalescent Bayesian skyline' tree prior as optimal. Eight independent analyses were conducted, combining results using LogCombiner and TreeAnnotator.

The ancestral relationship of the Takarkori population with others was investigated using the ‘find_graphs()' function from ADMIXTOOLS 2, which finds admixture graphs aligning with observed f statistics. Chimpanzee was set as an outgroup, and we included representatives from key relevant genetic clusters: ‘Morocco_Iberomaurusian', ‘Ethiopia_4500BP.SG', ‘Israel_Natufian_published' and ‘Iran_Ganj_Dareh_Neolithic'. Given the potential variability of ‘find_graphs()' outputs, 20 iterations were performed, using unique random graphs for each run. Graphs with a Z score of <|3| were selected (Supplementary Figs. 2.23–2.25). Moreover, Takarkori and Taforalt groups were treated as admixed populations, guided by previous knowledge from admixfrog results.

The DATES method49 v.753 was applied to the Takarkori group to detect Levantine admixture. A bin size of 0.001 and a fit range of 0.0045 to 1 in Morgan units were used. Admixture dates were estimated based on the decay of linkage disequilibrium between SNP pairs, with Levantine admixture modelled using sub-Saharan populations (Yoruba, Mbuti, Dinka, ancient groups from Ethiopia and Tanzania) and Eurasian populations (Natufian, PPNB, Ganj Dareh) (Supplementary Figs. 2.26.1–2.26.3).

The effective population size (Ne) for TKH001 was estimated using hapROH90 v.3.0. ROH segments longer than 4 cM were inferred using hapROH's recommended default settings, using the 1000 Genomes reference panel for comparison (Supplementary Fig. 2.27). This method analyses runs of homozygosity to estimate the population size and genetic background of the individual (Supplementary Fig. 2.28).

ADMIXTURE91 v.1.3.0 was used for unsupervised genetic clustering of global populations. Modern and ancient groups were subsetted from the HO-based dataset, converted to PLINK format, and transposed to pseudohaploid format to reduce artificial drift. Linkage disequilibrium pruning was performed using PLINK92 v.1.9 with a window size of 200 SNPs, a step size of 25 SNPs and an r2 threshold of 0.4. Five replicates for each k (2–9) were run, selecting the replicate with the highest log-likelihood.

Data visualization was performed in RStudio v.2022.12.0 + 353. The following R packages were used cowplot (v.1.1.2), ggplot (v.3.4.2), ggh4x (v.0.2.3), ggnewscale (v.0.4.8), janno (v.1.0.0), magrittr (v.2.0.3), maps (v.3.4.1), patchwork (v.1.1.2), purrr (v.1.0.1), RColorBrewer (v.1.1.3), readxl (v.1.4.1), tidyr (v.1.3.0) and tidyverse (v.1.3.2).

A) with Takarkori individuals projected and highlighted in black squares. B) Geographic locations of Takarkori individuals and relevant present-day populations included in our analysis.

Within the shared drift of Takarkori group, the highest genetic drift is exhibited with Taforalt-related groups, OUB and IAM. The colour scheme for populations in the legend follows that of PCA Fig. 1. The error bars represent three standard errors.

The Taforalt and later Epipaleolithic and Neolithic groups from Morocco are included for comparison due to their highest genetic drift with Takarkori. The Takarkori group shows the second highest affinity with FulaniA after Taforalt-related groups. The colour and shape scheme for populations in the legend follows that of the PCA in Extended Data Fig. 1. The error bars represent three standard errors.

All positive f4 values underscore shared genetic drift between Takarkori and Taforalt that surpasses other potential affinities tested here. The error bars represent three standard errors.

The phylogenetic tree is constructed for the Takarkori samples TKH001 and TKH009, combined with 209 published complete genomes from ancient and modern samples. The major mitochondrial lineages and sub-lineages for the N macrohaplogroup are differentiated by distinct colours.

Takarkori exhibits a notably higher affinity to Taforalt, with an f4 value approximately 3.5 times higher than the next closest African group. The error bars represent three standard errors.

Results of modelling the Taforalt group as a two-way admixture between Natufian and various African populations. Takarkori yielded the best model fit with a P-value > 0.05, indicating the sufficiency of the two-way admixture model for Taforalt. In contrast, the P-values for the other models were all <2.84 × 10−34. The error bars represent the standard error of the ancestry proportion estimates, calculated using 5 cM block jackknifing.

The results suggest a stronger connection between Takarkori and the OoA ancestry compared to sub-Saharan Africans. The error bars represent three standard errors.

A) Detected archaic ancestry fragments in Takarkori and Taforalt inferred by admixfrog. Dark and light blue regions are homozygous and heterozygous Neanderthal fragments, respectively. Grey fragments indicate African ancestry and bar height is proportional to the posterior probability of ancestry. B) The longest archaic fragment in Takarkori is on chromosome 1 compared to the reference panel. The y-axis refers to the frequency of the alternative allele in the reference population (Africans or Neanderthals in this case) at the given position, and the x-axis stands for the SNP positions.

Metrics details

Temporary pacemakers are essential for the care of patients with short-lived bradycardia in post-operative and other settings1,2,3,4. Conventional devices require invasive open-heart surgery or less invasive endovascular surgery, both of which are challenging for paediatric and adult patients5,6,7,8. Other complications9,10,11 include risks of infections, lacerations and perforations of the myocardium, and of displacements of external power supplies and control systems. Here we introduce a millimetre-scale bioresorbable optoelectronic system with an onboard power supply and a wireless, optical control mechanism with generalized capabilities in electrotherapy and specific application opportunities in temporary cardiac pacing. The extremely small sizes of these devices enable minimally invasive implantation, including percutaneous injection and endovascular delivery. Experimental studies demonstrate effective pacing in mouse, rat, porcine, canine and human cardiac models at both single-site and multi-site locations. Pairing with a skin-interfaced wireless device allows autonomous, closed-loop operation upon detection of arrhythmias. Further work illustrates opportunities in combining these miniaturized devices with other medical implants, with an example of arrays of pacemakers for individual or collective use on the frames of transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems, to provide unique solutions that address risks for atrioventricular block following surgeries. This base technology can be readily adapted for a broad range of additional applications in electrotherapy, such as nerve and bone regeneration, wound therapy and pain management.

Deaths due to Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia, have roughly doubled in the past 30 years and are expected to increase with an ageing population1. Despite the enormous health and economic impacts of Alzheimer's disease, effective treatments and preventative measures are lacking, partly because there has been a failure to definitively understand what causes the condition2. Emerging evidence suggests that viruses in the herpes family that target and affect the nervous system might be involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease3, raising the possibility that vaccines against these viruses could prevent or delay dementia4.

Metrics details

Quantum communications technologies require a network of quantum processors connected with low-loss and low-noise communication channels capable of distributing entangled states. Superconducting microwave qubits operating in cryogenic environments have emerged as promising candidates for quantum processor nodes. However, scaling these systems is challenging because they require bulky microwave components with high thermal loads that can quickly overwhelm the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator. Telecommunication frequency optical signals, however, can be fabricated in significantly smaller form factors to avoid challenges caused by high signal loss, noise sensitivity and thermal loads due to their high carrier frequency and propagation in silica optical fibres. Transduction of information by means of coherent links between optical and microwave frequencies is therefore critical to leverage the advantages of optics for superconducting microwave qubits, while also enabling superconducting processors to be linked with low-loss optical interconnects. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical control of a superconducting qubit. We achieve this by developing a microwave–optical quantum transducer that operates with up to 1.18% conversion efficiency with low added microwave noise, and we demonstrate optically driven Rabi oscillations in a superconducting qubit.

Metrics details

Animals learn the value of foods on the basis of their postingestive effects and thereby develop aversions to foods that are toxic1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 and preferences to those that are nutritious11,12,13. However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavours experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay. Here we reveal an unexpected role for the postingestive reactivation of neural flavour representations in this temporal credit-assignment process. To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel14,15, but not familiar, flavours with delayed gastrointestinal malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavours that support aversive postingestive learning. Analyses of brain-wide activation patterns reveal that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavours across every stage of learning (consumption, delayed malaise and memory retrieval). By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of malaise-coding hindbrain neurons, we show that delayed malaise signals selectively reactivate flavour representations in the amygdala from a recent meal. The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts the strengthening of flavour responses upon memory retrieval, which in turn leads to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavour. By contrast, flavour representations in the amygdala degrade in the absence of unexpected postingestive consequences. Thus, we demonstrate that postingestive reactivation and plasticity of neural flavour representations may support learning from delayed feedback.

Postingestive feedback signals arise from the gut as food is digested and absorbed, and animals are able to associate this delayed feedback with flavours experienced during a meal minutes or hours earlier1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. This learning process is essential for survival—nutritious foods are valuable, whereas poisonous foods can be deadly—but it remains unknown how the brain is able to associate a stimulus (flavour) with a delayed reinforcement signal (postingestive feedback from the gut) that can arrive much later.

Conditioned flavour aversion (CFA) provides a classic example of this credit-assignment problem. Humans8,9,10, rodents1,2,3,4,5 and other animals6,7 develop CFAs when they experience symptoms of food poisoning (such as gastrointestinal malaise, nausea or diarrhoea), which produces a long-lasting aversion to the potentially poisonous food. Animals can develop a CFA to novel foods after a single pairing (that is, one-shot learning) even with meal-to-malaise delays of several hours16,17,18.

Previous work on CFA has focused on two primary anatomical pathways. The first begins in the mouth and sends taste signals to the gustatory insular cortex19,20, which in turn transmits these signals to the basolateral amygdala (BLA)21,22. The second begins in the gut and sends malaise signals to a genetically defined population of glutamatergic neurons in the hindbrain parabrachial nucleus (PB) called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons23,24. These malaise-coding CGRP neurons then project to the central amygdala (CEA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST). However, it remains unclear where and how temporally separated flavour and malaise signals ultimately converge in the brain to support learning.

To gain insight into this long-standing question, we leveraged the fact that novel flavours support CFA after a single pairing with malaise, whereas familiar flavours that are already known to be safe do not14,15. Mice consumed a palatable flavour (sweetened grape Kool-Aid) that was either novel (no previous exposure before conditioning) or familiar (four daily pre-exposures before conditioning). Thirty minutes after consumption, the mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of lithium chloride (LiCl) to induce gastrointestinal malaise and related food-poisoning symptoms18,25. We then assessed learning 2 days later with a two-bottle memory-retrieval test (Fig. 1a). We used a flavour (combination of taste and odour), rather than a pure taste stimulus, in our study for ethological validity because animals rarely encounter a taste alone, and use both taste and odour to avoid foods that have made them ill26,27. Consistent with previous work14,15, mice for which the malaise-paired flavour was novel developed a strong and stable aversion, whereas mice for which the same flavour was familiar continued to prefer it to water even after the pairing with malaise (Fig. 1b).

Using this experimental paradigm, we compared cellular-resolution brain-wide activation levels in response to the same flavour when it was novel versus familiar to determine where novel flavours that support learning are represented and where this representation converges with postingestive malaise signals. After each stage of CFA learning (consumption, malaise and retrieval), brain samples from experimental mice were cleared using the iDISCO+ method28 and the samples were then immunolabelled for the immediate-early gene product FOS as a proxy for neural activation. High-resolution and high-signal-to-noise whole-brain light-sheet microscopy imaging volumes were subsequently acquired. We used an automated deep-learning-assisted cell-detection pipeline (258,555 ± 14,421 (mean ± s.e.m.) FOS+ neurons per animal across the experiments in Figs. 1 and 2 ; see Methods for details) and registered the location of each FOS+ neuron to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework29 (CCF) for downstream analyses (Fig. 1c).

Source data

We initially investigated the first stage of the CFA paradigm: consumption of flavoured water. We observed marked differences in the brain-wide activation patterns of mice that consumed a novel versus familiar flavour, even though each group had precisely the same sensory experience during FOS induction (Extended Data Fig. 1a–d and Supplementary Table 1; interactive visualization at https://www.brainsharer.org/ng/?id=872, left column). Novel flavours that support learning preferentially activated a set of sensory and amygdala structures (for example, the CEA, the BLA, the insular cortex and the piriform cortex; Extended Data Fig. 1a). These observations are consistent with previous anatomically targeted studies of immediate-early gene expression30,31 and with loss-of-function experiments19,20,21,22 that demonstrated a causal role for many of these regions in CFA. By contrast, a familiar flavour that animals had previously learned was safe primarily engaged a network of limbic regions (for example, the lateral septum (LS), the ventral hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens; Extended Data Fig. 1b). Unlike the novel-flavour-activated regions, most of these regions had not previously been implicated in CFA. The LS showed the strongest familiar-flavour-dependent activation, and chemogenetic activation of this region during consumption was sufficient to block CFA learning (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) and amygdala activation by a novel flavour (Extended Data Fig. 2c–g). Together, these results validate the potential of our brain-wide FOS imaging approach to identify new regions that contribute to CFA.

We next investigated how the brain-wide activation patterns induced by a novel versus familiar flavour change during postingestive malaise and, days later, memory retrieval (interactive visualization at https://www.brainsharer.org/ng/?id=872, middle and right columns). We reasoned that preferential novel-flavour activation at these time points, respectively, may reveal where flavour and malaise signals initially converge to support CFA learning and where the CFA memory is stored and recalled. To accurately estimate the contribution of flavour novelty and experimental time point to neural activation in each brain region, we applied a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) that accounts for variation associated with different technical batches and with the sex of the mice (Fig. 1d, Methods and Supplementary Table 1).

Although novel and familiar flavours preferentially activated an equal fraction of brain regions during consumption (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b), postingestive malaise triggered a brain-wide shift towards activation by the novel flavour (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). This shift towards representing the novel flavour was still present when the memory was retrieved days later (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3a–c).

To investigate which brain regions contributed to this effect, we performed hierarchical clustering on weights from the GLMM of novel-flavour versus familiar-flavour activation across experimental time points (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 3d–n). This analysis uncovered a network of amygdala regions (cluster 1) that was preferentially activated by the novel flavour at every stage of learning (Fig. 1g,h and see Extended Data Fig. 4a–d for correlation analyses within and across clusters), most notably in the CEA (Fig. 1i).

This discovery is notable for two reasons. First, the fact that the representation of a novel flavour formed during the initial consumption stage is still present 30 min later during postingestive malaise implies that this network is a site for the convergence of flavour and malaise signals. Second, the observation that this novel-flavour representation is still present upon memory retrieval suggests that the same network is also a site of storage and recall.

The idea that the amygdala could be a crucial node for the convergence of flavour representations and malaise signals is further supported by classic work establishing the amygdala as a site of associative learning32,33. Further pointing to the amygdala as a site of convergence, parabrachial CGRP neurons in the brainstem are reported to convey visceral malaise signals to the CEA23,24,34 (Fig. 2a). Indeed, we found that LiCl injection activated CGRP neurons in vivo34 (Fig. 2b). CGRP neurons formed dense monosynaptic connections in the CEA34 (Fig. 2c; latency: 5.9 ± 0.3 ms (mean ± s.e.m.)), and stimulation of CGRP neurons activated neurons throughout the amygdala in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 5a–f).

Optogenetic stimulation of CGRP neurons also recapitulated the effects of LiCl-induced malaise in mediating novel-flavour-dependent delayed CFA. Specifically, stimulation of CGRP neuron cell bodies that began 30 min after flavour consumption was sufficient to replace LiCl injection and condition an aversion to a novel but not familiar flavour (Fig. 2d). Similarly, stimulation of CGRP neuron→CEA (CGRPCEA) axon terminals 30 min after consumption of a novel flavour was also sufficient to condition a strong CFA (Fig. 2e). CGRPCEA projection inhibition during delayed LiCl-induced malaise significantly interfered with CFA acquisition (Fig. 2f), but did not fully block it. This result is consistent with previous work showing that other CGRP neuron projections, for example to the BST24, also contribute to CFA.

Given the similarities between LiCl-induced malaise and CGRP neuron stimulation, we sought to determine whether postingestive stimulation of these cells could recapitulate the effects of LiCl-induced malaise on neural activation in the amygdala and across the brain (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Postingestive CGRP neuron stimulation produced highly similar levels of overall neural activation (FOS+ cell counts in individual brain regions) across the entire brain compared to LiCl-induced malaise (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 6c,e). Also similar to LiCl-induced malaise, CGRP neuron stimulation induced stronger activation of the amygdala network when preceded by consumption of a novel rather than familiar flavour (Fig. 2j,k and Extended Data Fig. 6d,f). This effect was particularly prominent in the CEA (Fig. 2h) and was not observed in brain regions outside the amygdala network (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 6d,f).

We next asked whether the stronger effect of CGRP neuron stimulation on amygdala activation after consumption of a novel versus familiar flavour could be explained by recruitment of a specific CEA cell type. To address this question, we performed multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the CEA in a separate group of mice that consumed either a novel or familiar flavour followed by delayed CGRPCEA projection stimulation. We then examined co-expression of Fos mRNA with markers for several known CEA cell types35,36 (Sst, Prkcd and Calcrl; Fig. 2l). Most cells that expressed Fos also expressed Prkcd or Calcrl, and this did not depend on whether the mice had consumed a novel or familiar flavour before CGRPCEA projection stimulation (Fig. 2m,n and Extended Data Fig. 6g,h).

Taken together, these experiments show that postingestive CGRP neuron activity is necessary and sufficient to mediate delayed CFA learning and the effects of malaise on novel-flavour-dependent, amygdala-specific neural activation. This novelty-dependent activation does not seem to be instantiated by a specific CEA cell type. Instead, novel (versus familiar) flavour consumption leads to a greater number of Prkcd+ and Calcrl+ CEA neurons being activated by subsequent CGRP neuron activity.

Our brain-wide FOS measurements and CGRP neuron manipulations point to the amygdala as a unique site for the convergence of flavour representations and delayed malaise signals. However, these experiments do not resolve how these temporally separated signals are integrated at the single-cell level. One possibility is that individual novel-flavour-coding neurons may be persistently activated long after a meal in a manner that provides passive overlap with delayed CGRP neuron malaise signals (hypothesis 1 in Fig. 3a). Alternatively, CGRP neuron inputs may specifically reactivate novel-flavour-coding neurons (hypothesis 2 in Fig. 3a). Another possibility is that CGRP neuron inputs may activate a separate population of amygdala neurons that subsequently become incorporated into the novel-flavour representation during memory consolidation (hypothesis 3 in Fig. 3a). Testing these hypotheses requires tracking the activity of the same neurons across the stages of learning.

Therefore, to distinguish these possibilities, we performed high-density recordings of individual neurons in the CEA—the core node in the amygdala network from our brain-wide FOS imaging dataset (Figs. 1 and 2)—during consumption, subsequent malaise and memory retrieval (Fig. 3b). Recordings were performed with chronically implanted four-shank Neuropixels 2.0 probes37 (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Reconstruction of individual shank trajectories confirmed that we were able to precisely target the CEA (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 7b,c; 138 ± 30 (mean ± s.e.m.) CEA neurons per animal in Fig. 3b–l). We initially trained mice to consume water at an equal rate from two port locations (Extended Data Fig. 8a and see Methods for details). On the conditioning day, we replaced one port with a novel flavour, whereas water remained in the other as an internal control. Immediately after the consumption period ended, mice were transferred to a distinct second context in which they would experience postingestive malaise. This step was performed to ensure that any neural correlates of flavour consumption that we might subsequently observe were not due to features of the original context in which consumption occurred. After a 30-min delay period in this second context, we induced postingestive malaise using one of the following methods across three groups of mice: (1) optogenetic stimulation of CGRP neuron cell bodies (Fig. 3b–l); (2) optogenetic stimulation of CGRPCEA projections (Extended Data Fig. 9a–e); or (3) injection of LiCl (Fig. 3m–r). Similar results were observed across all three groups of mice; therefore we begin by describing data from the first group.

During consumption, 34% of CEA neurons were significantly activated by the novel flavour compared with only 11% for water (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 8b) and, in a separate experiment described below, 17% for a familiar flavour. These observations are consistent with our FOS imaging data at the consumption time point (Fig. 1h,i). Almost all CEA neurons, including novel-flavour-coding neurons, were significantly less active after consumption ended (Fig. 3d,e), which suggests that persistent activation (hypothesis 1 in Fig. 3a) is not the mechanism that the amygdala uses to associate flavours with delayed malaise signals.

We next investigated how delayed CGRP neuron stimulation affects CEA neuron activity. CGRP neuron stimulation potently and selectively reactivated novel-flavour-coding CEA neurons, with only limited effects on water-coding and nonselective neurons (Fig. 3d,e; consistent only with hypothesis 2 in Fig. 3a). This reactivation was precisely time locked to individual bouts of CGRP neuron stimulation (Fig. 3f), which suggests that it is directly driven by the release of glutamate from CGRP neuron inputs34 (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 5c) rather than by a slow change in affective or physiological internal state. Similar to CGRP neuron cell-body stimulation, delayed CGRPCEA projection stimulation strongly reactivated novel-flavour-coding CEA neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9a–d).

Reactivation of novel-flavour-coding neurons was similarly present in a separate group of mice that experienced delayed LiCl-induced malaise rather than CGRP neuron stimulation (Fig. 3m,n). Moreover, genetic ablation of CGRP neurons abolished the preferential reactivation of novel-flavour-coding neurons by delayed malaise (Fig. 3p,q) and impaired learning (Extended Data Fig. 9f,g). This finding indicates that the effects of postingestive malaise on CFA—and on CEA dynamics—are mediated by CGRP neurons.

Together, these observations suggest that CEA neurons that encode a recently consumed flavour are selectively reactivated by delayed malaise signals through CGRP neuron inputs, thereby providing a potential mechanism for temporal credit assignment during CFA learning (hypothesis 2 in Fig. 3a).

Population-level analyses corroborated the conclusion that CGRP neuron activity after consumption preferentially reactivates the neural representation of the recently consumed flavour. First, we trained a multinomial logistic regression decoder using population activity during the consumption period to discriminate novel flavour or water consumption from baseline activity (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 8c,d). Cross-validated decoding accuracy was nearly perfect (Extended Data Fig. 8e). We then evaluated this decoder using population activity during the delay and CGRP neuron-stimulation periods and investigated the probability of decoding the novel flavour or water representation on a moment-by-moment basis (decoder output, P(novel flavour|population activity)). This decoding analysis showed that individual bouts of CGRP neuron stimulation reliably reactivated population-level flavour representations (Fig. 3g–i). By contrast, water representations were rarely reactivated by CGRP neuron stimulation (Fig. 3g–i). Consistent with the results from CGRP neuron cell-body stimulation, LiCl-induced malaise also strongly reactivated population-level flavour representations in the CEA (Fig. 3o) and this required functional CGRP neurons (Fig. 3r).

We next compared population-activity trajectories during consumption and during CGRP neuron stimulation by performing principal component analysis (PCA) on the pooled (across mice) trial-averaged population activity during novel-flavour and water consumption. Neural activity during consumption was low-dimensional, with the first two principal components (PCs) explaining >70% of variance in trial-averaged population activity (Fig. 3j). Plotting neural trajectories during novel-flavour and water consumption on the PC1–PC2 axis revealed that PC2 perfectly discriminated these two flavours (Fig. 3k). Using these PCA loadings to project population activity during CGRP neuron stimulation onto the same PC1–PC2 axis showed that this experience closely mirrored the neural trajectory of novel-flavour consumption (Fig. 3k). This strong effect was also apparent in the population activity of individual mice (Fig. 3l) and in the population activity of mice that received delayed CGRPCEA projection stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 9e). Thus, population-level analyses confirmed that CGRP neuron activity specifically reactivates flavour representations in the CEA during delayed postingestive malaise (hypothesis 2 in Fig. 3a).

Tracking neural activity across flavour consumption and malaise revealed that malaise signals preferentially reactivate flavour representations in the amygdala (Fig. 3), thereby providing a potential mechanism for the brain to link flavours experienced during a meal with delayed postingestive feedback. If this mechanism contributes to learning, then postingestive CGRP neuron activity would be expected to trigger functional plasticity in flavour representations in the amygdala that could underlie the CFA memory. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether postingestive reactivation of novel-flavour-coding CEA neurons is predictive of stronger flavour responses when the CFA memory is retrieved. To accomplish this task, we took advantage of the high stability of our chronic recordings to track the same CEA neurons across days and analysed their responses to flavour consumption before (conditioning day) and after (retrieval day) pairing with CGRP neuron stimulation (Fig. 4a,b and see Methods for details).

The trial-averaged response of novel-flavour-coding CEA neurons (classified on the conditioning day) was largely stable across days (Fig. 4c). However, sorting these neurons on the basis of the magnitude of their response to CGRP neuron stimulation revealed a notable effect. Specifically, novel-flavour-coding CEA neurons with the greatest CGRP neuron input responded more strongly to the flavour during memory retrieval, whereas the responses of novel-flavour-coding neurons with weak or no CGRP neuron input remained relatively unchanged (Fig. 4c,d). By contrast, we did not observe a similar correlation for water-coding or nonselective CEA neurons (Fig. 4d), which further suggests that postingestive malaise does not recruit additional neurons into the initial flavour representation (as in hypothesis 3 in Fig. 3a). Together, these observations indicate that CGRP neurons induce functional plasticity that stabilizes the response of the amygdala to the conditioned flavour after learning. Consistent with this conclusion, the population-level flavour representation, as visualized using PCA, was highly stable across conditioning and retrieval days (Extended Data Fig. 10b,l).

CGRPCEA projection stimulation (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 10c–e) and LiCl-induced malaise (Extended Data Fig. 10f) had similar stabilizing effects on novel-flavour-coding neuron responses during memory retrieval compared to CGRP neuron cell-body stimulation. By contrast, the responses of novel-flavour-coding neurons significantly decreased during memory retrieval in mice lacking CGRP neurons (Extended Data Fig. 10g). Thus, CGRP neuron activity is necessary and sufficient for both the reactivation and stabilization of flavour representations in the amygdala by delayed malaise signals.

For comparison, we next asked how amygdala activity evolves after familiarization (that is, experience with a flavour without any aversive postingestive consequences, as in the ‘Familiar' condition in Figs. 1 and 2). Consistent with our initial FOS imaging data comparing activation patterns between novel and familiar flavours (Fig. 1h,i), tracking CEA neuron activity before and after familiarization revealed that the proportion of flavour-coding neurons significantly decreased after familiarization (Extended Data Fig. 10h,i). Similarly, the trial-averaged response of individual flavour-coding neurons (classified on the novel-flavour day) significantly decreased after familiarization (Fig. 4f). This result was in contrast to the stability we observed following conditioning with CGRP neuron stimulation (Fig. 4c, left) and LiCl-induced malaise (Extended Data Fig. 10f). Furthermore, initially water-preferring neurons increased their response to the flavour after it became familiar (Extended Data Fig. 10j). Together, these observations suggest that familiarization degrades flavour representations in the amygdala such that the representation of a flavour moves closer to the representation of pure water. Consistent with this conclusion, the modulation of population-level activity along the PC2 dimension that discriminates flavour from water was almost completely abolished following familiarization (Extended Data Fig. 10k,l).

Thus, CGRP neurons convey malaise signals that preferentially reactivate flavour representations in the amygdala, which may enable the brain to bridge the delay between a meal and postingestive feedback during CFA learning. Moreover, these postingestive signals induce plasticity to stabilize or strengthen flavour representations after conditioning, whereas flavour representations rapidly degrade in the absence of malaise signals as flavours become familiar and safe (Fig. 4g).

So far, we have focused on the role of neural activity in supporting CFA. Previous work in the field has taken a complementary approach to examine the role of biochemical signals38,39. For example, many studies have shown an important role in the amygdala for cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)40,41,42, a transcription factor that regulates neural excitability, and protein kinase A (PKA)43,44, which phosphorylates and activates CREB. CREB activity levels at the time of conditioning are thought to bias neurons towards allocation to the CFA ‘memory engram'45,46: the ensemble of cells that are activated during retrieval of the CFA memory (Fig. 5a).

We therefore investigated how the PKA→CREB pathway might relate to the malaise-driven reactivation and stabilization of flavour representations that we describe here. One possibility is that this biochemical pathway could be preferentially triggered in the amygdala by novel-flavour consumption, which may in turn contribute to increased excitability or responsiveness of novel-flavour-coding neurons to CGRP neuron inputs during malaise.

To test the first part of this hypothesis—that the PKA→CREB pathway is preferentially activated by novel flavours—we recorded in vivo PKA activity in the CEA through fibre photometry measurements of the AKAR2 sensor47 (Fig. 5b,c). These recordings showed that novel flavours drive a strong increase in PKA activity in the CEA, whereas familiar flavours have little impact on PKA activity (Fig. 5d–g). This increase in PKA activity (tens of seconds) was substantially longer in duration than the increase in spiking for each bout of consumption (Fig. 3d). Downstream effects on CREB, gene expression and neural excitability are presumably far longer-lasting. Thus, novelty-dependent gating of PKA could serve as a biochemical eligibility trace that increases the responsiveness of novel-flavour-coding neurons to delayed malaise signals, thereby permitting the selective reactivation and plasticity of novel-flavour representations in the amygdala (Fig. 5h).

The major reason that learning is challenging is because of delays between a stimulus or action and its outcome. This raises the question of how the brain assigns credit to the correct previous event. Most work on credit assignment has been limited to examining learning in the case of relatively short delays (on the order of seconds)48,49,50,51. Postingestive learning paradigms, such as CFA, provide an opportunity to study how the brain assigns credit across much longer delays.

Here we described a neural mechanism that may contribute to solving the credit-assignment problem inherent to CFA. That is, postingestive malaise signals selectively reactivate the neural representations of flavours experienced during a recent meal, and this reactivation serves to stabilize or strengthen the flavour representation upon memory retrieval.

Although previous work, mostly in the hippocampus and cortex, has suggested a role for neural reactivations in learning and memory52,53, our study advances this idea in multiple important ways. First, we applied this concept to a new paradigm: postingestive learning and CFA. Second, we discovered a role for the outcome signal (unconditioned stimulus) in directly triggering reactivations and demonstrated that a cell-type-specific malaise pathway mediates this effect. Third, we discovered a relationship between outcome-driven flavour reactivations and strengthened flavour representations during memory retrieval.

Our entry point into this problem was the fact that novel flavours more easily support postingestive learning than familiar flavours14,15. By comparing brain-wide neural-activation patterns in animals that consumed the same flavour when it was novel versus familiar, we identified an amygdala network that was unique in preferentially responding to novel flavours across every stage of learning. Although we focused here on how novel flavours become associated with aversive postingestive feedback in this amygdala network, it is possible that these same ideas generalize to the processes of familiarization or postingestive nutrient learning. Specifically, a parallel and mechanistically similar process may be at work when learning that a food is safe or nutritious. In that case, safety (or reward11,12,13) signals may reactivate recently consumed flavour representations, in contrast to the aversive CGRP neuron-mediated reactivations we report here. This may enable the weakening of flavour representations in the amygdala (Fig. 4f) and/or the strengthening of flavour representations in the LS and other limbic regions (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

The degree of specificity of malaise-driven reactivations for a recently consumed novel flavour (versus other flavours), and what mechanisms may contribute to such specificity, remain open questions. One possibility is that preferential activation of the PKA→CREB pathway by consumption of a particular novel flavour (Fig. 5) may provide a biochemical eligibility trace to facilitate the selective reactivation and strengthening of the neural representation of that flavour (versus other flavours) by delayed outcome signals.

Previous recording experiments during CFA have concentrated on the role of the gustatory insular cortex54,55,56,57,58,59. A consistent finding is that CFA amplifies the cortical representation of the conditioned tastant and shifts it to be more similar to innately aversive tastants. Recent work has further shown that homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the insula contributes to a transition, over the course of hours or days, from the initial formation of a more generalized taste aversion to a tastant-specific CFA memory60. How the malaise-driven reactivation of flavour representations in the amygdala we report here relates to such mechanisms in the insula requires further study. One possibility is that the reactivation of flavour representations by delayed malaise signals contributes to the formation of an initial memory, which is then further refined through homeostatic mechanisms in the insula and its reciprocal connections with the amygdala.

Overall, our results reveal how dedicated novelty-detection circuitry and built-in priors (preferential reactivation of recent flavour representations by postingestive malaise) work together to enable the brain to correctly link stimuli and outcomes despite long delays.

All experimental procedures were approved by the Princeton University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee following the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Wild-type mice (JAX 000664) and Calcacre mice34 (JAX 033168) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. Adult mice (>8 weeks old) of both sexes were used for all experiments. Mice were housed under a 12-h light–dark cycle, and experiments were conducted during the dark cycle. Ambient temperature was maintained at 21–26 °C and humidity at 30–70%. Stereotaxic surgeries were performed under isoflurane anaesthesia (3–4% for induction, 0.75–1.5% for maintenance). Mice received pre-operative antibiotics (5 mg kg–1 Baytril subcutaneous (s.c.)) and pre-operative and post-operative analgesia (10 mg kg–1 Ketofen s.c.; 3 daily injections). Post-operative health (evidence of pain, incision healing, activity and posture) was monitored for at least 5 days. For all CFA experiments, mice were water-restricted and maintained at >80% body weight for the duration of the experiment.

For CGRP neuron cell-body stimulation experiments (Figs. 2–4), we bilaterally injected 400 nl of AAV5-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP (titre, 1.2 × 1013 genome copies (GC) per ml; manufacturer, Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI) Viral Core Facility)61,62 at –5.00 mm anterior–posterior (AP), ±1.40 mm medial–lateral (ML) and –3.50 mm dorsal–ventral (DV) into Calcacre mice. We used these stereotaxic coordinates to target the PB in all subsequent experiments. For CGRP neuron fibre photometry experiments (Fig. 2b), we unilaterally injected 400 nl of AAV9-hSyn-FLEX-GCaMP6s (titre, 1.0 × 1013 GC per ml; manufacturer, PNI Viral Core Facility)63 into the PB of Calcacre mice. For CGRPCEA projection stimulation experiments (Figs. 2 and 4 and Extended Data Fig. 9), we bilaterally injected 350 nl of AAV5-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP (titre, 1.2 × 13 GC per ml; manufacturer, PNI Viral Core Facility; RNAscope FISH experiment)61,62, AAV5-EF1a-DIO-ChRmine-mScarlet (titre, 9.0 × 1012 GC per ml; manufacturer, PNI Viral Core Facility; all other experiments)64 or AAV5-EF1a-DIO-eYFP (titre, 1.5 × 1013 GC per ml; manufacturer, PNI Viral Core Facility) into the PB of Calcacre mice. For CGRPCEA projection inhibition experiments (Fig. 2f), we bilaterally injected 350 nl of AAV5-hSyn-SIO-eOPN3-mScarlet (titre, 9.0 × 1012 GC per ml; manufacturer, Addgene)65 or AAV5-EF1a-DIO-eYFP (titre, 1.5 × 1013 GC per ml; manufacturer, PNI Viral Core Facility) into the PB of Calcacre mice. For CGRP neuron ablation experiments (Fig. 3p–r and Extended Data Fig. 9g,h), we bilaterally injected 350 nl of AAV5-EF1a-FLEX-taCasp3-TEVp (titre, 1.6 × 1013 GC per ml; manufacturer, Addgene)66 into the PB of Calcacre mice. For control LiCl conditioning and Neuropixels implantation experiments (Fig. 3n,o), we bilaterally injected 350 nl of AAV5-Camk2a-eYFP (titre, 7.5 × 1011 GC per ml; manufacturer, University of North Carolina (UNC) Vector Core) into the PB of wild-type mice. For CEA PKA recording experiments (Fig. 5), we unilaterally injected 300 nl of AAV5-hSyn-ExRai-AKAR2 (titre, 2.4 × 1013 GC per ml; manufacturer, PNI Viral Core Facility)47 at –1.15 mm AP, –2.65 mm ML and –4.85 mm DV into wild-type mice. For LS activation experiments (Extended Data Fig. 2), we bilaterally injected AAV5-hSyn-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry (titre, 3.8 × 1012 GC per ml; manufacturer, Addgene)67 or AAV5-Camk2a-eYFP (titre, 7.5 × 1011 GC per ml; manufacturer, UNC Vector Core) at one (500 nl at +0.55 mm AP, ±0.35 mm ML and –4.00 mm DV) or two (150 nl each at +0.85 mm or +0.25 mm AP, ±0.60 mm ML and –3.75 mm DV) coordinates into wild-type mice. Virus was infused at 100 nl min–1. Coordinates are given relative to bregma. We allowed 3 weeks for AKAR2 and GCaMP expression, at least 4 weeks for ChR2 and hM3D expression, 5 weeks for CGRP neuron ablation by taCasp3-TEVp and 8 weeks for CGRPCEA terminal expression of ChRmine, ChR2 and eOPN3.

Optical fibres encased in stainless-steel ferrules were implanted into the brain for optogenetic and fibre photometry experiments. For bilateral optogenetic stimulation of CGRP neurons (Fig. 2), we implanted 300 µm core diameter, 0.39 NA fibres (Thorlabs, FT300EMT) above the PB at a 10° angle, with the fibre tips terminating 300–400 µm above the viral injection coordinate. For unilateral stimulation of CGRP neurons (Figs. 3 and 4), we implanted a 300 µm core diameter, 0.39 NA fibre above the left PB at a 25–30° angle, with the fibre tip terminating 300–400 µm above the viral injection coordinate. For bilateral optogenetic manipulation of CGRPCEA projections (Fig. 2), we implanted 300 µm core diameter, 0.39 NA fibres above the CEA, with the fibre tips terminating at –1.15 mm AP, ±2.85 mm ML and –4.25 mm DV. For unilateral optogenetic stimulation of CGRPCEA projections (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10), we implanted a 300 µm core diameter, 0.37 NA fibre (Doric, MFC_300/360-0.37_10mm_MF2.5_FLT) above the left CEA at a +55° angle, with the fibre tip terminating at –1.20 mm AP, +2.25 mm ML and –3.55 mm DV. For fibre photometry recording of CGRP neurons (Fig. 2b), we implanted a 400 µm core diameter, 0.48 NA fibre (Doric, MFC_400/430-0.48_5.0mm_MF2.5_FLT) above the left PB at a –10° to –30° angle, with the fibre tip terminating approximately at the viral injection coordinate. For fibre photometry recording of CEA PKA activity (Fig. 5), we implanted a 400 µm core diameter, 0.48 NA fibre (Doric, MFC_400/430-0.48_6.0mm_MF2.5_FLT) above the left CEA, with the fibre tip terminating approximately at the viral injection coordinate. Optical fibres were affixed to the skull with Metabond (Parkell, S380), which was then covered in acrylic dental cement.

We used four-shank Neuropixels 2.0 probes37 (test-phase; Imec), as they were miniaturized to make them more suitable for chronic implantation in mice. To avoid directly cementing the probes to the skull (that is, so that the probes could be reused), we designed a chronic implant assembly (Extended Data Fig. 7a) based on the design for Neuropixels 1.0 probes previously validated in rats68. Similar to that design, the assembly was printed on Formlabs SLA 3D printers and consisted of four discrete parts: (1) a dovetail adapter permanently glued to the probe base; (2) an internal holder that mated with the dovetail adapter and facilitated stereotaxic manipulation of the probe; and (3–4) an external chassis, printed in two separated parts, that encased and protected the entire assembly. The external chassis and internal holder were attached using screws that could be removed at the end of the experiment to enable explantation and reuse. The external chassis of the final implant assembly was coated with Metabond before implantation. After explantation, probes were cleaned with consecutive overnight washes in enzyme-active detergent (Alconox Tergazyme) and silicone cleaning solvent (Dowsil, DS-2025) before reuse. The dimensions of the Neuropixels 2.0 implant assembly were significantly smaller than the Neuropixels 1.0 implant assembly68, primarily because of the smaller size of the probe and headstage. The maximum dimensions were 24.7 mm (height), 12.2 mm (width) and 11.2 mm (depth), with a weight of 1.5 g (not including the headstage). Space was made for the headstage to be permanently housed in the implant, as opposed to the previous design in which the headstage was connected only during recording and was secured to a tether attached to the animal. This made connecting the animal to the assembly for a recording significantly easier and obviated the need for a bulky tether that limits the movements of the animal. This change was made possible owing to improvements in Neuropixels cable design, which required fewer cables per probe and less reinforcement of the cables during free movement. Design files and instructions for printing and assembling the chronic Neuropixels 2.0 implant are available from GitHub (https://github.com/agbondy/neuropixels_2.0_implant_assembly).

Surgery was performed 3–4 weeks after AAV injection to allow time for viral expression and behavioural training. First, three craniotomies were drilled: one small craniotomy (500 µm diameter) above the left PB (approached at a –10° to –30° angle) or the left CEA (approached at a +55° angle) for the optical fibre, another small craniotomy above the cerebellum for the ground wire, and one large craniotomy (1 × 2 mm) above the left CEA for the Neuropixels probe. Next, a single optical fibre was placed above the left PB or left CEA as described above. At this point, the optical fibre was affixed to the skull with Metabond and the exposed skull was covered with Metabond. Next, a prefabricated chronic Neuropixels assembly was lowered at 2.5 µm s–1 into the CEA using an ultraprecise micromanipulator (Sensapex µMp). The probe shanks were aligned with the AP axis of the skull, with the most anterior shank tip terminating at –0.95 mm AP, –2.95 mm ML and –6.50 mm DV. Once the probe was fully lowered, the stainless-steel ground wire was inserted 1–2 mm into the cerebellum and affixed with Metabond. The CEA craniotomy and probe shanks were then covered with medical-grade petroleum jelly, and Dentin (Parkell, S301) was used to affix the chronic Neuropixels assembly to the Metabond on the skull. The optical fibres and CEA Neuropixels probe were both placed in the left hemisphere because CGRP neuron projections are primarily ipsilateral24.

As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, we used a one-reward CFA paradigm that used either a novel or familiar flavour. Experiments were performed in operant boxes (Med Associates) using MedPC software (https://med-associates.com/product/med-pc; v.IV). Operant boxes were situated in sound-attenuating chambers and equipped with a single nosepoke port and light. The nosepoke port contained a reward-delivery tube that was calibrated to deliver 20 µl of reward through a solenoid valve (Lee Technologies, LHDA2433315H). Every behavioural session (training and conditioning) had the following basic structure. First, the mouse was allowed to acclimate to the chamber for 5 min. Then, the consumption period began and the port light turned on to indicate that rewards were available. During this period, each nosepoke, detected by an infrared beam break with a 1 s time-out period, triggered the delivery of a single reward, and the period ended when 1.2 ml of reward was consumed or 10 min had passed. Then, the delay period began and lasted until 30 min after the beginning of the consumption period. During training sessions, mice were returned to the home cage after the end of the delay period.

Mice assigned to the novel-flavour condition first received four training days as described above with water as the reward and no LiCl or CGRP neuron stimulation. On the conditioning day, sweetened grape Kool-Aid (0.06% grape and 0.3% saccharin sodium salt; Sigma, S1002) was the reward. Mice assigned the familiar-flavour condition had sweetened grape Kool-Aid as the reward for all four training days as well as on the conditioning day.

On the LiCl conditioning day (Fig. 1), mice received an i.p. injection of LiCl (125 mg kg–1; Fisher Scientific, L121) or normal saline after the 30-min delay after the end of the consumption period. For the CGRP neuron cell-body stimulation (Fig. 2d) and CGRPCEA projection stimulation (Fig. 2e) experiments, mice then received 45 min of intermittent stimulation beginning after the 30 min of delay. Blue light was generated using a 447 nm laser for ChR2 experiments. Green light was generated using a 532 nm laser for ChRmine experiments. The light was split through a rotary joint and delivered to the animal using 200 µm diameter core patch cables. Light power was calibrated to approximately 10 mW at the patch cable tip for ChR2 experiments and 3 mW for ChRmine experiments. During the experiment, the laser was controlled with a Pulse Pal signal generator (Sanworks, 1102) programmed to deliver 5 ms laser pulses at 10 Hz. For the duration of the stimulation period, the laser was pulsed for 1.5–15 s intervals (randomly chosen from a uniform distribution with 1.5 s step size) and then off for 1–10 s intervals (randomly chosen from a uniform distribution with 1 s step size). For the eOPN3 experiment (Fig. 2f), photoinhibition began 1 min before the LiCl injection and then continued for 90 min (532 nm laser, 10 mW power, 500 ms laser pulses at 0.4 Hz). Mice were then returned to the home cage. For the LS activation experiments (Extended Data Fig. 2), mice received an i.p. injection of 3 mg kg–1 clozapine N-oxide (CNO; Hellobio, 6149) 45 min before the experiment began.

We assessed learning using a two-bottle memory retrieval test. Two bottles were affixed to the side of a mouse cage (Animal Care Systems Optimice) such that the sipper tube openings were located approximately 1 cm apart. One day after conditioning, mice were given 30 min of access with water in both bottles. We calculated a preference for each mouse for this session and then counterbalanced the location of the test bottle for the retrieval test such that the average water day preference for the two bottle locations was as close to 50% as possible for each group. The next day, mice were given 30 min of access with water in one bottle and sweetened grape Kool-Aid in the other bottle. Flavour preference was then calculated using the weight consumed from each bottle during this retrieval test: flavour/(flavour + water).

To initially characterize behaviour in our CFA paradigm (Fig. 1b), retrieval tests were conducted on three consecutive days with the flavour bottle in the same location each day for each mouse. We then fit a GLMM to this dataset using the R package glmmTMB69 (https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB; v.1.17) with a Gaussian link function and the formula:

where Preference is the retrieval test result, Novel (novel, familiar), Injection (LiCl, saline), Day (day 1, day 2, day 3) and Sex (female, male) are fixed-effect categorical variables, (1|Subject) is a random effect for each mouse, the asterisk represents the main effects and interactions, and the tilde means ‘distributed as'. This GLMM showed a strong novel–injection interaction effect (P = 2.22 × 10–6, coefficient estimate z test, n = 32 mice) and a weak effect of novel alone (P = 0.025), but no effect of sex (P = 0.137) or injection (P = 0.574) alone or for any other effects. Using the coefficients from this GLMM, we then used the R package marginaleffects70 (https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/marginaleffects; version 0.12.0) to calculate the marginal effect of the flavour condition (novel – familiar) on each day independently for each injection group. We used the marginal effect estimates and s.e. values to calculate a P value for each injection–day combination with a z test, and then corrected for multiple comparisons in each injection group using the Hochberg–Bonferroni step-up procedure71.

For subsequent experiments (Fig. 2d–f and Extended Data Fig. 2b), we performed a single retrieval test per animal and tested for significant differences across groups using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

We visualized mCherry, mScarlet and YFP signals to validate transgene expression in our LS chemogenetics (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) and CGRP neuron optogenetics (Fig. 2d–f) experiments. Mice were deeply anaesthetized (2 mg kg–1 Euthasol i.p.) and then transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were then extracted and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4 °C and then cryoprotected overnight in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C. Free-floating sections (40 μm) were prepared with a cryostat (Leica Microsystems, CM3050S), mounted with DAPI Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, 0100) and imaged with a slide scanner (Hamamatsu, NanoZoomer S60) using NDP Scan software (https://www.hamamatsu.com; v.3.4).

To visualize ExRai–AKAR2 signals (Fig. 5c), we stained for GFP immunoreactivity in the CEA. To validate CGRP neuron ablation following taCasp3-TEVp injection (Fig. 3p and Extended Data Fig. 9f), we stained for CGRP immunoreactivity in the PB. In brief, sections were washed, blocked (3% normal donkey serum (NDS) and 0.3% Triton-X in PBS for 90 min) and then incubated with primary antibody (rabbit anti-GFP, Novus, NB600-308, 1:1,000; mouse anti-CGRP, Abcam, ab81887, 1:250) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then washed, incubated with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit, Invitrogen, A31573, 1:500; Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse, Life Technologies, A10037, 1:500) in blocking buffer for 90 min at room temperature, washed again, mounted with DAPI Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, 0100) and imaged with a slide scanner (Hamamatsu, NanoZoomer S60) using NDP Scan software (https://www.hamamatsu.com; v.3.4).

Basic image processing, such as brightness and contrast adjustment, was performed using Fiji72 (https://fiji.sc; v.1.52).

The reference atlas we used is based on the 25 μm resolution Allen Mouse Brain CCF v.3 (https://atlas.brain-map.org)29. For FOS imaging experiments, we considered every brain region in the atlas that met the following criteria: (1) total volume ≥0.1 mm3; (2) lowest level of its branch of the ontology tree (cortical layers or zones not included). We made two modifications to the standard atlas for this study.

First, we reassigned brain region identifiers to increase the clarity of our FOS visualizations that incorporate the atlas and to accurately represent the full functional extent of the CEA. We merged several small regional subdivisions together into the larger LG, PVH, PV, MRN, PRN and SPV regions (see Supplementary Table 1 for a list of brain-region abbreviations). We reassigned all cortical layers and zones to their immediate parent regions (for example, ‘Gustatory areas, layers 1–6b' (111–117) were reassigned to ‘Gustatory areas' (110)). We merged all unassigned regions (tagged with the ‘-un' suffix in the Allen CCF) into relevant parent regions (for example, ‘HPF-un' (563) was reassigned to ‘Hippocampal formation' (462)). We reassigned the voxels immediately surrounding the CEA that were assigned to the ‘Striatum' (581) to the ‘Central amygdalar nucleus' (605), because we found that cells localized to these CEA-adjacent voxels had highly similar FOS and Neuropixels responses compared with cells localized strictly in the CEA. These atlas changes were used throughout the paper (FOS imaging experiments and Neuropixels experiments). Summaries across the entire CEA (for example, Figs. 1i, 2h, 3 and 4) included all atlas voxels assigned to the parent CEA region (605) and to the CEAc (606), CEAl (607) and CEAm (608) subdivisions. The summary across the entire LS (Extended Data Fig. 2d) included all atlas voxels assigned to the parent ‘Lateral septal complex' region (594) and to the LS subdivision (595).

Second, we made the left and right hemispheres symmetric to facilitate the pooling of data from both hemispheres for our FOS visualizations. To ensure that the hemispheres of the Allen CCF were perfectly symmetric, we replaced the left hemisphere with a mirrored version of the right hemisphere. This atlas change was used only for the FOS experiments.

All mice used for the FOS experiments (Figs. 1 and 2 and Extended Data Figs. 1–4 and 6) were trained in the one-reward CFA paradigm as described above. For the consumption time point (Fig. 1), mice were euthanized 60 min after the end of the consumption period on the conditioning day (no LiCl injection was given). For the malaise time point (Fig. 1), mice were euthanized 60 min after the LiCl injection on the conditioning day. For the retrieval time point (Fig. 1), mice received the LiCl conditioning described above and then were returned to the operant box 2 days later for another consumption of the paired flavour using the same task structure as described above. Mice were euthanized 60 min after the end of the consumption period of the retrieval session (no LiCl was given during the retrieval session). For the CGRP neuron stimulation time point (Fig. 2), mice were euthanized 60 min after the onset of CGRP neuron stimulation on the conditioning day and stimulation continued for the full 60 min. For the LS activation time point (Extended Data Fig. 2), mice received an i.p. injection of 3 mg kg–1 CNO 45 min before consumption and were then euthanized 60 min after the LiCl injection on the conditioning day.

Mice were deeply anaesthetized (2 mg kg–1 Euthasol i.p.) and then transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS and heparin (20 U ml–1; Sigma, H3149) followed by ice-cold 4% PFA in PBS. Brains were then extracted and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4 °C.

Brain samples were cleared and immunolabelled using an iDISCO+ protocol as previously described28,73. All incubations were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.

Brain samples were serially dehydrated in increasing concentrations of methanol (Carolina Biological Supply, 874195; 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% in doubly distilled water (ddH2O); 45 min–1 h each), bleached in 5% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma, H1009) in methanol overnight and then serially rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of methanol (100%, 80%, 60%, 40% and 20% in ddH2O; 45 min–1 h each).

Brain samples were washed in 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma, T8787) in PBS, followed by 20% DMSO (Fisher Scientific, D128), 0.3 M glycine (Sigma, 410225) and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at 37 °C for 2 days. Brains were then washed in 10% DMSO and 6% NDS (EMD Millipore S30) and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at 37 °C for 2–3 days to block nonspecific antibody binding. Brains were then washed twice for 1 h at 37 °C in 0.2% Tween-20 (Sigma P9416) and 10 mg ml–1 heparin in PBS (PTwH solution) followed by incubation with primary antibody solution (rabbit anti-FOS, 1:1,000; Synaptic Systems, 226008) in 5% DMSO, 3% NDS and PTwH at 37 °C for 7 days. Brains were then washed in PTwH 6 times for increasing durations (10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h and overnight) followed by incubation with secondary antibody solution (Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit, 1:200; Abcam, ab150075) in 3% NDS and PTwH at 37 °C for 7 days. Brains were then washed in PTwH 6 times for increasing durations again (10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, overnight).

CGRP neuron stimulation time point samples also received primary (chicken anti-GFP, 1:500; Aves, GFP-1020) and secondary (Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-chicken, 1:500; Jackson Immunoresearch, 703-585-155) antibodies for ChR2–YFP immunolabelling during the above protocol.

Brain samples were serially dehydrated in increasing concentrations of methanol (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% in ddH2O; 45 min–1 h each), then incubated in a 2:1 solution of dichloromethane (Sigma, 270997) and methanol for 3 h then washed twice for 15 min in 100% dichloromethane. Before imaging, brains were stored in the refractive-index-matching solution dibenzyl ether (Sigma, 108014).

Cleared and immunolabelled brain samples were glued (Loctite, 234796) ventral side-down to a 3D-printed holder and imaged in dibenzyl ether using a dynamic axial-sweeping light-sheet fluorescence microscope74 (Life Canvas Technologies, SmartSPIM) using SmartSPIM acquisition software (https://lifecanvastech.com/products/smartspim; v.5.6). Images were acquired using a ×3.6, 0.2 NA objective with a 3,650 × 3,650 µm field of view onto a 2,048 × 2,048 pixel sCMOS camera (pixel size, 1.78 × 1.78 µm) with a spacing of 2 µm between horizontal planes (nominal axial point spread function, 3.2–4.0 µm). Imaging of the entire brain required 4 × 6 tiling across the horizontal plane and 3,300–3,900 total horizontal planes. Autofluorescence channel images were acquired using 488 nm excitation light at 20% power (maximum output, 150 mW) and 2 ms of exposure time, and FOS channel images were acquired using 639 nm excitation light at 90% power (maximum output, 160 mW) and 2 ms of exposure time. For CGRP neuron stimulation time point samples, a bilateral volume encompassing both PB regions was imaged separately using 561 nm excitation light at 20% power (maximum output, 150 mW) and 2 ms of exposure time to confirm ChR2–YFP expression.

After acquisition, tiled images for the FOS channel were first stitched into a single imaging volume using the TeraStitcher C++ package75 (https://github.com/abria/TeraStitcher; v.1.11.10). These stitching parameters were then directly applied to the tiled autofluorescence channel images, which produced two aligned 3D imaging volumes with the same final dimensions. After tile stitching, striping artefacts were removed from each channel using the Python package Pystripe76 (https://github.com/chunglabmit/pystripe; v.0.2.0).

We registered the final FOS imaging volume to the Allen CCF using the autofluorescence imaging volume as an intermediary73. We first downsampled both imaging volumes by a factor of five for computational efficiency. Autofluorescence→atlas alignment was done by applying an affine transformation to obtain general alignment using only translation, rotation, shearing and scaling, followed by applying a b-spline transformation to account for local nonlinear variability among individual brains. FOS→autofluorescence alignment was done by applying only affine transformations to account for brain movement during imaging and wavelength-dependent aberrations. Alignment transformations were computed using the Elastix C++ package77,78 (https://github.com/SuperElastix/elastix; v.4.8). These transformations enabled us to transform FOS+ cell coordinates first from their native space to the autofluorescence space and then to Allen CCF space. In rare cases when this two-step alignment strategy failed, we directly registered the FOS imaging volume to the Allen CCF by applying both affine and b-spline transformations.

We first use standard machine-vision approaches to identify candidate FOS+ cells based on peak intensity and then use a convolutional neural network to remove artefacts. Our pipeline builds on the Python package ClearMap28,79 (https://github.com/ChristophKirst/ClearMap2; v.2.0) for identifying candidate cells and the Python package Cellfinder80 (https://github.com/brainglobe/cellfinder; v.0.4.20) for artefact removal.

ClearMap operates through a series of simple image-processing steps. First, the FOS imaging volume was background-subtracted using a morphological opening (disk size, 21 pixels). Second, potential cell centres were found as local maxima in the background-subtracted imaging volume (structural element shape, 11 pixels). Third, the cell size was determined for each potential cell centre using a watershed algorithm (see below for details on the watershed-detection threshold). Fourth, a final list of candidate cells was generated by removing all potential cells that were smaller than a preset size (size threshold, 350 pixels). We confirmed that our findings were consistent across a wide range of potential size thresholds.

We implemented three changes to the standard ClearMap algorithm. First, we de-noised the FOS imaging volume using a median filter (function, scipy.ndimage.median_filter; size, 3 pixels) before the background-subtraction step. Second, we dynamically adjusted the watershed-detection threshold for each sample based on its fluorescence intensity. This step was important for achieving consistent cell-detection performance despite changes in the background and signal intensity across batches and samples owing to technical variations in clearing, immunolabelling and imaging. In brief, we selected a 1,000 × 1,000 × 200 pixel subvolume at the centre of each sample's FOS imaging volume. We then median-filtered and background-subtracted this subvolume as described above. We then used sigma clipping (function, astropy.stats.sigma_clipped_stats; sigma=3.0, maxiters=10, cenfunc=‘median', stdfunc=‘mad_std') to estimate the mean background signal level for this subvolume, µbg, and set the watershed-detection threshold for each sample to 10*µbg. Third, we removed from further analyses all cell candidates that were located outside the brain, in the anterior olfactory areas or cerebellum (which were often damaged during dissection), or in the ventricles, fibre tracts and grooves following registration to the Allen CCF.

One limitation of the watershed algorithm implemented by ClearMap is that it identifies any high-contrast feature as a candidate cell, including exterior and ventricle brain edges, tissue tears, bubbles and other aberrations. To overcome this limitation, we re-trained the 50-layer ResNet81 implemented in Keras (https://keras.io; v.2.8.0) for TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org; v.2.8.0) from the Python package Cellfinder80 to classify candidate FOS+ cells in our high-resolution light-sheet microscopy imaging dataset as true FOS+ cells or artefacts. This network uses both the autofluorescence and FOS channels during classification because the autofluorescence channel has significant information about high-contrast anatomical features and imaging aberrations. We first manually annotated 2,000 true FOS+ cells and 1,000 artefacts from each of four brain samples across two technical batches using the Cellfinder Napari plugin, which produced a total training dataset of 12,000 examples. We then re-trained the Cellfinder network (which had already been trained on approximately 100,000 examples from serial two-photon images of GFP-labelled neurons) over 100 epochs with a learning rate of 0.0001 and 1,200 examples (10% of the training dataset) held out for validation. Re-training took 4 days 16 min 41 s on a high-performance computing cluster using 1 GPU and 12 CPU threads. We achieved a final validation accuracy of 98.33%. Across all samples in our main brain-wide FOS dataset, our trained convolutional neural network removed 15.99 ± 0.58% (mean ± s.e.m.; range, 2.96–32.71%; n = 99 brains across the experiments in Figs. 1 and 2) of cell candidates from ClearMap as artefacts.

We used the ClearMap interface with Elastix to transform the coordinates of each true FOS+ cell to the Allen CCF space using the transformations described above. We then used these coordinates to assign each FOS+ cell to an Allen CCF brain region. For each sample, we generated a final data structure that contained the Allen CCF coordinates (x,y,z), size and brain region for each true FOS+ cell.

We generated 3D maps of FOS+ cell density by applying a Gaussian kernel-density estimate (KDE) (function, scipy.stats.gaussian_kde) in Python to all FOS+ cells across all animals in a given experimental condition (for example, novel flavour + consumption time point). These maps are visualized in Figs. 1h and 2k and Extended Data Figs. 1c–h, 2g and 6e,f.

We first generated a table containing the Allen CCF coordinates (x,y,z) for every FOS+ cell in every animal in an experimental condition. At this stage, we listed each cell twice (once with its original coordinates and once with its ML (z) coordinate flipped to the opposite hemisphere) to pool data from both hemispheres. We then assigned each cell a weight equal to the inverse of the total number of FOS+ cells in that animal to ensure that each animal in an experimental condition would be equally weighted. We then fit a 3D Gaussian KDE for each experimental condition using the scipy.stats.gaussian_kde function and manually set the kernel bandwidth for every experimental condition to be equal at 0.04. We then evaluated this KDE at every voxel in the Allen CCF (excluding voxels outside the brain or in anterior olfactory areas, cerebellum, ventricles, fibre tracts and grooves) to obtain a 3D map of FOS+ density for each condition. Last, we normalized the KDE for each experimental condition by dividing by its sum as well as the voxel volume of the atlas to generate a final 3D map with units of ‘per cent FOS+ cells per mm3'. For the CGRP neuron stimulation time point, we assigned each cell a weight equal to the inverse of the number of FOS+ cells in the PB of that animal, rather than the total number FOS+ cells, to account for variations in ChR2 expression across mice and flavour conditions.

To examine the difference in FOS+ cell density across flavour conditions (for example, in Extended Data Fig. 1d for the consumption time point) we simply subtracted the 3D KDE volumes for the two conditions, novel – familiar, and then plotted coronal sections through this subtracted volume with Allen CCF boundaries overlaid. The colour bar limits for all novel – familiar ΔFOS KDE figures are ±0.5% FOS+ cells per mm3 and for all average FOS KDE, figures are 0–1% FOS+ cells per mm3.

We used the WebGL-based Neuroglancer to generate interactive 3D visualizations of the FOS+ cell density maps for each experimental time point (https://www.brainsharer.org/ng/?id=872). To achieve this, we used the Python package cloudvolume (https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume; v.8.5.1) to convert our 3D KDE volumes from the numpy format to precomputed layers compatible with Neuroglancer and then loaded these layers into the Brainsharer web portal to create the final visualization.

We adopted a GLMM to analyse the brain-wide FOS data (Figs. 1 and 2). This process enabled us to model the contribution of flavour and experimental time point to neural activation in each brain region while also accounting for the overdispersed, discrete nature of the data by using a negative binomial link function, the contribution of batch-to-batch technical variation in tissue clearing, immunolabelling and imaging by modelling this as a random effect, and the potential contribution of sex as a biological variable by modelling this as a fixed effect.

The first step was to determine whether there was any effect of novel or familiar flavour, experimental time point or their interaction for each brain region while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) across all regions. To accomplish this, we fit a full GLMM for each brain region using the R package glmmTMB69 (https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB; v.1.1.7) with a negative binomial link function (nbinom2) and the formula:

where FOS counts is the number of FOS+ cells in a brain region, Novel (novel, familiar), Time point (consumption, malaise, retrieval) and Sex (female, male) are fixed-effect categorical variables, (1|Batch) is a random effect for each technical batch (that is, each set of samples that underwent tissue clearing, immunolabelling and light-sheet microscopy imaging together), ln(Total counts) is an offset term for the total number of FOS+ cells in each sample and the asterisk represents all possible main effects and interactions (Fig. 1d). We then fit a reduced GLMM for each brain region, which was the same as the full model (equation (2)) but with the Novel*Time point terms (that is, all main effects and interactions related to flavour novelty and experimental time point) removed. We compared these two models for each brain region using likelihood-ratio χ2-tests and then adjusted the resultant P values using the Benjamini–Krieger–Yekutieli two-step procedure82 to permit a 10% FDR across all brain regions. The 10% FDR threshold used here is standard for brain-wide FOS studies83,84,85. Of the 200 brain regions tested, 130 met this criterion and were included for downstream analyses.

We next specifically tested the effect of flavour novelty on FOS counts separately at each experimental time point for the 130 brain regions that passed the above-defined FDR threshold. To calculate the marginal effect of the flavour condition (novel – familiar) at each time point for each brain region, we used the R package marginaleffects70 (https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/marginaleffects; v.0.12.0) to do post hoc testing of the full GLMM. We used the marginal effect estimates and s.e. values to calculate a P value for each time point with a z test and then corrected for multiple comparisons across time points in each brain region using the Hochberg–Bonferroni procedure71. We also used the ratio of these marginal effect estimates and s.e. values to compute the standardized average difference in FOS+ cell counts across flavour conditions for each brain region at each time point (Z = estimate/s.e.; Fig. 1e–g and Supplementary Table 1). The advantage of this metric is that it explicitly accounts for variation within and across groups, for effects of sex and technical batch, and is independent of brain region size.

When displaying FOS+ cell counts for individual samples (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Figs. 1a,b and 6b), we divided the number of FOS+ cells for each animal or brain region by the total number of FOS+ cells in that animal and by the Allen CCF volume of that brain region, so that the data for each region are presented as ‘per cent FOS+ cells per mm3'. We used the P values from the GLMM marginal effect z tests described above to assess significance.

To examine the brain-wide shift in novel – familiar coding across time points (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3a–c), we used the Matlab package Violinplot (https://github.com/bastibe/Violinplot-Matlab) to plot the distribution of standardized average difference Z values at each time point for the brain regions that passed our FDR threshold and then used Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests to assess whether these distributions were significantly different from each other, correcting for multiple comparisons across time points using the Hochberg–Bonferroni procedure71.

To identify structure in novel – familiar coding across time points (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 3d–n), we used the built-in Matlab linkage function (method=‘ward', metric=‘chebychev') to create a hierarchical tree using the standardized average difference Z values at each time point for the brain regions that passed our FDR threshold. The input matrix was 130 brain regions × 3 time points. We then used the built-in Matlab dendrogram function to plot this hierarchical tree and used a distance threshold of 4.7 for clustering.

We followed an analogous procedure to analyse brain-wide FOS data for the CGRP neuron stimulation time point (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 6). To account for variations in ChR2 expression across mice and flavour conditions, we weighted FOS+ cell counts by the number of FOS+ cells in the PB in these analyses. Specifically, to compare the effects of CGRP neuron stimulation and LiCl-induced malaise on overall FOS levels (Extended Data Fig. 6c), we fit a GLMM for each brain region with the negative binomial link function and the formula:

where FOS counts is the number of FOS+ cells in a brain region, Time point (consumption, malaise, retrieval, CGRP neuron stimulation) and Sex (female, male) are fixed-effect categorical variables, (1|Batch) is a random effect for each technical batch, ln(PB counts) is an offset term for the total number of FOS+ cells in the PB of each sample and the asterisk represents all possible main effects and interactions. For this model, we did not include any terms related to flavour novelty because we were specifically investigating changes in overall FOS levels. We then plotted the coefficient estimate Z values from this GLMM (Extended Data Fig. 6c). To compare the effects of CGRP neuron stimulation and LiCl-induced malaise on FOS levels in the novel versus familiar flavour condition (Extended Data Fig. 6d), we fit a GLMM for each brain region with the formula:

where FOS counts is the number of FOS+ cells in a brain region, Novel (novel, familiar), Time point (malaise, CGRP neuron stimulation) and Sex (female, male) are fixed-effect categorical variables, (1|Batch) is a random effect for each technical batch, ln(PB counts) is an offset term for the total number of FOS+ cells in the PB of each sample and the asterisk represents all possible main effects and interactions. For this model, we only included the experimental time points in which CGRP neurons were activated either optogenetically (CGRP neuron stimulation) or pharmacologically (malaise); see Extended Data Fig. 6b for the quantification of PB activation. We then calculated and plotted the marginal effect of the flavour condition (novel – familiar) separately for each time point and brain region (Extended Data Fig. 6d). We also used the marginal effect from the GLMM in equation (4) to calculate the P value for Fig. 2h. When displaying FOS+ cell counts for individual animals (Fig. 2h; CGRP neuron stimulation time point) or brain regions (Fig. 2i,j; malaise and CGRP neuron stimulation time points), we first divided the number of FOS+ cells for each brain region in each animal by the number of FOS+ cells in the PB for that animal and by the Allen CCF volume of that brain region. We then divided this number by the average ratio of total FOS+ cells to PB FOS+ cells across every sample in that time point (malaise or CGRP neuron stimulation), which produced a final measure of FOS+ cells of each animal or region as a percentage of the entire brain's FOS+ cells weighted by the relative count of PB FOS+ cells for that animal. We obtained consistent results by instead subsampling the animals in the CGRP neuron stimulation time point to have approximately equal FOS+ cell counts in both flavour conditions and then weighting by the total FOS+ cell count of each animal.

To quantify FOS correlations across individual mice (Extended Data Fig. 4), we considered each experimental time point (consumption, malaise, retrieval) separately. We first assembled the relative FOS+ cell counts (per cent per mm3) for every brain region that passed our FDR threshold and then sorted these regions using the hierarchical tree fit described above, which resulted in a 130 brain region × 24 animal input matrix for each experimental time point. We then used the built-in Matlab corr function to calculate and visualize pairwise correlations among all brain regions (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To estimate the correlation among individual brain regions in the amygdala cluster at each time point (Extended Data Fig. 4b), we averaged pairwise correlations for each brain region with all other amygdala cluster regions in the correlation matrices described above. We tested whether the correlation among individual amygdala cluster brain regions was significant at each time point using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, correcting for multiple comparisons across time points using the Hochberg–Bonferroni procedure71. To estimate the correlation between the amygdala cluster and every other cluster at each time point (Extended Data Fig. 4c), we averaged the pairwise correlations for all brain region pairs across the two clusters.

To compare the effects of LS activation on FOS levels in the LS and the CEA (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e), we calculated P values for these two regions using a GLMM with the formula:

where FOS counts is the number of FOS+ cells in a brain region, hM3D (hM3D, YFP) and Sex (female, male) are fixed-effect categorical variables, (1|Batch) is a random effect for each technical batch, ln(Total counts) is an offset term for the total number of FOS+ cells in each sample and the asterisk represents all possible main effects and interactions. The P values in the figure are from the hM3D coefficient estimates.

To compare the effects of LS activation of FOS levels across the brain (Extended Data Fig. 2f), we plotted the average FOS level (per cent FOS+ cells per mm3) across all mice in each condition (hM3D, YFP) separately for three groups of brain regions: the amygdala network, the septal complex and other regions. We then used the built-in Matlab aoctool function to fit a one-way analysis of covariance model for these three groups of brain regions and the built-in Matlab multcompare function to test whether the estimated slopes were significantly different, correcting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni procedure.

We sliced 18–25-µm-thick sections from perfused brain samples. Multiplex FISH (Fig. 2l–n and Extended Data Fig. 6g,h) was performed using an RNAscope86 Multiplex Fluorescent Assay v2 (ACD 323120) with the following probes: Mm-Calcrl (452281), Mm-Sst-C2 (404631-C2, 1:50 dilution in C1 solution), Mm-Prkcd-C3 (441791-C3, 1:50 dilution in C1 solution) and Mm-Fos-C4 (316921-C4, 1:50 dilution in C1 solution). The Calcrl, Sst, Prkcd and Fos probes were linked to Opal 690, Opal 520, Opal 620 and Opal 570 fluorophores, respectively (Akoya Biosciences). All fluorophores were reconstituted in DMSO according to instructions from the manufacturer and diluted 1:1,200 in tyramide signal amplification buffer included in the RNAscope kit. After in situ hybridization, slides were coverslipped using DAPI Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, 0100).

We obtained ×20 z stacks from the CEA with a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8 X) using Leica Application Suite X software (https://www.leica-microsystems.com; v.1.8). We then converted these z stacks into maximum-intensity projections for each labelled RNA. We trained a Cellpose87,88 (https://cellpose.readthedocs.io; v.3.0.8) model to identify Fos+ cells in the maximum-intensity projections using eight manually corrected examples, and then used this model to identify Fos+ cells in the remaining images. We then manually classified whether every Fos+ cell identified by Cellpose also expressed Sst, Prkcd and/or Calcrl. We used the full z stacks for each labelled RNA for this process to ensure that potentially overlapping cells were labelled separately. We also imaged each tissue section with a slide scanner (Hamamatsu, Nanozoomer S60) using NDP Scan software (https://www.hamamatsu.com; v.3.4) and then registered them to the Allen CCF using ABBA89 (https://abba-documentation.readthedocs.io; v.0.8.0). To remove Fos+ cells outside the CEA from analysis, we manually aligned the confocal and slide scanner images using the Fos channel in each image as a guide and then manually transferred the CEA boundaries to the confocal images. Manual cell classifications and basic image processing tasks were performed using Fiji72 (https://fiji.sc; v.1.52).

All slice electrophysiology recordings (Fig. 2c) were performed on brain slices collected at approximately the same time of day. Calcacre mice were first injected with 400 nl of AAV5-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP (titre, 1.2 × 1013 GC per ml; manufacturer, PNI Viral Core Facility) bilaterally into the PB 6 weeks or more before the experiment. On the day of the recordings, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated to remove the brain. After extraction, the brain was immersed in ice-cold NMDG ACSF (92 mM NMDG, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 30 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM HEPES, 25 mM glucose, 2 mM thiourea, 5 mM sodium ascorbate, 3 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mM CaCl2·4H2O, 10 mM MgSO4·7H2O and 12 mM N-acetyl-l-cysteine; pH adjusted to 7.3–7.4) for 2 min. Afterwards, coronal slices (300 μm) were sectioned using a vibratome (Leica VT1200s) and then incubated in NMDG ACSF at 34 °C for approximately 15 min. Slices were then transferred to a holding solution of HEPES ACSF (92 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 30 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM HEPES, 25 mM glucose, 2 mM thiourea, 5 mM sodium ascorbate, 3 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM CaCl2·4H2O, 2 mM MgSO4·7H2O and 12 mM N-acetyl-l-cysteine, bubbled at room temperature with 95% O2 and 5% CO2) for at least 60 min until recordings were performed.

Whole-cell recordings were performed using a Molecular Devices Multiclamp 700B amplifier and Digidata 1440A low-noise data acquisition system. Recording pipettes had a resistance of 4–7 MΩ and were filled with an internal solution containing 120 mM potassium gluconate, 0.2 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM Mg-ATP and 0.3 mM NA-GTP, with the pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH and the osmolarity adjusted to approximately 289 mmol kg−1 with sucrose. During recordings, slices were perfused with a recording ACSF solution (100 μM picrotoxin, 120 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2 and 11 mM D-(+)-glucose) with 1 µM TTX and 100 µM 4AP that was continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Infrared differential interference contrast-enhanced visual guidance was used to select neurons that were 3–4 cell layers below the surface of the slices. All CEAc and CEAl recordings were made for which eYFP-expressing CGRP neuron axons were visible, and all CEAm recordings were made more medial to this location using the Allen CCF as a guide The recording solution was delivered to slices through superfusion driven by a peristaltic pump (flow rate of 4–5 ml min–1) and was held at room temperature. The neurons were held at −70 mV (voltage clamp), and the pipette series resistance was monitored throughout the experiments by hyperpolarizing steps of 1 mV with each sweep. If the series resistance changed by >20% during the recording, the data were discarded. Whole-cell currents were low-pass filtered at 4 kHz online and digitized and stored at 10 kHz using Clampex software (https://www.moleculardevices.com; v.10.7). Currents were then filtered at 1 kHz offline before analysis. During the experiment, we measured light-evoked oEPSCs every 30 s with light stimulation (0.074 mW mm–2) delivered for a duration of 5 ms. Twenty repetitions of the stimulation protocol were recorded per cell after stable oEPSCs were achieved. All experiments were completed within 4 h after slices were made to maximize cell viability and consistency.

Traces from example CEAc, CEAl and CEAm neurons are shown in Fig. 2c. Across all monosynaptically connected neurons, the amplitude of CGRP neuron→CEAc or CEAl oEPSCs was –327.0 ± 136.3 pA (mean ± s.e.m.; n = 5 out of 5 connected neurons from 3 mice) and of CGRP neuron→CEAm oEPSCs was –15.6 ± 6.4 pA (mean ± s.e.m.; n = 4 out of 5 connected neurons from 3 mice).

For Neuropixels recording experiments (Figs. 3 and 4), we used a two-reward CFA paradigm (rather than the one-reward paradigm used for the FOS experiments). This enabled us to compare neural correlates of the novel-flavour reward, which was delivered from one port, with responses related to a control port that delivered water. Experiments were performed in an operant box (Med Associates) using MedPC software (https://med-associates.com/product/med-pc; v.IV). The operant box was situated in a sound-attenuating chamber and equipped with a single speaker and with two custom 3D-printed nosepoke ports with built-in lights and infrared beam breaks in each port. The nosepoke ports each contained a reward delivery tube that was calibrated to deliver 20 µl of reward through a solenoid valve (Lee Technologies LHDA2433315H). The ports were located on either side of the same wall of the operant box.

Mice first underwent a basic task procedure to train them to drink from two reward ports in a cued manner (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Each behavioural session had the following structure. First, the mouse was allowed to acclimate to the chamber for 5 min. Then, the consumption period began and rewards were made available in a trial-based manner that forced mice to drink from the two ports at a relatively equal rate throughout the session. At the beginning of each trial, one port was randomly selected and made available to the mouse. This was cued through the port light turning on and a distinct tone (2.5 kHz or 7.5 kHz; 70 dB) playing. The mouse had 10 s to enter the port and receive a reward, which was detected by the infrared beam break. The end of the 10 s reward availability period or entering either port ended the trial; at this point, the cueing light and sound were terminated and an inter-trial interval was initiated (randomly selected from a uniform distribution of 10–20 s; 1 s step size). At the end of the inter-trial interval, a new trial would begin as long as the mouse had not entered either reward port in the previous 2 s; otherwise, the next trial was delayed until this criterion was satisfied. To ensure that mice drank from the two ports at a relatively equal rate, we required that each consecutive block of ten successful rewarded trials must be evenly split between the two ports. The consumption period ended when 1.2 ml (60 rewards) was consumed. Mice learned to perform this task nearly perfectly (<5 unsuccessful trials per session) in approximately 1 week. During initial training, both ports delivered water. After mice were trained in the task, they underwent the chronic Neuropixels surgery described above and were allowed to recover for at least 5 days. Mice were then returned to daily training, with the addition of a delay period following the consumption period. At the beginning of the delay period (immediately after the final reward), mice were transferred to a distinct second context, which was triangular in shape with smooth white acrylic walls. Mice remained in this second context for at least 30 min before returning to the home cage. Mice were acclimated to the delay period and second context, and to tethering of the Neuropixels assembly and optical fibre, for at least 4 days before proceeding to the conditioning experiments. Variations to this basic task structure for specific experiments that were used following training and surgery are described below.

For these experiments (Figs. 3 and 4), on the conditioning day, the same behavioural session structure was followed, but now one port delivered water and the other port delivered sweetened grape Kool-Aid (0.06% grape and 0.3% saccharin sodium salt). The novel-flavour port was counterbalanced across mice. Mice (n = 8) were run in two separate groups separated by approximately 2 months. After the 30-min delay period in the second context, the CGRP neuron stimulation period began and lasted for 45 min in the same second context. Blue light was generated using a 447 nm laser and delivered to the animal using a 200 µm diameter patch cable. Light power was calibrated to approximately 10 mW at the patch cable tip. The laser was controlled with a Pulse Pal signal generator programmed to deliver 5 ms laser pulses at 10 Hz. For the duration of the CGRP neuron stimulation period, the laser was pulsed for 3 s bouts and then off for random intervals chosen from an exponential distribution (minimum, 1 s; mean, 3 s; maximum, 7.8 s). Following the 45-min neuron stimulation period, mice were returned to the home cage overnight. The following day, mice underwent a forced retrieval session that followed the same trial structure as previous sessions, and the flavour and water were delivered from the same ports as on the conditioning day.

These experiments (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Figs. 9a–e and 10c–e) were performed using the same strategy as the cell-body stimulation experiment described above in a separate group of mice (n = 8) with the following changes. Green light was generated using a 532-nm laser and calibrated to approximately 3 mW at the patch cable tip. To minimize potential photoelectric artefacts in our recordings, we positioned the tip of the optical fibre 1.5 mm from the Neuropixels shanks in the CEA for an irradiance at the electrodes of approximately 0.1 mW mm–2 and reduced the laser pulse width to 2 ms. These stimulation parameters were sufficient to activate the ultrasensitive opsin ChRmine64.

This experiment (Fig. 3m–r and Extended Data Figs. 9f,g and 10f,g) was performed in a separate group of mice (n = 4 control mice and 4 CGRP neuron ablation mice). It followed the same structure as above except that LiCl (125 mg kg–1 i.p.) was injected to induce gastrointestinal malaise after 30 min in the second context (delay period) instead of CGRP neuron stimulation. For behavioural validation of CGRP neuron ablation (Extended Data Fig. 9g), we included five mice that were not used for recordings but either received taCasp3 virus (n = 2 ablation mice) or did not undergo surgery (n = 3 control mice).

For these experiments (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 10h–k), a different flavour, sweetened cherry Kool-Aid (0.06% cherry and 0.3% saccharin sodium salt), was used. The experiment followed the same basic task structure as during initial training for the two-reward CFA paradigm, without any aversive conditioning experiences (LiCl injection or CGRP neuron stimulation). The experiment was run on three consecutive days. On the first day (novel day), one port contained the novel sweetened cherry Kool-Aid flavour and the other port contained water. On the second day, the port locations were switched. On the third day (familiar day), the port locations were switched again (that is, back to the initial locations from novel day).

This experiment (Extended Data Fig. 9h–j) did not involve rewards or use the task structure described above. First, mice were allowed to acclimate to the operant box recording chamber for 5 min. Then, CGRP neurons were photostimulated using the same protocol as for the acute Neuropixels recording experiment described below. In brief, mice received 1 s of 10 Hz CGRP neuron stimulation followed by a 9-s inter-trial interval for a total of 10 min per 60 trains. After a 5-min recovery period, LiCl (125 mg kg–1 i.p.) was then injected to induce gastrointestinal malaise. Mice remained in the recording chamber for at least 15 min before being returned to the home cage.

We used 27 mice for chronic Neuropixels recording experiments (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Animals 1–4 were used for the CGRP neuron cell-body stimulation conditioning experiment. Animals 5–8 were used for multiple experiments with the following timeline: (1) CGRP neuron cell-body stimulation conditioning experiment, (2) familiarization experiment, (3) CGRP neuron stimulation→LiCl injection experiment. Animals 9–12 were control mice used for the LiCl conditioning experiment. Animals 13–16 were CGRP neuron ablation mice used for the LiCl conditioning experiment. Animals 17–24 were used for the CGRPCEA projection stimulation conditioning experiment. Animals 25–27 were used for the familiarization experiment.

Before beginning experiments, we performed a series of test recordings for each mouse to identify the recording sites along each Neuropixels shank that were located in the CEA. We recorded for approximately 10 min from the bottom 384 recording sites of each shank. We found that recording sites properly targeted to the CEA could be identified by a dense band of single-unit and multiunit activity (see Extended Data Fig. 7b for examples). This process enabled us to design custom Imec readout tables (recording site maps; https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/help/imroTables) for each mouse that maximized the yield of CEA neurons during subsequent experiments.

We recorded 384 Neuropixels channels per session at 30 kHz using National Instruments PXI hardware and SpikeGLX software (https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX; v.3.0). Experimental TTL signals (representing reward cues, port entries, reward deliveries and laser pulses) were recorded simultaneously using the same system.

We used CatGT (https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX; v.3.3) to apply global common average referencing (-gblcar) and to isolate the action potential frequency band (-apfilter=butter,12,300,9000). We then used the International Brain Laboratory's (IBL) Python Kilosort 2.5 implementation90,91 (https://github.com/int-brain-lab/pykilosort) to correct for sample drift along the length of the probe, to detect and remove failing channels and to apply a spatial de-striping filter.

We also used the IBL's Python Kilosort 2.5 implementation91,92,93 (https://github.com/int-brain-lab/pykilosort) for spike sorting. We then used the Python package Phy (https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy; v.2.0) for interactive visualization and manual curation of spike sorting output. We used Phy to classify clusters from Kilosort as single-unit (good) or multiunit (MUA) clusters and to remove noise. We relied on waveform shape, autocorrelogram shape, spike amplitude time course and cluster separation for classification. Following curation with Phy, we used Matlab to compute three statistics for each cluster. First, we calculated the median amplitude of each cluster using the template scaling amplitudes from Kilosort (stored in amplitudes.npy), converted from bits to µV using the gain factor 2.34375. These template-scaling amplitudes were calculated after whitening the data and were significantly smaller than the equivalent raw spike amplitudes (µV). Second, we calculated the estimated false-positive rate of each cluster based on 2 ms refractory period violations94. Third, we calculated the firing rate (sp s–1) of each cluster. For experiments with multiple epochs (for example, consumption and CGRP neuron stimulation in Fig. 3), we calculated these metrics separately for each epoch and then kept the minimum median template-scaling amplitude, the maximum estimated false-positive rate and the minimum firing rate across epochs for each cluster. We removed clusters with median template-scaling amplitude values of <20 µV, estimated false-positive rates of >100% or firing rates <0.05 sp s–1 as noise. We classified the remaining clusters that were labelled ‘good' in Phy and had an estimated false-positive rate <10% as single units and the rest as multiunits. We included both single-unit and multiunit clusters throughout the article. We confirmed that our findings were consistent across a range of amplitude thresholds and for only single-unit clusters. Finally, we binned the spikes for each included neuron into 10 ms bins for downstream analyses.

All probes were coated in CellTracker CM-DiI (Invitrogen C7000) before implantation. After the conclusion of experiments, animals were euthanized and the brains cleared with an abbreviated version of the iDISCO+ protocol described above without immunostaining. The cleared brains were then imaged on a light-sheet microscope (LaVision Ultramicroscope II) using LaVision BioTec ImSpector software (https://www.lavisionbiotec.com; v.7.0). Images were acquired using 488 nm (autofluorescence channel) and 561 nm (CM-DiI channel) excitation light with 10 µm between horizontal planes and 5.91 µm per pixel resolution. Atlas alignment then followed the IBL's pipeline95 (https://github.com/int-brain-lab/iblapps/wiki). The autofluorescence volume was registered to the atlas using the Python package Brainreg96 (https://github.com/brainglobe/brainreg; v.0.4.0), and these transformations were then directly applied to the CM-DiI volume. Individual Neuropixels shank trajectories were then manually annotated in the atlas-registered CM-DiI volume using the Brainreg-segment Napari module (https://github.com/brainglobe/brainreg-segment; v.0.2.16). Every recording site was then localized to an Allen CCF coordinate (x,y,z) and brain region using the IBL's alignment GUI. The alignment process was performed separately for each Neuropixels probe shank. For all analyses, we only included neurons from recording sites that were localized to the CEA.

We made two changes to our processing pipeline to track units across two recording sessions (for example, the conditioning and retrieval sessions in Fig. 4b–e and Extended Data Fig. 10a–g, and the novel and familiar sessions in Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 10h–k). First, we concatenated the two recording sessions using CatGT after applying global common average referencing and isolating the action potential frequency band. We then performed spike sorting using the IBL's Python Kilosort 2.5 implementation as described above. Second, during manual curation in Phy, we removed clusters with obvious discontinuities or irregularities across days as noise. We then evaluated our quality metrics in Matlab as described above. To improve Kilosort's ability to track units in multiday recordings, pairs of sessions were separated by only 1 day (conditioning and retrieval) or 2 days (novel and familiar). We then used the Matlab package Spikes (https://github.com/cortex-lab/spikes) to extract spike waveforms and to generate autocorrelograms for each recording session (Fig. 4a).

For experiments involving reward delivery, we classified all neurons as novel-flavour-preferring, water-preferring or nonselective (for example, in the heatmaps in Figs. 3d and 4b). We first z scored each neuron's 10-ms binned spiking across the entire consumption period. We then calculated the average neural activity in the 10 s following every reward delivery, which was triggered by the animal entering the port. We distinguished nonselective neurons from reward-selective neurons using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test on these average responses for novel flavour and water trials while permitting a 5% FDR across all recorded neurons (pooled across mice within each experiment) with the Benjamini–Krieger–Yekutieli procedure82. We then classified reward-selective neurons as novel-flavour-preferring if their average neural activity in the 10 s following reward delivery was greater for novel-flavour trials than for water trials; the remaining neurons were classified as water-preferring. When tracking neurons across days and examining the change in their flavour response or selectivity (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 10), we classified neurons as novel-flavour-preferring or water-preferring based on their responses during consumption on the first day (novel or conditioning) only. We defined ‘novel flavour response' as the average neural activity in the 10 s following novel flavour delivery and ‘novel flavour selectivity' as the average neural activity in the 10 s following novel flavour delivery minus the average neural activity in the 10 s following water delivery. When correlating CGRP response to the change in flavour response and selectivity across days (Fig. 4d,e), we subtracted the baseline activity (–10 s to –5 s before reward delivery) from each trial when calculating reward responses to account for potential changes in baseline firing rate across days.

We generated peri-event time histograms (PETHs) surrounding reward delivery (–5 s to +10 s) using the z scored traces calculated above and averaging across all novel-flavour or water reward deliveries. When generating reward PETHs for the second day of multiday recordings (retrieval day, familiar day), we used the mean and s.d. calculated while z scoring the consumption period trace for the first day to ensure that units were comparable across days. We generated PETHs surrounding CGRP neuron stimulation or CGRPCEA projection stimulation trains (–1 s to +4 s) using the mean and s.d. calculated while z scoring that day's consumption period trace, and then subtracted the baseline (–1 s to 0 s) mean of each neuron's PETH. For plotting reward delivery PETHs as heatmaps and traces, we convolved each neuron's PETH with a causal half-Gaussian filter with 100-ms s.d.

We generated delay→CGRP neuron stimulation PETHs (Figs. 3d,e and 4b, c), delay→CGRPCEA projection stimulation PETHs (Extended Data Figs. 9b,c and 10c) and delay→LiCl PETHs (Fig. 3n,q) using the 10-ms binned spiking from 30 min before to 45 min after the onset of CGRP neuron stimulation or CGRPCEA projection stimulation LiCl injection. We then z scored these traces using the mean and s.d. from the final 20 min of the delay period and downsampled the final normalized PETHs to 1 sample per min for plotting. We defined ‘CGRP response' as the average neural activity across the entire 45-min CGRP neuron stimulation or CGRPCEA projection stimulation period in the PETHs described above (Figs. 3e and 4c–e and Extended Data Fig. 9c) and ‘LiCl response' as the average neural activity from 5–15 min after LiCl injection in the PETHs described above (Fig. 3n,q). We generated whole-experiment PETHs (Fig. 3e,n,q and Extended Data Fig. 9c) by concatenating the 10-ms binned spiking from the final 15-min of the consumption period, the first 30-min of the delay period and the first 45-min of the CGRP neuron stimulation period or CGRPCEA projection stimulation period or LiCl-induced malaise period. We then z scored these traces using the mean and s.d. of the delay period calculated above and downsampled the final normalized PETHs to 1 sample per min for plotting. When comparing the CGRP response (Fig. 3e,f and Extended Data Fig. 9c,d) or LiCl response (Fig. 3n,q) of novel flavour-preferring, water-preferring and nonselective neurons, we corrected for multiple comparisons using the Hochberg–Bonferroni procedure71.

For the CGRP neuron stimulation→LiCl injection experiment (Extended Data Fig. 9h–j), we first classified each neuron's CGRP response type using the strategy from the acute recording experiment described below. We first z scored each neuron's 10-ms binned spiking across the entire 10-min CGRP neuron stimulation period and generated baseline-subtracted PETHs surrounding CGRP neuron stimulation trains (–1 s to +2 s). We then applied the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) fit on the acute recording data (Extended Data Fig. 5c) to these PETHs to determine each neuron's CGRP response type and to identify CGRP-activated neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9i). We then generated LiCl injection PETHs using the 10-ms binned spiking from 5 min before to 15 min after the LiCl i.p. injection. We then z scored these traces using the mean and s.d. from the 5-min acclimatization period before CGRP neuron stimulation began and baseline-subtracted the normalized PETHs using the mean activity during the period between CGRP neuron stimulation and LiCl i.p. injection (–5 min to –1 min before LiCl). We downsampled the final normalized PETHs to 1 sample per min for plotting and then plotted average LiCl injection PETHs separately for CGRP-activated neurons and for other neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9j). We defined ‘LiCl response' as the average neural activity from 5 to 15 min after LiCl injection in the PETHs described above (Extended Data Fig. 9j).

To identify reactivations of neural flavour representations (Fig. 3g–i,o,r), we trained a multinomial logistic regression decoder using the LogisticRegression class from the Python package scikit-learn97 (https://scikit-learn.org; v.1.0.2) separately for each mouse using all CEA neurons during the consumption period on the conditioning day and then evaluated this decoder across the entire conditioning session. We included all mice with >75 simultaneously recorded CEA neurons for the decoding analysis (6 out of 8 CGRP neuron stimulation mice in Fig. 4h–i; 8 out of 8 LiCl injection mice in Fig. 4o,r). The decoder was trained to discriminate behavioural states during the consumption period across three categories: novel-flavour consumption (represented by normalized spike counts within 1 s after novel-flavour delivery; normalization procedure described below); water consumption (normalized spike counts within 1 s after water delivery); and baseline (normalized spike counts within 1 s before each cue onset). We trained the decoder using Lasso regularization and tested λ from 10–4 to 104 (nine logarithmically spaced values; Extended Data Fig. 8c). We chose λ = 1 for the final decoder because it provided a high level of regularization without decreasing log-likelihood in the held-out data during tenfold cross-validation. Cross-validation also verified that the decoder correctly identified the animal's behavioural state (novel flavour, water, baseline) during the consumption period (Extended Data Fig. 8e).

We normalized spike counts separately for each neuron and task period. For the consumption period (decoder training), we calculated each neuron's average spike counts within 1 s before cue onsets and subtracted it from the binned spike counts. We then divided these baseline-subtracted spike counts by the s.d. during the consumption period. For the delay and CGRP neuron stimulation periods (decoder evaluation), we z scored each neuron's spike counts based on its mean and s.d. during the delay period.

We then evaluated the decoder using neural activities across the session. We first used a 1-s sliding window with 150 ms steps to bin the spikes across the start to the end of the session. After obtaining the n neuron × n time bin normalized spike counts, we used the decoder to classify the behavioural state for each time bin based on the corresponding normalized spike counts. To visualize the decoder's performance (Fig. 3g), we plotted the decoder output along with the simultaneously recorded neural activity (spike trains convolved with a causal half-Gaussian filter with 25 ms s.d.) grouped by novel flavour or water preference, defined using criteria described above. For clarity, we only display a subset of recorded neurons (50 out of 90) in the example raster in Fig. 3g: all novel flavour-preferring and water-preferring neurons, along with 15 randomly chosen nonselective neurons. We focused our analysis on the comparison between the decoded probabilities for the novel flavour and water categories (Fig. 3g, top, and Fig. 3h). We detected peaks (local maxima with values > 0.5) of the decoder output as reactivation events, and counted the number of novel flavour and water reactivations with a sliding window of 1 min width and 30 s step size (Fig. 3i,o,r).

We used the built-in Matlab pca function (Fig. 3j). We began by taking the novel flavour delivery, water delivery and CGRP neuron stimulation PETHs described above, all convolved with a causal half-Gaussian filter with 100 ms s.d., for all reward-selective neurons (n = 494 pooled across all mice). We baseline-subtracted each neuron's reward-delivery PETHs using the mean baseline activity (–5 s to –4 s before reward delivery) averaged across both reward types and then peak-normalized each neuron's PETHs using the maximum absolute value across both reward types. We baseline-subtracted each neuron's CGRP neuron stimulation PETH using the mean baseline activity (–1 s to 0 s) before laser onset and then peak-normalized each neuron's PETH using the maximum absolute value of the CGRP neuron stimulation PETH. To identify PC loadings and to calculate the variance explained, we concatenated each neuron's novel flavour and water reward PETHs (0 s to +5 s from reward delivery), which produced a final input matrix that was 494 neurons × 1,000 time bins for PCA. We centred every column of this matrix before performing PCA along the neuron dimension.

To plot neural trajectories during novel flavour consumption and water consumption (Fig. 3k), we used the PC loadings defined above to calculate PC1 and PC2 values for the entire population at each time bin of the PETH (–5 s to +10 s from reward delivery). We followed an analogous procedure to plot neural trajectories during CGRP neuron stimulation. In both cases, we centred every column (time bin).

We repeated this entire analysis using only the neurons from individual mice (Fig. 3l) or using all neurons from a separate group of mice that received CGRPCEA projection stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 9e).

When analysing changes in PC trajectories across days (retrieval in Extended Data Fig. 10b and familiarization in Extended Data Fig. 10k), we followed basically the same procedure as above. For these analyses, we identified PC loadings using only the first day's (conditioning day or novel day) reward delivery PETHs and then used this set of PC loadings when plotting the PC trajectories for both days. Similarly, we baseline-subtracted and peak-normalized the second day's PETHs using values that were calculated using only the first day's PETHs. These measures ensured that PC trajectories were comparable across multiday recordings.

Calcacre mice were first injected with 400 nl of AAV5-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP (titre, 1.2 × 1013 GC per ml; manufacturer, PNI Viral Core Facility) into the left PB. Four weeks later, in a second surgery, an optical fibre (300 µm diameter core, 0.39 NA) was implanted at a –30° angle above the injection site (see the section ‘Viral injections and optical fibre implantations' for details), a steel headbar (approximately 1 g) was implanted at AP +1.25 mm, and a ground pin (Newark Electronics) was placed above the right hemisphere of the cerebellum. Finally, a 2 mm2 recording chamber was built with Dentin (Parkell S301) above the left hemisphere extending from AP 0 mm to AP –2.0 mm and ML –2.5 mm to ML –3.5 mm. The exposed skull was removed and the brain covered with a silicone elastomer (Kwik-Cast, World Precision Instruments).

Mice were habituated to head fixation (3× 30-min sessions). On the recording day, mice were head-fixed in a custom-built recording rig91, the silicone elastomer removed and the exposed brain briefly cleaned with normal saline. Neuropixels 1.0 probes98 had a soldered connection to short ground to external reference, which was also connected to the mouse's ground pin during recording. Immediately before the start of the recording session, the probe was coated in CellTracker CM-DiI (Invitrogen C7000). A single probe was lowered (approximately 10 μm s–1) with an ultraprecise micromanipulator (Sensapex µMp) into the amygdala. To prevent drying, the exposed brain and probe shank were covered with a viscous silicone polymer (Dow-Sil, Corning). After reaching the targeted location, the brain tissue was allowed to settle for 15 min before starting the recording. Recordings were acquired at 30 kHz using National Instruments PXI hardware and SpikeGLX software (https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX; v.3.3). Six recording locations were targeted in each animal. During the recording, mice received 1 s CGRP neuron stimulation followed by a 9 s inter-trial interval for a total of 10 min. Blue light was generated using a 447 nm laser and delivered to the animal using a 200 µm diameter core patch cable. Light power was calibrated to approximately 8 mW at the fibre tip. The laser was controlled with a Pulse Pal signal generator (Sanworks, 1102) programmed to deliver 5 ms laser pulses at 10 Hz.

Spike sorting, manual curation and atlas alignment were performed as described above for chronic Neuropixels recordings. To precisely map our electrophysiological data to the anatomical subdivisions of the amygdala in this experiment, we used the IBL's electrophysiology alignment GUI (https://github.com/int-brain-lab/iblapps/wiki) to manually tune the alignment of each recording to the Allen CCF using electrophysiological landmarks. We then z scored each neuron's 10-ms binned spiking across the entire 10-min CGRP neuron stimulation period. We then generated PETHs surrounding CGRP neuron stimulation trains (–1 s to +2 s), and subtracted the baseline (–1 s to 0 s) mean of each neuron's PETH (Extended Data Fig. 5c). We then used the built-in Matlab fitgmdist function (CovarianceType=‘diagonal', RegularizationValue=1e-5, SharedCovariance=false, Replicates=100) to fit a GMM with four response types to this dataset. Specifically, we used the time bins during stimulation (0 s to +1 s) from all amygdala neurons to generate a 3,524 neuron × 100 time bin input matrix for GMM fitting. This GMM revealed two CGRP neuron stimulation-activated response types (shown in green in Extended Data Fig. 5c, left), one CGRP neuron stimulation-inhibited response type (shown in purple) and one unmodulated response type (shown in grey). We then plotted average CGRP neuron stimulation PETHs for each response type separately (Extended Data Fig. 5c, right) and analysed the distribution of CGRP neuron stimulation-activated neurons across amygdala regions (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e).

We recorded CGRP neuron GCaMP signals (Fig. 2b) with standard fibre photometry acquisition hardware99,100. Excitation light was supplied at two wavelengths—isosbestic 405 nm (intensity at patch cable tip, 5–10 µW; sinusoidal frequency modulation, 531 Hz) and activity-dependent 488 nm (intensity, 15–25 µW; sinusoidal frequency modulation, 211 Hz)—using an LED driver (Thorlabs, DC4104) coupled to a low-autofluorescence patch cable (Doric, MFP_400/430/1100-0.57_ 0.45m_FCM-MF2.5_LAF). Emission light was collected through the same patch cable using a low-light photoreceiver (Newport Femtowatt 215) and then digitized using a base processor (Tucker Davis Technologies, RZ5D) that served both as an analog-to-digital converter and a lock-in amplifier. We then low-pass filtered (2 Hz) and downsampled (100 Hz) the isosbestic 405 nm and activity-dependent 488 nm signals. To control for photobleaching, we applied a linear fit to the isosbestic signal to align it to the activity-dependent signal and then subtracted this fitted isosbestic signal from the activity-dependent signal to obtain the final de-bleached activity-dependent GCaMP signal.

To assess changes in CGRP neuron activity due to LiCl-induced malaise, we generated PETHs using the 10 min before and 30 min after LiCl injection (125 mg kg–1 i.p.). We z scored the entire PETH for each mouse using the mean and s.d. of the full 10 min before LiCl injection and then downsampled (1 Hz) and smoothed (1-min centred moving average) the final normalized PETHs for plotting.

We recorded CEA AKAR2 signals (Fig. 5) using the same acquisition system described above for GCaMP recordings. We low-pass filtered (1 Hz) and downsampled (100 Hz) both the 405 nm and 488 nm signals. Because AKAR2 is a ratiometric indicator of PKA activity47, we divided the 488 nm signal by the 405 nm signal to obtain the final de-bleached activity-dependent PKA signal.

This experiment was run on four consecutive days using a version of the two-reward familiarization paradigm described above (Fig. 5b). On day 0 (water day), both ports contained water. On day 1 (novel day), one port (port A) contained the novel sweetened grape Kool-Aid flavour and the other port (port B) contained water. On days 2 and 3 (familiar days), the same ports contained the same sweetened grape Kool-Aid flavour and water as on day 1. The flavour port was counterbalanced across mice.

We generated PETHs surrounding reward delivery (–10 s to +30 s) using the final PKA signal described above. We z scored these PETHs separately for each mouse and day using the following procedure. First, we centred each individual reward event PETH by subtracting the mean baseline signal (–5 to –1 s before reward delivery). Then we concatenated this baseline epoch from all individual reward events from both ports for that mouse per day and calculated the s.d. of this vector. Then we divided each individual reward event PETH for that mouse per day by the calculated s.d. Last, we averaged across all rewards of each type (port A, port B) for that mouse per day (Fig. 5d,e).

To quantify PKA activity for statistical analysis, we calculated the average response from +5 to +15 s after reward delivery for each mouse per day per port using the final averaged PETHs calculated above. We then fit a GLMM using the R package glmmTMB69 (https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB; v.1.1.7) with a Gaussian link function and the formula:

where PKA activity is as described above, Port (port A, port B) and Day (day 0, day 1, day 2, day 3) are fixed-effect categorical variables, (1|Subject) is a random effect for each mouse and the asterisk represents the main effects and interactions. Using the coefficients from this GLMM, we used the R package marginaleffects70 (https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/marginaleffects; v.0.12.0) to calculate the marginal effect of port (port A – port B) on each day. We used the marginal effect estimates and s.e. values to calculate a P value for each day with a z test, and then corrected for multiple comparisons across days using the Hochberg–Bonferroni procedure71 (Fig. 5f).

The recording location for each animal was determined using the same procedure as for our Neuropixels recordings described above. In brief, we manually annotated the tip of the optical fibre lesion for each animal in the light-sheet microscopy imaging data after registration to the Allen CCF and visualized these recording locations on the Allen CCF (Fig. 5g) as 100 µm circles centred on the fibre tip location for each animal.

We excluded data in three instances. First, we excluded one mouse with no hM3D(Gq)–mCherry expression and one mouse with no YFP expression in the LS from Extended Data Fig. 2b. Second, we excluded one mouse with no eOPN3–mScarlet expression in the CEA from Fig. 2f. Third, we excluded confocal images with poor FISH labelling (defined as <35 total Fos+ CEA cells, or <25% of Fos+ cells also Sst+, or <25% of Fos+ cells also Prkcd+, or <25% of Fos+ cells also Calcrl+) from Fig. 2m,n (22 out of 109 images).

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. Sample sizes were chosen based on previous studies investigating CTA and CGRP neurons (for example, refs. 23,24,34) and on the availability of animals. All attempts at replication were successful. Most experiments were replicated in multiple independent groups of animals with all experimental groups present in each cohort. We used multiple independent experimental approaches, and multiple independent analyses within each experiment, to confirm our findings whenever possible. For experiments with multiple groups, individual animals or entire cages were randomly assigned to a group either at the time of surgery or at the beginning of behavioural testing (for animals that did not require surgery) with the constraint of balancing sex across groups. Automated analyses and automated experimental hardware and software, without manual intervention, were used whenever possible. Experimenters were not blinded to the group assignments of the animals. Statistical tests and data analyses were performed in Matlab (R2021a), Python (3.8.10) and R (4.2.1) as described above. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001 throughout the article. Individual data points are shown when practical (and always for n ≤ 10), and box plots show the data distribution for larger sample sizes. Sample sizes, statistical tests, multiple comparisons corrections, exact P values, error bars, shaded areas and box plots are defined in the figure captions, Methods and Supplementary Table 2.

Metrics details

There is active crosstalk between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment during metastatic progression, a process that is significantly affected by obesity, particularly in breast cancer. Here we analyze the impact of a high fat diet (HFD) on metastasis, focusing on the role of platelets in the formation of premetastatic niches (PMNs). We find that a HFD provokes pre-activation of platelets and endothelial cells, promoting the formation of PMNs in the lung. These niches are characterized by increased vascular leakiness, platelet activation and overexpression of fibronectin in both platelets and endothelial cells. A HFD promotes interactions between platelets, tumor cells and endothelial cells within PMNs, enhancing tumor cell homing and metastasis. Importantly, therapeutic interventions like anti-platelet antibody administration or a dietary switch reduce metastatic cell homing and outgrowth. Moreover, blocking fibronectin reduces the interaction of tumor cells with endothelial cells. Importantly, when coagulation parameters prior to neoadjuvant treatment are considered, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) female patients with reduced Partial Thromboplastin time (aPTT) had a significantly shorter time to relapse. These findings highlight how diet and platelet activation in pre-metastatic niches affect tumor cell homing and metastasis, suggesting potential therapeutic interventions and prognostic markers for TNBC patients.

Metastasis is a complex process in which cancer cells must adapt to the diverse microenvironments they encounter as they disseminate to distant tissues1,2. In recent decades, it has become clear that tumor cell metastasis depends both on intrinsic alterations to tumor cells and extrinsic effects of the tumor microenvironment (TME)3. For example, it is known that obesity contributes to the progression of several cancer types, including endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic, colon and breast cancers (BCs)4,5. In addition, obesity is correlated to poor outcomes of BC in postmenopausal women6 and in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients7. As well as affecting primary BC tumor growth, obesity enhances the metastasis of these cells to the lungs in a manner that is dependent on neutrophils8,9, involving vascular dysfunction and increased endothelial transmigration of the tumor cells10. Moreover, obesity also induces chronic inflammation, while enhancing pro-thrombotic signaling in both platelets and endothelial cells11,12, and promoting a state of hypercoagulability in cancer patients13. Notably, exacerbated coagulation is related to worse patient survival in a variety of tumor types, underscoring the pro-metastatic role of platelets14.

Platelets have been implicated in tumor progression through several mechanisms, as they can interact with different cell types like leukocytes, or stromal, endothelial and cancer cells15,16. Indeed, platelets surrounding circulating tumor cells play an important role in tumor cell survival and metastasis, impeding their recognition by immune cells17,18,19. Hence, defining the precise mechanisms involved in the tumor-platelet-endothelial cell interactions is of particular interest. Platelets have also been implicated in the early metastatic dissemination of colon cancer and melanoma20,21. Upon activation, platelets release growth factors, cytokines and extracellular vesicles that help remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) and that are involved in the recruitment of other cells to the metastatic organs20,21. However, the precise influence of extrinsic factors like a high fat diet (HFD) on platelet activation and the formation of pre-metastatic niches (PMNs)22 remains unclear and warrants further investigation.

Here we show that a HFD promotes the generation of PMNs in distal organs, aiding metastatic cell homing. Our data demonstrate that a HFD contributes to platelet activation, and that it enhances vascular permeability and fibronectin (FN) overexpression in the lungs. Moreover, we find that adipose tissue in HFD-fed mice secretes high levels of TNF-α, which leads to increased FN levels and its subsequent accumulation in platelets. Notably, platelets from HFD-fed mice exhibit greater interactions with tumor cells within PMNs, reinforcing the tumor-endothelial-platelet cell axis. Furthermore, a HFD exacerbates tumor cell homing and metastasis, yet only in highly-metastatic BC models, suggesting that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors are crucial for metastatic success. Our results suggest that therapeutic interventions, such as anti-platelet antibody administration or dietary modifications, reduce metastatic cell homing and outgrowth, underscoring the potential of dietary and platelet-modulating strategies in influencing disease outcomes. Additionally, blocking FN reduces platelet-mediated interactions between tumor cells and endothelial cells, highlighting its pivotal role in this process. Finally, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, we observe a correlation between the body mass index (BMI) and higher pro-coagulant activity. Patients with a shorter activated Partial Thromboplastin time (aPTT) show increased risk and lower survival rates over three years post-treatment, suggesting a short aPTT as a risk factor in TNBC prior to surgery. Collectively, our findings reveal the impact of HFD on platelet activation, PMN formation, and metastasis in TNBC, offering potential therapeutic targets and prognostic markers for cancer management.

In this study, a diet-induced obesity (DIO) model was chosen to assess how a HFD might affect PMN formation in pre-metastatic lungs (Suppl. Figure 1A), initially verifying that the HFD produced a weight gain in these mice over the 12week study period (Suppl. Figure 1B-E). The impact of the HFD on platelet activation was assessed and since platelet activation results in dense granule secretion and a conformational change of integrin αIIbβ323,24, these parameters were analyzed in mice by flow cytometry using anti-GPIIb/IIIa (JON/A) and anti-P-selectin (CD62P) antibodies (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the platelets from HFD mice were more susceptible to activation by exposure to thrombin for 5 or 15 minutes relative to those from ND mice (Fig. 1A, B). In terms of dense granule secretion in response to thrombin stimulation, ATP luminometry revealed a significant increase in such release by platelets from HFD mice relative to those from ND mice (Fig. 1C). Since fibrinogen (Fg) binding to platelets promotes their spreading, an important step in the amplification process25, we analyzed this phenomenon in mice. Enhanced Fg adhesion was evident in platelets from HFD mice (Fig. 1D), coupled to significantly accelerated spreading (Fig. 1E-G). There was a particular enrichment in the filopodial (Fp, red bars, Fig. 1G) and spread phenotypes (Sp, green bars, Fig. 1G), for which cytoskeletal reorganization is crucial. Moreover, the HFD exacerbated platelet aggregation (Fig. 1 H), demonstrating that a HFD promotes both platelet activation and aggregation.

H Analysis of platelet aggregation in ND and HFD mice, assessing their response to thrombin (0.01 IU/ml). 3 independent experiments: ND n = 9, HFD n = 10 mice. I-M) Western blots of (I) phospho Src/Src, J phospho PKC/Actin, K phospho AKT/AKT, L phospho FAK/FAK and (M) phospho Talin/Talin in platelets isolated from ND (Upper panels) or HFD (Lower panels) mice, untreated (0) or activated with thrombin for the times indicated. The data corresponds to 3 independent experiments: ND n = 9, and HFD n = 10. All the data represent the mean ± s.d. and the P values were calculated two-way ANOVA (C, D, H) or with a two-tailed Student's t-test (B, G).

To gain further insights into the mechanisms driving platelet activation and aggregation in response to thrombin, signaling activation in platelets from ND and HFD mice was analyzed at different time points after treatment (Fig. 1I–M, Suppl. Figures 1F–J). Platelets from HFD mice displayed sustained Src phosphorylation (Fig. 1I, Suppl. Figure 1F), which is essential to initiate and propagate signals from αIIbβ3 through the “inside-out” signaling pathway26,27. A similar effect was observed on protein kinase C (PKC: Fig. 1J, Suppl. Figure 1G), which has been shown to play a major role in inducing platelet granule secretion28,29. Moreover, at later times there was enhanced AKT phosphorylation ((Fig. 1K, Suppl. Figure 1H), previously implicated in α-granule secretion30), FAK (Fig. 1L, Suppl. Figure 1I) and Talin (Fig. 1M, Suppl. Figure 1J), both Src substrates involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal reorganization in platelets31.

In the light of all these data, our results suggest that a HFD promotes the activation of integrin αIIbβ3 through the ‘inside-out' signaling pathway, followed by ‘outside-in' downstream signaling32,33 that leads to platelet activation, cytoskeletal reorganization and platelet spreading.

Platelets have been implicated in early metastasis in mice20, yet the impact of platelets and a HFD on PMN formation has been little explored. To assess the effect of HFD on PMN formation, platelet recruitment to the lungs of mice was analyzed. Interestingly, significantly enhanced P-selectin expression was evident in the lungs of HFD mice relative to the controls (Fig. 2A, B), showing a higher presence of platelets in the metastatic organs of HFD mice. Since obesity-associated inflammation is involved in endothelial cell disfunction34, we also studied the impact of a HFD on lung endothelial cell leakiness. Vascular leakiness was assessed by injecting fluorescent dextran into HFD or ND mice, which underwent greater extravasation in the former (Fig. 2C, D). Whether this leakiness was due to high adiposity, or the diet itself was explored in ob/ob mice35,36. These ob/ob mice also exhibited significantly enhanced vascular permeability in the lungs relative to wild type (WT) mice (Suppl. Figures 2A, 2B), demonstrating the increase in vascular leakiness regardless of the model assessed.

Values are shown in box‐and‐whisker plots where the line in the box corresponds to the mean. Boxes extend from the minimum to the maximum value.

We next explored the impact of the HFD on lung endothelial cells by analyzing gene expression in CD45−CD31+ lung endothelial cells isolated from the mice by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) (Suppl. Figure 2C, Suppl. Data 1). A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified signatures of enrichment related to the inflammatory response, cell adhesion and hemostasis, amongst other gene pathways (Suppl. Figure 2D, Suppl. Data 1). We found that three of the top ten pathways were enriched in genes related to cell adhesion (Jam2, Ocln, Dsp, Panx1), inflammatory responses (Ikbkb, Tlr3, Cmip) and hemostasis (Plaur, Plat, Fn1) (Suppl. Figure 2D, Table 1). To identify common pathways affected in both platelets and endothelial cells isolated from HFD mice we integrated the RNA expression data from endothelial cells and the proteomic analyzes of platelets-derived from mice fed with either diet (Fig. 2F). Out of 2916 candidate genes modulated, we identified 6 that were upregulated in both endothelial cells and platelets from HFD mice, with a FDR < 0.05 (Fig. 2F). Among these, fibronectin (FN) attracted our attention since it was previously associated with lung PMN formation37.

Immunohistochemical staining revealed FN to be significantly overexpressed in the lungs of HFD mice (Fig. 2G, H). To determine the origin of this FN expression, the lungs of mice perfused intracardially with PBS and non-perfused lungs were analyzed in Western blots (Fig. 2I). A significantly enhanced FN expression was detected in non-perfused whole lung tissues (Fig. 2J), suggesting an increase in blood circulation. We next analyzed FN expression in plasma and platelets isolated from the blood of ND and HFD mice (Fig. 2K, L) and while there were no differences in the FN in plasma (Fig. 2M), a significant increase in FN was evident in platelets reflecting its upregulation (Fig. 2N).

To assess the expression of FN in HFD-induced PMNs, we examined lung sections from our DIO model by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Suppl. Figure 2E). We analyzed FN co-expression with P-selectin (platelets) and CD31 (endothelial cells). We found that its expression was elevated in platelet aggregates (Suppl. Figure 2F), exhibiting a higher fluorescence intensity within the lungs of HFD mice (Suppl. Figure 2G). Conversely, there was negligible co-expression in the lungs of ND mice and as expected, there were almost no platelet aggregates in the lungs of these mice (Suppl. Figure 2E), indicative of specific co-expression and deposition of FN in platelet aggregates (P-selectin+ areas) in HFD mice. Furthermore, there was only a marginal and non-significant increase in FN staining of endothelial cells (CD31+, Suppl. Figure 2H), demonstrating that platelets are the primary source of FN in the lungs of HFD mice reflecting their activation at PMNs.

Since thrombus formation has been proposed to facilitate fibrinogen and fibronectin internalization in other contexts38, we investigated whether platelets from ND- and HFD-fed mice differ in their ability to bind and internalize FN. To do this, platelets isolated from both groups were incubated with FITC-FN and then fixed before and after the addition of trypan blue to distinguish between FN binding and internalization, respectively. Our results revealed that platelets from HFD-fed mice displayed a increassed capacity to both bind and internalize FN (Fig. 2O, P, Q) compared with those from ND-fed mice.

To identify potential factors involved in this mechanism, we analyzed the expression of cytokines in adipose tissue and platelets from HFD-fed mice compared to ND-fed mice. Our analysis revealed that several factors, including TNF-α, CCL3, Thrombopoietin, Angiopoietin-1, TIM-1, IL-22, Leptin, among others were significantly elevated in both conditions (Suppl. Figure 2I). Given the crucial role of TNF-α in obesity39, we further investigated its effect on FN production by platelets. Interestingly, we observed that the treatment significantly increased FN levels in platelets, reaching levels comparable to those observed in platelets from HFD-fed mice (Suppl. Figure 2J, K).

To evaluate the impact of a HFD on spontaneous BC metastasis, EO771 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of DIO mice and analyzed 22 days after injection. Primary tumor growth increased in the HFD mice (Fig. 3A) and when tumor cells were stained for p5340, a 3.17-fold increase in lung metastasis was detected (Fig. 3B, C). Moreover, among these metastases 69.3% existed as individual cells (Fig. 3C). To mitigate the potential impact of variations in primary tumor size on spontaneous metastasis, we compared the metastases in mice with similar tumor sizes on day 14 (Fig. 3D) when there were 4.7-fold more metastases in the lung of HFD mice (Fig. 3E, F). Interestingly, among these metastases 64.9% were individual cells (Fig. 3F), suggesting that the HFD specifically enhanced tumor cell homing and early adhesion.

Lesions were binned and analyzed as in (C), corresponding to 3 independent experiments: n = 15 mice per group. All data represent the mean ± s.d., and the P values were calculated by two-way ANOVA in (A) and with a two-tailed Student's t-test in C, F, I, and Mann-Whitney test in (K). Values are shown in box‐and‐whisker plots where the line in the box corresponds to the mean. Boxes extend from the minimum to the maximum value.

To assess how a HFD influences tumor homing, EO771-GFP-luciferase cells were injected into the tail vein of ND and HFD mice and mice were sacrificed after one hour (See Fig. 3G for a scheme of tumor cell homing assays). Remarkably, the HFD significantly enhanced tumor cell homing to the lungs (Fig. 3H-I). These findings were consistent when three additional murine BC models were assessed (Py230-Luc, Py8119-Luc and AT3-Luc: Suppl. Figure 3A–C). Tumor cell homing was also analyzed in ob/ob mice to determine whether this effect was influenced by high adiposity or the diet, and as no significant differences in tumor cell homing were observed in the lungs (Suppl. Figure 3D), it appears that this phenomenon is only affected by the HFD.

The impact of HFD on tumor cell metastasis was further investigated in the highly metastatic EO771 model, analyzing lung metastasis at early (12 days post injection –p.i.) and late (3 weeks p.i.) time points. The HFD enhanced metastasis at the early time point (Fig. 3J, Supp. Figure 3E), when the metastases were predominantly detected as single cells (2.2-fold change), followed by small metastases (2.8-fold change), micrometastases (1.5-fold change) and macrometastases (1.5-fold change: Fig. 3K). This effect was particularly prominent at the later time points (Suppl. Figure 3F–H). Similarly, with the Py8119-luc model an 11-fold increase in experimental metastasis was evident in the lungs of HFD compared to ND mice (Suppl. Figure 3I). By contrast, the HFD did not increase metastasis when the low metastatic AT3 model was assessed (Suppl. Figure 3J), suggesting that both intrinsic and extrinsic changes influence metastatic spread.

The pro-metastatic effects of platelets have traditionally been attributed to their ability to promote tumor cell adhesion or survival21, leading us to study the influence of a HFD on platelet and tumor cell interactions with endothelial cells. Platelets derived from HFD models adhered more to EO771 tumor cells than platelets derived from ND mice (Fig. 4A, B), as they also did to the low metastatic model AT3 cells (Suppl. Figure 4A, B). We next examined whether platelets from HFD-fed and ND-fed mice differ in their shape upon contact with tumor cells, as platelet morphology provides valuable insights into their activation potential. Our findings revealed that activated platelets from HFD-fed mice displayed an increased number of aggregating platelets, characterized by numerous membrane extensions and the formation of larger aggregates as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 4C, D).

Values are shown in box‐and‐whisker plots where the line in the box corresponds to the mean. Boxes extend from the minimum to the maximum value.

To determine if the enhanced tumor-platelet interaction also influences their interaction with endothelial cells, tumor-platelet-endothelial interactions were assayed in chambers coated with a monolayer of HUVECs (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: Fig. 4E). Platelets from HFD mice adhered more to endothelial cells (Fig. 4F) and tumor cells (Fig. 4G), and interestingly, transwell trans-endothelial migration (TEM) assays revealed that platelets from obese mice migrated more efficiently than those from lean mice when injected with Py230 or EO771 cells (Suppl. Figure 4C).

To study the effect of a HFD on platelet-tumor interactions in vivo, high-resolution intravital imaging of EO771GFP tumor cells injected into the tail vein was carried out on the lung of HFD or ND mice. The area covered by platelets surrounding the tumor cells was measured in vivo (see Suppl. Figure 4D–E for a scheme), indicating that platelets were recruited around tumor cells in the lungs of mice as early as 1 minute after tumor cell injection in both ND and HFD mice (Suppl. Figure 4F–G and Video 1). Tumor-platelet aggregation 30 minutes after injection reflected how platelets from HFD mice interacted more efficiently with tumor cells in PMNs than those from ND mice (Fig. 4H–I).

The enhanced FN expression by platelets and endothelial cells induced by a HFD suggests that FN might modulate tumor-endothelial-platelet interactions. Hence, FN expression by endothelial cells exposed to platelets from ND and HFD mice was assessed by immunofluorescence, with FN and CD41 staining highlighting the upregulation of FN expression (Fig. 4J, green channel) and the enhanced interaction of platelets from HFD mice with endothelial cells (Fig. 4J, red channel). Platelets from HFD mice induced stronger FN expression in fibers surrounding endothelial cells (Fig. 4J panel inset, lower panels), whereas no fibers were observed with platelets from ND mice, when FN was poorly organized (Fig. 4J panel inset, upper panels) a significant increase in cortical FN was evident in endothelial cells treated with platelets from HFD mice relative to those from ND mice (Fig. 4K).

Since FN is known to be involved in intracellular signaling in endothelial cells41,42,43, we assessed the activity of the main downstream pathways implicated in regulating cell adhesion, cytoskeletal reorganization and endothelial permeability, through the effectors Src and Talin. Talin and Src appeared to be activated in endothelial cells after their interaction with platelets from HFD mice44 (Fig. 4L). Whether the effect on endothelial cell adhesion was dependent on HFD-induced FN was assessed in a tumor-endothelial adhesion assay using platelets from HFD-fed mice in the presence or absence of FN-neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 4M). Adhesion of EO771 cells to HUVECs in the presence of blocking antibodies was reduced by 61% relative to that of HUVECs preconditioned with platelets from HFD mice (Figs. 4M, N), suggesting that FN is involved in the adhesion of tumor cells to endothelial cells promoted by platelets from HFD-fed mice.

It is known that integrin α5β1 is the primary FN receptor responsible for cell migration and adhesion45,46. Integrin α5β1-FN interactions are of particular interest since they contribute to cancer metastasis, as witnessed by its upregulation in invasive cancer cells47,48,49. Both subunits of this receptor were expressed in our BC cell models, with particularly high levels in the highly metastatic EO771 cells (Suppl. Figure 5A). To demonstrate the relevance of this integrin interaction, we blocked integrin α5 expression in EO771 cells (Suppl. Figure 5B) and performed tumor homing assays (Fig. 4O). The absence of integrin α5 significantly dampened metastatic cell homing (Fig. 4P), highlighting the significance of this integrin in tumor cell homing to PMNs in HFD mice.

We next investigated whether the effects of a HFD were reversible by subjecting mice to a “diet resting” protocol (S.Diet) in which mice were fed for 12 weeks with a HFD and then switched them to a ND (Switch-diet) for 7 days (Suppl. Figure 5C). We first verified that mice experienced a significant average weight loss of 10% after switching diet (Suppl. Figure 5D) and subsequently, this switch was seen to dampen the activation of platelets, as witnessed by the weaker expression of activated integrin αIIbβ3 and P-Selectin in platelets from the S.Diet mice (Fig. 5A, B). Consistent with the earlier observations, platelet aggregation was also significantly reduced after switching diet (Fig. 5C). The expression of FN in the plasma and platelets of all the mice was assessed (Fig. 5D–F) and interestingly, FN expression returned to normal in platelets (Fig. 5F) after the resting period (S.Diet) while that in the plasma remained relatively constant (Fig. 5E). We also analyzed the impact of the S.Diet on the adhesive properties of tumor cells to platelet-activated endothelium in vitro (Fig. 5G). As observed previously, the HFD heightened the platelet-endothelial interaction, while in mice that underwent S.Diet, the platelet endothelial interaction was dampened relative to HFD mice (Fig. 5H). Importantly, the normalization of these interactions by switching diet also significantly reduced the adhesion of EO771 tumor cells to endothelial cells (Fig. 5I). Overall, the S.Diet positively influenced mice by reducing platelet activation/aggregation, restoring the FN levels in platelets and normalizing the interaction with endothelial cells, reducing their adhesion to tumor cells.

All the data represent mean ± s.d., and P values were calculated by two-tailed Student's t-test in (B, K, L, M) one-way ANOVA in (E, F, H, I,) and two-way ANOVA in (C). Values are shown in box‐and‐whisker plots where the line in the box corresponds to the mean. Boxes extend from the minimum to the maximum value.

The dietary switch might modify the signaling pathways downstream of FN in endothelial cells, specifically those involving Src and Talin41,50. Indeed, the S.Diet significantly dampened FN expression in endothelial cells (Fig. 5J, K), in conjunction with a reduction in Src activation (Fig. 5J, L). We also observed weaker talin activation, albeit not significantly (Fig. 5J, M). Based on these findings, diet appears to modulate both the activation and aggregation of platelets, changes concomitant with a normalization of FN expression in platelets, limiting the interaction of these cells with tumor and endothelial cells, and the ensuing downregulation of downstream signaling pathways.

We next investigated whether a dietary switch could affect tumor cell homing 1 hour after injection of tumor cells. We observed tumor cell homing was enhanced in the HFD mice (Fig. 6A, B), although it was significantly reversed after a dietary switch (Fig. 6A, B). We also examined the impact of the S.Diet on lung vascular leakiness and while the HFD significantly increased vascular leakiness (Fig. 6C, D), dextran leakiness tended to revert in the S.Diet mice, albeit not significantly (Fig. 6C, D). Hence, while diet may modulate platelet activation and tumor cell homing, endothelial cell function did not appear to be completely restored by dietary switching. This data suggests that tumor cell homing is mainly affected by platelet activation rather than vascular permeability. In addition, we analyzed the effect of diet switching on experimental metastasis by examining lung metastases. Notably, the dietary change led to a significant reduction in tumor cell metastasis within one week (Fig. 6E, F), indicating that diet switch dampens platelet activation and thereby affects both tumor cell homing and metastasis.

Boxes extend from the minimum to the maximum value.

To analyze the relevance of platelets in tumor cell homing after HFD-induced PMN formation, we depleted platelets in HFD mice prior to the injection of tumor cells using anti-GPIbα (R300) antibodies51 (Suppl. Figure 5E). Mice received a single R300 injection 48 hours before that of the tumor cells, inducing a window of platelet depletion just when tumor cells home to the PMNs. After verifying platelet depletion, tumor cells were injected into the tail vein and tumor cell homing was analyzed 1 hour later (Supp. Figure 5E). Platelet depletion promoted a significant decrease in tumor cell homing in HFD and in ND mice (Fig. 6G, H), although the reduction was not significant in the latter. The effect of platelet depletion 48 hours before tumor cell injection on experimental metastasis assays in HFD mice was also analyzed in the lungs after 21 days (Fig. 6I–J). Importantly, the R300 antibody not only dampened tumor cell homing but also metastasis in HFD mice, yet not in the ND mice (Fig. 6J). Hence, platelets appear to be crucial to promote tumor cell interactions at PMNs. The activation of platelets in these niches by a HFD can be reversed by a dietary switch or platelet depletion during PMN formation, offering potential therapeutic strategies to reduce tumor cell homing to PMNs.

Since a HFD appears to promote platelet activation and aggregation, a HFD and increased BMI might also affect the coagulation profile in this model. Thus, the blood coagulation profile was analyzed in ND and HFD mice, measuring the Prothrombin Time (PT: Fig. 7A), Partial Thromboplastin time (aPTT:Fig. 7B), Thrombin Time (TT: Fig. 7C) and Fibrinogen (Fg:Fig. 7D) in the DIO model. Of all the parameters analyzed, the aPTT was significantly reduced in HFD mice (Fig. 7B).

A PT values measured in ND, and HFD mice. 10 independent experiments: ND n = 36, HFD n = 37 mice. B aPTT values measured in ND, and HFD mice. 9 independent experiments: ND n = 29, HFD n = 29 mice. C TT values measured in ND, and HFD mice. 5 independent experiments: ND n = 14, HFD n = 20 mice. D Fibrinogen values measured in ND, and HFD mice. 6 independent experiments: ND n = 28, HFD n = 29 mice. All data is expressed as the mean ± s.d and P values were calculated with two-tailed Student's t-test in (A, B, C and Mann-Whitney test in D). E Plot of BMI vs aPTT values among TNBC patients. Patients with BMI < 25 were categorized as normal weight and patients with BMI > 25 were categorized as overweight or obese. BMI > 25 is a positively correlated with a lower aPTT (correlation coefficient r = 0.08824, **p = 0.0083- analyzed by simple linear regression test). The red solid line is the fitted regression line, and the green shaded area corresponds to a range of standard aPTT values. The Kaplan–Meier survivor functions according to (F) aPTT, G PT, H INR and I Fibrinogen levels in patients. Log-rank tests between a normal aPTT and a shorter aPTT, PT and INR are shown (lowest quartile), and for fibrinogen the log-rank test is between normal and higher values (highest quartile are shown).

Based on our hypothesis and the association between a high BMI, pro-thrombotic risk and cancer4, we analyzed the potential association of BMI and coagulation parameters with disease outcomes in patients with TNBC. TNBC has an elevated risk of metastatic disease development and lower survival rates than hormone-positive BC52. Moreover, being overweight is associated with a shorter disease-free and overall survival time among TNBC patients7. Hence, the correlation of BMI and different coagulation parameters before surgery with disease outcome was analyzed in a cohort of 82 early TNBC patients treated, with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. The PT, aPTT, INR (International Normalized Ratio), Fg and platelet counts were evaluated in TNBC patients prior to surgery, examining the correlation between these parameters and the BMI. The BMI was inversely correlated with a reduced aPTT, albeit moderately (Fig. 7E), whereas no significant correlation was observed between the BMI and platelet count, platelet volume, total Fg or the INR.

Further analysis of these parameters relative to disease outcome demonstrated that patients with the shortest aPTT (1st Quartile - Q1) experienced a significantly shorter time to relapse (estimated mean time to relapse of 8.5 years) than other patients (11.9 years, P = 0.0014: Fig. 7F). However, a multivariate analysis did not reveal any further correlations of BMI with disease outcome or among the other parameters that were related to higher coagulation profile (Fig. 7G–I): PT, p = 0.568; INR, p = 0.789; or Fg, p = 0.135. Overall, these data suggest that although BMI was inversely correlated with a shorter aPTT, only a shorter aPTT could be considered as an independent additional risk factor of disease progression in TNBC patients prior to neoadjuvant treatment and surgery.

There is considerable experimental evidence that platelets influence metastasis17,18,19,21,53 and early metastatic dissemination20,21, therefore this study set out to assess the influence of additional systemic cancer risk factors in platelet-driven BC metastasis, in particular that of a HFD. The data obtained suggest that a HFD increases the activation, adhesion and the aggregation of platelets in circulation, and in the lungs of mice, leading to hypercoagulation.

Obesity is known to promote prothrombotic signaling in relation to platelet activation and hypercoagulability54,55. Our findings reveal that Src and Talin are activated in platelets obtained from HFD mice, and in endothelial cells exposed to platelets from these mice. Interestingly, the activation of Src is involved in the activation of platelets56 and endothelial cells57, promoting the recruitment of several proteins like Talin and integrins58, the latter serving as receptors for ECM molecules like FN59. Moreover, it is worth noting that prolonged Src activation has been implicated in disrupting barrier permeability57. Hence, these findings support a model in which a HFD induces Src hyperactivation and Talin expression in both platelets and endothelial cells, leading to increased vascular permeability and platelet activation, and enhancing tumor cell interactions through the upregulation of FN. Furthermore, our data also suggests that platelets from HFD mice exhibited prolonged phosphorylation, both inside-out and outside-in, producing elevated levels of pSrc and pPKC. By contrast, Src is partially inactivated in the inside-out pathway in platelets from ND mice, and activated again in the outside-in pathway, whereas Src exhibited constant activation in platelets from HFD mice. Src phosphorylation can induce filopodia and lamellipodia formation during platelet spreading by mediating calcium signaling and PKC activity60, while PKC and AKT are important regulators of platelet granule secretion28,29,30,61. The data obtained here suggests the pre-activation of inside-out signaling pathways in HFD mice, and more rapid outside-in signaling upon stimulation. It is worth noting that this type of activation has been associated with adhesion to the vascular wall and platelet aggregation62.

In addition to platelet activation and aggregation, the HFD increased vascular leakiness, modulating the expression of genes associated with cell adhesion and platelet activation, and endothelial cell damage63,64. These results are consistent with studies indicating that vascular injury leads to a shift in the endothelium from an anticoagulant to a procoagulant phenotype, resulting in the exposure of fibers and other endothelial matrix proteins65,66. Indeed, studies have shown that obesity enhances vascular leakiness, thereby promoting BC extravasation67. Our data suggests that systemic changes induced by HFD could affect the generation of PMNs, changes that influence vascular leakiness, platelet activation and ECM remodeling, favoring tumor cell homing and metastasis. Interestingly, similar changes have been proposed as hallmarks of PMN formation by primary tumors22, suggesting that they may be shared between these microenvironments.

We identified FN as a key molecule upregulated in endothelial cells and activated platelets in the lungs, both in vitro and in vivo. There are two forms of FN, plasma FN (pFN) that lacks extra EDA and EDB segments, and tissue cellular FN (cFN) that is synthesized by many cell types (e.g., fibroblasts, endothelial cells, platelets and monocytes) and that bears varying proportions of EDA and EDB segments68. Both forms of FN can be incorporated into the fibrillar network of the ECM68. Of these, pFN supports hemostasis and regulates thrombosis69, while cFN is implicated in efficient adhesion, activation and aggregation of platelets, promoting inflammation and thrombosis70,71,72. We found that the overexpression of FN in platelets induced by a HFD is crucial in regulating the interaction between platelets, endothelial and BC cells.

Moreover, FN plays a critical role in PMN formation37 and lung metastasis73. Interestingly, cFN levels are significantly elevated in the plasma of patients with thromboembolism or diabetes74 and they are positively correlated with the BMI75. The results here support the notion that platelets play a crucial role for successful vascular retention and metastatic outgrowth, consistent with an effect of HFD on platelets that enriches FN, influencing tumor cell homing and metastasis. These observations are supported by previous studies on FN-EDA KO mice administered a HFD, which exhibit reduced thromboembolism relative to WT mice on the same diet. Hence, FN appears to promote thromboembolism in the context of DIO75. Interestingly, an ECM rich in FN primes endothelial cells for activation in response to oxidized low-density lipoprotein76 and hyperglycemia77. Furthermore, atheroprone shear stress has been implicated in the upregulation of FN expression creating a positive feedback loop that sustains endothelial cell inflammation78. A HFD appears to promote platelet activation and aggregation at PMNs, concomitant with FN overexpression and deposition at their surface, that interacts with integrin α5β1 receptors on tumor cells. The involvement of integrin α5β1 in tumor cell migration, invasion and metastatic tumor cell homing makes it an attractive therapeutic target47,48,49,79. However, given the complexity of obesity-associated inflammation and BC metastasis8,9,10,80, and the multifaceted role of platelets in PMNs81, the mechanisms driving FN overexpression at PMNs are likely to be multifactorial54. Consistent with previous studies39, we observed that adipose tissue from HFD-fed mice secretes elevated levels of TNF-α. Notably, this factor promoted FN expression and accumulation in platelets, suggesting an additional mechanism underlying FN expression in circulating platelets from HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, given the crucial role of FN in platelet aggregation and activation70,82, our findings support a model in which HFD-induced signaling enhances platelet FN uptake and retention, potentially contributing to the prothrombotic state associated with HFD-fed mice.

It is widely accepted that obesity is associated with a higher incidence of BC, and with increased mortality and metastasis6,7. While several studies have shown that obesity is associated with BC metastasis8,9,80, the impact of platelets in this process has not been thoroughly assessed. Our data demonstrates a distinct role for platelets in the obese microenvironment, primarily influencing tumor cell homing and subsequently impacting later stages of metastasis. We found that the tumor cells in HFD mice have a greater capacity to extravasate and successfully survive as solitary cells in the lung parenchyma when compared to those in ND mice. We also found that platelets from HFD mice adhere more efficiently to both tumor cells and endothelial cells, rapidly binding to these upon their homing to metastatic organs and resulting in the formation of significantly larger aggregates. One possible explanation could be that after they home to the target organ, tumor cells are protected from the action of immune cells (e.g., NK cells) by the surrounding platelets, as suggested elsewhere18. Nevertheless, we did not analyze the implication of immune cells in this system, and the mechanism by which a HFD may lead to platelets favoring individual cell metastasis remains unclear.

Importantly, our findings indicate that the platelets derived from HFD mice interact more strongly with cells from both high and low metastatic TNBC models, although a HFD specifically reinforces single cell homing only in highly metastatic models. Hence, both extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics of the cancer cells appear to play an important role in this process. Notably, platelets engage with cancer cells and form stable aggregates primarily through the expression of P-selectin83,84. Indeed, platelets derived from HFD mice not only exhibit enhanced P-selectin expression but also, their interactions with tumor cells are heightened both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we observed that platelets from HFD-fed mice, aside from being more activated, also exhibited an enhanced spreading phenotype when interacting with tumor cells compared to platelets from ND-fed mice. These findings align with previous studies showing that platelet shape is modified upon contact with tumor cells85 and further demonstrate that platelets from HFD-fed mice display a heightened activation status while on the surface of tumor cells.

Once cancer cells have disseminated, their ability to home to a supportive niche becomes crucial for successful metastasis22. While a HFD appears to influence tumor cell interactions with endothelial cells in mice, the data presented here suggest that dietary intervention can reverse or mitigate certain consequences of a HFD. However, vascular damage appears to be more persistent and may require additional time to recover completely, as indicated elsewhere10. These findings imply that the impact on cell dissemination in HFD mice is probably due to the diet itself rather than solely being a result of high adiposity. Strikingly, the data from the ob/ob mouse model supports the notion that high adiposity induces increased vascular leakiness, regardless of diet.

While several studies suggest that weight loss is associated with improved BC outcomes86, the impact of diet on coagulation and metastasis has been little studied. Remarkably, the dietary switch restored FN levels concomitant with a decrease in lung metastasis. However, it is noteworthy that vascular injury persisted even after weight loss over the period analyzed here, probably due to the systemic effects of inflamed adipose tissue. These data highlight the complex interaction between diet and metastasis, such that vascular leakiness alone is not sufficient to affect tumor cell homing and that further factors are also required, for example platelet activation. It would be interesting to analyze coagulation parameters and clinical outcomes in ongoing clinical studies on dietary intervention in BC as an additional clinical factor.

From a clinical perspective, our study demonstrates that TNBC patients with stronger hypercoagulation have a worse prognosis. Although no direct association with BMI was seen, HFD mice and patients with a higher BMI had shorter aPTTs. Given the role of platelets in hematogenous metastasis, interest has grown in developing drugs that target platelets for anti-tumor therapy. Most of these drugs focus on inhibiting platelet activity and thus, they have the drawback that other platelet functions may be affected87. Our study demonstrates that a dietary switch or depleting platelets reduces metastasis in the lungs of mice on a HFD. Platelet depletion was particularly successful in reducing metastasis that developed on a background of a HFD right before tumor cell homing. Interestingly, aspirin treatment during tumor cell homing, yet not after tumor cell extravasation, reduces lung metastasis by inhibiting the platelet-derived COX-1/thromboxane A2 axis88. It would be interesting to test other anti-platelet drugs, such as inhibitors of αIIbβ3 and selectins in this context since their effect on cancer progression has yet to be evaluated89. Our findings support the effectiveness of anti-platelet therapies in blocking tumor cell homing, particularly in HFD-induced microenvironments. It should be recognized that other anti-coagulant treatments may affect later stages of metastasis, as previously suggested elsewhere75. Indeed, it was recently reported that targeting platelet-specific receptors like glycoprotein VI (GPVI) in mouse models reduces the growth of established metastases85. However, evidence of the effective clinical use of anticoagulant and anti-platelet drugs in obese patients and in the premetastatic setting is limited.

The human studies performed here were all approved previously by the ethics committees from the Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada (protocol approval number CEI: 11/37). The study included one cohort of 82 patients diagnosed with early TNBC between 2012 and 2015, and who were eligible for neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. The diagnosis was based on negative expression of ER/PR (less than 10%) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HER2, either IHC 0-1 or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)-negative if ≥ 2 on IHC (see Suppl. Table 2 for the clinical characteristics of the patients). The PA clinical study protocol was approved to gather their clinical, demographic and blood test data, and all the participating patients signed an informed consent form. The study was carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Institutional Review Board. TNBC was defined as negative ( < 1%) for ER and PR expression, and no amplification of HER2 (result of 0+ or 1+ in an Herceptest or a result of 2+ with negative FISH).

There were no restrictions regarding gender or ethnicity in our protocol; however, the recruited population was primarily Caucasian and Hispanic due to the local demographics.

All the experimentation with mice was first approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees of the CNIO (IACUC-015-2017, IACUC-020-2018, IACUC-017-2022), the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (CBA-19_2017, CBA 01_2019v4, CBA-04_2023v2) and the Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid (PROEX 227/17, PROEX091/19, PROEX77.1/23). The maximum tumor size (1000 mm3) and burden permitted by our ethics committee were not exceeded in the subcutaneous and metastasis models. All the experiments on animals were performed in accordance with the guidelines for ethical conduct in the care and use of animals, as stated in the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research involving Animals and devised by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences.

C57BL/6JolaHsd male and female mice and C57BL/6-Tg (CAG-EGFP) 10 sb/J male (8–12 weeks old: Envigo and Jackson Laboratory) were used in these studies, and they were housed at 21 ± 2 °C with 50–60% humidity, on a13 h light and 11 h dark cycle. For studies on male mice, 8-week-old mice were maintained on either a high-fat (HFD, 60% kcal, Research Diet D12492) or standard (ND, 6.2% Kcal, Envigo 2018S) diet for 12 weeks. For studies on female mice, 8-week-old mice were maintained on either a high-fat (HFD, 60% kcal, Research Diet D12492) or low-fat (LFD, 4% kcal, Envigo 2014) for 20 weeks. The key experiments (i.e., vascular leakiness, tumor cell homing, experimental metastasis, platelet parameter analysis, platelet aggregation analysis) were performed on both sexes of the DIO model and we did not find differences between sexes. Weight was monitored throughout the experiments. At the end-point, animals were either euthanized for coagulation analysis or injected with NIR-dextran (see Permeability assay with NIR-Dextran) or tumor cells (see sections on primary tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis, and experimental metastasis assay). For the dietary switch (HFD/ND-LFD), 8-week-old male or female BL6 mice were fed with a HFD diet until the end of DIO protocol and then switched to the ND or LFD for 1 week prior to sacrifice.

To analyze the effects of adipose tissue, 4-week-old female B6.Cg-Lepob (ob/ob: Jackson Laboratory) mice were maintained on a normal rodent diet (ND: Envigo 2018S). Their weight was monitored over time from 5 weeks of age and the mice were sacrificed when their weight exceeded 40 g, a period that was significantly shorter (6 weeks) than that of the DIO model (12 weeks). After 6 weeks, the mice were injected with NIR-dextran or tumor cells to perform 1 h homing assays.

To prepare NIR fluorescent dextran, 6.5 mg of dextran was diluted in 1.8 ml of 0.1 M NaHCO3, and 190 µl of DMSO and 10 µl of cyanine 7.5 NHS ester (25.6 mM) was then added to the solution. The mixture was kept in the dark and stirred at room temperature (RT) for 4 hours, after which the reaction was purified with 50 kDa Amicon filters (filtration 14,000 rpm, 10 min; recovery 7500 rpm, 5 min). The tail vein of male and female DIO mice was injected with 1 mg g−1 dextran and lung permeability was analyzed 1 h after dextran injection by bioluminescent imaging (Xenogen IVIS-200 Optical In Vivo Imaging System).

EO771 cells were purchased from CH3, the Py230 cell line was purchased from the ATCC and HUVECs were obtained from Lonza. Py8119 cells were kindly provided by Dr Cyrus Ghajar (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center), MC38 cells by Dr Luuke Hawinkels (Leiden University Medical Center) and AT3 cells by Dr Inge Verbrugge (The Netherlands Cancer Institute). The EO771 and AT3 tumor cell lines were grown in high-glucose DMEM (Lonza) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS: Hyclone), 2 mM glutamine and 20 μg ml−1 gentamicin. MC38, Py230 and Py8119 cells were grown in Ham's F12 (Lonza) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone), 2 mM glutamine and 20 μg ml−1 gentamicin. The HUVEC line (Clonetics, Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) was cultured in EGM-2 medium containing growth factors (Clonetics), 20 μg ml−1 gentamicin and 10% (v/v) FBS. Culture flasks were pre-coated with gelatin 0.2% in ultra-purified water for 15 min and all cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere.

For Itga5 gene inactivation, sgRNAs were designed using the Benchling CRISPR sgRNA tool (http://www.benchling.com). Specific sgRNAs were tested against the Itga5 gene (NM_010577, exons 3 and 4), and also a non-targeting (NT) guide was used as a control. These sequences were cloned into the lentiCRISPRv2 vector (plasmid #52961, Addgene) and verified by Sanger sequencing. Recombinant lentiviruses were produced by transient plasmid transfection into HEK293T cells using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were transfected using second-generation packaging plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD.2 G, #12260 and #12259, respectively, Addgene) and the appropriate transfer plasmid (pLV CRISPR sgItga5 or pLV CRISPR sgNT). The medium was collected after 48 hours, cleared by low-speed centrifugation, and filtered through 0.45 μm pore-size PVDF filters (Millipore). Viral titers were calculated by qPCR and values ranged from 107 to 108 TU/ml.

To investigate the effects of a HFD on breast cancer (BC) primary tumor growth, 1×106 BC cells (EO771) were injected into the right thoracic mammary fat pad of 20-week-old female DIO mice. Cells were injected in 1:1 serum-free DMEM/growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The tumor volume was measured with a digital caliper and calculated as V = (L × W2)/2. Key time points throughout the trial were: 0 d, prior to tumor cell injection; 14 d, when primary tumors presented no statistical differences between the groups; 22 d, when primary tumors presented statistical differences between the groups. To assess spontaneous metastasis to the lungs, mice were euthanized on day 14 or 22, and the lungs were fixed with 10% formalin, paraffin-embedded, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained. For EO771 cells, tissue sections (10 μm) were stained with p53 and metastases were counted using a Leica Aperio digital pathology slide scanner and software.

To investigate the effects of a HFD on experimental metastasis to the lungs, 1×105 EO771 BC cells labeled with GFP and luciferase (GFP-Luc) were injected into the tail vein of 22-week-old male and female DIO mice. Cells were resuspended in calcium- and magnesium-free PBS, and filtered through a 40 μm mesh immediately prior to injection. Animals were injected with luciferin (3 mg: MB102, syd labs), and lung metastases were then analyzed by bioluminescent imaging (Xenogen IVIS-200 Optical In Vivo Imaging System) 1 h, 24 h, 2 or 5 weeks after tumor cell injection using Living Image 4.7.2 software (PerkinElmer).

The effect of platelet depletion was analyzed in male DIO mice. Platelet depletion was achieved by injecting a single intravenous dose of an anti-Gp1bα antibody (R300, 4 μg g−1: Emfret Analytics) or rat IgG2a isotype control (C301, Emfret Analytics) 48 h before tumor cells (1 × 105 EO771 GFP-Luc cells) were injected intravenously. Tumor cell homing was analyzed 1 h after injection by bioluminescent imaging (BLI: Xenogen IVIS-200 Optical In Vivo Imaging System). To analyze the effect of platelet depletion on experimental metastasis, platelet depletion was performed as indicated above 48 h before injecting the EO771 tumor cells (1 × 105 cells). Lung metastases were analyzed over 3 weeks after injection by BLI, confirming the effectiveness of the anti-platelet antibody in each experimental setting by counting platelets prior to and during the homing assay.

Platelets were isolated as described previously90. Briefly, female and male DIO mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), and whole blood was drawn by cardiac puncture using a syringe containing acid citrate dextrose (1 volume of anticoagulant/9 volumes of blood). Blood was mixed with 1 volume of modified HEPES-Tyrode's buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 12 mM NaHCO3, 0.3 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 5.5 mM glucose, 5 mM HEPES, 2 mM EGTA, and 0.035% BSA, pH 6.7) and it was centrifuged at 150 g for 2 minutes to obtain platelets or platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1, 5 nM: Millipore Sigma) was then added and the platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 g for 4 minutes at 37 °C. Platelet pellets were finally suspended in modified HEPES-Tyrode's buffer without EGTA and BSA (pH 7.4) but in the presence of 0.02 U/ml apyrase (grade VII: Millipore Sigma). Platelets were counted and pooled at the density necessary for each experiment.

For murine platelet aggregation studies, washed platelets isolated from female and male mice, and female DIO mice (250 μl of 5 × 108 platelets/ml) were used. Optical platelet aggregation experiments were monitored by turbidimetry using an aggregometer (Chrono-log 490 Optical Aggregometer) with continuous stirring at 1200 rpm at 37 °C. A final concentration of 0.5 IU/ml thrombin and 5 μg/ml collagen (Chrono-log Corporation) was used as an agonist for the aggregation studies.

To analyze αIIbβ3 integrin activation (GPIIb/IIIa, CD41/CD61) in murine platelets isolated from male mice after DIO, washed platelets (100 μl of 1 × 106 platelets/ml) were activated with 0.05 IU/ml thrombin or left untreated, and analyzed by flow cytometry after incubating them with PE-labeled anti- GPIIb/IIIa (Emfret, clone JON/A) and anti-CD62-P FITC antibodies (Emfret, clone Wug.E9) for 15 minutes at RT. Reactions were stopped by adding 400 μl PBS and the samples were analyzed within 30 minutes on a FACS CANTO II (BD, San Jose CA) and using FloJo v10 (BD). All antibody details and dilutions are available in Suppl. Table 1. Pools of platelets from 3 mice per diet were used in each condition. Ex vivo fibronectin binding and uptake assays were performed following the protocol described previously for fibrinogen adapted with some modifications91, briefly washed platelets (1.0 ×  107/mL) were incubated with FITC-FN (0.15 mg/mL, Cytoskeleton, Inc.) at 37 °C for the indicated times. The platelets were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by FACS. To study fibronectin uptake, platelets were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry after addition of 0.04% trypan blue (Sigma). Pools of platelets from 3 mice per diet were used in each condition.

Washed platelets isolated from male DIO mice (250 μl of 5 × 108 platelets/ml) were activated with 0.05 IU/ml thrombin (Chrono-log Corporation) and incubated at 37 °C for different times: untreated, 0 min; activated 15 and 30 seconds, and 3, 7 or 15 min. Subsequently, 250 μl 2× RIPA lysis buffer was added: 100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.2% SDS, 2% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, supplemented with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (PMSF 2 mM, Leupeptine 10 μg/ml, NaF 50 mM, Aprotinin 5 μg/ml, Sodium Orthovanadate 0.3 mM). Signaling pathways were analyzed in immunoblots of total protein extracts from washed platelets probed with the antibodies indicated (Suppl. Table 1). Pools of platelets from 3 mice per diet were used in each condition. When indicated, platelets were pretreated with TNFα (1ug/ml, Peprotech) for 5, 15 and 30 minutes at 37 °C before activation.

The release of ATP stored in platelet dense granules was measured as light output generated following an ATP-luciferin-luciferase reaction. The assay was carried out as described previously92. Briefly, washed platelets isolated from male DIO mice (5 × 108/mL, 180 μL) were incubated in a white Corning Costar flat bottom 96-well plate for 5 minutes at 37 °C on an orbital shake. Platelet agonizts (Thrombin 0.01 IU/ml) and CaCcl2 (2 mM) were then added, and platelets were activated for 30 seconds (s) at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. ATP standards were assayed in the same plate. Finally, 50 μL of the Chronolume detection reagent (Chrono-Log Corporation, Havertown, PA, USA) was added to each well and the corresponding luminescence emitted was measured (in arbitrary units) for 3 s in a multiple-well Reader (ClarioStarPlus. Luminiscence) following a 1 s delay. Pools of platelets from 3 mice per diet were used in each condition. The assay was performed in triplicate on at least two independent experiments.

Spreading assays were performed as described previously91. In brief, Lab-Tek Chamber Slides (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μg/ml human fibrinogen (Millipore Sigma) in PBS [pH 8.0] and after washing with PBS, they were blocked for 2 hours at RT with heat-denatured BSA (5 mg/ml) and then washed again. Platelets isolated from male DIO mice (1 × 108 platelets/ml) were incubated on the fibrinogen-coated chambers and allowed to spread for 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes at 37 °C in the presence of 0.01 IU/ml thrombin. Pools of platelets from 3 mice per diet were used in each condition. The chambers were then washed and the adhered platelets were fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA, 4%) for 10 minutes. After washing again, the chambers were incubated with 100 mM glycine for 5 minutes, washed and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes. The plates were washed further, blocked for 30 minutes with 10% normal goat serum (NGS: Millipore Sigma) and then probed with an anti–α-tubulin primary antibody, followed by the Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Phalloidin–Alexa Fluor 564 (A22283, ThermoFisher) was used to stain F-actin (T9026, Sigma) and images were acquired with a TCS SP5 X confocal microscope (Leica-Microsystems) equipped with AOBS, a HCX PLAN APO CS 63x/1.4 Oil Immersion, a HCX PLAN APO CS 100×/1.4 Oil Immersion objective and LAS AF v2.7.5 software. To quantify platelet morphology, at least 150 platelets per sample were measured using Fiji v2.1software.

Adhesion assays were performed as described previously93. In brief, microplate wells coated with fibrinogen (Millipore Sigma) were blocked for 1 h at RT and washed with PBS before adding the platelets isolated from male DIO mice. The platelets (50 ul of 1 × 108 platelets/ml) were unactivated, or activated by exposing to thrombin (0.05 U/ml, final activity) for 20 to 60 min at RT, and had been washed four times with PBS before they were diluted in the phosphatase substrate solution (5 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate). After a 1 hour incubation, 2 M NaOH was added and the resulting formation of p-nitrophenol was measured spectrophotometrically in Multi-well Clario Star Plus Reader at λ = 405 nm absorbance. The assay was performed in triplicate for at least two independent experiments.

EO771 (1.5 × 105 tumor cells) were washed in serum free media prior incubation with platelet suspensions (1.5 × 106 platelets) at indicated concentrations. Purified platelets were incubated with EO771 tumor cells for 1 h at room temperature then fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in Milloning phosphate buffer for 4 h. Pools of platelets from 3 mice per diet were used in each condition. After washing in distilled water, samples were dehydrated in an ethanol series (30, 50, 70, 80, 90, 95 and 100% for 10 min each). The samples were dried in a critical point dryer (Leica EM CPD300; Leica Microsystems). A 10 nm gold layer was sputtered onto the surface of the samples. Image acquisition was performed at high resolution (20 kV) and ×3000–6000 magnification under an JEOL JSM 6400 scanning electron microscope.

A commercially available antibody array kit (Proteome Profiler Mouse XL Cytokine Array, R & D Systems, ARY028) which was coated with 111 different cytokine antibodies in duplicate on a nitrocellulose membrane (dot blot) was used, following the manufacturer's instructions. This cytokine antibody array was used to determine the effects of platelets exposure on cytokine synthesis by EO771 cells compared with the analysis of adipose tissue-secreted soluble factors from ND and HFD-fed mice. The assay required 500 μL of cell culture supernatants (unstimulated and Platelet stimulated (1 × 106). Pools of platelets from 3 mice per diet were used in each condition. Membrane images were quantified, processing and analyzed using Fiji v2.1. software. Levels of cytokines were expressed and normalized against of the reference spots and relativized to the control condition (EO771 or ND secreted factors). Only the cytokines that showed similar expression patterns in both between the HFD conditions are shown.

HUVECs were grown to form a monolayer on gelatin-coated 6-well plates and activated by adding 100 μl of PKH26-labeled-platelets from male DIO mice (1×108 platelets/ml) for 45 min. Pools of platelets from 3 mice per diet were used in each condition. Platelets were washed and 1x105 EO771 cells were added to each well and allowed to adhere for 45 min. The cells were gently washed twice with medium and fixed in 4% PFA. When indicated, HUVECs were treated with an anti-FN1 blocking antibody (100 mg/ml) for 16 h (IST9, Abcam, ab6328). Images were acquired on a Thunder Imaging System (Leica-Microsystems) equipped with a 5X/0.15 Air Objective, a 8-LED light source, a DFC9000GTC camera and LAS-X v3.9.1 software. Random fields were obtained and analyzed with Fiji v.2.1 software.

TEM assays were set up as described previously10. Briefly, endothelial cells (HUVEC or HMEC) were seeded in Transwell chambers (8 μm, 24-well format) at a density 100,000 cells/well and allowed to form monolayers. Endothelial monolayers were pre-treated with platelets isolated from female DIO mice (500,000 platelets/well, 45 min exposure). Pools of platelets from 3 mice per diet were used in each condition. BC cells were labeled with the Vybrant CFDA SE Cell Tracer (Invitrogen) to differentiate them from endothelial cells, they were seeded in the upper chamber (4000 cells/well, Py230 or EO771 cells) and then allowed to migrate across the endothelial monolayer to the underside of the Transwell chamber over 24 h along a 0-2% FBS gradient. The cells that migrated to the underside of the Transwell chamber were quantified under a fluorescent microscope using a 10x objective.

Western blots were performed on 30-60 μg of total protein extract from murine platelets and RIPA whole cell lysates, resolved by SDS-PAGE. Membranes were blocked for 1 hour at RT with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in TBS-T (50 mM Tris-Cl, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4) and probed overnight at 4 °C with the antibodies indicated (Suppl. Table 1). The membranes were then rinsed 3 times with TBS-T and incubated with the secondary conjugated antibodies. Signals were detected using the ECL Western Blotting Substrate kit (GE Healthcare) or the Odyssey CLX system (Licor).

Tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (4% formaldehyde in solution), paraffin-embedded, and 3 μm sections were mounted on TOMO®slides and dried overnight. For different staining methods, slides were deparaffinized in xylene and re-hydrated through a series of graded ethanols until they reached water. Consecutive sections were H&E stained and different immunohistochemistry reactions were carried out in an automated immunostaining platform (Discovery XT-ULTRA, Ventana-Roche). Antigen retrieval was performed with the appropriate pH buffer (CC1: Ventana, Roche) and endogenous peroxidases were blocked with hydrogen peroxide (3%). The slides were then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (anti-P53, anti-fibronectin or anti-P-selectin: Suppl. Table 1) and then with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies: anti-rat (Vector) and OmniMap anti-Rabbit visualization systems (Ventana, Roche). The immunohistochemical reaction was developed using 3, 30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB: ChromoMap DAB, Ventana, Roche) and the nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Finally, the slides were dehydrated, cleared and mounted in a permanent mounting medium for microscopy. Positive control sections known to be positive for the primary antibody were included in each staining run. The images from the whole slides were acquired on a slide scanner (AxioScan Z1, Zeiss) and captured with the Zen Blue Software (V3.1 Zeiss).

Cells were blocked with 4% PFA for 20 min and after three washes with PBS, the sections were incubated for 15 min with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Samples were blocked for 1 h at RT with PBS containing 1% BSA, 5% donkey serum and 0.05% Triton X-100. After three washes, the tissues were probed with the primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight (see Suppl. Table 1) and after another three washes, they were incubated for 1 h with the Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (diluted 1:500: Molecular Probes) and washed again. The samples were mounted with Prolong DAPI (Thermo), images were obtained using a TCS-SP8 STED 3X confocal microscope (Leica-Microsystems) equiped with a 63X/NA1.4 oil immersion objective, AFC, AOBS, a tunable white laser and LAS-X software v3.7.5. Images were analyzed with Fiji v2.1 software.

Mouse lung endothelial cells (MLECs) were obtained and cultured as described previously94,95. Briefly, lungs from male DIO mice were excised, disaggregated and digested in 0.1% collagenase (Gibco) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cell suspensions was seeded onto plates coated with 10 µg/ml fibronectin (Sigma), 10 µg/ml collagen I (PureCol) and 0.1% gelatin (Sigma). After attachment, the cells were negatively selected with an anti-CD16/CD32 mAb (BD Biosciences, 553141) coupled to magnetic beads (Dynal, Invitrogen, 11035) and then positively selected with anti-ICAM-2 (BD Biosciences, 553325) coupled to magnetic beads. The cells recovered were seeded onto plates coated with 10 µg/ml collagen I and left to reach confluency after a further 7 days. The cell suspension was stained with CD45-PB (Invitrogen, MCD4528), CD31-APC (BD Biosciences, 551262) and 7-AAD Viability Dye (Invitrogen, A1310). Doublets and dead cells were gated prior to FACS sorting in a FACS ARIA IIu (BD), and viable CD45– CD31+ ECs were sorted into collecting medium containing 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and immediately frozen to isolate RNA (all the details on the antibodies and their dilutions are available in Suppl. Table 1).

Total RNA was extracted from the cells using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). After recovering the aqueous phase using chloroform, DNase treatment and further purification was performed with the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, 500 cells per sample were processed with the “NEBNext Single Cell/Low Input RNA Library Prep” kit (NEB #E6420), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, extracts obtained by suspending the sample in cell lysis buffer were subjected to oligo(dT) primed reverse transcription in a template switching reaction. Double stranded cDNA was then produced by limited-cycle PCR, and sequencing libraries were completed with the “NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina” (NEB #E7805) and analyzed on an Illumina NextSeq 550 (with v2.5 reagent kits). Single-end 85 bp reads were obtained, their clontech adapters were removed with Cutadapt (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), subsequently removing the last 15 bp from the reads, and they were then analyzed in the nextpresso pipeline96: sequencing quality was checked with FastQC v0.11.7 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/); reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38) with TopHat-2.0.1097, using Bowtie 1.0.098 and Samtools 0.1.1999, and allowing three mismatches and twenty multi-hits; read counts were obtained with HTSeq-count v0.6.1100, using the mouse gene annotation from GENCODE (encode.vM20.GRCm38.Ensembl95)101; differential expression was established with DESeq2102, using a 0.05 FDR; GSEAPreranked103 was used to perform gene set enrichment for several gene signatures on a pre-ranked gene list, setting 1,000 gene set permutations. Only those gene sets with significant enrichment (FDR q-value < 0.25) were considered.

Platelets from male DIO mice were lysed in 7 M urea and 2 M thiourea, digested with trypsin using the standard FASP protocol and labeled using the iTRAQ® reagent 8-plex. Pools of platelets from 3 mice per diet were used in each condition For whole proteome analysis, peptides were fractionated using an online HpH reverse-phase HPLC system and then, concatenated into 15 fractions. Samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an Impact Mass Spectrometer (Bruker) and the Raw files obtained were analyzed with MaxQuant against a mouse protein database. Statistical analysis was achieved with Prostar. To integrate the RNA-seq performed on CD45-, CD31+ MLECS and the proteomic profile of platelets isolated from ND (N = 3) and HFD (N = 3) male mice, 2916 genes in common RNA–protein pairs were considered. Co-regulated pairs were FDR  <  0.05 (colored), 5 above the FC cut-off (in solid color) applying a protein fold change >0.25 or <−0.25.

Intravital microscopy of the lung was performed as reported elsewhere104. Briefly, male DIO mice were anesthetized and ventilated mechanically through the trachea using a small-animal ventilator (model 687: Harvard Apparatus). A right lateral thoracotomy was performed and the lung was positioned under the window of a custom-built fixation device, applying a mild vacuum to hold the lung in position during microscopy. To visualize platelets, anti-CD41-PE was injected intravenously (1 μg/mouse), and the lungs were then analyzed 10 min after the mice were injected with an anti-CD41-PE-antibody and 1x105 EO771-GFP cells. Kinetic parameters were quantified, such as the Tumor-Platelet Aggregation index (Fig. 4G), quantifying the platelets in the tumor cell area and those in the surrounding region. A ratio between the interacting platelets (closer) and the total platelets in the area (both interacting and non-interacting) was then calculated (see Suppl. Figure 3E for more details). We calculated the platelet accumulation around tumor cells and the same area measured in a different region (random location) without green cells to verify the specificity of the interactions. Intravital experiments were performed on a TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica-Microsystems) equipped with a 20x/NA 0.7 dry objective, an AOBS and a temperature controller driven by the LAS AF v2.6 software, and Z-stack time lapse videos were obtained and analyzed using an ImageJ macro105. The algorithm developed involved: first finding the tumor cell in each frame and its segmentation into the green channel; this region of interest is dilated to obtain a new area around the cell (surrounding region); subsequently, the platelet area is segmented into the red channel; and finally, the total area is measured and the number of particles in each region of interest was assessed (tumor cells and surrounding region). In addition, other measures were calculated, like the segmented area of the platelets in the full frame and the size of the tumor cell. These measures were studied and analyzed using SPSS and Microsoft Excel to obtain the results shown here.

The sample size for in vitro and in vivo experiments was selected based on pilot studies. Animals were randomly allocated for dietary studies and for studies involving tumor cell injection. For all other experiments, no specific randomization method was followed as this was irrelevant for the in vitro assays. Researchers were blind to the final outcome assessment in the mouse experiments but not to the allocation or treatment of the mice in the experiments. For the remaining in vitro experiments, researchers were not blinded but the experiments were performed by different individuals. Error bars in the graphical data represent the mean ± s.d. unless otherwise specified. For in vivo and in vitro assays, the number of independent experiments and biological replicates are indicated in the figure legends. Statistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism software v.9.1.0, applying a two-tailed unpaired or paired Student's t-tests, one-way or two-way ANOVA, or non-parametric tests as appropriate. For human studies, Pearson's correlation was assessed for bivariate correlations between the BMI and each coagulation test parameter. Survival analyzes were carried out with Kaplan-Meier estimates and LogRank tests. Multivariate analyzes were performed according to the Cox's proportionate hazards methods. All tests were two-sided and a P-value cut-off of 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. All these tests were performed with the SPSS V.11 software package.

The Sahara Desert has not always been the arid, inhospitable landscape we know today. Between 14,500 and 5,000 years ago, the area was unrecognizable, transformed into a lush savannah by an unusually wet interval called the African Humid Period. People roamed this green landscape for thousands of years before it was again lost to sand.

From Vikings to Beethoven: what your DNA says about your ancient relatives

From Vikings to Beethoven: what your DNA says about your ancient relatives

Ancient DNA extracted from two women who died in what is now Libya around 7,000 years ago is now helping researchers to reconstruct the origins of these early Saharans. The women's DNA profiles, described in a study published on 2 April in Nature1, represent the first full Saharan genomes from the African Humid Period — and reveal that the people were remarkably isolated from other African populations.

“The prehistory of North Africa is a big puzzle, and we only have a few pieces available,” says Rosa Fregel, a geneticist at the University of La Laguna in San Cristobal, Spain, who was not involved in the research. The work is “a significant contribution to the palaeogenomics of North Africa”, she says.

Ancient genomes from North Africa are hard to come by. Almost all palaeogenetic work is concentrated in Europe and Asia. Ancient DNA is especially rare in the Sahara, where high temperatures and strong ultraviolet light quickly degrade genetic material in remains.

That's why it's important to explore sites that are protected from the elements, says Nada Salem, an archaeologist at the Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. 

One such site is the Takarkori rock shelter in southwestern Libya. Between 2003 and 2007, archaeologists uncovered the remains of 15 people who were buried between 8,900 and 4,800 years ago at Takarkori. Two of the corpses — both belonging to women who lived between 7,000 and 6,000 years ago — had naturally mummified.

Archaeological evidence at the site suggested that the Takarkori women belonged to a group of herders who appeared in the region around 8,000 years ago. This marked a major transition in the way of life of early Saharans, who had previously all been hunter-gatherers. Some researchers have suggested that Saharans learnt herding by intermarrying with people who were migrating into North Africa from the Levant.

To test this, Salem and her colleagues sequenced the Takarkori genomes and compared the DNA to that of around 800 modern humans and 117 ancient genomes from around Africa, southern Europe and the Middle East. The team found that the Takarkori women had only small traces of Levant ancestry — suggesting that any intermingling had happened long before the advent of herding in the region.

What's more, the analysis struggled to connect these early Saharans to any other ancient group. “This was puzzling for us. How is it that this lineage has not spread either to the east or the west or to the south?” says Salem.

Metrics details

In reality, research projects grow through an evolutionary process. Variation — the substrate of evolution — is provided through the emergence of new questions and avenues of investigation. The research team must then choose which directions to pursue, a process akin to natural selection1. Along with this evolution at the macro-scale, a much more orderly process is required at the micro-scale. Within each step, thoughtful study design leads to robust experiments and analyses. This complementarity between evolution and design best encapsulates the process of discovery: in ‘night science' we evolve ideas for the next step, while ‘day science' tests them2.

A project's evolutionary history is generally obscured in the resulting scientific publication. The publication's function is to justify and communicate the project's main results; it is not a historical account. Instead of recounting all of the project's dried-up branches, publications zoom in on a single lineage in its evolution: the steps that led to the most interesting result (Fig. 1c). Publications typically describe the discovery as it ideally should have happened, reporting only the evidence relevant to the proposed claims3.

Metrics details

Accumulating evidence indicates that antibiotic exposure may lead to impaired vaccine responses1,2,3,4; however, the mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly understood. Here we prospectively followed 191 healthy, vaginally born, term infants from birth to 15 months, using a systems vaccinology approach to assess the effects of antibiotic exposure on immune responses to vaccination. Exposure to direct neonatal but not intrapartum antibiotics was associated with significantly lower antibody titres against various polysaccharides in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the Haemophilus influenzae type b polyribosylribitol phosphate and diphtheria toxoid antigens in the combined 6-in-1 Infanrix Hexa vaccine at 7 months of age. Blood from infants exposed to neonatal antibiotics had an inflammatory transcriptional profile before vaccination; in addition, faecal metagenomics showed reduced abundance of Bifidobacterium species in these infants at the time of vaccination, which was correlated with reduced vaccine antibody titres 6 months later. In preclinical models, responses to the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were strongly dependent on an intact microbiota but could be restored in germ-free mice by administering a consortium of Bifidobacterium species or a probiotic already widely used in neonatal units. Our data suggest that microbiota-targeted interventions could mitigate the detrimental effects of early-life antibiotics on vaccine immunogenicity.

Global immunization programmes prevent millions of deaths per year5,6; however, for reasons that are unclear, immune responses to vaccination exhibit substantial interindividual variation and are frequently suboptimal in the populations at most risk from infectious disease7. Evidence increasingly indicates that the gut microbiota is an important and targetable factor that may, at least in part, explain these interindividual and interpopulation differences in immune responses to vaccination7,8. In mice, antibiotic exposure in early life has been shown to lead to impaired antibody responses to five different adjuvanted and live-attenuated parenteral vaccines1. Antibiotic-treated and germ-free (GF) adult mice have also been shown to have impaired antibody responses to an unadjuvanted influenza vaccine but not to the live yellow fever vaccine9 or a COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine10. Furthermore, adult participants randomized to antibiotics before immunization with unadjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine had significantly impaired neutralizing and binding antibody titres; however, this was not observed in adults with pre-existing immunity to influenza11. On the other hand, oral rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity was not found to be reduced in adults randomized to antibiotics12. Consistent with our previous preclinical data suggesting that antibiotics may have a more profound effect on antibody responses to adjuvanted vaccines in early life1, a recent retrospective study found that vaccine antibody titres were lower in antibiotic-exposed infants2. Cumulative antibiotic exposure during the first year of life has also been associated with reduced vaccine response at 12 months3,4.

To prospectively assess whether antibiotic exposure in early life affects antibody responses to vaccination and to better understand the mechanisms involved, we established a prospective observational study that recruited healthy, full-term, vaginally delivered infants. Infants were defined as not exposed to antibiotics (no-ABX, n = 80) or exposed to antibiotics (ABX, n = 111) in the peripartum period (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1). ABX infants were further subdivided (Fig. 1b) into three antibiotic exposure groups defined a priori (Methods). Thirty of 32 infants (94%) in the direct neonatal antibiotic exposure group (neo-ABX) started antibiotics in the 48 h after birth, and 31 (97%) of these infants received intravenous (i.v.) benzylpenicillin and gentamicin for at least 48 h. Of these infants, 19 were also exposed or potentially exposed to maternal antibiotics intrapartum or postnatally (Supplementary Table 1). In the intrapartum antibiotic exposure (IP-ABX) group, 36 of 49 (73%) of mothers received i.v. benzylpenicillin within 48 h before delivery, seven (14%) received i.v. benzylpenicillin in combination with at least one other oral or i.v. antibiotic, four (8%) received i.v. clindamycin, one received i.v. clindamycin plus oral cephalexin and—consistent with the a priori definition of this group, which included mothers treated with antibiotics in the last 28 days of pregnancy—one received oral cephalexin from day 12 to day 10 before birth. Mothers of infants in the postnatal antibiotic exposure group (PN-ABX, n = 30) received a variety of different antibiotics orally in the postnatal period from birth to day 45, and seven also received i.v. antibiotics (Supplementary Table 1). Maternal and infant demographics, as well as breastfeeding rates, were comparable across exposure groups, except for probiotic usage, which was higher in the ABX group (Extended Data Table 1).

Responses to the polio, measles, mumps, rubella and meningococcal ACWY vaccines were not measured in this study. b, Antibiotics administered to infants and their mothers in the direct neonatal antibiotic exposure group (Neo-ABX, n = 32 infants), intrapartum antibiotic exposure group (IP-ABX, n = 49 infants) and postnatal antibiotic exposure group (PN-ABX, n = 30 infants). c, Heatmap showing fold change in the geometric mean concentration (GMC) of vaccine antigen-specific antibodies in serum collected from Neo-ABX (n = 27 at 7 months, n = 26 at 15 months), IP-ABX (n = 43 at 7 months, n = 42 at 15 months) and PN-ABX (n = 26 at 7 months, n = 27 at 15 months) infants, relative to No-ABX infants (n = 64 at 7 months, n = 65 at 15 months).

Source data

Eighty-six per cent of infants in this study received hepatitis B vaccine at birth. At approximately week 6 of life, the first doses of the other primary childhood vaccines were administered as recommended by the Australian National Immunisation Program (NIP) schedule as of 2017. Further primary doses were administered at approximately 4 and 6 months of age (Fig. 1a). Serum IgG titres against 20 different vaccine antigens and anti-rotavirus vaccine IgA titres were measured at baseline and at 7 and 15 months (Extended Data Fig. 2a–u), using previously validated immunoassays13,14,15,16,17,18. To assess the relationship between ABX group and antibody responses to vaccination, we used multivariate regression adjusting for sex and baseline antibody titres; this was because baseline titres, as expected19, were frequently negatively correlated with subsequent antibody titres (Extended Data Fig. 2v). Compared with No-ABX infants, infants exposed to any antibiotics before the first dose of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), 6-in-1 Infanrix Hexa and rotavirus vaccines had significantly (P < 0.05) decreased IgG titres against six of the capsular pneumococcal polysaccharides (PPS1, 6B, 9V, 18C, 19F and 23F) in the PCV13 vaccine and significantly lower anti-tetanus toxoid IgG titres at age 7 months (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 2a). After subdivision by exposure group, this decrease in anti-PPS IgG titres was evident in Neo-ABX infants (PPS1, 6B, 9V, 18C, 19F and 23F) but not IP-ABX infants (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 3a–f and Supplementary Table 3a). A similar trend towards reduced anti-PPS4 and PPS5 titres (but not those for other polysaccharides) was observed (Extended Data Fig. 3g–m). IgG titres against diphtheria toxoid and the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) antigen (antigens in the 6-in-1 Infanrix Hexa vaccine) were also significantly lower in Neo-ABX infants at 7 months (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 3n,o). A similar trend was observed for anti-tetanus toxoid IgG titres (P = 0.09) (Extended Data Fig. 3p). There was no detectable association of ABX group with IgG titres against pertussis toxoid (PT), hepatitis B surface antigen (HB-sAg), pertactin (PRN) or filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA), or with serum oral rotavirus vaccine IgA titres (Extended Data Fig. 3q–u). PN-ABX infants had significantly reduced anti-PPS19A and 23F IgG titres at 7 months (Fig. 1c), indicating that maternal postnatal antibiotic exposure may have an impact on subsequent infant responses to vaccination but to a lesser extent than direct administration of antibiotics to neonates.

Antibody titres were significantly lower at 15 months compared with 7 months for all of the antigens assessed, except anti-tetanus toxoid IgG titres, consistent with waning of immunity over time20 (Extended Data Fig. 2a–u). Any antibiotics before the first dose of the PCV13, 6-in-1 and rotavirus vaccines was associated with significantly lower IgG titres at 15 months against six different serotypes in the PCV13 vaccine (PPS4, 6A, 9V, 19A, 19F and 23F) and Hib-PRP (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 2a). After subdivision by exposure group, significantly reduced IgG titres were observed only in Neo-ABX (PPS14, PPS19A, Hib-PRP) and PN-ABX (PPS6A, 9V, 19A, 19F, 23F) infants at this time point (Extended Data Fig. 4a–u and Supplementary Table 3a). There were no significant differences in IP-ABX infants. We also analysed the antibody data longitudinally (rather than separately at 7 and 15 months) and found that IgG titres against nine of 13 serotypes were significantly lower in Neo-ABX infants (Supplementary Table 3b). Taken together, our data indicate that antibiotic-exposed infants, particularly those exposed directly to antibiotics in the neonatal period, have impaired immunogenicity against several different vaccine antigens, particularly those in conjugate polysaccharide vaccines.

We next used opsonophagocytic assays to assess the functionality of antibodies against three PCV13 serotypes (6B, 9V and 18C) that had significantly reduced binding antibody titres in Neo-ABX infants. Compared with No-ABX infants, the opsonophagocytic activity of serum from Neo-ABX infants at 7 months was significantly lower (P < 0.05) against serotype 6B but not 9V or 18C (Fig. 2a–c). These data indicate that neonatal antibiotic exposure can not only impair vaccine-induced binding antibody titres months later but also, in some cases, reduce the functionality of those antibodies.

All statistical tests were two-sided. Exact P values are provided in the source data.

Source data

Next, we assessed the association between ABX group and the proportion of infants with antibody responses above the seroprotective threshold defined for each vaccine antigen (Supplementary Table 2b). At 7 months, 1 month after the three primary doses of PCV13 and 6-in-1 vaccines had been administered, most of the infants (69–100%, dependent on the vaccine antigen) achieved a seroprotective response (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 2b), although there was a significantly reduced proportion of Neo-ABX infants above the seroprotective threshold for one PCV13 polysaccharide, PPS6B (Supplementary Table 3c). By 15 months, the percentage of infants in any of the exposure groups maintaining antibody titres above the seroprotective thresholds had dropped considerably, below 50% for several antigens (Fig. 2e). Despite this waning, the proportion above the seroprotective threshold for infants exposed to any antibiotics was lower for all 13 PCV13 serotypes at 15 months compared with No-ABX infants. These reductions were statistically significant for four serotypes (PPS6B, 9V, 14 and 19A), and there was a trend for anti-diphtheria toxoid titres (P = 0.06). The proportions of Neo-ABX and PN-ABX infants above the seroprotective threshold were significantly lower (P < 0.05) for PPS14 and 19A, and PPS9V and 19A, respectively (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Table 3c). No significantly impaired seroprotective responses were observed in IP-ABX infants. These analyses used the seroprotective threshold accepted by the World Health Organization for PCV13 (0.35 µg ml−1). Reanalysis of the data using serotype-specific seroprotective thresholds21 showed the same trend (Supplementary Table 3d). These results indicate that there may be more rapid waning of vaccine-induced protection against certain pneumococcal serotypes in antibiotic-exposed infants, particularly those directly treated with antibiotics in the neonatal period.

Infants in our study also received four doses of the four-component meningococcal B vaccine (4CMenB) (Fig. 1a). Sera from infants with matched samples at 7 weeks (pre-4CMenB vaccination), 7 months and 15 months were tested for bactericidal activity against Neisseria meningitidis NZ98/254, an internationally accepted surrogate of protection for meningococcal serogroup B vaccines, for which a titre greater than or equal to 1:4 is considered to be protective22. There was a significant increase in serum bactericidal activity titres postvaccination in the 7- and 15-month samples compared with baseline (Fig. 2g). Despite these very high seroprotective responses, we observed a trend (P = 0.06) towards reduced serum bactericidal activity titres at 7 months in infants exposed to any antibiotics (Fig. 2h). This was not observed when infants were divided further by antibiotic exposure group (Fig. 2i), possibly owing to reduced statistical power. No significant differences were observed at 15 months (Fig. 2j), around 3 months after the fourth dose of 4CMenB had been administered.

In adults, transcriptional responses in blood at baseline or induced postvaccination have been shown to be correlated with subsequent vaccine-specific antibody responses23. Here we profiled the peripheral blood transcriptome in 329 infant blood samples collected at baseline and approximately 1 week after first-dose vaccination (Supplementary Table 4). Gene set enrichment analysis, a powerful approach that can be used to detect subtle but coordinated changes in gene expression23,24,25, showed upregulation of several inflammation-related blood transcriptional modules (BTMs) in Neo-ABX infants at baseline (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 5). Few of these BTMs were found to be enriched among genes upregulated in IP-ABX infants, which may be functionally relevant, given that impaired vaccine antibody responses were observed in Neo-ABX infants and not in IP-ABX infants. Upregulation of inflammatory modules has also been previously reported in adults treated with a cocktail of antibiotics11. By contrast, B cell-related and plasma-cell-related modules were frequently downregulated in Neo-, IP- and PN-ABX infants. The activity of upregulated monocyte-related BTMs was negatively correlated with antibody responses at 7 months, whereas the activity of B cell-related BTMs was positively correlated (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Taken together, these data indicate that BTMs associated with antibody responses to vaccination are altered at baseline, particularly in Neo-ABX infants. Notably, several BTMs related to natural killer cells were enriched among genes downregulated in IP-ABX infants, indicating that although IP-ABX may not be associated with impaired humoral responses to vaccination, it may alter the immune system in early life in other ways.

Statistical significance was assessed using the fgsea39 R package in a and d and using the edgeR40 package in c. The Benjamini–Hochberg method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons in a, c and d, with an FDR < 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. Statistical significance in e was assessed using two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Asterisk indicates FDR < 0.05.

Compared with the prevaccination baseline, there was a clear difference in peripheral blood transcriptomes approximately 1 week after the first dose of vaccines had been administered (Fig. 3b), with 3,089 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) identified postvaccination (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 6). These differences were driven by vaccination and not the 1-week difference in the age of the infants between the two time points (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). BTMs upregulated postvaccination (Fig. 3d) included several that have been associated with response to vaccination in adults23 (Extended Data Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 7). BTMs related to B cells, monocytes and neutrophils were enriched among genes downregulated postvaccination. Broadly, the magnitude of the transcriptional response to vaccination was similar across the different ABX groups (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). However, because Neo-ABX infants had altered transcriptional activity at baseline, these infants had notably different BTM activity postvaccination compared with that of No-ABX infants (Extended Data Fig. 5g and Supplementary Table 5).

We performed flow cytometry analysis of more than 40 different immune cell populations in fresh peripheral blood samples collected concurrently with the week-7 blood samples used for RNA sequencing (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Figs. 1–3). Although there was a modest reduction in the number of CD45RA− regulatory T cells in IP-ABX infants (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 5h,i), the numbers and frequencies of all other immune cell populations were not significantly different in any of the ABX groups compared with unexposed infants (Extended Data Fig. 5j–o and Supplementary Table 9). In addition, we explored whether any circulating immune cell populations differed between high and low vaccine responders, but we did not detect any significant differences (data not shown). These results indicate that the transcriptional differences observed in ABX infants are not primarily driven by differences in the frequency of major circulating immune cell populations.

We collected stool specimens (n = 409) at weeks 1 and 6, with 89% of the week-6 samples being collected within 1 day of the first dose of the PCV13, 6-in-1 and oral rotavirus vaccines being administered. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of these samples therefore enabled unique insight into the composition of the faecal microbiota in these infants at the time of vaccination (Supplementary Table 10). More than 12 million scaffolds were assigned into 3,774 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), encompassing more than 300 species from 43 bacterial families. Actinomycetota and Pseudomonadota were the most abundant phyla at both time points, consistent with findings of previous studies26. Bacterial load did not significantly differ between ABX groups at either time point (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Alpha diversity (both evenness and richness) was significantly lower (P ≤ 0.05) in Neo-ABX and IP-ABX infants at week 1 (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). From week 1 to week 6, both bacterial load and alpha diversity significantly increased (P < 0.001) (Extended Data Fig. 6a–c). We also assessed antimicrobial-resistant-gene carriage and observed increased carriage in Neo-ABX and IP-ABX infants (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e).

Using Dirichlet multinomial mixtures modelling to cluster metagenomic samples, we identified six community state types (CSTs) (Fig. 4a,b). CST-2 had a high centred log ratio (CLR) abundance of Bifidobacterium species, particularly Bifidobacterium breve but also included Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium infantis, and was significantly overrepresented among No-ABX infants at both week 1 and week 6 (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 6f). Notably, this was not observed for CST-3, which had a higher CLR abundance of B. longum compared with CST-2. We next assessed whether specific bacterial taxa were differentially abundant among the ABX groups. Compared with No-ABX infants, numerous taxa, including several from the genera Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Haemophilus, Citrobacter and Streptococcus, had significantly higher (FDR < 0.05) CLR abundance in the IP-ABX infants at week 1 but not at week 6 (Fig. 4d,e, Extended Data Fig. 6g,h and Supplementary Table 11). Correspondingly, the CLR abundances of several different Bifidobacterium species were significantly lower (FDR < 0.05) in IP-ABX infants at week 1 but not at week 6 (Fig. 4d,e, Extended Data Fig. 6i and Supplementary Table 11). Consistent with the changes in the composition of the microbiota in IP-ABX infants, we detected 298 metagenomically encoded pathways that were differentially abundant (FDR < 0.05) at week 1 but none at week 6 (Supplementary Table 12). These data indicate that the effects of intrapartum antibiotics on the composition and functional capacity of the faecal microbiota were transient and had resolved by the time the first doses of vaccines were administered.

By contrast, the CLR abundances of various Bifidobacterium species including B. breve, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and B. bifidum (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 6j–l) and several Collinsella species were significantly decreased (FDR < 0.05) in Neo-ABX infants at week 6 (Supplementary Table 11), the time that the first doses of PCV13, 6-in-1 and oral rotavirus vaccines were administered. Reduced Bifidobacterium relative abundance has been reported in some but not all previous studies assessing the impact of antibiotics on the gut microbiota in early life27. Consistent with the persistent changes in the composition of the faecal microbiota of Neo-ABX infants at week 6, we identified 406 metagenomically encoded pathways that were differentially abundant (FDR < 0.05) in Neo-ABX infants at this time point compared with No-ABX infants (Supplementary Table 12). These data indicate that the persistent changes induced in the composition and encoded function of the gut microbiota at the time of vaccination by neonatal antibiotic exposure—in particular, reduced abundance of Bifidobacterium species—could play a part in the suboptimal antibody responses to vaccination observed in these infants. Consistent with this, the CLR abundances of several Bifidobacterium species at week 6 were positively correlated with IgG titres against several different vaccine antigens at 7 months (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Table 13a). Correlations between abundances of taxa at week 1 and antibody responses at month 7 were weaker, although there was positive correlation (P < 0.05) between the CLR abundance of Bifidobacterium species and anti-PPS6B IgG titres (Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 13b). Given these associations, we next assessed whether Bifidobacterium at 6 weeks was increased in high versus low vaccine responders. The CLR abundances of B. breve, B. bifidum and B. longum—but not B. pseudocatenulatum—were significantly increased in high responders to several different vaccine antigens, particularly PPS6B (Extended Data Fig. 7b and Supplementary Table 13). Causal mediation analysis28,29 also indicated significant positive direct relationships of both B. breve and B. bifidum with PPS6B IgG titres (P < 0.05) that were mediated by inflammation-related (BTM M11.0, P < 0.05) but not B cell-related transcriptional activity. These data indicate that antibiotic exposure may trigger a pro-inflammatory state that impedes Bifidobacterium colonization and/or growth and subsequently affects optimal vaccine responses.

Our clinical data indicated that antibody responses to the PCV13 vaccine might be particularly dependent on signals from the gut microbiota. To assess whether this was also reflected in preclinical models, we compared antibody responses in sera collected from PCV13-vaccinated conventional specific-pathogen-free (SPF) and GF mice. PCV13-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2c, IgG3 and IgM responses in sera were markedly impaired in GF mice (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 8a–d), as were IgG titres against PPS1, PPS3, PPS6B, PPS9V and PCV13 conjugate protein CRM197 (Extended Data Fig. 8e–i). GF mice immunized with the 6-in-1 vaccine also had significantly impaired anti-diphtheria toxoid and anti-tetanus toxoid IgG responses; however, analogous to our observations in Neo-ABX infants, their anti-pertussis toxoid responses were not significantly different to those of SPF mice (Extended Data Fig. 8j–l). GF mice also had antibody responses comparable with those of SPF mice following immunization with the 4CMenB vaccine (Extended Data Fig. 8m). We recently reported that GF mice have B and T cell responses to the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine that are comparable with those of SPF mice10. Taken together, these data indicate that as in antibiotic-treated infants, responses to PCV13 in mice are particularly dependent on signals from the gut microbiota.

Source data

To investigate why, we next assessed whether germinal centre (GC) responses, which have a critical role in optimal T-dependent humoral immune responses, were suboptimal in PCV13-immunized GF mice. Compared with SPF mice, GF mice immunized with two doses of PCV13 had significantly lower total and CRM197-specific GC B cells in their spleens (Fig. 5b,c) and draining lymph nodes (dLN) (Extended Data Fig. 8n–q). The proportion of T follicular helper (TFH) cells in the spleen (Fig. 5d) but not in the dLN (Extended Data Fig. 8r,s) was also significantly lower in GF mice. Confocal microscopy confirmed impaired GC formation in PCV13-immunized GF mice (Extended Data Fig. 9). These data indicate that PCV13-immunized GF mice have impaired T-dependent antibody responses to vaccination because of a failure of optimal GC formation in these mice.

We next proposed that GF mice might fail to mount optimal GC responses to PCV13 because of impaired innate immune activation postvaccination. Consistent with this hypothesis, 24 h after the first dose of PCV13, we observed significant increases in surface expression of activation marker CD86 on cells of several different myeloid populations, including dendritic cells (DC), conventional dendritic cells (cDC), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), migratory dendritic cells (mDC) and resident dendritic cells (rDC) in the dLN of SPF but not GF mice (Fig. 5e). Expression of MHCII or CD80 was not induced in either GF or SPF mice at 24 h postvaccination (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Notably, given the associations we observed between increased CLR abundance of Bifidobacterium species and higher antibody titres in infants, mice born to GF dams colonized with B. breve during pregnancy (to ensure colonization from birth) had significantly higher CD86 expression at 24 h after PCV13 vaccination compared with mice that remained GF (Extended Data Fig. 10c).

Given that GF mice seemed to have impaired innate immune responses to PCV13 immunization, we proposed a further hypothesis that signals from the microbiota might act through an MyD88-dependent pathway. Consistent with this, serum IgG, IgG1, IgG2c and IgM responses to PCV13 were severely impaired in Myd88−/− mice (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 10d–f). A previous study found that TLR5-mediated sensing of the microbiota was required for antibody responses to a non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine9; however, we have previously shown that antibody responses to the alum-adjuvanted PCV13 vaccine are not impaired in Tlr5−/− mice1. Given this, we instead investigated responses to PCV13 in Tlr4−/− and Tlr2−/− mice and found a trend suggestive of impaired PCV13-specific antibody responses in Tlr4−/− but not Tlr2−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 10g,h). These data indicate that sensing of the microbiota through an MyD88-dependent pathways may be required for optimal antibody responses to the PCV13 vaccine; however, further work is needed to determine the upstream pattern recognition receptor(s) involved, noting that redundancy between different receptors is possible.

Our clinical data suggested that loss of Bifidobacterium species in infants at the time of immunization leads to impaired antibody responses to PCV13 and other vaccines. To assess whether administering a consortium of Bifidobacterium species to GF mice could restore PCV13-specific antibody responses, we administered a mixture of B. breve, B. longum subsp. longum and B. longum subsp. infantis to pregnant dams to ensure colonization of their offspring from birth. These pups (GF + Bif) and pups born to GF or SPF mice were vaccinated with PCV13 at around day 21 of life and again 2 weeks later. Consistent with our hypothesis, PCV13-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgM antibody responses in GF + Bif pups were significantly higher 2 weeks following the second dose of PCV13 compared with those in GF mice (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 10i,j). Compared with GF mice, GF + Bif mice also had significantly higher proportions or total numbers of GC B cells in their spleens (Fig. 5h) and dLN (Extended Data Fig. 10k). Proportions or numbers of TFH cells were also higher in GF + Bif mice (Extended Data Fig. 10l,m). Notably, we observed no increase in antibody responses to PCV13 in GF + Bif mice after only a single dose of vaccine (Extended Data Fig. 10n–p).

Next, we wanted to establish whether responses in GF mice to PCV13 could be restored by directly administering a probiotic intervention to the GF mice closer to the time of vaccination (rather than through their mothers). To assess this, we compared responses to PCV13 in SPF mice, GF mice and GF mice colonized with strains from commercial probiotic Infloran, 1 week before vaccination with PCV13 (GF + Probiotic). We selected Infloran as it contains a mixture of B. bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus and also because it is commonly used in neonatal intensive care units to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis30,31 and thus has an established clinical safety profile with clear translational potential. In addition, B. bifidum was among the Bifidobacterium species that we observed to show decreased abundance in Neo-ABX infants and increased abundance in infants that were high vaccine responders (Extended Data Fig. 7b). PCV13-specific IgG and IgG1 responses in GF mice were significantly enhanced by colonization of the mice with the Infloran probiotic strains (Fig. 5i,j). Notably, colonization of GF mice with either strain alone was insufficient to enhance antibody responses to PCV13 (Extended Data Fig. 10q–s). Bifidobacterium spp. are known to use a variety of cross-feeding synergistic strategies involving other members of the gut microbiota to access carbohydrates that they cannot metabolise;32 this potentially explains why neither culture alone enhanced antibody responses. Consistent with this, the bacterial load in mice colonized with both the B. bifidum and L. acidophilus strains simultaneously was two log-fold higher than that of mice colonized with either strain alone (Extended Data Fig. 10t). Colonizing GF mice with a range of other commensal isolates before PCV13 vaccination did not enhance responses to PCV13 vaccination (Extended Data Fig. 10u–w). In conclusion, our data indicate that restoring a healthy Bifidobacterium-rich microbiota in antibiotic-exposed infants, before vaccination, may lead to enhanced antibody responses to vaccination and increased protection against infectious diseases.

We have previously shown that early-life antibiotic exposure in mice leads to impaired responses to a range of different infant vaccines1; this motivated us to conduct the prospective clinical study we report here. Consistent with these previous preclinical data, we found that infants exposed to antibiotics, particularly direct antibiotic treatment in the neonatal period, had significantly reduced serum IgG titres against several vaccine antigens at 7 and 15 months of age. Our results, which add to the findings of several important previous studies (Supplementary Discussion), indicate that immune responses to certain types of vaccine, particularly protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines such as PCV13, may be more dependent on signals from the gut microbiota than others. Further investigation is needed to determine why this is the case; however, it may be related to the lower immunogenicity of polysaccharide conjugate vaccines compared with adjuvanted protein vaccines and other platforms such as mRNA vaccines10.

Our clinical and preclinical data suggest that Bifidobacterium species in the infant gut microbiota have an important role in mediating optimal innate, GC and serum antibody responses to PCV13 and other vaccines and that administering probiotics to infants exposed to neonatal antibiotics may be a feasible, cheap and safe intervention to enhance responses to vaccination. This needs to be rigorously tested in randomized controlled trials in appropriate populations (Supplementary Discussion). Consistent with our data, some previous correlative studies have reported an association between the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium species and responses to the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), oral polio and tetanus toxoid vaccines33,34. In addition, GF mice colonized with B. longum subp. infantis have recently been found to have increased T cell responses to the BCG vaccine35. Notably, intrapartum antibiotic exposure was not associated with reduced antibody responses to vaccination in our study (Supplementary Discussion). A possible explanation is that at the time of first-dose vaccination, abundances of Bifidobacterium species were not significantly reduced in infants exposed to intrapartum antibiotics, whereas they were significantly reduced in infants who were directly treated with antibiotics.

Despite our important findings, our study had several limitations. The sample size was relatively modest, especially when the antibiotic exposure group was broken down further according to the type of antibiotic exposure. Further studies in larger cohorts are now warranted. Encouragingly, our results in infants were strongly concordant with our observations in animal models. Our study excluded infants born by caesarean section and those born to mothers with a body mass index greater than 30. Future research should investigate whether these and other factors that alter the infant gut microbiota36 can also influence immune responses to vaccination. A recent study reported that infants born by caesarean section had significantly reduced IgG titres against pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides in saliva (no serum was collected in that study)37. Furthermore, assessment of gene expression responses at more time points postvaccination and using single-cell technologies could further refine our understanding of the link between altered transcriptional responses in infants exposed to antibiotics and suboptimal responses to vaccination (Supplementary Discussion). Finally, our study focused predominantly on binding antibody titres, given that these are the established correlates of protection for most vaccines; however, we found that the opsonophagocytic activity of serum from infants treated with antibiotics in the neonatal period against one of the three PCV13 polysaccharides, PPS6B, was significantly reduced. Furthermore, there was a modest reduction in the bactericidal activity (against N. meningitidis) of serum collected from infants vaccinated with the 4CMenB meningococcal B vaccine that had been exposed to any antibiotics, compared with those that had not been exposed to antibiotics. Future studies should also assess the impact of antibiotic exposure on functional antibody responses in more detail, as well as T cell responses to vaccination. In conclusion, we found that early-life antibiotic exposure was associated with significantly impaired vaccine immunogenicity, with a particular impact on immune responses to the PCV13 vaccine. These effects seemed to be mediated by a reduction in abundance of Bifidobacterium species, which in turn led to altered baseline immune status. Our findings emphasize the need to broaden the rationale for antibiotic stewardship in early life beyond antimicrobial resistance, as well as the potential of precision vaccination approaches to optimize vaccine-mediated protection from infectious diseases.

Infants were enrolled in the study at the Women's and Children's Hospital Adelaide, Australia, between April 2017 and March 2021 as part of the Antibiotics and Immune Responses (AIR) study, a prospective, observational clinical study (ACTRN12617000856314). Potential participants were approached by study research nurses in postnatal wards and invited to participate if the mother and their infant met the study eligibility criteria. Study information had also been previously provided to women delivering at the Women's and Children's Hospital through pamphlets in antenatal care packs. Following written informed consent, stool collection packs were provided to families, and medical case notes were reviewed to confirm eligibility criteria and antibiotic exposure status. Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Women's and Children's Health Network (approval number HREC/17/WCHN/19), and the authors affirm that they have complied with all relevant ethical regulations.

Exclusion criteria were gestation of less than 37 weeks; maternal body mass index greater than 30 (at first-trimester antenatal visit); maternal sepsis (defined by laboratory-confirmed bacterial infection in blood cultures or cerebrospinal fluid) during pregnancy; infant delivered by caesarean section; confirmed sepsis in infant (defined by laboratory-confirmed bacterial infection in blood cultures or cerebrospinal fluid); known or suspected disorder of the immune system that would prevent an immune response to the vaccines, such as congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, or receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy; infant with suspected or confirmed HIV, major congenital abnormality or serious illness; maternal or infant participation in a clinical study that could interfere with participation in this study; and anything that would place the individual at increased risk or preclude their full compliance with or completion of the study. For immunogenicity analyses, only participants who received at least one vaccine at study visit 1 were included.

Participants were allocated to an antibiotic exposure group for immunogenicity analyses on the basis of medical record review and discussion with the mother to ascertain any antibiotic exposure before vaccination at study visit 1 (approximately 6 weeks of age). Antibiotic exposure groups were defined a priori as follows: infants with no direct or maternal antibiotic exposure (n = 80, No-ABX); (1) infants who received at least 48 h of antibiotic treatment in the neonatal period (the first 28 days after birth), with or without maternal antibiotic exposure (n = 32, Neo-ABX); (2) infants whose mothers received intrapartum antibiotics (within 28 days before or during delivery) and no direct infant antibiotic exposure up to 6 weeks of age (n = 49, IP-ABX); and (3) infants who did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the No-ABX, Neo-ABX or IP-ABX group. Upon study completion, all infants in group 3 were those who could have been exposed to maternal antibiotics during breastfeeding in the postnatal prevaccination period, so we called this group the postnatal exposure group (PN-ABX, n = 30). Researchers conducting the serological assays, omics analyses and other data analyses were blinded to antibiotic exposure group allocations. Participant data were recorded in a secure REDCap (https://project-redcap.org/) database.

Faecal samples for metagenomics were collected from the nappies (diapers) of each infant by parents at week 1 (days 2–10 of life) and week 6 (days 38–56 of life) and placed into Zymo DNA/RNA Shield faecal collection tubes (Zymo Research) before being stored at −80 °C. Blood (3–5 ml) was obtained from infants at approximately 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 7 months and 15 months. At 6 weeks, 1–3 ml of whole blood was placed into BD Vacutainer serum tubes, and 2 ml was placed in a PAXgene blood RNA tube (BD) for RNA preservation and stored at −80 °C. At 7 weeks, up to 1 ml of blood was collected in a BD Vacutainer K3 EDTA tube, 2 ml was collected for flow cytometry analysis, and the remainder (up to 2 ml) was placed into a PAXgene (BD) tube. At 7 months and 15 months, 3–5 ml of blood was collected into BD Vacutainer serum tubes.

Infants were vaccinated with PCV13 (Prevenar 13, Pfizer) and the combination 6-in-1 vaccine (Infanrix Hexa, GSK) at 6 weeks and 4 and 6 months of age and with the oral rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix, GSK) at 6 weeks and 4 months of age as per the NIP Schedule for South Australia as of 2017. Most of the infants (86%) were also vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine at birth (either H-B-Vax II Paediatric or Engerix B Paediatric). Infants in this study were also vaccinated with the meningococcal B vaccine (4CMenB/Bexsero, GSK) at 7 weeks, 4 months and 6 months of age, with a booster dose at 12 months of age. The meningococcal ACWY (Nimenrix, Pfizer) and the measles, mumps, rubella (M-M-R II, Merck Sharp & Dohme; or Priorix, GSK) vaccines were administered at 12 months of age as part of the standard NIP schedule (although antibody responses were not evaluated for these vaccines in this study). In this study, the booster dose of PCV13 was provided at 15 months rather than the current NIP scheduled time point of 12 months of age. All vaccines were administered intramuscularly except for the oral rotavirus vaccine. All vaccines were administered in line with Australian Immunisation Handbook recommendations.

Antibodies against PCV13 serotypes were measured as previously described13,15,16, with modifications. In brief, Bio-Plex COOH-microspheres (6.25 × 106, 500 µl, Bio-Rad) were conjugated overnight with optimized doses of DMTMM-modified pneumococcal polysaccharides (ATCC) in 1× PBS pH 7.2 (Life Technologies) as per Schlottmann et al.41. The optimal coating doses were a 1:1 dose, 500 µl microspheres with 500 µl DMTMM-modified polysaccharides for serotypes 1, 3, 5, 7F and 9V; and a 1:0.5 dose, 500 µl microspheres with 250 µl DMTMM-modified polysaccharides for serotypes 4, 6A, 6B, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F and 11A.

A ten-step, three-fold serial dilution of the international reference standard for human antipneumococcal capsule, 007sp (NIBSC), two in-house quality controls and test samples were diluted in adsorbent buffer containing 0.05% Tween-20, 2% N-butyl benzenesulfonamide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.5 µg ml−1 CWPS Multi (SSI Diagnostica) for 30 min to remove non-specific antibodies before incubation with polysaccharide-conjugated microspheres. Equal volumes (25 µl) of diluted samples and bead-mix containing 4,000 microspheres per region were combined on a MultiScreen filter plate (Merck) prewetted with 50 µl of 0.05% PBS with Tween-20 (PBS-T). Plates were incubated at room temperature in the dark on an orbital shaker at 500 rpm for 20 min. They were then washed twice with 100 µl 0.05% PBS-T, followed by addition of 100 µl (1:150) RPE-conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fc secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) and incubation for a further 20 min. Following washing, the beads were resuspended in 125 µl 0.05% PBS-T and read on a Bio-Plex-200 machine (Bio-Rad).

Antibody concentrations specific to pertussis toxoid, pertactin, filamentous haemagglutinin, tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid were measured as previously described14,42.

Antibodies against Hib-PRP and HB-sAg were measured as previously described for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP)14,42, changing only the antigen-coated microspheres, quality controls and reference sera used. In brief, DMTMM-modified41 Hib-PRP 12/306 (NIBSC) was conjugated to Bio-Plex COOH-microspheres (Bio-Rad) as outlined above for pneumococcal polysaccharides, with an optimal dose of 1:1, 500 µl microspheres with 500 µl DMTMM-modified polysaccharide. Recombinant HB-sAg subtype adr (Prospec Bio) was conjugated as previously described for DTP antigens, with an optimal coating concentration of 10 µg ml−1. A ten-step, three-fold serial dilution of the international standard for anti-H. influenzae type b, 09/222 (NIBSC), was used as the reference serum, after anti-HB-sAg titres had been determined in that serum. Anti-HB-sAg titres in 09/222 were quantified against the second international standard for anti-HB-sAg, 07/164 (NIBSC), using the final Bio-Plex protocol; they were further validated using the current gold-standard method, the Alinity i Anti-HBs kit (PathWest), which showed excellent concordance (coefficient of variation less than 5%).

Rotavirus IgA antibodies were measured by validated enzyme-linked immunoassay, as previously described17,18.

High and low vaccine responders were defined as infants with IgG titres in the 75th percentile and 25th percentile, respectively, for each of the antigens assessed.

Multiplex opsonophagocytosis assays were performed on three serotypes (6B, 9V and 18C) using a previously published method43,44. Serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min; then, serial dilutions were made, and 20 μl per well of each dilution was tested in duplicate in 96-well u-bottomed microtitre plates (Interpath Services). Serial three-fold dilutions were used. Frozen aliquots of target pneumococci were thawed, washed with opsonization buffer (HBSS with magnesium and calcium, and 0.1% gelatin), and diluted to approximately 5 × 104 CFU ml−1 of each serotype. All serotypes were then pooled in one bacterial suspension, and 10 μl of the bacterial suspension was added to each well. Plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking (mini Orbital Shaker; Bellco Biotechnology) at 700 rpm for 30 min. Then, 10 μl of baby rabbit complement and 40 μl of HL60 cells (approximately 1 × 107 cells ml−1) were then added to each well (the HL60 cells had been washed twice with HBSS before use). Plates were incubated in a tissue culture incubator (37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere) with shaking at 700 rpm. After 45 min, plates were placed on ice to stop the reaction, and 10 μl of the final reaction mixture was spotted onto Todd-Hewitt agar plates supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract. An overlay agar containing one of the selective antibiotics (selective markers for target bacteria) was added to one of each of the Todd-Hewitt agar plates, which was then incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The number of bacterial colonies was enumerated using a ProtoCol3 automatic colony counter (Synbiosis). Results were expressed as opsonization indices, defined as the interpolated dilutions of serum that killed 50% of bacteria. The lower limit of detection in the assay was 4. The opsonization indices of samples that did not kill 50% of bacteria were reported as 2 for purposes of analysis. A cut-off of 8 was used to define a positive response.

Human serum bactericidal activity assays were performed on 140 matched study participant serum samples (from blood draws at 6 weeks, 7 months and 15 months of the study) as described previously45. Briefly, heat-inactivated study participant sera were serially diluted two-fold in assay buffer and inoculated with approximately 1 × 103 CFU of N. meningitidis strain NZ98/254. Exogenous human complement (25% v/v, Pel-Freez Biologicals) was added, and assay microtitre plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 60 min; then, samples were plated on GC agar base plates prepared using the tilt method and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight to enable CFU enumeration. Bactericidal titres are reported as the reciprocal of the lowest dilution of participant serum that induced at least 50% killing relative to the no-serum control. The serologic correlate of protection for N. meningitidis is considered to be a human serum bactericidal activity titre greater than or equal to 4 (ref. 22). Statistical analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance and two-tailed paired Student's t-test.

For flow cytometry analysis, 450 µl of infant blood was transferred from a BD Vacutainer K3 EDTA tube into a sterile 10-ml tube within 3 h of collection, and red blood cells were lysed by addition of 4.5 ml of 1× BD Pharm Lyse for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 200g for 5 min, the supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml flow cytometry buffer and centrifuged again. Cells were subsequently resuspended in 150 µl flow cytometry buffer and divided equally into three tubes for staining. Fc receptors were first blocked using Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend) in Brilliant Stain Buffer (BD) for 10 min on ice. Three panels were designed for same-day flow cytometry analysis (see Supplementary Table 8 for a complete list of cell subsets identified in each panel). Panel 1 was a pan-leukocyte panel enabling identification of neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, eosinophils, basophils, T cells, B cells and natural killer cells. Cells were stained with a cocktail of anti-CD3 FITC (HIT3a, 1:20, BD Biosciences), anti-CD11c PE (B-ly6, 1:20, BD Biosciences), anti-HLA-DR APC-H7 (G46-6, 1:40, BD Biosciences), anti-CD15 V500 (HI98, 1:80, BD Biosciences), anti-CD45 BUV395 (HI30, 1:80, BD Biosciences), anti-CD16 BV421 (3G8, 1:143, BD Biosciences), anti-CD14 AF647 (Mop-9, 1:143, BD Biosciences), anti-CD123 BV711 (9F5, 1:143, BD Biosciences), anti-CD56 PE-Cy7 (5.1H11, 1:40, BioLegend), anti-CD19 BV605 (HIB19, 1:80, BioLegend), anti-CD20 BV786 (2H7, 1:80, BioLegend), anti-FcεRIα PerCP Cy5.5 (AER-37, 1:80, BioLegend) and anti-Siglec8 PE Dazzle (7C9, 1:143, BioLegend). Panel 2 enabled characterization of around 20 functional subsets of B and T cells including naive, central memory and effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells; regulatory T cells; and naive, memory and plasma B cells. The antibody cocktail consisted of anti-CD19 PE (HIB19, 1:10, BD Biosciences), anti-CCR7/CD197 AF647 (150503, 1:10, BD Biosciences), anti-CD127 BV421 (A019D5, 1:40, BioLegend), anti-CD38 BV510 (HIT2, 1:40, BD Biosciences), anti-HLA-DR APC-H7 (G46-6, 1:40, BD Biosciences), anti-CD3 BUV395 (UCHT1, 1:40, BD Biosciences), anti-CD4 BV605 (RPA-T4, 1:80, BD Biosciences), anti-CD8 Cy7 (RPA-T8, 1:80, BD Biosciences), anti-IgD PerCP Cy5.5 (IA6-2, 1:80, BD Biosciences), anti-CD27 BV711 (L128, 1:143, BD Biosciences), anti-CD25 PE Dazzle594 (M-A51, 1:80, BioLegend), anti-CD20 BV786 (2H7, 1:80, BioLegend), and anti-CD45RA FITC (HI100, 1:143, BioLegend). Panel 3 was designed to assess specific T helper (TH) subsets, including TH1, TH2, TH9, TH17, TH22 and natural killer T cells, using anti-CD3 BUV395 (UCHT1, 1:50, BD Biosciences), anti-CD4 BV605 (RPA-T4, 1:100, BD Biosciences), anti-CD8 PE Cy7 (RPA-T8, 1:100, BD Biosciences), anti-CXCR3 BV421 (1C6/CXCR3, 1:100, BD Biosciences), anti-CCR10 APC (1B5, 1:100, BD Biosciences), anti-CCCR6 BV711 (11A9, 1:50, BD Biosciences), anti-CCR4 PECF594 (1G1, 1:50, BD Biosciences), anti-CD45RA FITC (HI100, 1:100, BioLegend) and CD1d-Tet PBS57 PE (1:5,000, NIH). See Supplementary Table 8 for a comprehensive list of antibody sources, catalogue numbers and fluorophores.

After each antibody cocktail had been added, samples were incubated in the dark on ice for 30 min before being washed and resuspended in 300 µl of flow cytometry buffer. Panel 1 was added to a BD Trucount FACS tube (BD), whereas panels 2 and 3 were added to round-bottomed 5-ml FACS tubes alongside 10 µl liquid counting beads (BD). Counts were generated as previously described25. Dead cells were stained by addition of DNA binding dye DAPI and were excluded from analysis. Samples were run on a FACSymphony (BD) flow cytometer using FACSDiva software, and results were analysed using FlowJo v.10.6.1 (Tree Star).

RNA extraction and elimination of genomic DNA were carried out using a PAXgene Blood RNA kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's instructions, with final elution into 80 μl RNase-free water. A further RNA precipitation reaction was carried out. Briefly, RNA was resuspended in 2.5 × 100% ethanol and 10% sodium acetate and spun at 12,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were washed in 75% ethanol. Pellets were air-dried and resuspended in 40 µl of RNase-free water. The total RNA yield was determined using a Bioanalyzer 2100/TapeStation (Agilent) and Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Before library preparation, 0.2 ng of synthetic reference RNA standards (Sequins, Garvan Institute) were added to 250 ng of RNA.

Total RNA was converted to strand-specific Illumina-compatible sequencing libraries using a Nugen Universal Plus mRNA-Seq library kit from Tecan, with Any Deplete probes and custom gamma globin depletion per the manufacturer's instructions (MO1442 v.2). Briefly, 250 ng of total RNA was polyA-selected, and the mRNA was fragmented before reverse transcription. Any deplete and custom gamma globin depletion was performed before strand selection II complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis with pooled gamma depletion oligos, per the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was end-repaired, followed by ligation of Illumina-compatible barcoded sequencing adaptors. The cDNA libraries were strand-selected and PCR amplified for 12 cycles before quality control assessment using a TapeStation (Agilent Technologies). Library concentrations were assessed using a Qubit fluorescence assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequencing pools were generated by mixing equimolar amounts of compatible sample libraries on the basis of the Qubit measurements. The library pool was sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S1 flow cell with 2 × 100-bp paired-end reads.

Sequence read quality was assessed using FastQC v.0.11.4 (ref. 46) and summarized with MultiQC v.1.8 (ref. 47), followed by quality control with Trimmomatic v.0.38 (ref. 48) with a window size of 4 and an average quality score of 25. Reads of fewer than 50 nucleotides after trimming were discarded. Reads that passed all quality control steps were then aligned to the human genome (GRCh38) using HISAT2 v.2.1.0 (ref. 49). The gene count matrix was generated with FeatureCounts version 1.5.0-p2 (ref. 50) using the union model with Ensembl v.93 annotation. Data were then imported into R v.4.2.0 for further analysis. Counts were normalized using the trimmed mean of M values method in EdgeR v.3.38 (ref. 40), followed by multidimensional scaling analysis and differential gene expression analysis performed with the glmLRT function. For differential expression analysis comparing week 6 and week 7, a paired design was used, fitting each participant into the model as well as each time point. As each participant's samples were processed together, this intrinsically controlled for batch effects. For non-paired comparisons, processing batch and infant sex were fitted into the model to adjust for those effects. Unknown sources of variation were identified using svaseq v.3.46.0 (ref. 38) and adjusted for before multidimensional scaling and gene set variation analysis. The gene count matrix was filtered to remove genes with a count per million of less than 5 in 15 samples before differential expression analysis. The Benjamini–Hochberg method was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Gene set enrichment analysis was carried out using the fgsea R package v.1.22.0 (ref. 39) with predefined BTMs24, with input ranks as fold changes calculated by edgeR. Gene set variation analysis was used to calculate a per-sample activity score for each of the BTMs (excluding unannotated modules labelled ‘TBA') using R Bioconductor package GSVA v.1.44.1 (ref. 51). Spearman correlation analysis was performed using the Hmisc v.4.7-0 package in R v.4.2.

Two millilitres of the faecal suspension from the Zymo DNA/RNA Shield faecal collection tube (Zymo Research) was transferred into a sterile microcentrifuge tube and pelleted by centrifugation at 16,200g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then removed, and DNA extraction was performed on the faecal pellet using the PowerLyzer PowerSoil Kit protocol (Qiagen) as described previously52.

Total bacterial load in the samples was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene using a SYBR-based assay, as described previously53. Each qPCR reaction comprised 1× PowerUP SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.2 µM of each forward and reverse primer, and 1 µl of DNA in a 35-µl total reaction volume. Each reaction was then aliquoted into three technical replicates of 10 μl for qPCR analysis. Numbers of 16S rRNA gene copies were calculated on the basis of a standard curve generated by serial dilutions of Escherichia coli genomic DNA and normalized against the faecal weight (in mg) of each sample.

Shotgun metagenomics libraries were generated as previously described with modifications54. Briefly, libraries were generated for samples with a DNA concentration of at least 0.2 ng µl−1 using a Nextera DNA XT Library Preparation Kit and indexed using a Nextera XT Index Kit v.2 (Illumina). Quality control checks for DNA fragment size following PCR enrichment were performed using a DNA 1000 chip on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). All libraries with a concentration of 5 nM and above were pair-end sequenced (2 × 151 bp) on the NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina).

Read quality was assessed using FastQC v.0.11.4 (ref. 46) and summarized with MultiQC v.1.8 (ref. 47). Adaptors were removed with cutadapt v.1.18, and quality-filtering and trimming were performed using Trimmomatic v.0.38 (ref. 48) with a window size of 4, average quality score of 25 and minimum length of 50 nucleotides. The percentage of human DNA per sample was estimated using Kraken2 v.2.1.1 (ref. 55). MAG bins were generated by assembling each of the 409 samples individually using metaSPAdes v.3.15.2 (ref. 56). Reads were then aligned back to this assembly catalogue, and the mapped output was used for binning with MetaBAT2 v.2.15 (ref. 57). Counts per bin were then calculated on the basis of SAM files output from bowtie2 v.2.5.0. Each MAG bin was taxonomically classified using GTDB-Tk v.2.1.0 and reference data release 207 (ref. 58). This MAG bin count matrix was then imported into R for further analyses. Count data were transformed to relative abundances before being visualized using bar plots and were normalized by CLR elsewhere as implemented in R library PhyloSeq v.1.28. Differential abundance analysis was performed with LinDA as implemented in R library MicrobiomeStat v.1.18 with raw count data as input. Counts were filtered for taxa detected in at least 5% of samples before testing with the prev.filter flag in LinDA59. Spearman correlation analyses were performed using functions in base R with the CLR-normalized data as input. Alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed in R using PhyloSeq v.1.28 (ref. 60). Metagenomic samples were clustered into CSTs with Dirichlet multinomial mixture modelling (R package DirichletMultinomial v.1.38.0), with the optimal number of clusters calculated using the lowest LaPlace approximation. Quality-filtered reads were also used as input to HUMAnN v.3.0 (ref. 61) for generation of microbial pathway data and summed to represent counts for each MetaCyc pathway and gene ontology term (biological processes only). Pathway count data were also CLR-normalized. To account for variation in 16S rRNA copy numbers between samples, which could have biased qPCR estimates of bacterial load, a mean copy number per sample was calculated on the basis of the species-level relative abundance profiles from the shotgun metagenomic data and the copy number from rrnDB62. Antimicrobial resistance genes were analysed by prediction of the encoded protein sequences from MAGs using prodigal v.2.6.3, clustering at 95% identity with cd-hit v.4.8.1, and conversion to amino acid sequences using transseq to generate a non-redundant predicted protein catalogue. The non-redundant catalogue was aligned to the Comprehensive Antibiotics Resistance Database (v.3.2.7) using the Resistance Gene Identifier (v.5.2.1) with default parameters except the addition of ‘–exclude_nudge'. Per-gene counts were generated by aligning reads using bowtie2 against the gene catalogue and generating a per-sample count with SAMtools v.1.17. Reads per kilobase per million mapped reads values were generated in R, summed by antibiotic class and compared between groups using a Wilcoxon rank sum test, controlling for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Causal mediation analysis was performed in R with the mediation R package (v.4.5.0)28.

C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory; RRID: IMSR_JAX:000664) were bred and maintained under specific and opportunistic pathogen free (SPF) conditions or gnotobiotic conditions at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI). SPF mice were kept in cages with free access to commercial pelleted food and water and were housed under standardized conditions with regulated daylight, humidity and temperature. Gnotobiotic (GF) C57BL/6 mice (Translational Research Institute) were housed in positively pressurized HEPA-filtered isolators at the SAHMRI Preclinical, Imaging and Research Laboratories (PIRL) with access to autoclaved commercially pelleted food and sterilized water ad libitum, with regulated 12 h day/night and regulated humidity (45–75%) and temperature (18–24 °C). All experiments were carried out in accordance with protocols approved by the SAHMRI Animal Ethics Committee. Each vaccine experiment was conducted as an independent experiment. Equal numbers of male and female mice were used. Young mice (aged approximately 3 weeks) or dams (aged 8–16 weeks) and pups were randomized to the treatment groups. Investigators were not blinded to the mouse treatment groups. The appropriate sample size for the murine experiments was determined on the basis of data from our previous mouse vaccine experiments.

GF mouse dams and their pups remained GF (as determined by culturing of faecal samples and 16S rRNA gene qPCR) or were colonized as previously described63 by means of oral gavage with a consortium of Bifidobacterium species consisting of B. breve (DSM 20213, Leibniz Institute), B. longum subspecies longum (DSM 20219) and B. longum subspecies infantis (DSM 20088) at approximately 14 days postcoitus (E14) and at day 7 and day 14 postbirth. Successful colonization was confirmed by culturing and Sanger sequencing. For culturing, Bifidobacterium isolates were plated on MRS agar (Thermo Fisher Scientific) enriched with 1 mg ml−1 cysteine, and single colonies were isolated, confirmed using a MALDI Biotyper (Bruker) and cultured for 48 h at 37 °C using BD GasPak pouch systems (BD). To assess whether administration of a commercially available probiotic could restore antibody responses to PCV13, GF mice were colonized by means of oral gavage at day 21 of life with 2 × 107 CFU L. acidophilus and B. bifidum isolated from commercial probiotic Infloran (Laboratorio Farmaceutico). Further GF mice were similarly colonized with 2 × 107 CFU with each of the strains individually. L. acidophilus and B. bifidum cultures were prepared by serially diluting Infloran on to MRS agar plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) enriched with cysteine for L. acidophilus or reinforced clostridial agar (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for B. bifidum, under anaerobic conditions. Single colonies were identified using a MALDI Biotyper (Bruker). Further GF mice, aged 21 days, were colonized with Lactobacillus murinus (DSM 20452), Enterococcus gallinarum (DSM 24841), Akkermansia muciniphila (DSM 22959), Bacteriodes acidifaciens (DSM 15896), Blautia producta (DSM 2950), Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 202195, The Global Bioresource Centre) or Enterobacter cloacae1.

To produce littermate wild-type and knockout mice for the experiments in Myd88−/−, Tlr2−/− and Tlr4−/− mice, pairs of heterozygous Myd88+/−, Tlr2+/− and Tlr4+/− dams (8–12 weeks of age) were bred with heterozygous studs. Equal numbers of wild-type and knockout offspring were cohoused for studies.

Mice were vaccinated with 3 μg PCV13 (Pfizer), 8 μg Infanrix Hexa combination vaccine (GSK) or 17.5 μg Bexsero meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (GSK) intraperitoneally at day 28 postbirth and boosted with the same dose 2 weeks later. Control mice were mock-vaccinated with 100 μl of PBS. Four to eight sex-matched mice per group were vaccinated or mock-vaccinated in each experiment. Sera were collected 2 and 4 weeks postimmunization in each experiment and also at 6 and 8 weeks in selected experiments.

Faecal samples were collected from mice at the start of each experiment and at each experimental time point to confirm the GF or colonization status of the mice. Faecal pellets were aseptically collected, immediately snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C.

Faecal samples were individually weighed, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.2) by vortexing and pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000g for 5 min. Microbial DNA extraction was performed on the faecal pellets using a DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (Qiagen) with the following minor modifications: faecal pellets were resuspended in 750 μl of PowerSoil bead solution and 60 μl solution C1 in a PowerSoil bead plate and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min before bead beating as per previously described protocols63.

Murine faecal DNA extracts were used to generate amplicons of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene as described previously63. Sequencing of the amplicon library was performed using an Illumina MiSeq system (2 × 300-bp run). Paired-end 16S rRNA gene sequences were demultiplexed and imported into QIIME2 (release 2023.2) for processing64. Sequences were error-corrected, and counts of error-corrected reads per sample, which we refer to herein as exact sequence variants, were generated with DADA2 (ref. 65). Taxonomy was assigned to sequences with the sklearn plugin for QIIME2 with an 80% confidence threshold, using the SILVA v.138 database66. Exact sequence variant counts were converted to relative abundance, which was plotted in R v.4.2.0 with ggplot2 v.3.3.6.

Real-time PCR was performed on a Quant Studio 7 Flex Real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using primers that targeted conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene as described in ref. 67. Each reaction comprised 5 μl of SYBR Green qPCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.2 μM of each forward and reverse primer, 1 μl of DNA template and sterile water to a total reaction volume of 22 μl. A no-template DNA control, with the DNA substituted with 1 μl sterile water, was included in each run. Real-time PCR reactions for each sample were performed in duplicate, consisting of 10 μl per reaction. The amplification program was 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Melting curve analysis was performed at the end of the program. The total bacterial load in each sample was quantified against a standard curve of serial dilutions of E. coli genomic DNA, which were performed in the same run, and was detectable within a range of 3 to 3 × 106-equivalent E. coli cells. Numbers of cells were then calculated against the faecal weight used for each sample. A Mann–Whitney test was used to assess statistical significance.

Levels of antigen-specific IgGtotal IgG1, IgG2c, IgG3 and IgM were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum collected from each vaccine experiment. Briefly, Nunc MaxiSorp ELISA plates (Sigma) were coated either with CRM197 (0.5 μg ml−1, Finabio), PCV13 vaccine (0.05 μg ml−1, Pfizer), pneumococcal polysaccharide (4 μg ml−1 PPS1, 161-X, ATCC), PPS3 (4 μg ml−1 169-X, ATCC), PPS6B (4 μg ml−1 105-X, ATCC), PPS9V (4 μg ml−1 305-X, ATCC) or diphtheria toxoid (1 μg ml−1, List Biological Laboratories), tetanus toxoid (1 μg ml−1, List Biological Laboratories), pertussis toxoid (1 μg ml−1, List Biological Laboratories) or Bexsero vaccine (2 μg ml−1, GSK). Plates were washed with 0.5% Tween-20/PBS and blocked with 1× ELISA buffer (eBioscience). Mouse serum samples were diluted in 1× ELISA buffer and incubated on blocked plates. Antigen-specific serum antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies: anti-mouse IgG (Novex) or anti-mouse IgG1 (Abcam) at a dilution of 1:1,000 or IgG2c, IgG3 or IgM (Abcam) at 1:500. HRP activity was detected using tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stopped with 2 N H2SO4. Developed plates were recorded using a Synergy HTX microplate absorbance reader (BioTek) at 450 nm with correction at 595 nm by subtraction. Data were analysed using Prism 10 (GraphPad).

Single-cell suspensions of murine spleen or lymph nodes were prepared by mechanical dissociation and filtration through a 70-µm nylon filter (Merck Millipore). Cells were stained with Fixable Viability Stain 780 (BD Biosciences) and murine Fc-blocking antibody clone 2.4G2 (1:100, BD Biosciences) in PBS for 15 min. Cells were washed and then stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies in FACS buffer (PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM EDTA) against CD3 (142-C11, 1:300, BD Biosciences), CD4 (RM4, 1:300, BD Biosciences), CD8 (53-6.7, 1:600, BD Biosciences), CD19 (1D3, 1:300, BD Biosciences), CD38 (90, 1:600, BioLegend), CD44 (IM7, 1:600, BD Biosciences), CD62L (MEL-14, 1:600, BD Biosciences), CD95 (J02, 1:300,BD Biosciences), CD138 (281-2, 1:600, BD Biosciences), B220 (RA3-6B2, 1:600, BD Biosciences), CXCR5 (L138D7, 1:200, BioLegend), GL7 (GL7, 1:600, BD Biosciences), IgD (11-26 c.2a, 1:300, BioLegend), IgM (R6-60.2, 1:300, BD Biosciences), PD-1 (RMP1-30, 1:300, BD Biosciences) and streptavidin-PECF549 (1:400, BioLegend).

For assessment of CRM+ GC B cells, cells were stained with Fixable Viability Stain 780 (1:1000, BD) and murine Fc block (1:100, BD) in PBS for 15 min; then, they were washed and incubated with biotinylated CRM (1:100, Fina BioSolutions) in FACS buffer. Surface antibody cocktails were added directly after staining for 20 min at 4 °C. Data were acquired on a BD FACS Symphony and analysed using FlowJo v.10. For assessment of CD86, CD80 and MCHII expression, single-cell suspensions of spleen or lymph nodes were stained with Zombie Aqua Fixable Viability Stain 780 (1:1000, BioLegend) and murine Fc-blocking antibody clone 2.4G2 (1:100, BD Biosciences) in PBS for 15 min. Cells were washed and then stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies in FACS buffer (PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM EDTA) against CD19 (ID3, 1:200, BD), CD3 (145-2C11, 1:150, BD Biosciences), CD8 (53-6.7, 1:200, BD), NK1.1 (PK136, 1:200, BD), Ly6G (1A8, 1:600, BD), B220 (RA3-6B2, 1:3000, BD), CD11b (M1/70, 1:500, BD), CD11c (HL3, 1:400, BD Biosciences), MHCII (M5/114.15.2, 1:150, Miltenyi), CD86 (PO3.3, 1:150, Miltenyi) and CD80 (16-10A1, 1:150, Tonbo Biosciences).

Mediastinal lymph nodes were fixed in 1 ml 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 4 h and then incubated in 1 ml 30% sucrose solution overnight at 4 °C before being embedded in OCT (Tissue Tek) as described previously68. Slides were blocked in blocking buffer (normal goat serum 4% v/v (Southern Cross Science), normal donkey serum 4% v/v (Stratech Scientific APAC) and bovine serum albumin 15% v/v (AusGeneX)) for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were permeabilized with Triton X-100 2% v/v (Sigma) and stained with CD16/32 (1:100, BD Biosciences) and CD21/35 clone 7E9 (1:200), GL7 (1:200), CD3 clone 17A2 (1:200) and IgD clone 11-26c.2a (1:200) (all from BioLegend). Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP8X confocal microscope and analysed using Fiji69 in ImageJ.

The primary objective of the AIR study was to determine whether antibody responses to the PCV13 vaccine at 7 months of age were different between antibiotic-exposed and unexposed groups, specifically comparing the following:

The percentage of participants achieving a seroprotective antibody response (greater than or equal to 0.35 μg ml−1) against pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes in the PCV13 vaccine at approximately 7 months of age.

Geometric mean concentrations in μg ml−1 of anti-PPS IgG as measured by serum assay at approximately 7 months of age.

As secondary outcomes, we compared PCV13 vaccine responses at 15 months of age and antibody responses to the Infanrix Hexa 6-in-1 vaccine (6-in-1, DTPa-HepB-IPV-Hib) and the Rotarix oral rotavirus vaccine in antibody-exposed and unexposed infants at both time points. Multivariable linear regression adjusting for baseline prevaccination titres and sex was used to test for any association between antibiotic exposure group and IgG geometric mean concentrations for each of the vaccine antigens assessed. Further longitudinal analyses were conducted by fitting a mixed effects multivariable linear regression, including a random effect for participant ID, to assess the interaction between time point and antibiotic exposure group on IgG geometric mean concentrations for each of the vaccine antigens. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test for any association between antibiotic exposure group and the proportion of infants achieving a seroprotective response. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. Further sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of associations to adjustment for probiotic consumption, formula consumption, baseline IgG/IgA concentration, infant sex and gestation at delivery. The AIR study also included a range of exploratory systems immunology assessments for which analyses were undertaken in line with best practices for each data type and as described in the sections above. Measurements were taken from distinct samples. All statistical tests throughout were two-sided; the specific statistical analyses used are specified in the figure legends.

Metrics details

Deracemization is an emerging strategy for generating enantioenriched compounds wherein the two enantiomers of a readily available racemic starting material are transformed into a single enantiomer, typically through the action of a light-induced catalyst1,2. Excellent proof of principle for this potentially powerful approach to asymmetric catalysis has been described3,4,5,6,7,8; nevertheless, substantial challenges have not yet been addressed, including the exploitation of carbon–heteroatom (rather than only carbon–hydrogen and carbon–carbon) bond cleavage to achieve deracemization, as well as the development of processes that provide broad classes of useful enantioenriched compounds and tetrasubstituted stereocentres. Here we describe a straightforward method that addresses these challenges, using a chiral copper catalyst, generated in situ from commercially available components, to achieve the photoinduced deracemization of tertiary (and secondary) alkyl halides through carbon–halogen bond cleavage. Mechanistic studies (including the independent synthesis of postulated intermediates, photophysical, spectroscopic and reactivity studies, and density functional theory calculations) provide support for the key steps and intermediates in our proposed catalytic cycle, as well as insight into the origin of enantioselectivity.

Metrics details

Glucose metabolic enzymes and their metabolites not only provide energy and building blocks for synthesizing macromolecules but also possess non-canonical or moonlighting functions in response to extracellular and intracellular signalling. These moonlighting functions modulate various cellular activities, including gene expression, cell cycle progression, DNA repair, autophagy, senescence and apoptosis, cell proliferation, remodelling of the tumour microenvironment and immune responses. These functions integrate glucose metabolism with other essential cellular activities, driving cancer progression. Targeting these moonlighting functions could open new therapeutic avenues and lead to cancer-specific treatments.

Metrics details

The solute carrier protein SLC19A1 is crucial for transporting folate nutrients, antifolate chemotherapeutics, and more recently cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) immune transmitters, influencing various physiological and pathological processes. While the inward-open state of human SLC19A1 (hSLC19A1) has been previously described, key aspects regarding its conformational dynamics, substrate selectivity, and precise mechanisms underlying CDNs transport remain elusive. Using an antibody-facilitated conformation screening strategy, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of hSLC19A1 in its outward-open state with and without bound substrates, revealing detailed mechanisms of substrate recognition and conformational changes during transport. We identify both general and specific features for folate/antifolate recognition, including an SLC19A1-specific pocket for accommodating γ-carboxylate-modified antifolates. Intriguingly, CDNs bind as monomers within the canonical pocket of outward-open hSLC19A1, contrasting with dimeric binding in inward-open structures. Together with functional assays, these findings provide a framework for developing antifolate drugs and CDN-targeted therapies, advancing our understanding of SLC19A1's physiological and therapeutic functions.

Folate, an essential nutrient for mammalian growth and development, acts as a crucial one-carbon unit donor in fundamental metabolic processes and plays pivotal roles in synthesizing key biomolecules such as thymidine, purine nucleotides, serine, and methionine1,2. The solute carrier protein SLC19A1, also known as the reduced folate carrier, has been extensively studied for its role in folate transport over several decades3,4,5. Additionally, SLC19A1 facilitates the transport of antifolate drugs, such as methotrexate and pemetrexed, which are widely used in the treatment of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis6. Interestingly, recent studies have unveiled a novel function of SLC19A1 in the transport of cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs)7,8. CDNs serve as pivotal immune signaling molecules capable of eliciting broad downstream immune responses by binding to the stimulator of interferon genes (STING)9,10,11,12,13. SLC19A1 transports not only mammalian endogenous CDN: 2'3'-cGAMP synthesized by cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)14,15,16, but also bacterial CDN and synthetic CDN-type drugs11,17,18,19. The dual role of SLC19A1 in folate/antifolate and CDN transport underscores its significance in fundamental metabolism, infection, immunopathology, cancer chemotherapy, and immunotherapy4,5,20,21,22.

In line with the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) fold, SLC19A1 comprises 12 transmembrane (TM) helixes, with TM1-6 forming the N-terminal domain (NTD) and TM7-12 constituting the C-terminal domain (CTD)23. The transmembrane transport of substrates by MFS protein normally occurs through a rocker-switch rotation model, wherein the two domains undergo conformational changes from an outward-open to an inward-open state24. Previous cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies have provided insights into the substrate binding details of human SLC19A1 (hSLC19A1) in its inward-open state, with folate and antifolate binding as monomers within a canonical pocket25,26,27 and CDNs forming a compact dimeric unit within a non-canonical cavity25. However, all the reported structures exhibit the same inward-open conformation, leaving unresolved questions about how hSLC19A1 changes conformation and recognizes substrates during the transport cycle. Moreover, it is still unclear whether the captured CDN dimer in the inward-open state represents the actual form in which CDNs are transported by hSLC19A1 or just a potential substrate binding mode, since CDNs are not located in the typical pocket of SLC proteins25. Therefore, whether CDNs are transported in the dimeric form remains an open question25. Further structural studies of hSLC19A1 in complex with different substrates at the outward-open conformation are warranted to fully elucidate the transport cycle and diverse substrate recognition mechanisms of hSLC19A1, thereby advancing understanding of its physiological roles and potential therapeutic implications.

Previously reported hSLC19A1 structures all exhibit the inward-open conformation, suggesting that purified hSLC19A1 may have a preference for this state in vitro. To capture hSLC19A1 in other conformations, we sought to systematically introduce mutations at the NTD-CTD interface aimed at destabilizing the inward-open state without affecting the substrate recognition tunnel. By taking advantage of our previously isolated inward-open specific antibody to hSLC19A1 (mAb70#)25, we were able to efficiently distinguish the conformation of each mutant in cells using flow cytometry, rather than going through tedious purification and structure determination procedures for each sample (Fig. 1a). In addition, we also generated two conformation-unspecific antibodies recognizing linear epitopes as control antibodies, mAb5# and mAb6#, targeting the disordered N-terminal tail and intracellular loop between TM6 and TM7 (IL6-7), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Subsequent flow cytometry results show that, among multiple mutants tested, the G307F mutation completely disrupts the binding between hSLC19A1 and mAb70# while leaving interactions with mAb5# and mAb6# unaffected (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). Size-exclusion chromatography experiments with purified hSLC19A1WT and hSLC19A1G307F further confirm these results (Supplementary Fig. 1d, e). Consistently, the 3H-labelled antifolate uptake of hSLC19A1G307F is abolished in the cellular uptake assay (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2), highlighting that the G307F mutation may have trapped hSLC19A1 in a conformation other than the inward-open state.

hSLC19A1 is a relatively small membrane protein and lacks rigid soluble domains, making it challenging for high-resolution structure determination. To facilitate cryo-EM reconstructions, we designed a hSLC19A1G307F construct carrying an N-terminal BRIL domain and a C-terminal specific nanobody (termed hSLC19A1EM-G307F; Supplementary Fig. 3a), both of which can specifically bind to a widely used anti-BRIL Fab fragment. In this way, the subsequent addition of anti-BRIL Fab may bridge the N- and C-terminus of hSLC19A1 together, thereby enhancing sample stability and facilitating cryo-EM particle alignment. It should be noted that the N- and C-terminal fusions to the wild-type protein still largely preserve the substrate cellular uptake activity (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3b), suggesting that the fusion strategy per se does not significantly affect hSLC19A1 function.

To verify the conformational details of the engineered protein, we reconstituted the complex of hSLC19A1EM-G307F and anti-BRIL Fab (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d) and successfully determined its cryo-EM structure at a resolution of 2.94 Å (Fig. 1c-e, Supplementary Fig. 3e–i and Supplementary Table 1). The density is of sufficient quality to trace the transmembrane regions of hSLC19A1 from residues 24 to 457 (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Some parts of the intracellular loop between TM6 and TM7 (IL6-7, residues 213-248) and the extracellular loop between TM7 and TM8 (EL7-8, residues 295-302) were not observed in the cryo-EM map, possibly due to the dynamic nature of these regions (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, in contrast to previously reported structures, the engineered hSLC19A1 adopts an outward-open conformation (Fig. 1d). In this conformation, TM1 and TM2 tilt away from TM7 and TM8, exposing the entrance to a large solvent-accessible and highly conserved cavity that extends more than halfway across the cell membrane (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Characterized by a narrow extracellular entrance, the upper portion of the cavity extends toward the NTD and presents an overall negative electrostatic surface (Fig. 1e). Conversely, the lower half of the cavity contracts and shows an overall positive charge, consistent with the anionic properties of CDN and folate (Fig. 1e). On the intracellular side, TM4 and TM5, along with TM10 and TM11, snugly interlock to seal the cavity from the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Additionally, IL2-3, IL4-5, IL6-7 and IL10-11 closely associate to further stabilize the outward-open conformation (Supplementary Fig. 4c).

Domain-wise alignments between outward- and inward-open structures of hSLC19A1 show that the alternate access is achieved through a rocker-switch motion of the NTD and CTD domains. Individual NTD and CTD of outward-open hSLC19A1 align well with those in inward-open state, with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values of 0.69 Å over 168 Cα atoms and 0.71 Å over 155 Cα atoms, respectively (Fig. 1f). Both domains of hSLC19A1 rotate relative to an axis perpendicular to the membrane plane by approximately 18°, allowing the transmembrane regions to remain embedded within the membrane (Fig. 1g). The highly conserved and functionally important N-terminal region of IL6-728 (aa203-aa212), which is tightly embedded in a surface groove formed by the intracellular ends of TM2, TM3, TM4 and TM11, also undergoes relative motion to accommodate the movement of CTD in the outward-open state (Supplementary Fig. 4d). In the current outward-open conformation, three pairs of hydrogen bonds (Gln150-Ala324/Val327 and Arg157-Gln377) and a set of hydrophobic interactions (Phe141-Ala388-Phe400), presumably contribute to the closure of the intracellular gate (Fig. 1h, i). Interestingly, structural superimposition with the inward-open structure reveals dramatic conformational changes in Phe141, Gln150 and Arg157, which would disrupt the intracellular gate and trigger the closure of the extracellular gate as well as the release of substrates (Fig. 1i and Supplementary Fig. 4e). To validate these structural observations, we substituted these gate residues and assessed the cellular uptake of 3H-labelled antifolate in SLC19A1−/− HeLa cells stably expressing either wild-type or mutant hSLC19A1. The F141S and R157A substitutions nearly abolish antifolate uptake, Q150A, A388S and F400S reduce antifolate uptake by about 70–80%, and Q377A decreases the activity by around 25% (Fig. 1j, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4f).

Our structure also provides a detailed explanation of why the G307F single point mutation drives conformational changes (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). In the inward-open hSLC19A1 structure, Gly307 on TM8 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of Gln172 on TM5 (Supplementary Fig. 4g). However, by wedging into the lateral interface between NTD and CTD, Phe307 disrupts the hydrogen bond and stacks with Gln172 to lock the outward-open conformation (Supplementary Fig. 4g). To check whether substitutions of Gly307 with residues of different side chain sizes can enable hSLC19A1 in alternative intermediate states of the transport cycle, we further generated G307W, G307S, and G307A mutations. Cryo-EM analysis shows that G307W and G307S both adopt the same outward-open structures as observed with G307F, while a smaller side chain mutation G307A maintains the inward-open conformation similar to the wild-type protein (Supplementary Fig. 4h). These results suggest that the outward- and inward-open conformations likely represent two relatively stable states of the SLC19A1 transport cycle.

While previous studies have provided insights into the interaction pattern of inward-open hSLC19A1 with folate and antifolate, a comprehensive understanding of the transport cycle of these substrates necessitates further structural elucidation. Therefore, using the aforementioned engineering strategy, we determined the cryo-EM structures of outward-open hSLC19A1 in complex with the reduced folate 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) and the antifolate methotrexate (MTX) at resolutions of 3.43 Å and 3.44 Å, respectively (Fig. 2a–f, Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 1).

5-MTHF is a predominant natural folate in diet and blood and plays a crucial role in normal metabolism and development. The well-resolved density map reveals that 5-MTHF is situated at the polar cavity in an approximately upright conformation, with its long axis aligned parallel to the transmembrane helices (Fig. 2a–c, g and Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Anchored by hydrogen bonds with Thr49 of TM1 and Glu123 of TM4 (Fig. 2h), the pterin moiety of 5-MTHF inserts diagonally into the upper negatively charged pocket within the NTD (Fig. 2c). The pterin ring and methyl group establish extensive hydrophobic contacts with Glu45/Ile48 of TM1, Leu72 of TM2 and Tyr126 of TM4 (Fig. 2i). Meanwhile, the benzoyl moiety extends downward perpendicular to the plane of the pterin ring, forming a hydrogen bond with Arg133 of TM4, along with hydrophobic interactions with Tyr126/Met130 of TM4 and Tyr286 of TM7 (Fig. 2h, i). In addition, the glutamate moiety faces the intracellular side and reaches the positively charged region (Fig. 2c, h). The β-carboxylate group faces the CTD and interacts with Tyr281 of TM7, Arg373 and Gln377 of TM10, while the γ-carboxylate group turns back towards the NTD and interacts with Arg133 of TM4 (Fig. 2c, h).

It is noteworthy that SLC19A1 shows a pronounced preference for reduced folate over folic acid4. Compared to folic acid, 5-MTHF contains an additional methyl group at position N5 (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Our previous inward-open structure reveals that this extra methyl group is embedded in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Glu45, Ile48 and Tyr126, thereby enhancing the affinity of 5-MTHF for hSLC19A125. Although the overall binding site and interaction mode between 5-MTHF and the current outward-open hSLC19A1 are similar to those of the inward-open structure, the detailed conformations of the pterin ring, benzoyl and glutamate moieties of 5-MTHF exhibit notable differences (Fig. 2g). Specifically, the pterin ring of 5-MTHF rotates ~180° with the N5 methyl group serving as the pivot, maintaining the methyl group within the hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 2g, i). The benzoyl and glutamate moieties also undergo appropriate adjustments accordingly (Fig. 2g). These findings highlight the contribution of the N5 methyl group to the reduced folate selectivity preference of SLC19A1 and indicate that 5-MTHF likely possesses some degree of flexibility to accommodate the transport cycle.

MTX is a widely used antifolate drug for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Consistent with the 5-MTHF-bound structure, MTX also adopts an upright conformation and binds within the central cavity, with the pteridine ring occupying the electronegative pocket at NTD and the glutamate moiety extending toward the electropositive region (Fig. 2d–f and Supplementary Fig. 6c). The interactions between MTX and the outward-open hSLC19A1 are similar to those of 5-MTHF (Supplementary Fig. 6d, e). Interestingly, in the previously reported inward-open hSLC19A1 structure bound to an N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-conjugated MTX26, the glutamate moiety of MTX was covalently linked to Lys411 of TM11 via NHS-mediated crosslinking, resulting in a 180° rotation of the glutamate and benzoyl groups when aligning the NTD of SLC19A1 of the two structures (Fig. 2j). These results indicate that the glutamate moiety of antifolate exhibits high dynamics within the electropositive cavity to accommodate the binding and dissociation with hSLC19A1.

The residues lining the binding sites for 5-MTHF and MTX are highly conserved among vertebrates (Supplementary Fig. 7). To investigate the contribution of the observed SLC19A1-substrate interactions, we introduced mutations into the corresponding residues of hSLC19A1 (Supplementary Fig. 2) and examined the effects on cellular 3H-labelled antifolate uptake. The representative substitutions lead to a substantial reduction in antifolate uptake, with E123A, R133A and R373A mutations almost abolishing the activity (Fig. 2k). Furthermore, the initial-rate analysis confirms the critical roles of representative residues for folate/antifolate recognition (Supplementary Fig. 4f).

Tumor cells tend to use different types of folate transporters to sustain the elevated folate levels necessary for their rapid growth. Studies have shown that SLC19A1 primarily functions in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and osteosarcoma3,29,30. In contrast, SLC46A1 (also known as proton-coupled folate transporter, PCFT), another crucial pathway for folate and antifolate drug delivery, is prominently expressed in solid tumors, particularly in breast, lung and ovarian tumor cell lines4,31,32,33. The widely used antifolate drugs, including MTX and pemetrexed (PMX), can be absorbed by healthy cells through both SLC19A1 and SLC46A1, resulting in significant cytotoxicity34. Therefore, selective targeting of SLC19A1 or SLC46A1 through designer drugs would facilitate more effective treatments while mitigating cytotoxic effects35.

The γ-carboxylate groups of folates and antifolates have been demonstrated to be important for their uptake by SLC19A1 and SLC46A125,33. However, PT523, an atypical antifolate featuring a substituted γ-carboxylate (Supplementary Fig. 8a), emerges as an even more favorable substrate for SLC19A1 while exhibiting minimal transport by SLC46A14,36,37. To elucidate the SLC19A1-specific recognition mechanism of PT523, we determined the cryo-EM structure of outward-open hSLC19A1 in complex with PT523 at a resolution of 3.25 Å (Fig. 3a–c, Supplementary Fig. 8b–g and Supplementary Table 1). The cryo-EM density is of high quality and corresponds well to the molecular shape of PT523 (Supplementary Fig. 8a, g). An additional smeared density was also observed near PT523 in the pocket, likely due to non-specific attachment, which diminishes with decreasing PT523 concentration during cryo-EM sample preparation (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). Similar to 5-MTHF, PT523 is tightly embedded in the central polar cavity with its long axis aligning parallel to the transmembrane helices (Fig. 3b, c and Supplementary Fig. 9c). The pteridine ring of PT523 occupies the electronegative pocket of the NTD, forming interactions with Glu45/Ile48/Thr49 of TM1, Leu72 of TM2 and Glu123 of TM4 (Fig. 3d, e). The benzoyl moiety forms hydrophobic interactions with Tyr126/Met130 of TM4 and the carbonyl is hydrogen bonded by Arg133 of TM4 (Fig. 3d, e). The β-carboxylate group faces the CTD and engages in hydrogen bonds with Tyr281 of TM7 and Arg373/Gln377 of TM10 (Fig. 3c, d). Remarkably, the γ-substituted hemiphthaloyl group delves into a distinct pocket within the NTD at the bottom of the central cavity (Fig. 3c, f, g and Supplementary Fig. 9d). The aromatic ring is supported from below by Tyr136 of TM4 and is flanked on both sides by hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of Arg133 of TM4 and Val160 of TM5 (Fig. 3f, g). Furthermore, the carbonyl and carboxyl are further stabilized by Arg133/Ser137 of TM4 and Arg157 of TM5 through hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3f, g). Thus, these additional contacts appear to contribute to the high transport activity of PT523. In addition, the existence of the specific and conserved pocket (Supplementary Fig. 7), lined by Arg133, Tyr136, Ser137, Arg157 and Val160, provides structural insights into the preference of SLC19A1 for antifolates with γ-carboxylate modifications over those with β-carboxylate modifications38.

Key residues are shown as sticks and dots.

In contrast, in the recently solved SLC46A1-PMX outward-open structure, PMX binds at the base of the polar cavity in an orientation nearly parallel to the membrane plane33. The pyrimidine moiety of SLC46A1-bound PMX resides in a negatively charged cavity within the CTD, while the glutamate group extends toward the NTD with the γ-carboxylate group nestled in a positively charged pocket (Supplementary Fig. 9e). Consequently, SLC46A1 ligands must establish an appropriate distance between the ring and the γ-carboxylate group to adapt to the minimal distance (~16 Å) of the functional groups within the binding site33,35. The length of the long axis of PT523 (~23 Å) exceeds the capacity of the substrate pocket of SLC46A1, thus the γ-substituted hemiphthaloyl group will apparently create significant steric hindrance with the positively charged pocket within the NTD (Supplementary Fig. 9c, e). Taken together, the additional interactions of PT523's hemiphthaloyl group with SLC19A1, coupled with its steric hindrance with the positively charged pocket of SLC46A1, may contribute to the high affinity and substrate selectivity preference of PT523 for SLC19A1. These results provide new clues for the design of next-generation antifolate drugs with enhanced transporter specificity and reduced side effects. Moreover, besides serving as delivery systems for antifolate drugs, SLC19A1 and SLC46A1 also represent attractive targets for modulating folate uptake in tumor cells. A comparative analysis of substrate binding modes between SLC19A1 and SLC46A1, both in their outward-open conformation, will likely provide a framework for the rational design of specific exofacial inhibitors aimed at blocking folate uptake in different tumor types, as the substrate binding pocket of the outward-open conformation is readily accessible on the extracellular surface39,40.

In our previously reported hSLC19A1-CDN inward-open structures, CDNs were observed to bind as a compact dual-molecule unit near the intracellular side of hSLC19A1, even at low CDN:transporter molar ratios25. However, the compact CDN dimer does not bind within the canonical substrate cavity of SLC proteins and is likely to hinder closure of the intracellular gate of hSLC19A1 due to its numerous interactions with gate residues (Supplementary Fig. 11a). Therefore, the CDN dimer may only represent a potential substrate binding mode, and it remains unclear whether CDNs are transported by SLC19A1 in such a dimeric form. To further understand the precise transport mechanism of CDNs by SLC19A1, we determined the structure of outward-open hSLC19A1 bound to a representative CDN-type drug, 2′3′-CDAS, at a resolution of 3.34 Å (Fig. 4a–c, Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 1).

2′3′-CDAS represents one of the most extensively evaluated synthetic CDN-type drugs which consists of two AMP moieties connected by 2′-5′/3′-5′ mixed linkages with bisphosphothioate substitutions (Supplementary Fig. 10f). The cryo-EM density is of good quality to distinguish 2′-5′ and 3′-5′ phosphodiester bonds and different chemical groups (Supplementary Fig. 10g). Intriguingly, in contrast to inward-open structures, only one 2′3′-CDAS molecule binds within the canonical substrate cavity of hSLC19A1 (Fig. 4a–d). Positioned within the central canonical cavity of hSLC19A1, 2′3′-CDAS monomer adopts a U-type conformation (Fig. 4a–d). The sugar-phosphate ring faces the intracellular side and wedges diagonally into the positively charged region of the cavity, with the 3′-5′ thiophosphate interacting with Lys411 of TM11 and the 2′-5′ thiophosphate interacting with Tyr281 of TM7 (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 11b). Moreover, the free 3′-OH is held in place by a hydrogen bond with Arg133 of TM4 (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 11b). Consistent with the orientation of the sugar-phosphate ring, the 2′-5′ side adenine base occupies a lower position and is tightly packed to the NTD by hydrophobic interactions with Leu72 of TM2 as well as Tyr126/Met130 of TM4 (Fig. 4d). On the other hand, the 3′-5′ side adenine base is located at a higher position by interacting with His289 of TM7 in the CTD and is almost perpendicular to the 2′-5′ side adenine base (Fig. 4d). The backbones of 2′3′-CDAS-bound hSLC19A1 align well with those in substrate-free and folate-bound structures, with the side chains within the cavity exhibiting reasonable adjustments to adapt different type of substrates (Supplementary Fig. 11c, d).

To verify the importance of residues involved in CDN recognition, we assessed the effect of hSLC19A1 mutants on extracellular CDN-mediated STING pathway activation by cellular assays (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 2). In SLC19A1−/− THP-1 cells stably expressing WT or mutant hSLC19A1, IFNB1 mRNA production levels induced by extracellular 2′3′-cGAMP are reduced to varying extents by representative mutations (Fig. 4e). In particular, substitutions of Arg133, His289 and Lys411 to alanine nearly abolish STING pathway activation (Fig. 4e). Direct measurement of intracellular 2′3′-cGAMP accumulation41 using the cGAMP ELISA Kit further confirms the importance of Arg133, His289 and Lys411 in CDN recognition and cellular uptake (Fig. 4f).

Although both folate/antifolate and CDN occupy the canonical substrate cavity of the outward-open hSLC19A1, their interaction details differ significantly (Fig. 4g). The pterin moiety of 5-MTHF occupies the upper negatively charged pocket within the NTD, and the glutamate moiety extends to the intracellular side and reaches the positively charged region (Fig. 4g). Despite sharing partial structural similarities with the pterin group of 5-MTHF (Supplementary Figs. 6a and 10f), the adenine bases of 2′3′-CDAS occupy lower positions and establish contacts with both domains instead of fitting into the negatively charged pocket of the NTD as folate does (Fig. 4g). Structural superimposition reveals certain overlap between the 2′-5′ side adenine base of 2′3′-CDAS and the benzoyl moiety of 5-MTHF (Fig. 4g), and therefore, not surprisingly, the two types of substrates may compete with each other in cellular uptake processes. Mutations of residues involved in the interaction of hSLC19A1 with both CDN and folate (e.g., Arg133) markedly reduce the uptake of both types of substrates (Fig. 4f, h, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4f). However, mutations targeting CDN pocket-specific residues (e.g., His289 and Lys411) almost abolish CDN uptake while only mildly affecting folate uptake, highlighting the specific role of these residues in CDN recognition (Fig. 4f, h, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4f). These findings lay the groundwork for the development of SLC19A1-specific inhibitors that selectively block CDN uptake without significantly affecting folate, which will be constructive in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

As an antiporter, SLC19A1 mediates the import of folates or CDNs by coupling the export of organic anions such as ATP, ADP, AMP, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide monophosphate (ZMP), and glucose 6-phosphate (G6P)4,5. Among these, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) stands out as one of the preferred coupled substrates of SLC19A1, binding to inward-open SLC19A1 in a manner similar to folates (Supplementary Fig. 11e)27. To understand how SLC19A1 recognizes the exported organic anion in its outward-open conformation, we further determined the cryo-EM structure of outward-open hSLC19A1 in complex with TPP at 3.74 Å (Supplementary Fig. 11f, g and Supplementary Table 1). The pyrimidine ring of TPP aligns well with the density at the folate pocket and its interactions with SLC19A1 are similar to those of pterin ring in 5-MTHF (Supplementary Fig. 11h, i and Fig. 2h, i). However, the thiazolium ring and the pyrophosphate moiety remain unresolved due to the weak densities (Supplementary Fig. 11h). After the intracellular release of substrates in the inward-open conformation, organic anions bind to the inward-open SLC19A1, triggering the transporter to switch to its outward-open conformation, which drives the transport of folates and CDNs (Fig. 5). It is possible that the affinity of TPP for the outward-open cavity becomes weaker, facilitating the extracellular release of TPP. Interestingly, our cellular results indicate that the mutation in the folate-specific pocket (e.g., E123A) significantly reduces the uptake of both folates and CDNs (Fig. 4f, h and Supplementary Fig. 2), probably because the mutation affects the recognition of not only folates but also the coupled organic anions.

Schematic diagram of the alternating-access model for SLC19A1-mediated folate/antifolate and CDN transport. Alternating access of SLC19A1 is achieved through conformational changes alternately expose central substrate binding sites to each side of the membrane. Key residues involved in substrate recognition are highlighted.

Originally recognized as a transporter for folate and antifolate, and recently identified as an immune transmitter transporter, SLC19A1 plays a pivotal role in basal metabolism, antitumor therapy, infection and immunopathology. Although previous works have established a structural framework for understanding the interaction modes of folate/antifolate and CDN in the inward-open conformation, further elucidation of the conformational change, substrate selectivity, and precise transport mechanism of CDN remain necessary. In the current work, using an antibody-facilitated screening strategy, we successfully identified a mutation capable of fixing SLC19A1 in the outward-open state and determined the structures of SLC19A1 in the substrate-free state and in complex with different types of substrates. This work also demonstrates the potential of an antibody-facilitated mutant screening strategy in elucidating the transport cycle of other SLC family proteins.

In the outward-open conformation of SLC19A1, TM1 and TM2, as well as TM7 and TM8, diverge to reveal the extracellular entrance to the hydrophilic cavity, facilitating substrate access and binding. Hydrogen bonds of Gln150-Ala324/Val327 and Arg157-Gln377, along with hydrophobic interactions of Phe141-Ala388-Phe400, form the intracellular gates, sealing off the cavity from the intracellular side. Notably, structural superimposition reveals that Phe141, Gln150 and Arg157 undergo dramatic conformational changes during the transport cycle, which would open the intracellular gate and trigger the intracellular release of substrates. In addition to the conformational changes during the transport cycle, the 5-MTHF-, MTX- and PT523-bound structures also shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying substrate preference for SLC19A1 (Fig. 5). Remarkably, SLC19A1 NTD forms a specific pocket at the bottom of the cavity, lined by Arg133, Tyr136, Ser137, Arg157 and Val160, to accommodate the γ-substituted hemiphthaloyl group of PT523. However, comparison with the recently determined outward-open structure of SLC46A133, another folate transporter, reveals a potentially strong steric hindrance between the cavity of SLC46A1 and the γ-carboxylate modifications of PT523. Given the different expression levels of SLC19A1 and SLC46A1 in different tumor types, the integration of current molecular insights may accelerate the development of novel antifolates targeting specific transporters with minimized side effects.

Different from inward-open structures, the 2′3′-CDAS-bound outward-open structure shows that only one CDN molecule binds within the canonical cavity of SLC19A1 in a U-shaped conformation. The detailed binding pattern of CDN differs significantly from that of folate/antifolate, despite of sharing some similarities in chemical structure (Fig. 5). Specifically, CDN is sandwiched between the two domains of SLC19A1 at the positively charged position, whereas folate and antifolate interact more prominently with the NTD, with the pterin moiety extending into the upper negatively charged pocket. Through systematic mutant analysis, we identified that mutations targeting CDN-specific residues (e.g., H289A and K411A) nearly abolish SLC19A1-mediated CDN uptake while only slightly affecting folate/antifolate transport. These results highlight the distinctive recognition strategies of SLC19A1 for different substrate types, and provide critical insights for the development of potential small molecule drugs with selective regulatory activity for CDN and folate uptake processes. Inspired by the CDN-bound outward-open cryo-EM structure, we performed molecular docking and found that CDN may also be able to bind as a monomer to the canonical cavity of inward-open SLC19A1 (Supplementary Fig. 11j). The calculated binding free energy suggests that CDN binds to this pocket with low affinity (Supplementary Fig. 11k), which probably facilitates the release of substrates into cytoplasm and also makes it challenging to capture the inward-open structure with CDN monomer bound within the canonical pocket. Taken together, the structural, cellular and computational results indicate that CDN can be transported in its monomeric form by SLC19A1 via a canonical mechanism of SLC family proteins (Fig. 5).

Considering that in our previously reported SLC19A1-CDN inward-open structures25, the compact CDN dimer binds in a non-canonical pocket near the intracellular side and probably hinders the efficient intracellular release of CDN due to stronger interactions, the CDN dimer captured in these structures may not represent an effective transport unit of SLC19A1. On the other hand, given that CDN dimer or oligomer exhibits dynamic behavior in solution and plays important roles in other biological processes42,43,44, and that CDN can bind as a dimer even at low CDN:SLC19A1 molar ratios, it is reasonable to speculate that the dimer-bound conformation may represent a substrate binding mode of SLC19A1 with potential regulatory functions. Further studies will be required to determine whether this dimeric binding state functions in different immune activation or suppression scenarios. In addition, the non-canonical dimeric binding mode may also provide an unexpected avenue and strategy for the design of new classes of SLC19A1-specific drugs (Fig. 5).

In summary, the data elucidated in this study reveal the molecular basis for the transport mechanism and substrate preference of SLC19A1, establishing the framework for the development of antineoplastic and anti-autoimmune drugs.

Monoclonal antibodies targeting human SLC19A1 (hSLC19A1) were screened using single-cell B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing of antigen-specific cells, following a previously established protocol25. Approximately 10,000 antigen specific B cells (hSLC19A1-bound CD3-B220+CD19+CD38−GL7+ B cells) were isolated from the spleens and lymph nodes of immunized mice using the BD FACSAria III cell sorter. These cells were barcoded through the 10x Chromium Single Cell platform (10x Genomics). The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Novaseq X Plus platform in a 150 bp pair-ended manner (Berry Genomics Corporation). A total of 54 VH and VL sequences were selected, synthesized, and cloned into mammalian expression vectors with constant regions of mouse IgG2a heavy chain and κ light chain respectively. The recombinant antibodies were then transiently expressed in HEK-293T cells using lipo2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Culture supernatants were collected 24 hours post transfection. HEK-293T cells overexpressing hSLC19A1, mouse SLC19A1 (mSLC19A1) and chimeras of hSLC19A1 with specific regions replaced by mSLC19A1 were stained with the culture supernatants as the primary antibodies and PE goat anti-mouse IgG (BioLegend) as the secondary antibody. Epitope mapping of the recombinant antibodies was performed using western blot and flow cytometry on an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The monoclonal antibodies (mAb70#, mAb5#, and mAb6# targeting different binding epitopes) were produced in HEK-293F Human Embryonic Kidney cells and purified using a protein A agarose prepacked column.

The DNA sequences encoding engineered mutants of hSLC19A1, designed to be locked in different conformations, were cloned into a modified pTT3 vector containing a GFP reporter gene linked with an IRES sequence. HEK-293T cells were transfected with these constructs using lipo2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) after 6 hours. After 24 hours, the transfected cells were collected, labeled with hSLC19A1-specific antibodies targeting different epitopes (mAb70#, mAb5#, and mAb6#) as the primary antibodies and PE goat anti-mouse IgG (BioLegend) as the secondary antibody. Flow cytometry screening for outward-open proteins was conducted using an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The cDNA of hSLC19A1 (Uniport ID: P41440) was cloned into a modified PTT5 vector with a C-terminal 10×His tag using the ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme) for overexpressing in HEK-293F. To facilitate cryo-EM structures determination, the gene encoding BRIL fragment was fused to the N-terminus of TM1 of hSLC19A1 and the gene encoding anti-Fab nanobody was fused into the C-terminus of TM12 by a helical linker (AEEEKRKAEEEKRK). All mutants were generated with a standard PCR-based strategy. To produce hSLC19A1 protein, 0.5 mg hSLC19A1 plasmids were pre-incubated with 1.5 mg PEI in 50 mL Opti-MEM medium at 37 °C. After 20 mins, the mixture was added drop by drop into 500 mL HEK-293F cells at a density of 2 ~ 2.5 × 106 cells/mL. The transfected cells were cultured for 72 hours before harvesting by centrifugation. Harvested HEK-293F cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5% glycerin and 1 mM PMSF. The cells were disrupted by sonication, and 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-b-D-maltoside (DDM, Anatrace) and 0.1% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (Anatrace) were added for protein solubilizing at 4 °C for 2 hours. After centrifugation (30,000 × g, 30 mins, 4 °C), the supernatant was incubated with nickel affinity resin at 4 °C for 1 hour, and then the resin was washed with the washing buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 60 mM imidazole, 0.05% (w/v) n-dodecyl-b-D-maltoside (DDM, Anatrace) and 0.005% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (Anatrace) and 5% glycerin. The protein was eluted with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 400 mM imidazole, 0.05% (w/v) n-dodecyl-b-D-maltoside (DDM, Anatrace) and 0.005% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (Anatrace) and 5% glycerin. The eluted protein was further purified through a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in the SEC buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% (w/v) GDN. Peak fractions were collected and concentrated to ~2 mg/mL.

For complex assembly, the purified hSLC19A1EM and anti-BRIL Fab were mixed on ice at a molar ratio of 1:1.1. After incubation for 20 mins, the mixture was subjected to a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with SEC buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.01% GDN) to remove the excess anti-Bril Fab. For nanodisc reconstitution, hSLC19A1EM, MSP1D1, POPG and anti-BRIL Fab were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:2.1:84:1.1. Detergents were removed by 100 mg/mL Bio-beads with gentle agitation overnight. Subsequently, the Bio-beads were removed and the nanodisc reconstitution mixture was loaded onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and then concentrated for cryo-EM sample preparation.

For apo hSLC19A1 samples, the peak fractions of hSLC19A1EM-Fab in GDN (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.01% GDN) were concentrated to 8.4 mg/mL. For substrate-bound samples, the peak fractions of the SLC19A1EM-Fab in nanodisc (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl) were concentrated to 10.7 mg/mL and separately incubated with 5 mM 5-MTHF, 8 mM MTX, 5 mM PT523, 3 mM 2'3'-CDAS and 5 mM TPP for 3 h. 3 μL of the protein sample was deposited onto the glow-discharged holey carbon, 300 mesh R1.2/1.3 Au grids (Quantifoil). Subsequently, the grids were blotted for 2.5 s and plunged into liquid ethane for quick freezing using the Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All cryo-EM datasets were collected under the dose rate of 9.2 e− Å−2 s−1 and dose-fractioned into 32 frames, yielding a total dose of 60 e− Å−2 by SerialEM45 on the Talos Arctica 200 kV FEG (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a K2 summit direct electron elector (Gatan) and a GIF quantum energy filter (Gatan). The pixel size was calibrated at 0.5 Å (×130,000) under super-resolution mode, with the defocus ranging from −0.8 to −1.5 μm. Images were recorded using beam–image shift data collection methods46.

3301 micrographs were collected for outward-open apo-hSLC19A1 structure dataset. Beam-induced motion correction and dose weighting were performed with MotionCor247. Corrected micrographs were then imported into cryoSPARC48 for contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation with CTFFIND449. A total of 2,001,272 particles were picked and extracted. After two rounds of 2D classification, 854,517 particles with clear features were picked and subjected to the Ab initio reconstruction. The following two rounds of heterogeneous refinement yielded 345,903 good particles which resulted in a reconstruction with an overall resolution of 3.26 Å. The particles were then imported into RELION50 for Bayesian polishing, followed by non-uniform refinement and local refinement in cryoSPARC, which yielded a final reconstruction to 2.94 Å resolution. 5-MTHF-bound (6,961 micrographs; 220,166 particles), MTX-bound (2,333 micrographs; 97,106 particles), PT523-bound (2,082 micrographs; 94,583 particles), 2′3′-CDAS-bound (5,257 micrographs; 301,880 particles) and TPP-bound (1,389 micrographs; 50,812 particles) datasets were processed using a similar procedure and yielded reconstructions at 3.43 Å, 3.44 Å, 3.25 Å, 3.34 Å and 3.74 Å respectively. The local resolution estimation was performed to determine the local resolution of the final map in cryoSPARC.

The inward-open hSLC19A1 (PDB: 7XPZ)25 was used as initial template for model building. The NTD and CTD were roughly fitted into the hSLC19A1 outward-open maps by UCSF Chimera51. After manually adjustment by Coot52, the resulting model was further refined in PHENIX53. The atomic model of ligand-bound hSLC19A1 was generated by several rounds of real space refinement in COOT and PHENIX with the apo outward-open hSLC19A1 as the initial model. 5-MTHF, MTX, PT523, 2′3′-CDAS or TPP was fitted into the density using COOT, then the resulting model was manually rebuilt in COOT and further refined in PHENIX. The models were validated through evaluation of the Clash scores, MolProbity scores and statistics of the Ramachandran plots by PHENIX. All the structural figures were prepared by PyMOL54 and UCSF ChimeraX55.

The experiments were carried out as previously described in ref. 25. In brief, the DNA sequence encoding human SLC19A1 or its mutants was cloned into a lentiviral plasmid containing a GFP reporter gene connected by a 2 A sequence. The mutant-carrying lentiviruses were produced in HEK-293T cells and used to infect SLC19A1−/− Hela or SLC19A1−/− THP-1 cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). After 72 hours of culture, lentiviral-infected cells showing similar levels of GFP expression were isolated using a BD FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences).

The cellular [3H]-labelled antifolate uptake assay was performed under published protocols25,56. The cell lines were generated as mentioned above. For uptake assays, 2 × 105 WT or SLC19A1 mutant cells per well were seeded into 24-well plates. After 12 h growth, the cells were washed twice with 500 µL HBSS buffer at pH 7.4 (Pricella). The buffer contains 140 mg/L CaCl2, 100 mg/L MgCl2•6H2O, 100 mg/L MgSO4•7H2O, 350 mg/L NaHCO3 and 1000 mg/L D-glucose. The cells were then incubated with 200 µL HBSS buffer supplemented with 25 nM [3H]-labelled methotrexate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) for 10 mins. The uptake was terminated and washed twice by 500 µL ice-cold HBSS buffer. Lysed by 200 µL 0.2 M NaOH, the amount of accumulated [3H]-labelled methotrexate was calculated by scintillation counting in Ultima Gold (Perkin Elmer). For measurement of the initial uptake rates, the amount of accumulated [3H]-labelled methotrexate was calculated at 0.5 min, 1 min, 1.5 min and 2 min respectively.

The experiments were according to established protocols25. Briefly, SLC19A1−/− THP-1 cells stably expressing either wild-type or mutant hSLC19A1 were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well in 400 µL medium. The cells were then stimulated with 30 μM 2′3′-cGAMP for 3 hours. Cells were collected and total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Genomic DNA was removed by DNase I treatment (RQ1, Promega). Reverse transcription was carried out using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega). Real-time PCR was performed with 1x PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used were as follows: β-actin, 5'-ACCGAGCGCGGCTACAG-3' and 5'-CTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTCC-3'; IFNB1: 5'-GTCTCCTCCAAATTGCTCTC-3' and 5'-ACAGGAGCTTCTGACACTGA-3'. Samples were analyzed on a QuantStudio Q7 (Applied Biosystems).

SLC19A1−/− Hela cells stably expressing either wild-type or mutant hSLC19A1 were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well and cultured for 12 hours. After being washed twice with PBS, the cells were exposed to fresh DMEM complete medium containing 50 μM cGAMP for 4 hours. Following this, the cells were washed five times with PBS, lysed in 100 μL of RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0) on ice for 15 mins, and then centrifuged to remove insoluble material before cGAMP quantification. The intracellular cGAMP levels were measured using the Direct 2'3'-Cyclic GAMP ELISA Kit (Arbor Assays).

The binding modes between hSLC19A1 and 2'3'-cGAMP were determined by using molecular docking method. Structural models of inward-open (PDB: 7XPZ) and outward-open (PDB: 9JOZ) hSLC19A1 were set to be rigid in the docking process. The ligand 2'3'-cGAMP was set to be flexible. The docking process was accomplished by using the AutoDock Vina software and performed within 25 Å × 25 Å × 25 Å cubes centered on the center points of the chosen canonical substrate binding pocket with exhaustiveness set to 32. The results were ranked based on the lowest binding energy. Structural drawings were generated using PyMol.

Metrics details

Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with therapeutic potential for treating mental illnesses1,2,3,4. At the cellular level, psychedelics induce structural neural plasticity5,6, exemplified by the drug-evoked growth and remodelling of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal cells7,8,9. A key question is how these cellular modifications map onto cell-type-specific circuits to produce the psychedelics' behavioural actions10. Here we use in vivo optical imaging, chemogenetic perturbation and cell-type-specific electrophysiology to investigate the impact of psilocybin on the two main types of pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. We find that a single dose of psilocybin increases the density of dendritic spines in both the subcortical-projecting, pyramidal tract (PT) and intratelencephalic (IT) cell types. Behaviourally, silencing the PT neurons eliminates psilocybin's ability to ameliorate stress-related phenotypes, whereas silencing IT neurons has no detectable effect. In PT neurons only, psilocybin boosts synaptic calcium transients and elevates firing rates acutely after administration. Targeted knockout of 5-HT2A receptors abolishes psilocybin's effects on stress-related behaviour and structural plasticity. Collectively, these results identify that a pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT2A receptor in the medial frontal cortex have essential roles in psilocybin's long-term drug action.

a, To express GFP in IT neurons, we injected AAV-CAG-FLEX-eGFP in the ACAd and medial MOs portion of medial frontal cortex and low titre of the retrogradely transported AAVretro-hSyn-Cre in the contralateral striatum of adult C57BL/6J mice. Post hoc histology and imaging of the GFP fluorescence in coronal sections shows ipsilateral and contralateral projections to various striatal and cortical regions. CP, caudoputamen. b, To express GFP in PT neurons, we injected AAV-CAG-FLEX-eGFP in the ACAd and medial MOs portion of medial frontal cortex and low titre of the retrogradely transported AAVretro-hSyn-Cre in the ipsilateral pons of adult C57BL/6J mice. Post hoc histology and imaging of the GFP fluorescence in coronal sections shows ipsilateral projections to striatum and subcortical regions including the pons (lower rightmost image). c, In vivo two-photon images of apical dendrites from PT and IT neurons targeted to express GFP using retrogradely transported viruses. d, Baseline spine density for all imaged dendrites on Day -3 prior to any psilocybin or saline administration.

a, b, Potential differential effect of psilocybin on dendritic spine head width in frontal cortical PT and IT neurons. Spine head width in the apical tuft of PT neurons (a) after psilocybin (yellow; 1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline (grey) across days, expressed as fold-change from baseline in first imaging session (day -3). b, Similar to (a) for IT neurons after psilocybin (purple) or saline (light purple). There was cell-type difference in psilocybin's effect on spine head width (interaction effect of treatment × time × cell type: P = 0.007, mixed effects model). These results show that PT neurons have a more pronounced increase in spine head width than IT neurons, indicative of a strengthening of excitatory connections in addition to gaining new inputs for PT neurons. This enlargement in spine head for PT neurons was less durable than the changes in spine density, returning to baseline after 35 days. We note the results should be interpreted with the consideration that the spine head width is near the spatial resolution limit for in vivo two-photon microscopy. c, Density of dendritic spines in the apical tuft of PT neurons after psilocybin (yellow; 1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline (grey) across days. d-f, Similar to (c) for spine head width, formation rate, and elimination rate. g-j, Similar to (c-f) for IT neurons.

Psilocybin had no detectable effect on spine protrusion length (main effect of treatment: P = 0.309, mixed effects model). u, Protrusion length of dendritic spines in apical tuft of PT neurons for all mice after psilocybin (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline across days, without taking advantage of the longitudinal data for within-dendrite baseline normalization. v, Similar to (u) for IT neurons. n = 8 mice (PT neurons, saline, 4 females, 4 males), n = 9 (PT neurons, psilocybin, 4 females, 5 males) in (s, u). n = 8 (IT neurons, saline, 5 females, 3 males), n = 8 (IT neurons, psilocybin, 5 females, 3 males) in (t, v).

Source Data

a, Volumetric reconstruction from z-stack images of GFP-expressing IT neurons. IT neurons can be divided into two groups based on the laminar position of their cell body (200–400 μm or 450–600 μm). For the deep-lying IT neurons, sometimes the cell body could not be imaged due to the depth limitation of two-photon microscopy, but nonetheless the apical trunk was observed at >450 μm. b, Density of dendritic spines (left), spine head width (middle), and spine protrusion length (right) in apical tuft of IT neurons residing in layer 2/3 (top row) or layer 5 (bottom row) after psilocybin (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline across days, expressed as fold-change from baseline in first imaging session (day -3). The same mice were used for both depth ranges (200–400 μm and 450–600 μm). c, Left: spine formation rate determined by number of new and existing spines in consecutive imaging sessions across two-day interval, expressed as difference from baseline in first interval (day -3 to day -1). Right: similar to left for elimination rate. d-e, Similar to (b) for density of dendritic spines and spine head width but further divided the data based on the sex of the animal. n = 8 mice (IT neurons, saline, 5 females, 3 males), n = 8 (IT neurons, psilocybin, 5 females, 3 males) in (b-e). The analysis was motivated by the question: is psilocybin-evoked increase in spine size specific to cell type (IT versus PT), or specific to laminar position (layer 2/3 versus layer 5)? This is because IT neurons can be both superficial and deep, but PT is only found in deep layer. We detected no significant depth dependence for spine size for layer 2/3 and deep layer 5 IT neurons (interaction effect of treatment × soma depth, indicated in plots, mixed effects model). Data are mean and s.e.m. across dendrites. Detailed sample size n values are provided in Methods. Statistical analyses are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

Metrics details

Developing a general algorithm that learns to solve tasks across a wide range of applications has been a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. Although current reinforcement-learning algorithms can be readily applied to tasks similar to what they have been developed for, configuring them for new application domains requires substantial human expertise and experimentation1,2. Here we present the third generation of Dreamer, a general algorithm that outperforms specialized methods across over 150 diverse tasks, with a single configuration. Dreamer learns a model of the environment and improves its behaviour by imagining future scenarios. Robustness techniques based on normalization, balancing and transformations enable stable learning across domains. Applied out of the box, Dreamer is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or curricula. This achievement has been posed as a substantial challenge in artificial intelligence that requires exploring farsighted strategies from pixels and sparse rewards in an open world3. Our work allows solving challenging control problems without extensive experimentation, making reinforcement learning broadly applicable.

Reinforcement learning has enabled computers to solve tasks through interaction, such as surpassing humans in the games of Go and Dota4,5. It is also a key component for improving large language models beyond what is demonstrated in their pretraining data6. Although the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm7 has become a standard algorithm in the field of reinforcement learning, more specialized algorithms are often used to achieve higher performance. These specialized algorithms target the unique challenges posed by different application domains, such as continuous control8, discrete actions9,10, sparse rewards11, image inputs12, spatial environments13 and board games14. However, applying reinforcement-learning algorithms to sufficiently new tasks—such as moving from video games to robotics tasks—requires substantial effort, expertise and computational resources for tweaking the hyperparameters of the algorithm1. This brittleness poses a bottleneck in applying reinforcement learning to new problems and also limits the applicability of reinforcement learning to computationally expensive models or tasks where tuning is prohibitive. Creating a general algorithm that learns to master new domains without having to be reconfigured has been a central challenge in artificial intelligence and would open up reinforcement learning to a wide range of practical applications.

Here we present Dreamer, a general algorithm that outperforms specialized expert algorithms across a wide range of domains while using fixed hyperparameters, making reinforcement learning readily applicable to new problems. The algorithm is based on the idea of learning a world model that equips the agent with rich perception and the ability to imagine the future15,16,17. As shown in Fig. 1, the world model predicts the outcomes of potential actions, a critic neural network judges the value of each outcome and an actor neural network chooses actions to reach the best outcomes. Although intuitively appealing, robustly learning and leveraging world models to achieve strong task performance has been an open problem18. Dreamer overcomes this challenge through a range of robustness techniques based on normalization, balancing and transformations. We observe robust learning across over 150 tasks from the domains summarized in Fig. 2, as well as across model sizes and training budgets. Notably, larger models not only achieve higher scores but also require less interaction to solve a task, offering practitioners a predictable way to increase performance and data efficiency.

The world model encodes sensory inputs xt using the encoder (enc) into discrete representations zt that are predicted by a sequence model with recurrent state ht given actions at. The inputs are reconstructed as \(\hat{x}\)t using the decoder (dec) to shape the representations. The actor and critic predict actions at and values vt and learn from trajectories of abstract representations \(\hat{z}\)t and rewards rt predicted by the world model.

Dreamer succeeds across these domains, ranging from robot locomotion and manipulation tasks over Atari games, procedurally generated ProcGen levels, and DMLab tasks, which require spatial and temporal reasoning, to the complex and infinite world of Minecraft. We also evaluate Dreamer on non-visual domains.

To push the boundaries of reinforcement learning, we consider the popular video game Minecraft, which has become a focal point of research in recent years19,20,21, with international competitions held for developing algorithms that autonomously learn to collect diamonds in Minecraft3. Solving this problem without human data has been widely recognized as a substantial challenge for artificial intelligence because of the sparse rewards, exploration difficulty, long time horizons and the procedural diversity of this open-world game19. Owing to these obstacles, previous approaches resorted to using human expert data and domain-specific curricula20,21. Applied out of the box, Dreamer is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch.

We present the third generation of the Dreamer algorithm22,23. The algorithm consists of three neural networks: the world model predicts the outcomes of potential actions, the critic judges the value of each outcome, and the actor chooses actions to reach the most valuable outcomes. The components are trained concurrently from replayed experience while the agent interacts with the environment. To succeed across domains, all three components need to accommodate different signal magnitudes and robustly balance terms in their objectives. This is challenging as we are not only targeting similar tasks within the same domain but also aiming to learn across diverse domains with fixed hyperparameters. This section introduces the model components and their robust loss functions.

The world model learns compact representations of sensory inputs through autoencoding24 and enables planning by predicting future representations and rewards for potential actions. We implement the world model as a recurrent state-space model25, shown in Fig. 1. First, an encoder maps sensory inputs xt to stochastic representations zt for each time step t in the training sequence. Then, a sequence model with recurrent state ht predicts the sequence of these representations given past actions at−1. The concatenation of ht and zt forms the model state from which we predict rewards rt and episode continuation flags ct ∈ {0, 1} and reconstruct the inputs to ensure informative representations:

Here, the tilde (~) indicates random variables sampled from their corresponding distribution. Figure 3 visualizes long-term video predictions of the world model. Additional video predictions are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. The encoder and decoder use convolutional neural networks for image inputs and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for vector inputs. The dynamics, reward and continue predictors are also MLPs. The representations are sampled from a vector of softmax distributions and we take straight-through gradients through the sampling step23. Given a sequence batch of length T with inputs x1:T, actions a1:T, rewards r1:T and continuation flags c1:T, the world model parameters ϕ are optimized end-to-end to minimize the prediction loss \({{\mathcal{L}}}_{{\rm{pred}}}\), the dynamics loss \({{\mathcal{L}}}_{{\rm{dyn}}}\) and the representation loss \({{\mathcal{L}}}_{{\rm{rep}}}\) with corresponding loss weights βpred = 1, βdyn = 1 and βrep = 0.1:

where \({E}_{{q}_{\phi }}\) is the expected value.

A procedural maze and a quadrupedal robot are shown. Given 5 context images and the full action sequence of an unseen video, Dreamer predicts 45 frames into the future without access to intermediate images. From pixel observations, the world model learns an understanding of the underlying structure of each environment.

The prediction loss trains the decoder and reward predictor via the symlog squared loss described later, and the continue predictor via logistic regression. The dynamics loss trains the sequence model to predict the next representation by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the predictor pϕ(zt∣ht) and the next stochastic representation qϕ(zt∣ht, xt). The representation loss, in turn, trains the representations to become more predictable, allowing us to use a factorized dynamics predictor for fast sampling during imagination training. The two losses differ in the stop-gradient operator sg(⋅) and their loss scale. To avoid a degenerate solution where the dynamics are trivial to predict but contain no information about the input, we employ free bits26 by clipping the dynamics and representation losses below the value of 1 nat ≈ 1.44 bits. This disables them while they are already minimized well to focus learning on the prediction loss:

Previous world models require scaling the representation loss differently based on the visual complexity of the environment22. Complex scenes contain details unnecessary for control and thus prompt a stronger regularizer to simplify the representations and make them easier to predict. Simple graphics where individual pixels matter for the task require a weaker regularizer to extract fine details. We find that combining free bits with a small representation loss scale resolves this dilemma, allowing for fixed hyperparameters across domains. Moreover, transforming vector observations using the symlog function described later prevents large inputs and large reconstruction gradients, further stabilizing the trade-off with the representation loss.

We occasionally observed spikes in the Kullback–Leibler losses in earlier experiments, consistent with reports for deep variational autoencoders27. To prevent this, we parameterize the categorical distributions of the encoder and dynamics predictor as mixtures of 1% uniform and 99% neural network output, making it impossible for them to become deterministic and thus ensuring well-behaved Kullback–Leibler losses. Further model details and hyperparameters are included in Supplementary Information.

The actor and critic neural networks learn behaviours purely from abstract trajectories of representations predicted by the world model15. For environment interaction, we select actions by sampling from the actor network without lookahead. The actor and critic operate on model states st ≐ {ht, zt} and thus benefit from the Markovian representations ht learned by the recurrent world model. The actor aims to maximize the return \({R}_{t}\doteq {\sum }_{\tau =0}^{\infty }{\gamma }^{\tau }{r}_{t+\tau }\) with a discount factor γ = 0.997 for each model state, where τ denotes imagined future time steps. To consider rewards beyond the prediction horizon T = 16, the critic learns to approximate the distribution of returns28 for each state under the current actor behaviour:

Here, θ and ψ are the parameters of the actor and critic neural networks, respectively. Starting from representations of replayed inputs, the world model and actor generate a trajectory of imagined model states s1:T, actions a1:T, rewards r1:T and continuation flags c1:T. Because the critic predicts a distribution, we read out its predicted values \({v}_{t}\doteq {\rm{E}}[{v}_{\psi }(\,\cdot \,|{s}_{t})]\) as the expectation of the distribution. To estimate returns that consider rewards beyond the prediction horizon, we compute bootstrapped λ returns that integrate the predicted rewards and the values. The critic learns to predict the distribution of the return estimates \({R}_{t}^{\lambda }\) using the maximum likelihood loss:

Although a simple choice would be to parameterize the critic output as a normal distribution, the return distribution can have multiple modes and vary by orders of magnitude across environments. To stabilize and accelerate learning under these conditions, we parameterize the critic output as a categorical distribution with exponentially spaced bins, decoupling the scale of gradients from the prediction targets as described later. To improve value prediction in environments where rewards are challenging to predict, we apply the critic loss both to imagined trajectories with loss scale βval = 1 and to trajectories sampled from the replay buffer with a lower loss scale βrepval = 0.3. The critic replay loss uses the imagination returns \({R}_{t}^{\lambda }\) at the start states of the imagination rollouts as on-policy value annotations for the replay trajectory to then compute λ returns over the replay rewards.

Because the critic regresses targets that depend on its own predictions, we stabilize learning by regularizing the critic towards predicting the outputs of an exponentially moving average of its own parameters. This is similar to target networks used previously in reinforcement learning9 but allows us to compute returns using the current critic network. We further noticed that the randomly initialized reward predictor and critic networks at the start of training can result in large predicted rewards that can delay the onset of learning. We thus initialize the output weight matrix of the reward predictor and critic to zeros, which alleviates the problem and accelerates early learning.

The actor learns to choose actions that maximize return while exploring through an entropy regularizer. However, the correct scale for this regularizer depends on both the scale and the frequency of rewards in the environment. Ideally, we would like the agent to explore more if rewards are sparse and exploit more if rewards are dense or nearby. At the same time, the exploration amount should not be influenced by arbitrary scaling of rewards in the environment. This requires normalizing the return scale while preserving information about reward frequency.

To use a fixed entropy scale of η = 3 × 10−4 across domains, we normalize returns to be approximately contained in the interval [0, 1]. In practice, subtracting an offset from the returns does not change the actor gradient and thus dividing by the range S is sufficient. Moreover, to avoid amplifying noise from function approximation under sparse rewards, we scale down only large return magnitudes and leave small returns below the threshold of L = 1 untouched. We use the Reinforce estimator29 for both discrete and continuous actions, resulting in the surrogate loss function, where H denotes the policy entropy:

The return distribution can be multi-modal and include outliers, especially for randomized environments where some episodes have higher achievable returns than others. Normalizing by the smallest and largest observed returns would then scale returns down too much and may cause suboptimal convergence. To be robust to these outliers, we compute the range from the 5th to the 95th return percentile (Per) over the batch dimension and smooth out the estimate using an exponential moving average (EMA):

Previous work typically normalizes advantages7 rather than returns, emphasizing returns and entropy equally regardless of whether significant returns are within reach or not. Scaling up advantages when rewards are sparse can amplify noise that outweighs the entropy regularizer and stagnates exploration. Normalizing rewards or returns by their standard deviation can fail under sparse rewards where the standard deviation is near zero, which overly amplifies rewards and can cause instabilities. Constrained optimization targets a fixed entropy on average across states30,31 regardless of achievable returns, which is robust but explores slowly under sparse rewards and converges lower under dense rewards. We did not find stable hyperparameters across domains for these approaches. Return normalization with a denominator limit overcomes these challenges, exploring rapidly under sparse rewards and converging to high performance across diverse domains.

Reconstructing inputs and predicting rewards and returns can be challenging because the scales of these signals vary across domains. Predicting large targets using a squared loss can diverge, whereas L1 and Huber losses9 stagnate learning and normalization based on running statistics7 introduces non-stationarity. We suggest the symlog squared error as a simple solution to this dilemma. For this, a neural network f(x, θ) with inputs x and parameters θ learns to predict a transformed version of its targets y. To read out predictions \(\widehat{y}\) of the network, we apply the inverse transformation:

Using the logarithm as transformation would not allow us to predict targets that take on negative values. Therefore, we choose a function from the bi-symmetric logarithmic family32 that we name symlog as the transformation with the symexp function as its inverse:

The symlog function compresses the magnitudes of both large positive and negative values. This allows the optimization process to quickly move the network predictions to large values when needed. The symlog function approximates identity around the origin so it does not affect learning of small enough targets. An alternative asymmetric transformation has previously been proposed for critic learning33, which we found less effective on average across domains.

For potentially noisy targets, such as rewards or returns, we additionally introduce the symexp two-hot loss. Here, the network outputs the logits for a softmax distribution over exponentially spaced bins bi ∈ B. Predictions are read out as the weighted average of the bin locations weighted by their predicted probabilities. Importantly, the network can output any continuous value in the supported interval because this weighted average can fall between the buckets:

The network is trained on two-hot encoded targets10,28, a generalization of one-hot encoding to continuous values. The two-hot encoding of a scalar is a vector with ∣B∣ entries that are 0 except at the indices k and k + 1 of the 2 bins closest to the encoded scalar. The 2 entries sum up to 1, with linearly higher weight given to the bin that is closer to the encoded continuous target. The network is trained to minimize the categorical cross entropy loss for classification with soft targets. The loss depends on only the probabilities assigned to the bins and not on the continuous values associated with the bin locations, fully decoupling the gradient magnitude from the signal scale:

Applying these principles, Dreamer transforms vector observations using the symlog functions, both for the encoder inputs and the decoder targets and employs the synexp two-hot loss for the reward predictor and critic. We find that these techniques enable robust and fast learning across many diverse domains.

We evaluate the generality of Dreamer across 8 domains—with over 150 tasks—under fixed hyperparameters. We designed the experiments to compare Dreamer with the best methods in the literature, which are often specifically designed and tuned for the benchmark at hand. We further compare with a high-quality implementation of PPO7, a standard reinforcement-learning algorithm that is known for its robustness. We run PPO with fixed hyperparameters chosen to maximize performance across domains, which reproduce strong published results of PPO on ProcGen34. To push the boundaries of reinforcement learning, we apply Dreamer to the challenging video game Minecraft, comparing it to strong previous algorithms. All Dreamer agents are trained on a single Nvidia A100 graphics processing unit (GPU) each, making it reproducible for many research labs. A public implementation of Dreamer that reproduces all results is available.

We perform an extensive empirical study across eight domains that include continuous and discrete actions, visual and low-dimensional inputs, dense and sparse rewards, different reward scales, two-dimensional and three-dimensional worlds, and procedural generation. Figure 4 summarizes the benchmark results, comparing Dreamer and a wide range of previous algorithms across diverse domains. Dreamer matches or exceeds the best experts—whether they are model based or model free—in the domains they are applicable to and outperforms PPO across all domains.

Atari. This established benchmark contains 57 Atari 2600 games with a budget of 200 million frames, posing a diverse range of challenges35. We use the sticky action simulator setting. Dreamer outperforms the powerful MuZero algorithm10 while using only a fraction of the computational resources. Dreamer also outperforms the widely used expert algorithms Rainbow36 and IQN37.

ProcGen. This benchmark of 16 games features randomized levels and visual distractions to test the robustness and generalization of agents38. Within the budget of 50 million frames, Dreamer outperforms the tuned expert algorithms PPG34 and Rainbow38. Our PPO agent with fixed hyperparameters matches the published score of the highly tuned official PPO implementation34.

DMLab. This suite of 30 tasks features three-dimensional environments that test spatial and temporal reasoning39. In 100 million frames, Dreamer exceeds the performance of the scalable IMPALA and R2D2+ agents33 at 1 billion environment steps, amounting to a data-efficiency gain of over 1,000%. We note that these baselines were not designed for data efficiency but serve as a valuable comparison point for the performance previously achievable at scale.

Atari100k. This data-efficiency benchmark contains 26 Atari games and a budget of only 400,000 frames, amounting to 2 hours of game time18. EfficientZero40 holds the state of the art by combining online tree search, prioritized replay and hyperparameter scheduling, but also resets levels early to increase data diversity, making a comparison difficult. Without this complexity, Dreamer outperforms the best remaining methods, including the model-based IRIS, TWM and SimPLe agents, and the model-free SPR41.

Proprio Control Suite. This benchmark contains 20 simulated robot tasks with continuous actions, proprioceptive vector inputs and a budget of 1 million environment steps42. The tasks range from classical control over locomotion to robot manipulation tasks, featuring dense and sparse rewards. Dreamer matches the state of the art on this benchmark, such as DMPO31 and TD-MPC243.

Visual Control Suite. This benchmark consists of the same 20 continuous control tasks but the agent receives only high-dimensional images as input42. Dreamer establishes a state of the art on this benchmark, outperforming DrQ-v244 and TD-MPC243, which are specialized to visual environments by leveraging data augmentation.

BSuite. This benchmark includes 23 environments with a total of 468 configurations that are specifically designed to test credit assignment, robustness to reward scale and stochasticity, memory, generalization, and exploration45. Dreamer establishes a state of the art on this benchmark, outperforming Boot DQN and other methods46. Dreamer improves over previous algorithms especially in the scale robustness category.

Using fixed hyperparameters across all domains, Dreamer outperforms tuned expert algorithms across a wide range of benchmarks and data budgets. Dreamer also substantially outperforms a high-quality implementation of the widely applicable PPO algorithm. IMPALA and R2D2+ use ten times more data on DMLab.

Collecting diamonds in the popular game Minecraft has been a long-standing challenge in artificial intelligence19,20,21. Every episode in this game is set in a unique randomly generated and infinite three-dimensional world. Episodes last until the player dies or up to 36,000 steps equalling 30 minutes, during which the player needs to discover a sequence of 12 items from sparse rewards by foraging for resources and crafting tools. It takes experienced human players about 20 minutes to obtain diamonds21. We form a categorical action space of the actions provided by the MineRL competition, which includes abstract crafting actions. Moreover, we follow previous work in accelerating block breaking because learning to hold a button for hundreds of consecutive steps would be infeasible for stochastic policies20, allowing us to focus on the essential challenges inherent in Minecraft. Refer to Supplementary Information for details and a comparison with video pretraining (VPT) and Voyager21,47.

Because of the training time in this complex domain, extensive tuning would be difficult for Minecraft. Instead, we apply Dreamer out of the box with its default hyperparameters. As shown in Fig. 5, Dreamer is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without using human data, as required by VPT21, or adaptive curricula20. All the Dreamer agents discover diamonds within 100 million environment steps. Success rates of all items are shown in Extended Data Fig. 2. Although several strong baselines progress to advanced items such as the iron pickaxe, none of them discover a diamond.

a, Applied out of the box, Dreamer is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm to accomplish all 12 milestones leading up to the diamond, from sparse rewards without human data or curricula. b, Fraction of trained agents that discover each of the three latest items in the diamond task, and the fraction of episodes during which they obtain the item. Although previous algorithms progress up to the iron pickaxe, Dreamer is the only compared algorithm that discovers diamonds, and does so in every training run. Shaded areas indicate one standard deviation.

In Fig. 6, we ablate the robustness techniques and learning signals on a diverse set of 14 tasks to understand their importance. The training curves of individual tasks are included in Supplementary Information. We observe that all robustness techniques contribute to performance, most notably the Kullback–Leibler balancing and free bits of the world model objective, followed by return normalization and symexp two-hot regression for reward and value prediction. In general, we find that each individual technique is critical on a subset of tasks but may not affect performance on other tasks. To investigate the effect of the world model, we ablate the learning signals of Dreamer by stopping either the task-specific reward and value prediction gradients or the task-agnostic reconstruction gradients from shaping its representations. Whereas previous reinforcement-learning algorithms often rely only on task-specific learning signals9,10, Dreamer rests predominantly on the unsupervised objective of its world model. This finding could allow for future algorithm variants that leverage pretraining on unsupervised data.

a, All individual robustness techniques contribute to the performance of Dreamer on average, although each individual technique may affect only some tasks. Training curves of individual tasks are included in Supplementary Information. advnorm, advantage normalization. b, The performance of Dreamer predominantly rests on the unsupervised reconstruction loss of its world model, unlike most previous algorithms that rely predominantly on reward and value prediction gradients7,9,10. c, The performance of Dreamer increases monotonically with larger model sizes, ranging from 12 million to 400 million parameters. Notably, larger models not only increase task performance but also require less environment interaction. d, Higher replay ratios predictably increase the performance of Dreamer. Together with model size, this allows practitioners to improve task performance and data efficiency by employing more computational resources.

To investigate whether Dreamer can scale robustly, we train 6 model sizes ranging from 12 million to 400 million parameters, as well as different replay ratios on Crafter48 and a DMLab task39. The replay ratio affects the number of gradient updates performed by the agent. Figure 6 shows robust learning with fixed hyperparameters across the compared model sizes and replay ratios. Moreover, increasing the model size directly translates to both higher task performance and a lower data requirement. Increasing the number of gradient steps further reduces the interactions needed to learn successful behaviours. The results show that Dreamer learns robustly across model sizes and replay ratios, providing a predictable way of increasing its performance by scaling computational resources.

Developing general-purpose algorithms has long been a goal of reinforcement-learning research. PPO7 is widely used and robust but requires large amounts of experience and often underperforms specialized alternatives. MuZero10 plans over discrete actions using a value prediction model, but the authors did not release an implementation and the algorithm contains several complex components, making it challenging to reproduce. Gato49 fits one model to expert demonstrations of multiple tasks but cannot improve autonomously. In comparison, Dreamer masters a diverse range of environments with fixed hyperparameters, does not require expert data and its implementation is open source.

Minecraft has been a focus of recent research. MineRL offers several competition environments and a diverse human dataset to support exploring and learning skills19. VPT21 recorded contractor gameplay with keyboard and mouse actions for behaviour cloning followed by reinforcement learning, obtaining diamonds using 720 GPUs for 9 days. Voyager uses a language model to call the commands of the MineFlayer bot scripting layer that was specifically engineered to the game and exposes high-level actions47. Dreamer uses the MineRL competition action space that includes abstract crafting actions to autonomously learn to collect diamonds from sparse rewards using 1 GPU for 9 days, without human data.

Learning dynamics models of unknown environments and using them for reinforcement learning15 has been explored in early algorithms, such as PILCO, E2C and Visual Foresight16. PlaNet introduced a latent dynamics model accurate enough to plan from pixels25. IRIS and TWM41 integrate transformers, whereas R2I employs structured state-space models for long-term memory50. TD-MPC243 learns deterministic dynamics to combine a policy network with classical planning for continuous actions and employs robustness techniques of Dreamer, such as percentile return normalization.

We present the third generation of the Dreamer algorithm, a general reinforcement-learning algorithm that masters a wide range of domains with fixed hyperparameters. Dreamer not only excels across over 150 tasks but also learns robustly across varying data and compute budgets, moving reinforcement learning towards a wide range of practical applications. Applied out of the box, Dreamer is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch, achieving a significant milestone in the field of artificial intelligence. As a high-performing algorithm that is based on a learned world model, Dreamer paves the way for future research directions, including teaching agents world knowledge from internet videos and learning a single world model across domains to allow artificial agents to build up increasingly general knowledge and competency.

We employ the PPO algorithm7, which has become a standard choice in the field, to compare Dreamer under fixed hyperparameters across all benchmarks. There are a large number of PPO implementations available publicly and they are known to substantially vary in task performance2. To ensure a comparison that is representative of the highest performance PPO can achieve under fixed hyperparameters across domains, we choose the high-quality PPO implementation available in the Acme framework51 and select its hyperparameters in Extended Data Table 6 following recommendations1,2 and additionally tune its epoch batch size to be large enough for complex environments38, its learning rate and its entropy scale. We match the discount factor to Dreamer because it works well across domains and is a frequent choice in the literature10,33. We choose the IMPALA network architecture that we have found performed better than alternatives38 and set the minibatch size to the largest possible for one A100 GPU. We verify the performance of our PPO implementation and hyperparameters on the ProcGen benchmark, where a highly tuned PPO implementation has been reported by the PPO authors34. We find that our implementation matches or slightly outperforms this performance reference. The training time of the implementation is comparable to Dreamer under equal replay ratio. It runs about 10-times faster than Dreamer with a train ratio of 32, unless restricted by environment speed, owing to its inherently lower experience reuse.

For Minecraft, we additionally tune and run the IMPALA and Rainbow algorithms because successful end-to-end learning from scratch has not been reported in the literature19. We use the Acme implementations51 of these algorithms, use the same IMPALA network we used for PPO, and tune the learning rate and entropy regularizers. For continuous control, we run the official implementation of TD-MPC243 from proprioceptive inputs and from images. We note that the code applies data augmentation and frame stacking for visual inputs—which is not documented in its paper—which is crucial to its performance. The training time of TD-MPC2 is 1.3 days for proprioceptive inputs and 8.0 days from pixels. Besides that, we compare with a wide range of tuned expert algorithms reported in the literature9,10,33,36,41,44,52,53,54.

Aggregated scores on all benchmarks are shown in Extended Data Table 1. Scores and training curves of individual tasks are included in Supplementary Information.

Summarized in Extended Data Table 2, we follow the standard evaluation protocols for the benchmarks where established. Atari35 uses 57 tasks with sticky actions55. The random and human reference scores used to normalize scores vary across the literature and we chose the most common reference values, replicated in Supplementary Information. DMLab39 uses 30 tasks52 and we use the corrected action space33,56. We evaluate at 100 million steps because running for 10 billion as in some previous work was infeasible. Because existing published baselines perform poorly at 100 million steps, we compare with their performance at 1 billion steps instead, giving them a 10-times data advantage. ProcGen uses the hard difficulty setting and the unlimited level set38. Previous work compares at different step budgets34,38 and we compare at 50 million steps owing to computational cost, as there is no action repeat. For Minecraft Diamond purely from sparse rewards, we establish the evaluation protocol to report the episode return measured at 100 million environment steps, corresponding to about 100 days of in-game time. Atari100k18 includes 26 tasks with a budget of 400,000 environment steps, 100,000 after action repeat. Previous work has used various environment settings, summarized in Extended Data Table 3, and we chose the environments as originally introduced. Visual control and proprioceptive control span the same 20 tasks22,42 with a 1 million budget. Across all benchmarks, we use no action repeat unless prescribed by the literature.

In earlier experiments, we observed that the performance of both Dreamer and PPO is robust to the number of environment instances. On the basis of the central processing unit resources available on our training machines, we use 16 environment instance by default. For BSuite, the benchmark requires using a single environment instance. We also use a single environment instance for Atari100K because the benchmark has a budget of 400,000 environment steps whereas the maximum episode length in Atari is in principle 432,000 environment steps. For Minecraft, we use 64 environments using remote central processing unit workers to speed up experiments because the environment is slower to step.

We run five seeds for each Dreamer and PPO per benchmark, with the exception of ten seeds for BSuite as required by the benchmark and ten seeds for Minecraft to reliably report the fraction of runs that achieve diamonds. All curves show the mean over seeds with one standard deviation shaded.

All Dreamer and PPO agents in this paper were trained on a single Nvidia A100 GPU each. Dreamer uses the 200 million model size by default. The replay ratio controls the trade-off between computational cost and data efficiency as analysed in Fig. 6 and is chosen to fit the step budget of each benchmark.

We present the third generation of the Dreamer line of work. Where the distinction is useful, we refer to this algorithm as DreamerV3. The DreamerV1 algorithm22 was limited to continuous control, the DreamerV2 algorithm23 surpassed human performance on Atari, and the DreamerV3 algorithm enables out-of-the-box learning across diverse benchmarks.

We summarize the changes introduced for DreamerV3 as follows:

Robustness techniques: observation symlog, combining Kullback–Leibler balance with free bits, 1% unimix for categoricals in the recurrent state-space model and actor, percentile return normalization, symexp two-hot loss for the reward head and critic

Network architecture: block gated recurrent unit (block GRU), RMSNorm normalization, sigmoid linear unit (SiLu) activation

Optimizer: adaptive gradient clipping, LaProp (RMSProp before momentum)

Replay buffer: larger capacity, online queue, storing and updating latent states.

To accommodate different computational budgets and analyse robustness to different model sizes, we define a range of models shown in Extended Data Table 4. The sizes are parameterized by the model dimension, which approximately increases in multiples of 1.5, alternating between power of 2 and power of 2 scaled by 1.5. This yields tensor shapes that are multiples of eight as required for hardware efficiency. Sizes of different network components derive from the model dimension. The MLPs have the model dimension as the number of hidden units. The sequence model has eight times the number of recurrent units, split into eight blocks of the same size as the MLPs. The convolutional encoder and decoder layers closest to the data use 16-times-fewer channels than the model dimension. Each latent also uses 16-times-fewer codes than the model dimension. The number of hidden layers and number of latents is fixed across model sizes. All hyperparamters, including the learning rate and batch size, are fixed across model sizes.

Extended Data Table 5 shows the hyperparameters of Dreamer. The same setting is used across all benchmarks, including proprioceptive and visual inputs, continuous and discrete actions, and two-dimensional and three-dimensional domains. We do not use any annealing, prioritized replay, weight decay or dropout.

Images are encoded using stride 2 convolutions to resolution 6 × 6 or 4 × 4 and then flattened and decoded using transposed stride 2 convolutions, with sigmoid activation on the output. Vector inputs are symlog transformed and then encoded and decoded using three-layer MLPs. The actor and critic neural networks are also three-layer MLPs and the reward and continue predictors are one-layer MLPs. The sequence model is a GRU57 with block-diagonal recurrent weights58 of eight blocks to allow for a large number of memory units without quadratic increase in parameters and computation. The input to the GRU at each time step is a linear embedding of the sampled latent zt, of the action at, and of the recurrent state to allow mixing between blocks.

The encoder, dynamics predictor and actor distributions are mixtures of 99% of the predicted softmax output and 1% of a uniform distribution59 to prevent zero probabilities and infinite log probabilities. The rewards and critic neural networks output a softmax distribution over exponentially spaced bins b ∈ B and are trained towards two-hot encoded targets:

In the equation, δ refers to the indicator function. The output weights of two-hot distributions are initialized to zero to ensure that the agent does not hallucinate rewards and values at initialization. For computing the expected prediction of the softmax distribution under bins that span many orders of magnitude, the summation order matters, and positive and negative bins should be summed up separately, from small to large bins, and then added. Refer to the source code for an implementation.

We employ adaptive gradient clipping60, which clips per-tensor gradients if they exceed 30% of the L2 norm of the weight matrix they correspond to, with its default ϵ = 10−3. Adaptive gradient clipping decouples the clipping threshold from the loss scales, allowing to change loss functions or loss scales without adjusting the clipping threshold. We apply the clipped gradients using the LaProp optimizer61 with ϵ = 10−20 and its default parameters β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.99. LaProp normalizes gradients by RMSProp and then smoothes them by momentum, instead of computing both momentum and normalizer on raw gradients as Adam does62. This simple change allows for a smaller epsilon and avoids occasional instabilities that we observed under Adam.

We implement Dreamer using a uniform replay buffer with an online queue63. Specifically, each minibatch is formed first from non-overlapping online trajectories and then filled up with uniformly sampled trajectories from the replay buffer. We store latent states into the replay buffer during data collection to initialize the world model on replayed trajectories, and write the fresh latent states of the training rollout back into the buffer. Although prioritized replay64 is used by some of the expert algorithms we compare with and we found it to also improve the performance of Dreamer, we opt for uniform replay in our experiments for ease of implementation. We parameterize the amount of training via the replay ratio. This is the fraction of time steps trained on per time step collected from the environment, without action repeat. Dividing the replay ratio by the time steps in a minibatch and by action repeat yields the ratio of gradient steps to environment steps. For example, a replay ratio of 32 on Atari with action repeat of 4 and batch shape 16 × 64 corresponds to 1 gradient step every 128 environment steps, or 1.5 million gradient steps over 200 million environment steps.

With 100 million monthly active users, Minecraft is one of the most popular video games worldwide. Minecraft features a procedurally generated three-dimensional world of different biomes, including plains, forests, jungles, mountains, deserts, taiga, snowy tundra, ice spikes, swamps, savannahs, badlands, beaches, stone shores, rivers and oceans. The world consists of 1-m-sized blocks that the player can break and place. There are about 30 different creatures that the player can interact with or fight. From gathered resources, the player can use over 350 recipes to craft new items and progress through the technology tree, all while ensuring safety and food supply to survive. There are many conceivable tasks in Minecraft and as a first step, the research community has focused on the salient task of obtaining diamonds, a rare item found deep underground and that requires progressing through the technology tree.

We built the Minecraft Diamond environment on top of MineRL v0.4.419, which offers abstract crafting actions. The Minecraft version is 1.11.2. We make the environment publicly available as a faithful version of MineRL that is ready for reinforcement learning with a standardized action space. To make the environment usable for reinforcement learning, we define a flat categorical action space and fix bugs that we discovered with the original environments via human play testing. For example, when breaking diamond ore, the item sometimes jumps into the inventory and sometimes needs to be collected from the ground. The original environment terminates episodes when breaking diamond ore so that many successful episodes end before collecting the item and thus without the reward. We remove this early termination condition and end episodes when the player dies or after 36,000 steps, corresponding to 30 minutes at the control frequency of 20 Hz. Another issue is that the game sometimes misses the jump key when it is pressed and released quickly, which we solve by keeping the key pressed for 200 ms. The camera pitch is limited to a 120° range to avoid singularities.

The agent observes a 64 × 64 × 3 first-person image, an inventory count vector for the over 400 items, a vector of maximum inventory counts since episode begin to tell the agent which milestones it has achieved, a one-hot vector indicating the equipped item, and scalar inputs for the health, hunger and breath levels. We follow the sparse reward structure of the MineRL competition environment19 that rewards 12 milestones leading up to the diamond, for obtaining the items log, plank, stick, crafting table, wooden pickaxe, cobblestone, stone pickaxe, iron ore, furnace, iron ingot, iron pickaxe and diamond. The reward for each item is given only once per episode, and the agent has to learn to collect certain items multiple times to achieve the next milestone. To make the return easy to interpret, we give a reward of +1 for each milestone instead of scaling rewards based on how valuable each item is. In addition, we give −0.01 for each lost heart and 0.01 for each restored heart, but did not investigate whether this is helpful.

Although the MineRL competition environment19 is an established standard in the literature3,20, it provides a complex dictionary action space that requires additional set-up to connect agents. The action space provides entries for camera movement using the mouse, keyboard keys for movement, mouse buttons for mining and interacting, and abstract inventory actions for crafting and equipping items. To connect the environment to reinforcement-learning agents, we turn them into a categorical space in the simplest possible way, yielding the 25 actions listed in Extended Data Table 7. These map onto keyboard keys, mouse buttons, camera movement and abstract inventory actions. The jump action presses the jump and forward keys, because the categorical action space allows only one action at a time and the jump key alone would only allow jumping in place rather than onto something. A similar but more complex version of this action space was used for curriculum learning in Minecraft in the literature20.

In Minecraft, breaking blocks requires keeping the left mouse button pressed continuously for a few seconds, corresponding to hundreds of time steps at 20 Hz. For an initially uniform categorical policy with 25 actions, the chance of breaking a wood block that is already in front of the player would thus be \({\frac{1}{25}}^{400}\approx 1{0}^{-560}\). This makes the behaviour impossible to discover from scratch without priors of how humans use computers. Although this challenge could be overcome with specific inductive biases, such as learned action repeat65, we argue that learning to keep the same button pressed for hundreds of steps does not lie at the core of what makes Minecraft an interesting challenge for artificial intelligence. To allow agents to learn to break blocks, we therefore follow previous work and increase the block-breaking speed20, so that blocks break within a few time steps depending on the material. As can be seen from the tuned baselines, the resulting environment still poses a significant challenge to current learning algorithms.

Voyager uses the substantially more abstract actions provided by the high-level MineFlayer bot scripting library, such as predefined behaviours for exploring the world until a resource is found and for automatically mining specified materials within a 32-m distance47. It also uses high-level semantic observations instead of images. Unlike the Voyager environment, the MineRL competition environment requires visual perception and low-level actions for movement and the camera, such as having to jump to climb onto a block or rotate the camera to face a block for mining. VPT21 uses mouse movement for crafting and does not speed up block breaking, making it more challenging than the MineRL competition action space but easier to source corresponding human data. To learn under this more challenging set-up, its authors leverage significant domain knowledge to design a hierarchical action space composed of 121 actions for different foveated mouse movements and 4,230 meaningful key combinations. In summary, we recommend the MineRL competition environment with our categorical action space when a simple set-up is preferred, the Voyager action space for prompting language models without perception or low-level control, and the VPT action space when using human data.

The algorithm generates its own experience data by interacting with the simulated environments at run time, thus no external datasets are used. Datapoints for training curves are available in the code repository.

Metrics details

Precipitation over East Asia and the western United States is projected to increase as a result of global warming, although substantial uncertainties persist regarding the magnitude. A key factor driving these uncertainties is the tropical surface warming pattern, yet the mechanisms behind both this warming pattern and the resulting regional precipitation changes remain elusive. Here we use a set of climate model experiments to argue that these changes are partly driven by global teleconnection from the Southern Ocean, which rapidly absorbs anthropogenic heat but releases it with a delay of decades to a century. We show that the delayed Southern Ocean warming contributes to broad tropical ocean warming with an El Niño-like pattern, enhancing precipitation during summer in East Asia and winter in the western United States. The atmospheric teleconnections from the tropical ocean link the Southern Ocean warming to the Northern Hemisphere regional wetting. Southern Hemisphere low clouds are a key regulator of this teleconnection, partly explaining the projected uncertainty of regional precipitation. The documented teleconnection has practical implications: even if climate mitigation reduces carbon dioxide levels, the delayed Southern Ocean warming will sustain a wetter East Asia and western United States for decades to centuries.

Effective adaptation to climate change hinges on accurate regional precipitation projections. This is particularly true for East Asia and the western United States—highly populated regions that experience substantial precipitation variability and associated socioeconomic impacts from flood and droughts1,2,3. State-of-the-art climate models, however, show a high uncertainty of future precipitation changes in these regions4. A factor contributing to this uncertainty is inter-model differences in sea surface temperature (SST) projections over the tropics5,6,7,8,9. For example, climate models projecting a stronger El Niño-like warming pattern—stronger warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific compared to the western part—tend to exhibit a more pronounced precipitation increase in summer over East Asia10 and winter over the western United States11.

However, the underlying drivers of projection uncertainty in tropical SSTs, and thus regional precipitation, remain elusive. A key insight emerges from the common slow timescale shared by the tropical Pacific SST and regional precipitation responses. When CO2 concentration is abruptly quadrupled in climate models, the eastern equatorial Pacific warming is initially muted but gradually evolves to an El Niño-like warming pattern12 (Extended Data Fig. 1d). The regional precipitation over East Asia and the western United States also slowly increases following the slow timescale of the El Niño-like warming13 (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Notably, the slowly emerging processes are the primary contributors to the multi-model mean and inter-model spread of the long-term responses (Extended Data Fig. 1g–i). This raises a critical question: what process in the slow timescale governs the uncertainty of the tropical Pacific warming and, consequently, the regional precipitation enhancements?

Building on these insights, we hypothesize that delayed warming of the Southern Ocean (SO) is a key slow process. Initially, ocean circulation over the SO mitigates SST warming by absorbing heat into the deep ocean. This ocean heat uptake gradually slows, and manifests as the delayed SO warming14. Meanwhile, the anomalous SO warming causes the tropical Pacific to warm, particularly in the eastern basin, inducing the El Niño-like warming pattern, as revealed by recent idealized model experiments15,16,17. In this Article, through a series of climate model experiments, we demonstrate that tropical ocean warming, including with an El Niño-like pattern, is partly attributable to the delayed SO warming. This SO warming, in turn, increases precipitation during summer in East Asia and winter in the western United States, through teleconnections from the tropical SST changes. We show that Southern Hemisphere low cloud feedback modulates the entire teleconnection from the SO, partially explaining the inter-model spread of the regional precipitation projections over East Asia and the western Unites States.

The teleconnection from the delayed SO warming emerges in the slow response. In this study, we define the slow response as the difference between the last and first 30 years of the 150-year CMIP6 abrupt-4xCO2 simulation, in which CO2 is abruptly quadrupled from pre-industrial levels18 (Methods). In this section we will focus on the remote impact the delayed SO warming has on the tropical SSTs, before investigating the impact on regional precipitation.

With abrupt CO2 increases, the SO initially absorbs heat from the atmosphere, but gradually releases it around 45° S (Fig. 1a). Consequently, in the CMIP6 slow response, the SST warming is pronounced between 60° S and 40° S, indicating delayed SO warming (Fig. 1b). Meanwhile, the tropical Pacific warms in a triangular shape from the South Pacific (Fig. 1b, purple triangle), corresponding to El Niño-like warming (Supplementary Fig. 1). To isolate the effect of the delayed SO warming, we conducted a numerical experiment with the CESM1-CAM4 fully coupled model, wherein a regional thermal forcing is applied between 40° S and 60° S (Methods). The prescribed SO heating induces a response that resembles the CMIP6 slow response (compare Fig. 1c and 1b), with a high pattern correlation, 0.76 over the tropical Pacific between 30° S and 30° N and 120° E and 300° E. In other words, an anomalous zonally uniform heating to the SO drives global-scale teleconnections, including a warming of the eastern Pacific. Therefore, the delayed SO warming partially contributes to the tropical Pacific SST pattern of the slow response.

OHU corresponds to a downward positive net surface heat flux. b,c, Annual mean SST anomaly from the multi-model mean CMIP6 slow response to CO2 quadrupling (b) and the CESM1-CAM4 SO warming experiment (c) (Methods). Note that the SST averaged over the tropics between 20° S and 20° N is used as the centre of the colour scale to emphasize the tropical SST pattern. Stippling in b indicates where >70% of 35 models agree on the sign of the pattern change. Unhatched shading in c indicates statistically significant signals at the 95% confidence using a t-test, compared to the inter-annual variability of the tropical SST pattern in the control climate.

Previous studies have revealed the physical mechanisms by which zonally uniform SO heating induces El Niño-like warming over the tropical Pacific15,16,19,20,21. Specifically, SO warming is advected equatorward by the climatological southeasterlies west of South America15. The warm anomalies weaken these winds, leading to a reduction in evaporative cooling and coastal upwelling, which further amplifies the warming response15,16,22. The resulting Southeast Pacific SST warming reduces low cloud cover west of South America, and this positive low cloud feedback is the key that mediates the SO-driven teleconnection15,16. Once the warming reaches the eastern equatorial Pacific, the El Niño-like warming pattern is sustained by Bjerknes feedback.

The SO warming also propagates towards the tropical Indian Ocean and the tropical Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 1b,c). The west of Australia and South Africa exhibit climate states similar to those west of South America, with prevalent southeasterlies and stratocumulus clouds, thus exhibiting a similar teleconnection mechanism15. However, over the Indian Ocean, tropical warming is not evident in the SO warming experiment compared to the CMIP6 slow response. We suspect that this muted teleconnection towards the tropical Indian Ocean is due to the erroneously negative low cloud feedback west of Australia in CESM1-CAM4 (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Methods). Regardless of such tropical pattern differences, the delayed SO warming partially contributes to the enhanced equatorial warming—the stronger SST warming near the equator compared to the tropical ocean7. The enhanced equatorial warming is dominantly shaped by the tropical Pacific heating (Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Fig. 1).

The delayed SO warming further contributes to the regional precipitation increases in the Northern Hemisphere, via tropical SST anomalies and subsequent atmospheric teleconnections. In this section we first focus on the precipitation over East Asia (25° N–40° N and 110° E–145° E) during the boreal summer months of June, July and August (JJA). This geographic domain includes a densely populated coastal region subject to flood risks, as well as portions of ocean, to capture the large-scale precipitation signal.

The East Asia summer precipitation increases in both the CMIP6 slow response and the response to the SO warming alone (Fig. 2a,b, green boxes). Thus, the slow increase in the East Asia summer precipitation can be partly attributed to the delayed SO warming. The atmospheric teleconnection occurring in the summer following El Niño in the winter illustrates the mechanism, which relies on enhanced equatorial warming increasing the East Asia summer precipitation by shifting the Asian jet southward6,7,8,23.

The target East Asia domain is indicated by the green box in a, b and f, and the thick green line in e indicates the latitudes of the target East Asia domain. The thick green lines in f denote longitudes east of the Tibetan Plateau corresponding to e. Stippled and unhatched regions indicate statistical significance as in Fig. 1b,c. All variables are averaged for JJA.

First, the enhanced equatorial warming, driven by the delayed SO warming, leads to tropical upper-level warming following the moist adiabat (Fig. 2c). The resultant southward shift in the maximum meridional temperature gradient leads to the southward displacement of the Asian summer jet23 (Fig. 2d). As the Asian jet shifts southward, the atmospheric column it passes through becomes shallower due to the elevated topography (Fig. 2d). Potential vorticity conservation implies a reduction in relative vorticity24, and the subsequent anticyclonic flow triggered along the topography entails a northerly wind downstream of the Tibetan Plateau8 (Fig. 2e). Northerly anomalies result in moisture convergence within East Asia and thereby lead to the precipitation increase6. In addition, the southward-shifted jet favours warm advection to East Asia in the mid-troposphere, as after the jet shift, the westerlies blow from the climatologically warmer regions over the Tibetan Plateau25 (Fig. 2f). To balance the mid-tropospheric energy budget, the enhanced warm advection requires compensatory adiabatic cooling by anomalous upward motion (Supplementary Fig. 3). The anomalous upward motion enhances East Asia precipitation26.

Indeed, the East Asia summer moistening is tightly linked to the southward jet shift across models, which is associated with the different degree of enhanced equatorial warming, hence the tropical Pacific warming (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The aforementioned dynamics in the CMIP6 slow response can be consistently identified in the SO warming experiment (compare Fig. 2c–f to Extended Data Fig. 3). In other words, the delayed SO warming causes the enhanced equatorial warming, shifting the Asian jet southward, resulting in the anomalous northerly and mid-tropospheric warm advection east of the Tibetan Plateau, thereby increasing the East Asia precipitation.

Although dynamical mechanisms related to jet shift are consistent between the CMIP6 slow response and the SO warming experiment, the precipitation decreases south of East Asia only in the CMIP6 slow response (Fig. 2a,b). We attribute this difference to the muted warming over the tropical Indian Ocean in CESM1-CAM4 (Fig. 1b,c). In previous studies, the equatorial warming over the Indian Ocean relative to the western Pacific is shown to trigger a subtropical high-pressure anomaly over the western North Pacific9,10. The resulting anticyclonic flow enhances East Asia precipitation by supplying additional moisture, and the descent motion associated with the anticyclone decreases the precipitation south of the East Asia9,27. Indeed, the western North Pacific subtropical high-pressure anomaly is developed only in the CMIP6 slow response (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Similarly, the teleconnection mechanisms related to the subtropical high-pressure anomaly exist in the slow response but can be negligible in models in which the relative Indian Ocean warming is muted (Extended Data Fig. 4e–g).

We now examine the slow CO2-forced precipitation response in the western United States (30° N–45° N, 215° E–245° E) during the boreal winter months (December, January, February, DJF). Note that the selected region contains the highly populated coastal cities. The western United States precipitation increases in the CMIP6 slow response as well as in the SO warming experiment (Fig. 3a,b, green rectangles). Hence, the slow increase in the western United States winter precipitation is partly attributed to the delayed SO warming.

The geopotential height pattern is calculated by subtracting the Northern Hemisphere average (0°–40° N) from the original value (Methods). The solid (dashed) grey contours represent negative (positive) anomalies (interval = 10 m). c,d, The multi-model mean CMIP6 slow response related to the Pacific/North America pattern. c, The 850-hPa geopotential height pattern (shading) and 850-hPa horizontal wind (vectors). The vectors are shown in the region where >70% of 35 models agree on the sign of either the zonal or meridional wind changes. d, The changes (shading) and climatology (contours) of the 200-hPa zonal wind. Only positive contours larger than 12 m s−1 are shown; the contour interval is 8 m s−1. The green rectangle (parallelogram) corresponds to regions of western United States (southeastern United States) precipitation enhancement. Stippled and unhatched regions indicate statistical significance as in Fig. 1a,b. All variables are averaged for DJF.

The wetting in the western United States can be induced by an El Niño-like teleconnection, starting from the delayed SO warming. Previous research has revealed that tropical Pacific warming induces low geopotential height anomalies reminiscent of the Pacific/North America (PNA) pattern via Rossby wave responses, thereby enhancing winter precipitation over the western United States5,11. Indeed, in response to the delayed SO warming, the 200-hPa geopotential height anomalies exhibit minima over the northeastern Pacific (Fig. 3a,b, grey contours), which resemble the responses in a typical El Niño year28. The resulting low height anomalies generate southwesterly winds directed towards the western United States (Fig. 3c), which in turn supply moisture and enhance precipitation. In addition, the low height anomalies in the northeastern Pacific correspond to the eastward extension of the Pacific jet, which would otherwise be concentrated in the western Pacific (Fig. 3d). Given that climatological storm track activity decreases from the Pacific to the western United States29, this eastward jet extension steers more storms towards the western United States, thereby enhancing precipitation30.

Accordingly, models with stronger tropical Pacific warmings tend to have lower height anomalies, modulating the western United States precipitation response among models (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). In addition, the dynamic mechanisms behind the western United States moistening are similar in the CMIP6 slow response and the SO warming experiment (compare Fig. 3c,d to Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Therefore, the delayed SO warming induces a tropical Pacific warming, triggering a low geopotential height anomaly over the northeastern Pacific, increasing moisture supply and steering more storms to the western United States, thereby intensifying precipitation there.

The slow precipitation increase in the southeastern United States is also partly explained by the SO-driven teleconnection. Precipitation during winter increases with the warming from the SO (Fig. 3a,b, green parallelograms). The tropical Pacific warming induces low height anomalies over the southeastern United States (Fig. 3a,b, grey contours), thereby increasing the rainfall in the southeastern United States as in El Niño years31. This El Niño-like teleconnection is further confirmed by the inter-model correlation between the tropical Pacific warming, low height anomaly and southeastern United States precipitation increase (Extended Data Fig. 5d–f).

Likewise, the SO-driven teleconnections affect not only the tropical SSTs but also regional precipitation over East Asia, the western United States and the southeastern United States. Previous studies have identified Southern Hemisphere low cloud feedback as a key determinant of the teleconnection from the SO to the tropics15,16. Here we examine whether variations in low cloud feedback can explain the inter-model differences not only in tropical SST anomalies, but also in regional precipitation changes.

We first quantified the Southern Hemisphere low cloud feedback (CFSH) as the sensitivity of the shortwave (SW) cloud radiative effect to underlying SSTs averaged over Southern Hemisphere regions with climatological low clouds32, indicated by black boxes in Fig. 4a (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4). We then regressed the CMIP6 slow response against CFSH across different climate models (Fig. 4a–c). The models with a stronger CFSH exhibit more warming in the SO and tropical oceans. To be specific, the triangular warming over the South Pacific becomes stronger, with a significant inter-model correlation of 0.74 (Fig. 4g). Furthermore, the models with a larger CFSH tend to have a more pronounced increase in precipitation over East Asia and the western United States (Fig. 4b,c), with significant correlation coefficients (Fig. 4h,i). Therefore, the Southern Hemisphere low cloud feedback may amplify the SO-driven teleconnection, regulating the slow response of the tropical SST pattern as well as regional precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere.

Unhatched shading indicates statistically significant signals at the 95% confidence level using a t-test. g–i, CFSH versus the CMIP6 slow responses for the tropical Pacific triangular warming (g); precipitation during the East Asian (EA) summer (h) and western United States (WUS) winter (i). Annotations indicate inter-model correlation coefficients. The symbols are colour-coded from blue to red in ascending order of the CFSH. The black symbols indicate the multi-model mean, and open (filled) green rectangles indicate the CESM1-CAM5 experiment in which the clouds are regionally locked (globally interactive). In i, the western United States winter is defined as November, December, January for the CMIP6 slow response and as January, February, March for the cloud-locking experiment, when each signal is maximized.

We further quantified the role of CFSH by means of a regional cloud-locking experiment. The abrupt-4xCO2 simulation with the default CESM1-CAM5 was compared with a simulation in which the cloud radiative feedbacks were disabled regionally over the climatological low cloud regions in the Southern Hemisphere (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5). The differences in the slow response between the cloud-interactive and regional cloud-locked configurations represent the impact of CFSH (Fig. 4d–f). The tropical Pacific warming and the regional precipitation increases were amplified with interactive CFSH relative to the cloud-locked experiments (Fig. 4g–i, green rectangles). Therefore, it is evident that CFSH regulates the global teleconnections from the SO in the models, as suggested by the similarity between the regional cloud-locking experiment and the inter-model regression map (Fig. 4a–f).

The atmospheric teleconnections discussed in previous sections propagate the uncertainty of the diverging CFSH among models to regional precipitation change. For the East Asia precipitation increase, the southward jet shift and associated interaction with the Tibetan Plateau (Fig. 2c–f) explain the model uncertainty associated with CFSH, shown by the consistent signals both in the inter-model regression (Extended Data Fig. 7) and the regional cloud-locking experiment (Extended Data Fig. 8). The stronger CFSH also favours a stronger high-pressure anomaly over the western North Pacific subtropical regions (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d), explaining the reduced precipitation south of East Asia (Fig. 4b,e). For the western United States and southeastern United States precipitation enhancement, the Rossby wave responses and subsequent PNA pattern (Fig. 3c,d) are also amplified with a stronger CFSH (Extended Data Fig. 6c–f).

Our analysis has concentrated on the slow climate response to abrupt CO2 quadrupling, specifically the gradual evolution of tropical Pacific warming and related changes in regional precipitation. In fact, the Southern Hemisphere low cloud feedback explains the projection uncertainties not only for the slow responses, but also for the long-term responses (Extended Data Fig. 9). The inter-model correlation is dominated by four CESM2 variant models, but the cloud-locking experiment aligns with the inter-model relationship (compare the black regression lines and green dashed lines in Extended Data Fig. 9). Given that the cloud-locking experiment provides actual causal evidence, whereas the inter-model correlation does not, we argue that the CFSH is partly responsible for the inter-model spread, even in the non-robust inter-model correlation. Thus, under the scenario with CO2 enhancements, the misrepresentation of low clouds in the Southern Hemisphere will contribute to the projection uncertainties of tropical SSTs and regional precipitation changes over East Asia and the southeastern United States.

Here we reveal a teleconnection in which the delayed SO warming expected under anthropogenic climate change contributes to enhanced equatorial warming with an El Niño-like pattern, thereby enhancing regional precipitation over East Asia, the western Unites States and the southeastern United States, as summarized in Fig. 5. The Southern Hemisphere low cloud feedback regulates the strength of the SO-driven teleconnection and partly explains the inter-model uncertainties of the regional precipitation projections. In fact, the highly model-dependent feedback from the Southern Hemisphere low clouds has been identified as a major source of uncertainty in global mean temperature increase and thus climate sensitivity33,34. Therefore, recent field campaigns focusing on the Southern Hemisphere low cloud35,36 will prove valuable to improve not only climate sensitivity estimates but also regional precipitation projections.

The delayed SO warming propagates equatorward, preferentially west of the continents, following the climatological southeasterlies. This equatorward teleconnection is further promoted by positive low cloud feedback. As the warming signal reaches the equator, it is further amplified by Bjerknes feedback, leading to the El Niño-like warming pattern. In summer, the enhanced equatorial warming heats the tropical troposphere following the moist adiabat, shifting the Asian jet southward and intensifying precipitation over East Asia (EA) due to strengthened interactions between the jet and the Tibetan Plateau. In winter, the El Niño-like warming induces the Rossby wave responses, producing a PNA circulation pattern with corresponding low (L) and high (H) pressure anomalies, which in turn enhances precipitation across the western United States (WUS) and southeastern United States (SEUS). The multi-model mean of the slow response in abrupt-4xCO2 and piControl climatology across the CMIP6 ensemble is used for the schematic.

In response to global warming, the slow teleconnections we describe here occur on centennial timescales as the SO slowly absorbs and releases heat, implying less impact on the near-future transient climate. However, the teleconnection impact will be more evident as humans reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs)—SO warming will persist while other regions will cool or equilibrate faster due to the differing heat capacities37. Indeed, in recent climate model experiments in which CO2 is removed after transient quadrupling38, SO warming becomes pronounced when CO2 is removed (Fig. 6a–d). The SO warming sustains the enhanced warming over the tropical oceans, inducing dynamical changes identical to this study, thereby sustaining a precipitation increase over East Asia, the western United States and the southeastern United States (Fig. 6e–h). The sustained warming and wetting are consistent with recent studies with similar model experiments27,39. Eventually, long-term adaptation policies need to reflect these regional climate changes induced by SO warming, which will remain even with CO2 reductions.

Generally, there is growing evidence indicating that the SO is a global climate pacemaker in recent trends, producing remote impacts such as those highlighted in this study40,41,42. Specifically, in the process of developing decadal climate predictions, higher spatial resolution has been shown to improve the prediction skill of surface temperature over the SO. This SO skill improvement extends to a better hindcast of the tropical Pacific SST as well as the western United States and southeastern United States precipitation during winter42. Therefore, an accurate representation of recent SO cooling trends may play a crucial role in resolving model–observation discrepancies of the recent tropical Pacific cooling as well as the western United States drying. The mechanisms revealed in this study lend further support to this hypothesis. These cumulative findings could help alleviate model errors in simulating recent regional precipitation trends and enable more trustworthy future projections.

We use monthly mean outputs of two fully coupled CMIP618 experiments: piControl and abrupt-4xCO2. piControl mimics the climate with a pre-industrial CO2 concentration (280 ppm), and abrupt-4xCO2 simulates the climate with quadrupled CO2. We calculated the total response to CO2 quadrupling as the difference between the last 30 years of abrupt-4xCO2 and the last 100 years of piControl. We calculated the slow response as the last minus first 30 years of abrupt-4xCO2, in which the effects of ocean dynamics and slowly evolving SSTs dominate. Although previous studies used the first ten years to capture the slow evolution of the SST, here we use the first 30 years to minimize the high internal variability in regional precipitation. This definition of the slow response clearly characterizes the delayed SO warming and associated global impacts (Supplementary Fig. 6). All CMIP6 data are interpolated to 1° × 1° horizontal resolution, and one ensemble per model was used for the analysis. A total of 35 models were selected based on their data availability (model lists are provided in Supplementary Table 1).

To confirm the SO-driven teleconnection impact, a SO warming experiment was conducted using the fully coupled CESM1-CAM443. We first equilibrate to the pre-industrial climate and then added the SO warming to run a forced simulation for 150 years. The target warming was added to the longwave heat flux term in the ocean coupler code. We added a sinusoidal heat flux between 40° S and 60° S, with a maximum of 20 W m−2. The averaged difference between the last 50 years of forced climate and last 100 years of pre-industrial climate was analysed. The imposed heat flux was eventually released towards the atmosphere (dashed–dotted blue line in Supplementary Fig. 6), affecting the global climate through teleconnections. Note that the tropical Pacific response in this experiment is weaker than in the CMIP6 slow response, even if the forcing magnitude is larger (Fig. 1b,c). The weaker response can be attributed to the weak positive low cloud feedback in CESM1-CAM4, which might dampen the cloud radiative anomalies and thus the teleconnection in this particular model (Supplementary Fig. 2). To be specific, the negative low cloud feedback west of Australia might hinder the equatorward propagation of the SO warming in CESM1-CAM4, muting the tropical Indian Ocean warming (Fig. 1c). Note that the SST response in the North Atlantic and North Pacific in the SO warming experiment differs from the CMIP6 slow response. In the SO warming experiment, the stronger North Atlantic warming and displacement of the North Pacific cooling maxima to the northwest modulate the jet streams, which could result in weaker precipitation signals over East Asia and the western United States. However, the overall teleconnection impacts from the tropical SST anomalies are consistent.

In this study we aim to find the cause of the inter-model spread in the SW cloud radiative effect (SWCRE) responses over the Southern Hemisphere low cloud regions. We decompose the SWCRE response into the product of the forced SST response and the SWCRE sensitivity to SST, a relationship that holds, particularly for low cloud regions33. The SWCRE sensitivity at each grid point is the estimated strength of the local SW cloud feedback, which will be intrinsic to a model's parameterizations.

We calculated the local SW cloud feedback strength by regressing the monthly SWCRE at the top of atmosphere (TOA) onto the monthly SST at each model grid point, using the de-seasonalized and de-trended deviations of 100-year piControl simulations. The local SW cloud feedback was then averaged over the Southern Hemisphere low cloud regions, where the inter-model correlation between the SWCRE changes and the tropical Pacific triangular warming is large (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b, green and blue boxes). The averaged feedback is what we refer to as the Southern Hemisphere low cloud feedback (CFSH). This low cloud feedback can explain the inter-model spread of SWCRE changes both in the subtropical and SO domains, even without considering SST changes (Supplementary Fig. 4d,e). This indicates that the difference in low cloud parameterization is the dominant cause of the inter-model spread in the SWCRE responses. We estimated the observational CFSH with the same method, using the CERES-EBAF44 for SWCRE and OISSTv545 for SST from March 2000 to February 2020.

Here, the Southern Hemisphere low cloud includes the cloud over the subtropics and SO, and the subtropical and SO cloud feedbacks are correlated among climate models (r = 0.63; Supplementary Fig. 4c). In addition, note that we directly link the low cloud and SWCRE changes to the SST. In previous studies using cloud-controlling factor analysis, estimated inversion strength is another important factor for explaining SWCRE changes33,46,47. However, for the Southern Hemisphere low cloud regions, the anticorrelation between the time series of SST and estimated inversion strength is strong, so the univariate regression with SST is sufficient to capture the inter-model spread of the SWCRE responses.

To elucidate the role of CFSH, we conducted regional cloud-locking experiments48 using the fully coupled CESM1-CAM549. First, the eight cloud parameters were extracted every 2 h from a randomly chosen year of the equilibrated pre-industrial simulation. Then, in the regional cloud-locking experiments, the 2-h cloud parameters were prescribed repetitively every year in the radiative transfer code for the target region. The target regions we focused on were the SO and off the west coast of all major Southern Hemisphere continents where CFSH is defined. One abrupt-4xCO2 simulation was integrated for 150 years with the interactive clouds and locked clouds. The effect was that the SW cloud radiative forcing in the interactive cloud experiment was muted in the regionally locked experiment (Supplementary Fig. 5). The difference between the interactive and locked cloud experiments demonstrates the role of CFSH. The slow response was used for the analysis as in CMIP. Note that the CESM1-CAM5 has relatively realistic SW cloud feedback strength over the SH low cloud regions when compared to other models (Supplementary Fig. 2d), confirming the fidelity of the cloud-locking experiment.

The tropical SST pattern was calculated as the SST from which the tropical (20° S–20° N) mean has been subtracted. For the 200-hPa and 850-hPa geopotential height patterns, the deviation from the Northern Hemisphere (0°–40° N) average value was used to capture the circulation responses under global warming, following a previous study50.

The shift of the Asian summer jet was quantified as the change in meridional asymmetry of the 200-hPa zonal wind as follows. First, we took the 200-hPa zonal wind during the summer (JJA) over the Asian continent (60° E–120° E). Next, we calculated the climatological Asian jet position as the latitude of the maximum zonally averaged zonal wind. To assess the meridional asymmetry of the zonal wind (U200asy), the meridionally averaged zonal wind between the climatological jet position and 20° south of the jet was subtracted from that between the climatological jet and 20° north of the jet. Negative changes in U200asy denote a southward shift in the Asian summer jet.

Fast response is subtraction of the slow from the total response. a–c, Multi-model mean total response in annual-mean SST (a), summer precipitation (b), and winter precipitation (c). d–f, Decadal averaged timeseries of the response in equatorial Pacific SST gradient (d), precipitation over East Asia (e) and the Western United States (f). The zonal SST gradient and regional precipitations are calculated over the black boxes in (a-c). Black lines represent multi-model mean and shading indicate \(\pm\)1 inter-model standard deviation. g–i, Total responses versus slow/fast responses for equatorial Pacific SST gradient (g), precipitation over East Asia (h) and the Western United States (i). Red (Blue) circles indicate the slow (fast) responses, and the open circles indicate the multi-model mean. For slow/fast response, inter-model correlation coefficients to the total response are inserted as text. Note that the definition of slow response—which uses first 10 years—is specific to this figure; in main analysis we use first 30 years to minimize the internal variability of the regional precipitation (Methods).

Oops, something went wrong

If investors are looking at the Sector - Tech fund category, Janus Henderson Global Technology A (JATAX) could be a potential option. JATAX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.

We note that JATAX is a Sector - Tech option, and this area is loaded with many options. Found in a wide number of industries such as semiconductors, software, internet, and networking, tech companies are everywhere. Thus, Sector - Tech mutual funds that invest in technology let investors own a stake in a notoriously volatile sector, but with a much more diversifies approach.

Janus Fund is based in Boston, MA, and is the manager of JATAX. Janus Henderson Global Technology A made its debut in July of 2009, and since then, JATAX has accumulated about $286.98 million in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. Denny Fish is the fund's current manager and has held that role since January of 2016.

Obviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 17.65%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 13.87%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.

It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.

When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 15.61%, the standard deviation of JATAX over the past three years is 23.46%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 22.8% compared to the category average of 16.74%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.

Investors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.14, which means it is hypothetically more volatile than the market at large. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration, since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which in this case, is the S&P 500. With a negative alpha of -0.32, managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.

Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, JATAX is a load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.98% compared to the category average of 1%. Looking at the fund from a cost perspective, JATAX is actually cheaper than its peers.

While the minimum initial investment for the product is $2,500, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.

Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.

Overall, Janus Henderson Global Technology A ( JATAX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, worse downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.

 April 02, 2025  

New research suggests that the shingles vaccine Zostavax may protect against dementia, supporting the theory that viruses that affect the nervous system may contribute to neurodegeneration. 

The study, which leveraged a unique vaccine rollout policy in Wales and analyzed the health records of more than 280,000 older adults, showed that receipt of the live-attenuated shingles vaccine reduced the probability of developing dementia by around one fifth over 7 years. 

“Shingles vaccination is recommended for older adults. If the shingles [vaccine] has a benefit for dementia delay or prevention in addition to its preventive benefit for shingles, then this is all the more reason to get vaccinated,” study investigator Pascal Geldsetzer MD, PhD, MPH, Departments of Medicine and Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University in California, told Medscape Medical News. 

The study was published online on April 2 in Nature.

Prior studies have suggested a potential link between the shingles vaccine and a lower risk for dementia. 

A “critical limitation” of this previous research is that the health behaviors of those who get vaccinated are different from those who do not. 

“Our study takes a fundamentally different approach and, thus, provides a very different level of evidence,” Geldsetzer said. 

The researchers took advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the live-attenuated varicella zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual's exact date of birth. Those born before September 2, 1933, were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after September 2, 1933, were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine. 

“This is just like a randomized trial. We have a vaccine-eligible and a vaccine-ineligible group for which we know that they should be, on average, similar to each other, and therefore good comparison groups, because all that's different about these two groups is if they were born a few days earlier or a few days later,” Geldsetzer explained. 

The electronic health record data showed that the percentage of adults who received the zoster vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week younger. 

“We see in our data that just a 1-week difference across this date-of-birth cutoff means that you go from essentially no one getting vaccinated to about half of the population getting vaccinated,” said Geldsetzer.

Using these comparison groups, the researchers found that receiving the zoster vaccine, vs not receiving the vaccine, reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over 7 years by 3.5 percentage points, corresponding to a 20% relative reduction. 

This protective effect was more pronounced in women, potentially due to stronger vaccine-induced immune responses or higher shingles prevalence.

The researchers replicated their findings in health records from other countries, including England, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, which had similar rollouts of the zoster vaccine. 

“We just keep seeing this strong protective signal for dementia in dataset after dataset,” Geldsetzer said in a Stanford University news release. 

Geldsetzer has set his sights on a large, randomized controlled trial of the potential neuroprotective effects of the live-attenuated zoster vaccine, “which is the vaccine for which we have generated our compelling body of evidence.”

“It would be a very simple, pragmatic trial because we have a one-off intervention that we know is safe,” Geldsetzer said. He is seeking philanthropic funding for the trial as the live-attenuated vaccine is no longer manufactured by pharmaceutical companies.

It is unknown whether the newer version of the vaccine (Shingrix) may have a similar or greater impact on dementia, the researchers said.

“Although it is still unclear precisely how herpes zoster vaccination lowers the risk of dementia, the implications of the study are profound,” Anupam Jena, MD, PhD, with Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, wrote in a Nature News & Views. 

“The vaccine could represent a cost-effective intervention that has public health benefits strongly exceeding its intended purpose. Given the substantial economic and social burden of dementia, policymakers and health-care providers might need to reassess the value of widespread herpes zoster vaccination, particularly in older adults,” Jena added. 

Reached for comment, Courtney M. Kloske, PhD, Alzheimer's Association director of scientific engagement, noted that the study supports research presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in 2020, which showed that flu and pneumonia vaccinations — especially multiple vaccinations over time — were associated with a lower risk for Alzheimer's disease, as previously reported by Medscape Medical News. 

“This new study adds to our current knowledge by suggesting the shingles vaccine may also reduce someone's risk of developing dementia,” Kloske said.

“These new results, while preliminary, call for further studies in large, diverse study populations to inform public health strategy regarding whether vaccinations can decrease our risk of developing dementia as we age,” Kloske added. 

“Big picture,” said Kloske, “these studies emphasize the importance of taking care of your overall health and highlight how important it can be in reducing the long-term risk of developing dementia.”

The study received funding from The Phil & Penny Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience, the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. Geldsetzer, Jena, and Kloske reported no relevant disclosures.

 April 02, 2025  

Preliminary results from a new study showed that the risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) was more than twice as high in individuals who used antidepressants for 6 or more years compared with that in those not taking the medications. 

While the findings suggest a possible association between long-term antidepressant use and SCD, researchers caution that the results do not imply these medications are inherently dangerous or should be discontinued.

“I hope doctors don't think they need to discontinue this treatment because it might pose a risk of sudden cardiac death,” study investigator Jasmin Mujkanovic, MD, PhD student, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark, told Medscape Medical News. 

Mujkanovic emphasized that depression itself is a known risk factor for SCD and that effective treatment can improve quality of life and support healthier lifestyle choices, which may in turn help reduce heart-related risks. 

The findings were presented on March 30 at the European Heart Rhythm Association 2025, a scientific congress of the European Society of Cardiology.

Previous research has shown a link between long-term antidepressant use and poor cardiac health. Antipsychotics have also been tied to an increase risk for cardiovascular disease in older adults with dementia.

While earlier studies suggested that patients with depressive disorders have an increased risk for SCD, the effect of antidepressant exposure on SCD risk was unclear.

Researchers reviewed all death certificates and autopsy reports from 2010 among the 4.3 million residents of Denmark aged 18-90 years. The year 2010 was chosen because some of Mujkanovic's colleagues had already assessed every death certificate for that year and entered pertinent information into a database.

The researchers defined antidepressant exposure as having filled at least two prescriptions for the medication within a single year during the 12 years leading up to 2010, the start of the follow-up period. Exposure was categorized as either 1-5 years or 6 years or more. 

Based on available data, deaths were categorized as SCD or non-SCD. There were 6002 deaths due to SCD, which included 1981 in the antidepressant cohort and 4021 in the unexposed population.

Investigators found that the risk for SCD was significantly higher in individuals exposed to antidepressants than in the general population across all age groups — except those aged 18-29 years, where the association was not statistically significant. Mujkanovic suggested that younger patients may not have used antidepressants long enough to be classified as having prolonged exposure.

After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, including ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and arrhythmias, the risk for SCD was 56% higher in those with 1-5 years of exposure to antidepressants (hazard ratio [HR], 1.56; P < .001) and more than double for those with 6 or more years of exposure (HR, 2.17; P < .001).

The risk for SCD among individuals taking antidepressants, compared with the unexposed general population, varied slightly across age groups. However, among those aged 40-79 years, the incidence of SCD was significantly higher in individuals with 6 or more years of antidepressant use than in those with 1-5 years of exposure.

When comparing longer to shorter durations of antidepressant use, the differences in risk were significant in the following age groups: 40-49 years (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.7; P = .03), 50-59 years (IRR, 2.0; P < .001), and 60-69 years (IRR, 1.4; P < .001).

The differences in risk between antidepressant exposure durations were not statistically significant among the younger participants (age, 18-39 years) and the oldest group (age, 80-90 years).

Due to the study's design, it's challenging to determine whether the increased risk for SCD is linked to the underlying condition of depression or to the antidepressant medications themselves, Mujkanovic said. However, if the medications do contribute to the risk, it may be because some can alter the heart's electrical activity, he noted.

Mujkanovic also pointed out that certain antidepressants are associated with significant weight gain and QT interval prolongation, which can lead to metabolic syndrome — a known risk factor for atherosclerosis.

“It's like a chain reaction — atherosclerosis is a known risk factor for ischemic heart disease, and ischemic heart disease increases the risk for myocardial infarction, which increases the risks for cardiac death,” Mujkanovic said.

The study did not distinguish between different classes of antidepressants — such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclics — and participants may have switched between classes during the study period.

It also did not analyze men and women separately, though Mujkanovic expressed interest in exploring sex-specific differences in future research.

Several experts weighed in on the findings in a statement from the UK-based independent nonprofit Science Media Centre (SMC). 

Paul Keedwell, MB, PhD, consultant psychiatrist and fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in London, the United Kingdom, agreed with the investigators' caution against discontinuing antidepressants based on the study's findings. 

“The results should be treated with caution because the study was unable to separate the risks of antidepressant treatment from the risk of having depression per se,” Keedwell said.

Depression is linked to a 60% higher risk for heart disease, including SCD, a 50%-90% increased risk for life-threatening arrhythmias, and approximately double the risk for heart attack, Keedwell noted.

He added that individuals with depression tend to die earlier than those in the general population — with men dying up to 14 years earlier and women dying up to 10 years earlier.

While suicide contributes to this excess mortality, Keedwell emphasized that the leading cause is poor physical health, likely driven by an unhealthy lifestyle.

“More research is needed to directly compare the life expectancy in treated and untreated depression, but as things stand, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that the risk of early death is much higher when depression is left untreated than when it is treated,” he said. “Therefore, people should not stop their antidepressant treatment based on this study.”

Also commenting for the SMC, Charles Pearman, MB, PhD, consultant cardiologist and electrophysiologist at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, noted that previous studies have identified a link between antipsychotic use and an increased risk for SCD.

He added that antidepressants may not directly cause SCD but could instead serve as markers for other underlying health issues or risk factors — such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, or physical inactivity.

“The investigators tried to account for this possibility, but it is unclear which risk factors they considered,” Pearman said.

Pearman emphasized that the overall risk remains low and, like the study authors, advised against patients abruptly discontinuing their antidepressant treatment. Overall, while there was an increased risk from taking antidepressants, the risk remains small, he noted. 

“People who are concerned about their risks should speak to their GP [general practitioner] rather than stopping their medicines abruptly,” he said.

The study received no external funding. Mujkanovic and Keedwell reported n o related conflicts of interest. Pearman disclosed no relevant conflicts.

Among women, the use of systemic hormonal contraceptives is independently associated with an increased likelihood of having allergic rhinitis, a study showed.

“Clinicians may have a higher vigilance for rhinitis symptoms in adult women taking systemic hormonal contraceptives,” the study authors wrote.

Richard G. Chiu, with the University of Illinois Chicago, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on March 21 in Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology.

The duration of exposure to hormonal contraceptives was not always clear from medication records. The study had a cross-sectional design and did not establish a causal relationship between hormonal contraceptive use and rhinitis.

This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

 April 02, 2025  

Intermittent fasting (IMF) with behavioral support may be more effective and better tolerated by patients than standard daily caloric restriction (DCR) in weight-loss programs, a randomized study found.

A 4:3 IMF program produced modestly superior weight loss than DCR of 2.89 kg over 12 months in the context of a guidelines-based, high-intensity, comprehensive behavioral weight-loss program, according to Danielle M. Ostendorf, PhD, MS, co-lead author and an assistant professor at The University of Tennessee Knoxville, and Victoria Catenacci, MD, study principal investigator, co-lead author, and an associate professor located at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.

The study, published in Annals of Internal Medicine, found that objectively measured percentage caloric restriction was greater in the 4:3 IMF group, whereas there was no between-group difference in change in total moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, suggesting that differences in weight loss may have been due to greater adherence to 4:3 IMF. The 4:3 IMF program was well tolerated and attrition was lower in this group: 19% for IMF group vs 30% for DCR group.

The authors noted that alternative patterns for restricting dietary energy intake are gaining attention owing to the difficulty of adhering to a reduced-calorie diet daily, with most adults who lose weight through DCR showing significant weight regain a year later.

According to Ostendorf and Catenacci, fasting strategies “come in two different flavors and oftentimes get confused in the lay press and by patients and researchers. And there is a difference between IMF and time-restricted eating (TRE),” they told Medscape Medical News. “TRE involves limiting the daily window of food intake to 8-10 hours or less on most days of the week — for example, 16:8 or 14:10 strategies. TRE is done every day, consistently and involves eating in the predefined window, and fasting outside of that window.” 

IMF is a more periodic and significant fast and involves cycling between complete or near-complete (> 75%) energy restriction on fast days and ad libitum energy intake on nonfast days.

An appealing feature of IMF is that dieters do not have to focus on counting calories and restricting intake every day as they do with DCR, the authors wrote. Furthermore, the periodic nature of fasting is simpler and may mitigate the constant hunger associated with DCR.

Some said the diet was dreadful, but many said it was the easiest diet they had ever been on. “But it did take time for people to adjust to this strategy,” Catenacci said. “It was reassuring to see no evidence of increased binge-eating behaviors.”

Although objectively measured adherence to the targeted energy deficit (percentage caloric restriction from baseline) was below the target of 34.3% in both groups, the 4:3 IMF group showed greater percentage caloric restriction over 12 months. This suggests that, on average, the 4:3 IMF group may be more sustainable over a year than the DCR group. However, weight loss varied in both groups. Future studies should evaluate biological and behavioral predictors of response to both 4:3 IMF and DCR groups in order to personalize recommendations for weight loss.

The investigators randomized 165 patients at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, with a mean age of 42 years (18-60), a mean baseline weight of 97.4 kg, and a mean baseline body mass index (BMI) of 34.1 to IMF (n = 84) or DCR (n = 81). Of these, 74% were women and 86% were White individuals, and 125 (76%) completed the trial.

The 4:3 IMF group restricted energy intake by 80% on 3 nonconsecutive fast days per week, with ad libitum intake on the other 4 days (4:3 IMF). The 80% calorie reduction fasting corresponded to about 400-600 kcals/d for women and 500-700 kcals/d for men.

“Participants were only required to count calories on their fast days, which is part of the appeal,” Ostendorf said. Although permitted to eat what they wanted on nonfast days, participants were encouraged to make healthy food choices and consume healthy portion sizes.

For its part, the DCR group reduced daily energy intake by 34% to match the weekly energy deficit of 4:3 IMF.

Both groups participated in a high-intensity comprehensive weight-loss program with group-based behavioral support and a recommended increase in moderate-intensity physical activity to 300 min/wk.

On the primary endpoint, the 4:3 IMF group showed a weight loss of 7.7 kg (95% CI, –9.6 to -5.9 kg) compared with 4.8 kg (95% CI, -6.8 to -2.8 kg, P =.040) in the DCR group at 12 months. The percentage change in body weight from baseline was –7.6% (95% CI, –9.5% to –5.7%) in the 4:3 IMF group and –5% (95% CI, – 6.9% to –3.1%) in the DCR group.

At 12 months, 58% (n = 50) of participants in the 4:3 IMF group achieved weight loss of at least 5% vs 47% (n = 27) of those in the DCR group. In addition, 38% (n = 26) of participants in the 4:3 IMF group achieved weight loss of at least 10% at 12 months vs 16% (n = 9) of those in the DCR group. Changes in body composition, BMI, and waist circumference also tended to favor the 4:3 IMF group.

On other 12-month measures, point estimates of change in systolic blood pressure, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, triglyceride level, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, fasting glucose level, and A1c level favored 4:3 IMF. Point estimates of change in diastolic blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level favored DCR.

Currently lacking, the authors said, are data on safety in children and older adults, and adults affected by a long list of conditions: Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease (stage 4 or 5), cancer, and eating disorders. Also, people of normal weight or only mild overweight, and pregnant or lactating women. “There have been concerns about IMF causing eating disorders, so we did not include people with eating disorders in our study,” Ostendorf and Catenacci said.

Offering an outside perspective on the findings, James O. Hill, PhD, director of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center and a professor at The University of Alabama at Birmingham believes IMF is a viable option for people trying to lose weight and has prescribed this approach for some in his practice. “But there is no one strategy that works for everyone,” he told Medscape Medical News. “I recommend IMF as a science-based strategy that can be effective for some people, and I think it should be on the list of science-based tools that people can consider using.” But as it won't work for everyone, “we need to consider both metabolic success and behavioral success. In other words, would it be more effective if people could do it and how easy or hard is it for people to do?”

Audra Wilson, MS, RD, a bariatric dietitian at Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital in Geneva, Illinois, who was not involved in the study, expressed more reservations. “We do not specifically recommend intermittent fasting at Northwestern Medicine. There is no set protocol for this diet, and it can vary in ways that can limit nutrition to the point where we are not meeting needs on a regular basis,” she told Medscape Medical News.

Moreover, this study did not specify exact nutritional recommendations for participants but merely reduced overall caloric intake. “Although intermittent fasting may be helpful to some, in my nearly 10 years of experience I have not seen it be effective for many and especially not long-term,” Wilson added.

Concerningly, IMF can foster disordered eating patterns of restriction followed by binging. “Although a balanced diet is more difficult to achieve, guidance from professionals like dietitians can give patients the tools to achieve balance, meet all nutrient needs, achieve satiety, and maybe most importantly, have a better relationship with food,” she said.

As for the influence of metabolic factors that may be associated with better weight loss, Ostendorf said, “Be on the lookout for future publications in this area. We are analyzing data around changes in energy expenditure and changes in hunger-related hormones, among others.” A colleague is collecting biological samples to study genetics in this context. “However, in general, it appeared that the difference in weight loss was due to a greater caloric deficit in the 4:3 IMF group.”

Ostendorf and Catenacci are currently conducting a pilot study testing 4:3 IMF in breast cancer survivors. “We think this is a promising strategy for weight loss in breast cancer survivors who struggle with overweight/obesity in addition to their cancer diagnosis,” Ostendorf said.

This study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Ostendorf, Catenacci, Hill, and Wilson disclosed no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

 April 02, 2025  

Almost one in 10 people reported experiencing harm from NHS care in the past 3 years, according to a survey led by the University of Oxford. 

The study, published in BMJ Quality & Safety, found that 9.7% of respondents reported harm, with 6.2% attributing it to the treatment or care received and 3.5% citing lack of access to services.

Researchers noted that these findings exceed those of two previous British surveys which reported harm rates of 4.8% in 2001 and 2.5% in 2013. While acknowledging that the pandemic's impact on healthcare access may have contributed to the higher figures, they said that the study highlights issues that “may be hidden from official data on patient safety.” 

As well as the withdrawal of medical care attributed to the pandemic, the increase could also be explained by using a broader definition of harm to include psychological as well as physical harm, the study authors suggested.

The survey, conducted between November 2021 and May 2022, involved telephone interviews with over 10,000 individuals. Participants were asked about harm experienced between November 2018 and May 2022 — a period when most pandemic restrictions had ended.

Previous studies had indicated rising harm rates before the pandemic. For example, a 2019 meta-analysis of 70 studies involving nearly 350,000 patients found patient harm prevalence at 6%, with total harm reaching 12%. An accompanying editorial noted that the study raised “serious concerns about the safety of health systems.”

Lead author of the new study, Dr Michele Peters, PhD, a medical sociologist at the University of Oxford, told Medscape News UK : “In the past, harm has usually been measured using clinical rather than patient perspectives.” She explained that this emphasis tended to highlight harm associated with clinical errors rather than harm related to system issues, such as long waits for treatment. 

The latest study is one of the first to explicitly assess actions taken following harm due to lack of access to care. Around half of those awaiting treatment experienced physical or psychological consequences, with longer waits more common in deprived areas.

“Current waiting list management approaches do recognise that some people are particularly vulnerable to deterioration during the waiting period,” Peters told us. This means they may end up in poor condition when called for treatment. She noted that some interventions, such as weight management or smoking cessation support, aim to maintain patients' health while they wait for procedures like hip replacements.

Among those affected, 37.6% reported moderate harm, while 44.8% experienced severe harm. However, most patients did not seek financial compensation. Instead, they prioritised getting treatment or care to help recover or access to the treatment that they had not had.

Just over 21% of those harmed said they avoided claims because they did not want to take action against the NHS. Another 18% stated they did not want financial compensation. Instead, nearly 60% sought professional advice or shared their experiences with family and friends. 

“This means there are opportunities for people to be supported in the aftermath of harm that do not involve the challenges or burdens of litigation,” Peters said.

Some patients remain loyal to the NHS, despite reporting harm, perhaps owing to other experiences of good care, she suggested. “People realise that the NHS is a complex organisation and that quality of care, and indeed safety, will vary across providers,” she said. 

Many patients faced obstacles in seeking redress. Some were deterred by the complexity of the process or concerns about being labelled difficult. Others worried about potential consequences for their future care. “Taking action requires time and energy, as well as confidence in navigating complex processes,” said Peters. Many patients did not feel heard by professionals when they raised concerns, “and they may need to be quite insistent for their concerns to not be dismissed.” 

A more open system for patient feedback, including negative experiences, could help patients feel more comfortable raising concerns, she added.

Asked to comment on the study's findings, an NHS spokesperson told Medscape News UK: “This survey reflects people's personal experiences during the exceptional circumstances of the pandemic period,” which were “unprecedented.” “It is based solely on individual perceptions and experiences during telephone interviews, rather than clinically reported harm.”

They added that there was no standardised definition of severe harm used in the study.

The spokesperson added: “The NHS has made significant progress in strengthening patient safety – including a nationwide programme of training and education – and we recognise there is still more to do to improve care for patients by providing better access to services and reducing health inequalities.”

 April 02, 2025  

A low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level below 70 mg/dL was associated with a 26% reduced risk of all-cause dementia and a 28% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease-related dementia (ADRD), with statin use further decreasing that risk, a new study suggests.

While earlier research had suggested lower LDL levels may offer a protective advantage against dementia, these findings provide a specific target number, which investigators said could prove helpful in clinical practice. 

“These findings emphasize the importance of targeted LDL-C management as part of dementia prevention strategies, with potential integration into clinical guidelines,” lead investigator Minwoo Lee, MD, PhD, Department of Neurology, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, South Korea, and colleagues wrote.

“The results support the use of statin therapy within specific LDL-C ranges for both cardiovascular and cognitive health benefits.”

The study was published online April 1 in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry.

The relationship between LDL-C levels and cognitive outcomes is not well understood, and prior research has yielded conflicting results. 

Early studies raised concerns that very low levels were linked to cognitive decline, but those findings have been mitigated by more recent evidence showing a significant reduction in LDL-C does not raise the risk of dementia. 

Level fluctuations have also been shown to carry an increased risk of cognitive decline, and the Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care recently added high cholesterol to its list of modifiable risk factors associated with dementia.

To the study the issue further, investigators led a retrospective analysis of patients in 11 university hospitals in South Korea that included 108,980 patients with LDL-C levels < 70 mg/dL and a propensity score matched group of 108,980 patients with levels > 130 mg/dL.

Researchers assessed the prevalence of all-cause dementia as a primary outcome and ADRD as a secondary outcome and performed secondary analyses of patients with LDL-C levels below 55 mg/dL and patients who used statins.

Compared with patients who had LDL-C levels of ≥ 130 mg/dL, investigators found a 26% reduction in all-cause dementia among patients with LDL-C levels < 70 mg/dL (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.70-0.78) and a 28% reduction in ADRD (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.67-0.77).

Among patients with LDL-C levels < 55 mg/dL, researchers noted an 18% reduction, each, in the risk for all-cause dementia (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.77-0.88) and ADRD (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.89). There was no significant reduction in dementia risk in those with levels < 30 mg/dL compared with patients with LDL-C levels of ≥ 130 mg/dL.

The use of statins in patients with LDL-C < 70 mg/dL was also associated with a 13% lower risk of all-cause dementia (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.94) and a 12% decrease in ADRD risk (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.94) compared with patients who did not use statins. There was no link between lower risk and statin use among those with LDL-C levels < 55 mg/dL.

“The primary findings of this study highlight the critical importance of LDL-C levels in dementia risk, emphasizing the critical importance of these levels irrespective of statin use,” the investigators wrote. “Lower LDL-C levels are directly associated with reduced dementia incidence, supporting cholesterol management as fundamental in preventing dementia.”

Balancing LDL-C for cardiovascular benefits while being cognizant of potential neurocognitive impacts is “something we deal with constantly in clinical practice,” Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, a neurologist and researcher based in Miami, Florida, told Medscape Medical News.

“Until now, it's been hard to say what level is ‘safe' or even beneficial for the brain,” said Lakhan, who was not part of the new research. “The study's identification of <70 mg/dL as a target that significantly reduces risk of both all-cause and Alzheimer's-related dementia is incredibly helpful. It gives us a concrete, evidence-based benchmark we can share with patients — especially those at high vascular and cognitive risk.”

The finding that there is a potential floor to the benefits of lowering LDL-C also runs counter to the idea that a lower LDL-C level is always better, Lakhan added. 

“It's a strong argument for individualized targets rather than pushing every patient to extreme lows, particularly in those with cognitive concerns,” he said.

For Lakhan, the evidence that statins have neuroprotective effects and that those benefits extend beyond lowering cholesterol are the most important findings for clinical care. 

“It gives clinicians a strong rationale to continue statins in older adults and those at risk for dementia, not just for their hearts, but for their brains as well,” he said.

While the results do not establish causality due to the study's retrospective nature, overall, Lakhan said the study's “size, consistency, and methodologic rigor make this a valuable contribution that should absolutely inform clinical decision-making and future guidelines.”

Several experts also weighed in on the results in a statement from the independent, nonprofit UK Science Media Center.

The results of the study “give a convincing argument for researchers to consider LDL cholesterol in addition to the classic approaches,” said Francesco Tamagnini, PhD, a neurophysiologist with the University of Reading. 

“Amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated tau have, so far, been assumed to be the main cause of Alzheimer's but that is an opinion that is now likely to fade,” he added.

Julia Dudley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said it is difficult to know whether there is a direct link between LDL-C and reduced dementia risk. 

“Clinical trials will be key to understand what effects statins might be having on disease processes in the brain,” she said.

This study was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea and the Korean Neurological Association. Study authors, Lakhan, and Tamagnini reported no relevant financial relationships. Medscape could not confirm Dudley's financial disclosures at the time of reporting.

 April 02, 2025  

Rapid spread of the H5N1 avian influenza virus has reached an “unprecedented” scale this season, wiping out hundreds of millions of birds worldwide and increasingly infecting mammals, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations warned on March 16. The spread of the virus poses significant risks from food and public health perspectives.

In a statement, FAO deputy director general Godfrey Magwenzi stressed that the crisis threatens to have “serious impacts on food security and food supply in countries.”

In the United States, for instance, egg prices hit record highs in February as workers were forced to cull more than 166 million birds, primarily laying hens, according to the FAO. The organization also reported that “at least 300 new species of wild birds have been affected since 2021, posing a serious threat to biodiversity.”

Beth Bechdol, another FAO deputy director general, emphasized the critical role of private sector involvement, particularly in the development of vaccines, diagnostics, and high-quality veterinary health services.

Beyond the food crisis, the intense circulation of the virus has led to spillover from birds to mammals, raising alarms among researchers.

Speaking to Medscape's French edition, Pierre Bessière, a virology researcher at the National Veterinary School of Toulouse in Toulouse, France, explained that in the United States, as the virus circulates among mammals such as cattle, it acquires adaptive mutations that make it dangerous to humans, even though it was not initially the case.

Currently, the circulating viruses are poorly adapted to humans and cause mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis, fever, and cough. However, earlier this year, a senior citizen in Louisiana became the first person in the United States to die from bird flu. In Canada, a young girl infected with the D1.1 variant was hospitalized in critical condition for 2 months.

“It is important to remember that between 1918 and today, there have been four pandemics caused by avian-origin influenza viruses. Historically, these viruses have often caused pandemics worldwide. Currently, H5N1 viruses have all the tools needed to acquire pandemic potential. The virus isolated from the young Canadian patient showed mutations that indicated pandemic potential. Fortunately, the virus was not transmitted to anyone else because the patient was treated immediately. She could not infect other people. However, one can imagine such a scenario, which could be problematic. This is how an epidemic, and subsequently a pandemic, begins. What must be avoided at all costs are human-to-human transmission chains,” Bessière said.

In France, the situation is less concerning than that in the United States, largely due to the vaccination of farmed ducks, a program implemented over the past 2 years. Over the past 12 months alone, 60 million ducks have been vaccinated. This strategy has significantly reduced farm outbreaks, with only 10 reported during 2023-2024 compared with more than 400 in the earlier season.

A study published by the Chair for Avian Health and Biosecurity at the National Veterinary College of Toulouse, Toulouse, France, estimated that, without vaccination, France could have experienced between 273 and 701 poultry farm outbreaks in 2023-2024, significantly exceeding the 10 outbreaks recorded across poultry farms during this period.

“Our team's modelling work suggests that the vaccination campaign has been a success. In the past, we knew that when we had cases in France, they were always preceded by cases in Scandinavia about a month earlier because the spread followed the migration corridors. Applying this methodology to 2024, when ducks were vaccinated, we observed very few cases in France instead of the hundreds expected based on combined data from Norway, Sweden, and Finland obtained a month earlier,” explained Bessière, who did not participate in the study.

Primary care physicians (PCPs) frequently initiated multiple medications simultaneously, with rates varying between 14.0% and 27.2% across institutions. Analysis showed that only 0.6% of the most common combinations were recommended to be started together.

“Based on our rating of the necessity of these concurrent starts, many could benefit from a more cautious approach that weighs the harms vs benefits of such simultaneous starts and considers alternate potentially safer prescribing strategies,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Tewodros Eguale, PhD, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Boston. It was published online on March 28, 2025, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

This study was unable to confirm with certainty that a prescribed medication was genuinely new for the patient. The authors acknowledged that they could not conduct detailed chart reviews for each encounter, which limited their ability to fully assess the appropriateness of concurrent prescribing in individual cases. Data on clinical outcomes were lacking, which could have helped assess whether the multiple medication initiations were harmful or beneficial.

The study was supported by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The authors reported no conflicts of interest.

The use of smoking cessation medications during the first trimester of pregnancy posed no greater risk for major congenital malformations (MCMs) in infants than smoking, based on a meta-analysis of approximately 400,000 infants. 

“Maternal smoking during pregnancy is the leading cause of harms to both mother and baby, contributing to outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight, fetal and neonatal death, birth defects, and long-term health consequences, and smoking cessation significantly reduces these risks,” said lead author Duong T. Tran, PhD, of the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, in an interview.

“Although nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, and bupropion are effective pharmacologic aids for smoking cessation in the general population, we don't have robust evidence regarding their safety during pregnancy,” Tran said. Current guidelines advise against varenicline and bupropion during pregnancy and advise NRT with caution, she said.

In a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, Tran and colleagues reviewed data from four countries (Norway, Sweden, New Zealand, and Australia) to examine overall risk for MCMs, risks in subgroups, and specific malformations associated with smoking cessation therapy use.

The study population included 267,522 women with a mean age of 27.2 years at the time of childbirth, and 391,474 singleton births, including 9325 infants exposed to NRT, 3031 to varenicline, and 1042 to bupropion. 

Overall prevalence of MCMs was not significantly different for infants exposed to NRT, varenicline, or bupropion compared with unexposed infants per 1000 live births (37.6 vs 34.4, 32.7 vs 36.6, and 35.5 vs 38.8, respectively). 

In subgroup analyses, NRT was associated with a higher risk for digestive organ MCMs compared with no exposure (3.8 vs 2.6 per 1000 live births) but no difference in risk for MCMs related to heart, limbs, genital organs, kidneys, urinary tract, respiratory system, or orofacial clefts. Varenicline was associated with a higher risk for kidney or urinary tract MCMs compared with no exposure (11.5 vs 4.2 per 1000 live births), but no difference appeared in the risk for heart, limb, or genital MCMs; data on risk for other MCMs were too imprecise, the researchers wrote. Bupropion data were too sparse for a subgroup analysis, the researchers noted. 

The findings were limited by several factors including the lack of data on adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes or other long-term functional defects and by a lack of data on whether women smoked during their entire first trimester, the researchers noted. However, the results suggest that the use of NRT, varenicline, and bupropion during pregnancy were not associated with an increased overall MCM risk compared with continued smoking, and that the data are reassuring given the detrimental impact of smoking on both maternal and child health, they concluded. 

The current study yielded results consistent with previous trials of NRT, which had been too small to provide definitive evidence of safety, Tran said. “As for varenicline, no clinical trials have assessed its safety during pregnancy. Our study found no increased risks of MCMs overall, nor specific malformations affecting the heart, limbs, and genital organs,” she said. The study is the first to examine the effects of bupropion on MCMs and found no risk for exposure overall, she added.

“Clinicians can use these findings to guide decision-making during consultations with pregnant women, weighing the potential benefits of these medicines against the possibility of smoking-related adverse outcomes,” said Tran.

“Future research should confirm the effectiveness of these medicines specifically for pregnant women,” Tran told Medscape Medical News. “While these pharmacologic smoking cessation aids like NRT, varenicline, and bupropion are effective in the broader population of people who smoke, physiological changes during pregnancy could alter medicine metabolism, and consequently their effectiveness,” she noted. Studies are needed to evaluate the effects of smoking cessation medications on other adverse outcomes as well, such as the likelihood of preterm birth, low birth weight, and any potential risks to the pregnant woman, Tran added. 

“Robust pregnancy-related drug safety data are difficult to acquire, and this is particularly so for rare, life-altering conditions like MCMs,” wrote Tim Coleman, MD, of the University of Nottingham, Nottingham, England, and Sophie Orton, PhD, of the Society for the Study of Addiction, Northampton, England, in an accompanying editorial. 

The current study provides encouragement to clinicians to offer smoking cessation medications to pregnant women, especially given the even greater health risks associated with continuing to smoke while pregnant, the editorialists wrote. The data support previous evidence of the safety of NRT and increase comfort with other options. 

“Some who try but are unable to stop smoking with NRT might now consider trying varenicline or bupropion,” although with counseling that neither drug is recommended in guidelines or widely used for smoking cessation during pregnancy, they said. 

Ideally, the current study will prompt randomized, controlled trials of the effectiveness of varenicline and bupropion, they added. Meanwhile, motivation to stop smoking during pregnancy is often high, and clinicians should take advantage and consistently offer cessation support to all pregnant patients who smoke, they emphasized.

Clinicians know the significant risk associated with smoking during pregnancy, but most do not routinely offer NRT when advocating smoking cessation, said Marissa Platner, MD, associate professor of maternal-fetal medicine at Emory University, Atlanta, in an interview. “This paper gives us the opportunity to be able to better counsel our patients on the possibility of quitting given the limited risk of fetal harm from medical options to assist with smoking cessation,” she said.

Platner was surprised by the association between kidney and urinary tract abnormalities and varenicline but noted that these abnormalities may not be severe. 

In clinical practice, the data are helpful in counseling patients toward smoking cessation and on more options for assistance, said Platner. “The findings overall are very reassuring, and I would recommend these medications to patients who are open to smoking cessation,” she said.

“The major limitation of the study is that it is based on population-level data and self- reported smoking status without any knowledge of how much women were smoking,” Platner told Medscape Medical News. “More research is needed to look at long-term outcomes and larger numbers of the specific associated anomalies with the medications and NRT,” she added.

This study was supported by an NHMRC Ideas Grant, the University of New South Wales Research Infrastructure Grant, University of New South Wales Scientia Program Award, the National Health and Medical Research Council Medicines Intelligence Centre of Research Excellence (1196900), the Research Council of Norway, and the Research Council of Norway Centers of Excellence.

Intestinal iron absorption efficiency after iron supplementation was higher in older hospitalised patients with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels < 5 mg/dL but declined with increasing CRP levels (inflammation), with the most marked reduction observed in those with CRP levels ≥ 10.1 mg/dL.

""While intravenous iron therapy is an alternative, it is associated with a significant risk of allergic reactions and elevated healthcare costs compared to oral iron supplementation. Therefore, establishing a definitive CRP threshold could significantly enhance clinical decision-making,"" the authors wrote.

""These findings underscore the vital roles of iron in the human body and highlight the need for careful management of iron supplementation in older hospitalized patients,"" they added.

This study, led by Baigang Wang, Marien Hospital Herne, Ruhr-University Bochum, Herne, Germany, was published online on March 27, 2025, in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

This study did not differentiate between acute and chronic inflammation or examine the dynamics of changes in CRP levels. The investigation focused exclusively on the dynamics of iron absorption and excluded the analysis of increases in haemoglobin levels in patients with clinically evident anaemia.

This study received Open Access funding that was enabled and organised by Projekt DEAL, and the authors acknowledged receiving support from the Open Access Publication Fund of the Ruhr-Universität Bochum. The authors declared having no competing interests.

The Rojiblancos' campaign would effectively be over if they were to lose to Barcelona in the second leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final on Wednesday

As Antonio Rudiger raced away to celebrate with his team-mates after converting the decisive spot-kick in Real Madrid's shootout win over city rivals Atletico, Diego Simeone made a beeline for his disconsolate players. The message was clear: keep your heads up, you've done yourselves and your club proud. Then, the coach turned to fans and urged them to applaud a side that had given its all but once again come up agonisingly short in a Champions League tie against their neighbours from across the Spanish capital.

This was a particularly bitter pill for Atleti to swallow, though, as an incredibly controversial call had ultimately proved decisive, with the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) ruling out Julian Alvarez's converted penalty in the shootout for a 'double touch' that was neither deliberate nor obvious even in the multiple video replays that followed. Consequently, despite Simeone's best efforts to lift his players, centre-back Clement Lenglet admitted that they were all still in a ""state of shock"" in the dressing room.

""We produced a massive performance from start to finish,"" he told Movistar Plus after Atleti had won 1-0 on the night to draw 2-2 on aggregate. ""I think we deserved [to win] as a team, a club, for the fans and their support, which helped us a lot. But we will handle the blow to our morale in the days ahead. We have a lot of work left to do, we have important things to play for, the season doesn't end today.""

Although Leganes appear to be the obvious contender for the 3rd relegation spot in Spain, Alaves' upcoming fixtures make them better value to back.

Last season's La Liga 2 champions, Leganes, fell into the La Liga relegation zone with just 9 games of the season remaining after 1 win in 9 games.

Odds courtesy of bet365. Correct at time of publishing and subject to change.

Leganes stormed back into La Liga for the 2024/25 season after winning La Liga 2. They started the new campaign well as they went unbeaten in their first three games.

By the festive season, Leganes had racked up four league wins and suffered just eight defeats in their 18 games.

Leganes' home form has been their saviour so far, with five of their six La Liga wins coming at Estadio Municipal Butarque.

Around the New Year, Leganes looked like they were growing in confidence. They landed a shock away win at Barcelona before a gritty 1-0 home victory over another title contender in Atletico Madrid.

However, since the end of January, Leganes have suffered six defeats in eight games. They've scored just nine goals in eight games, and they've conceded a worrying 17 in that period.

It's not like they have a lengthy injury or suspension list to contend with. However, the issue is more likely to be a long, gruelling La Liga season catching up with them. The gulf in class between La Liga and La Liga 2 continues to widen, if not quite at the same speed as the Premier League and the EFL Championship.

However, Leganes' run-in makes us question whether they should be considered odds-on third favourites for relegation. That's because they face the current bottom two in their penultimate games of the season.

Their schedule also includes games against struggling Osasuna and Espanyol, who have won just once away all season.

While Leganes is given a 52.63% chance of relegation, the betting markets suggest Alaves only have a 42.19% chance of the drop.

Their probabilities should be significantly closer. Alaves averaged just 0.75 points per game from their last eight games. While that's slightly better than Leganes, their next six La Liga games look particularly tough.

They travel to Girona, before clashes with Real Madrid, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Atletico Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. Alaves will be comfortable underdogs in all six of those contests.

That leaves a lot of pressure on Alaves' final three games of the campaign. They host Valencia and Osasuna, who both have dreadful away records. There's also a trip to bottom club Real Valladolid, who are certain to be relegated by then.

Alaves have won just once in their last nine fixtures, just like Leganes. Scoring goals has been a big issue for Babazorros too, with eight goals in those previous nine games.

Espanyol sit two places and just two points above Leganes right now, albeit with a game in-hand. Their form has improved a lot since the turn of the New Year, and they have lost just twice in 2025.

They also defeated Real Madrid and recently drew with Atletico Madrid. However, their remaining fixtures until May are equally challenging.

In fact, they are only likely to be the pre-game favourites in two of their remaining ten games. One of those is on the final day of the season at home to Las Palmas.

Espanyol's away form has been dreadful. They've picked up just five points from a possible 39 on their travels this season.

The most concerning aspect for the Periquitos is that six of their remaining ten games are away from the RCDE Stadium. Four of their next five are on the road.

The betting markets give Espanyol a relegation probability of just over 30%. However, if their dreadful away form continues between now and 27th April, it's hard to see them picking up more than three points in that period.

To sum up, backing Alaves for relegation seems a better play than Leganes. Alternatively, you could take a chance on Espanyol now and consider cashing out after their run of four away games in five. If their away form continues to be woeful, it's likely their odds will drop.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}"

Check out our football expert's Liverpool vs Everton predictions and betting tips, prior to Wednesday's 15:00 ET Premier League clash (04/02).

All odds are courtesy of bet365, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change. 

Our Liverpool vs Everton predictions indicate things couldn't have gone much worse for Liverpool before the international break. One minute they were competing for a treble, the next they were out of the Champions League and League Cup. However, they are unbeaten in 25 Premier League games and have one hand on the trophy.

Everton, meanwhile, have put together a streak of their own under David Moyes. They're without defeat in nine league matches and find themselves in 15th place. While top-flight safety isn't mathematically confirmed yet, it's not far away, and they've proven hard to beat of late.

Liverpool Expected Lineup: Alisson, Quansah, Konate, Van Dijk, Robertson, Gravenberch, Mac Allister, Salah, Szoboszlai, Gakpo, Nunez

Everton Expected Lineup: Pickford, O'Brien, Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Mykolenko, Gueye, Garner, Harrison, Doucoure, Alcaraz, Beto

Arne Slot's men may have faced setbacks outside the Premier League, but they remain strong in the league. They've won four in a row at Anfield, scoring 11, and haven't lost at home since September. They'll be desperate to continue that form against their bitter rivals this week.

The Toffees haven't picked up many wins recently, but they also haven't lost many. You have to go back to mid-January to find their last league defeat, and they've scored in every game since. If the Reds are still reeling from their CL and cup defeats, Moyes' side will sense an opportunity.

It's only a few weeks since these two sides last faced off, and that game ended with four goals between them. However, potential injuries to Alisson, Ryan Gravenberch and Vitali Mykolenko are worth considering, and a tight game is expected.

The Reds are deservedly favourites for this one, but Everton will look for any weaknesses in their defence. Moyes' side have scored in nine consecutive Premier League games and got 17 goals along the way. They've had eight different scorers in that time period.

A total of 25 Premier League matches have gone by since Liverpool failed to score in one. Therefore, a clean sheet for the Toffees would come as a surprise, but they'll feel confident of breaking down their rivals. Their chances of doing so increase if Iliman Ndiaye and Dwight McNeil can get back in the mix.

Both players were back in training last week, but it remains to see how much - or even if - they will feature at Anfield. Both teams have scored in five of Liverpool's last nine across all competitions - for Everton, it's seven in 10.

Not many teams will be eager to play against Mo Salah right now, but Everton have extra reason to fear him. In his 12 games against the Toffees so far, Salah has scored eight and assisted two - including one of each the last time they met. 

The Egyptian has only failed to score in three of his 11 league outings since the turn of the year. He may not have been able to get things going against PSG or Newcastle United, but Everton should fear him. Slot's side will be out for revenge given the nature of their draw in February, and Salah is their destroyer-in-chief. 

There's been a winner in eight of the last 12 Merseyside derbies, and Liverpool are desperate to put March behind them with three big points.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}"

Real Valladolid, who are owned by a Brazilian legend Ronaldo, have been favourites for the drop for some time now. They've picked up one point from the last 30 available, and that point came against the team directly above them. They sit bottom of La Liga, 11 points off safety, and are destined for the drop.

Their next game pits them against mid-table Getafe. Jose Bordalas' side don't have much to play for except personal pride, but some recent results suggest they are still fighting. They recently beat Atletico Madrid, and even away from home, they're favourites in Valladolid.

Alvaro Rubio's bottom-dwellers are showing no signs of fight as they face the reality of relegation to Segunda División. They can't keep clean sheets, barely score, and another defeat is on the cards at Estadio José Zorrilla.

Similar to Valladolid in Spain, Italian outfit Monza appear to be out of luck. They're rock bottom of Serie A and have a 10-point deficit on 17th-placed Lecce - it's almost impossible to close. However, Alessandro Nesta's side have picked up points at home against some teams around them, and their next opponent is hardly flourishing.

Como have done enough to beat the drop. Impressive wins over Udinese, Fiorentina and Napoli saw them create a big gap between themselves and the bottom three. However, they were unable to see off relegation battlers Venezia and Empoli in March, and Monza have home advantage.

Drawing with the likes of Lecce, Parma and possibly Como won't keep I Brianzoli in the Italian top-flight. However, it would at least show their manager, an Azzurri legend, that there's still some fight in them.

As January came to an end, and Lecce had just beaten Parma 3-1, there didn't seem to be much doubt about I Salentini's status. They were 13th, and even though the points gap between them and the relegation zone was small, they seemed to be doing enough.

However, after a run of five straight defeats, they're on the brink of slipping into the bottom three. Marco Giampaolo's men have scored just three goals in their last seven, and Patrick Dorgu's move to Manchester United definitely didn't help. This weekend, however, they have a big opportunity on their hands.

Lecce go up against Venezia, who haven't won away since May, and a win could see them take a big step away from the drop zone. They'll need to rekindle some of their home form from late 2024, but Nikola Krstović rediscovered his scoring form ahead of the international break. That could help a lot.

In the 2011/12 season, a surprising new force emerged in French football. Montpellier, spearheaded by Olivier Giroud and Younès Belhanda, snatched the title from PSG against all expectations. Although their success was short-lived, they stayed in the top-flight for the 12 seasons that followed. 

That will all change this summer, though, with Jean-Louis Gasset's side in crisis. The Frenchman has won just three games since taking over in October, and there seems no way back for La Paillade. They're 11 points off safety, with seven games to play, and they have lost seven on the bounce.

This weekend, however, they face a side with a defensive record almost as bad as their own. Le Havre are in better form, with three solid wins in February/March giving them a fighting chance, but they struggle to keep clean sheets. With 16 games since their last one, Montpellier could end their four-game goalless run - even if they still lose.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}"

Manchester United still struggles to get consistent results in the Premier League as they suffered a disappointing loss against Nottingham Forest on Tuesday.  Meanwhile, Arsenal keeping their title hope alive after grabbing a slender win against Fulham.

The Red Devils have been picking up two straight victories in all competition and were looking for another positive result on Tuesday. However, playing away at the City Ground was far from an easy task for Ruben Amorin's side.

Man United found themselves trailing 1-0 after just five minutes when their former player Anthony Elanga burst through on goal following a swift counterattack. None of United's defenders can catch up with Elanga as he comfortably slotted the ball passed Andre Onana.

Despite the away team's continuous efforts to get back on level terms, Forest holds on to their lead and keeps their top four seats alive. As for United, that result now puts them in 13th place with 37 points from 30 matches.

Contrary to their rival, The Gunners were able to grab an important victory in front of their home crowd at the Emirates. Mikel Arteta's men took the lead in 37 minutes through Mikel Merino's effort before Bukayo Saka marked his return with a goal on 73 minutes.

Fulham didn't lay down easily as they kept on pushing hard and did manage to pull one back in injury time from Rodrigo Muniz's goal. Unfortunately, that effort was not enough to stop Arsenal from grabbing all three points and slightly keeping their title shot still alive.

That win now puts the Gunners on 61 points, nine points behind league leader, Liverpool, but Arne Slot's men do have one game in hand. Nevertheless, Arsenal can at least put a bit of pressure on their title rival.

It was here where she made her 2019 WTA debut as an 18-year-old wildcard, falling in straight sets to Laura Siegemund.

Navarro, who has been ranked as high as world No. 8 and owns two WTA titles to her name, is still seeking a strong result in Charleston. She owns a 2-4 record on the green clay, including one round-of-16 appearance.While the American will be applying all her lessons learned on court at her home tournament, off the court she's indulging her wanderlust as a way to unwind from the WTA grind.“On my days off, I prioritize rest for sure. But I also like to get out there and see some things,” Navarro tells me. ""I love to walk around different cities and neighborhoods especially, just see how the people live or see the different architecture.""Things like that make me feel like I'm a little bit in touch with the local people and my surroundings.”

Caty McNally had to scratch and claw her way to a victory over Anhelina Kalinina in the Round of 64 at the Credit One Charleston Open on Monday. However, the American should be better off after having come through that war, and she'll now turn her attention to a meeting with Anna Kalinskaya on Wednesday, April 2nd. Kalinskaya is a phenomenal player—she was the world No. 11 as recently as October of 2024—who won 33 matches last season. However, given the Russian's 4-7 record to start the 2025 season, it's hard not to view this as a winnable match for McNally. So, I'm backing the American at plus-money odds.Not only did McNally beat Kalinina on Monday, but she played at an extremely high level for a good chunk of that match. After going down 4-1 in the opening set, McNally won 15 out of the next 22 games. She was really looking dangerous as a ball-striker, she mixed her shots up well and she just looked a lot like the player that was world No. 54 back in May of 2023. McNally has also had a ton of time to get her feet wet on clay, as she beat Arina Rodionova and Claire Liu in qualifying. That's three clay-court matches at a venue she really enjoys.

Kalinskaya is coming over from Miami and hasn't played a clay-court match in a long time. Changing surfaces is always a tricky proposition, and this isn't the most confident player to begin with. Kalinskaya's best performance of the entire 2025 season was a 6-7 (3), 6-2, 6-7 (2) loss to Jessica Pegula in South Beach. And while it's definitely nice that the Russian was able to go toe-to-toe with one of the best players in the world, it still ended with Kalinskaya losing. That said, this isn't a player that knows the feeling of winning matches right now. That makes her vulnerable.Realistically, there's always a chance Kalinskaya will snap back into form and start rattling off wins. But at the moment, the 26-year-old has a 67.5% hold percentage, which is down from last year's 71.7% hold percentage. And her break percentage is below 30% for the first time since 2020. She's not doing anything at the level we're used to, and her rally tolerance has also been a problem. So, if McNally just shows up and plays a decent match, she'll be in this right until the end. It also doesn't hurt that the entire crowd will be pulling for her.Pick: McNally ML (+120)

 Flavio Cobolli showed plenty of character to snap an eight-match tour-level losing streak on Wednesday at the Tiriac Open presented by UniCredit Bank. 

 The No. 45 in the PIF ATP Rankings let slip a break lead in all three sets before prevailing 6-4, 4-6, 6-1 against Richard Gasquet at the clay-court ATP 250 in Bucharest. Cobolli began his 2025 season with victories against Dominic Stricker and Top 20 star Ugo Humbert at the United Cup in late December, but had won just one ATP Challenger Tour match since then until his one-hour, 55-minute opening-round defeat of Gasquet. 

 “I want to say thanks to the crowd, because I felt like I was at home,” said the 22-year-old. “I heard so many Italians here, and maybe some Romanians too. It's always a pleasure to play with an amazing player like Richard and I'm really happy to reach my first win of the [calendar] year, finally. 

 “When I play a tournament, my goal is to win the tournament, so I'm here to play my best game. I am focused to play match by match. I am happy now for the win, but I'm not happy because I want to win more.” 

Into the next round 💪@cobollifla takes out Gasquet 6-4 4-6 6-1 to advance in Bucharest!#TiriacOpen pic.twitter.com/11EIm9MKCR

 Cobolli converted six of 13 break points he earned against Gasquet, according to Infosys ATP Stats. He will hope to carry that form on return into his eighth ATP Tour quarter-final, in which he will take on Filip Misolic. The Austrian qualifier earlier upset eighth seed Camilo Ugo Carabelli 6-3, 6-1 in the Romanian capital. 

 Francisco Comesana was another second-round winner on Wednesday in Bucharest, where the Argentine downed fifth seed Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the pair's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. Meanwhile Comesana's countryman and top seed Sebastian Baez will have to return to court Thursday to try and seal his quarter-final spot: Baez was level at 7-6(5), 2-6 with Gabriel Diallo when play was cancelled for the day due to rain.

Ethan Quinn's first clay-court match on the ATP Tour was a memorable one.



The 21-year-old defeated World No. 35 Jordan Thompson 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 on Tuesday, earning the highest-ranked win of his career at the Fayez Sarofim & Co. U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship.



“That was a unique experience, my first one on clay. Not too comfortable out there. There are a few slips and a few almost falls,” said Quinn, who is competing in Houston at a career-high No. 130 in the PIF ATP Rankings.



“To get through that one, not on the floor, but also against a really tough opponent in Jordan — he beat me when I was a little bit younger just on Tour at a Challenger. To get revenge a little bit felt really good, but also to get one on clay and start the clay-court season.”








The wild card saved nine of the 13 break chances he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and will next play American qualifier Colton Smith, a standout senior at the University of Arizona. Smith defeated Quinn earlier this season at an ATP Challenger Tour event in Cleveland, overcoming the 2023 NCAA singles champion 1-6, 6-1, 6-4 in the first round. Smith went on to win the title.

The 22-year-old Smith, who is also competing at a career high (No. 200) this week, cruised past Australian James Duckworth 6-2, 6-2 in opening-round action at the ATP 250.In other Houston action, Kei Nishikori claimed his eighth tour-level win of the season by racing past American Mitchell Krueger 6-4, 6-2 in a dominant display under the lights.""I served really well today, I think that was the key to winning like this today,"" said Nishikori, who won 77 per cent of his first-serve points. ""Overall, I played pretty well. I think I'm pretty happy with every shot, every moment.""

Nishikori is making his third appearance at the clay-court event and first since reaching the final in 2011. One win shy of his 450th tour-level victory, the Japanese star will next face Christopher Eubanks.

The 28-year-old Eubanks and fellow American Mackenzie McDonald advanced with three-set wins. Eubanks defeated Rinky Hijikata 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 in a rematch of their first-round clash last year at the same event. Eubanks and Hijikata are now level at 1-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

McDonald outlasted Daniel Elahi Galan 6-2, 6-7(3), 6-4 to set a second-round clash against fourth seed Brandon Nakashima. The 29-year-old McDonald will test his perfect 4-0 record against Nakashima.Watch Extended Highlights from Tuesday's action in Houston:

WTA Staff


Three Americans were the first players to reach the WTA 500 Credit One Charleston Open Round of 16, with Madison Keys, Amanda Anisimova and defending champion Danielle Collins all booking third-round spots on Tuesday evening.

Charleston: Draws | Scores | Order of play

No. 2 seed Keys had the trickiest path of the three into the Round of 16. The reigning Australian Open champion needed eight match points before she could close out her fellow American Caroline Dolehide 6-3, 7-6(4).

Keys held her first four match points while up a set and a break at 6-3, 5-4. However, Dolehide erased those chances, and two more in the following game, battling back to level footing in the second set of the power-hitting clash.

Currently ranked a career-high World No. 5, Keys needed to hold firm in the tiebreak before she at last defeated her compatriot, earning her 20th match-win of the year.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

""I think [Dolehide] started playing some of her best tennis at the end, and I think I got a little bit passive, and then all of a sudden, seven match points later..."" Keys trailed off, shaking her head in her on-court interview. ""The drama is escalating, and everyone just kinda wants to go home.

""But I got it done, and I get to come back out and play another match here.""

The stage is still set for Keys to pick up her second Charleston title. She won the event in 2019, defeating Caroline Wozniacki to capture her first clay-court title, in a city where she has the best vibes.

""I've been coming here for more than the last decade, I love it here,"" Keys said. ""[Bjorn Fratangelo and I] got married here, I always feel like this is one of my favorite places in the entire world, and I'm so happy to be back playing here.""

Defending champ cruises: No. 7 seed Collins followed on Credit One Stadium, and she kicked off her title defense by besting fellow American Robin Montgomery 6-3, 6-1 in 1 hour and 9 minutes. Collins collected her seventh straight victory in Charleston.

Collins' title run last year was the middle of a 15-match winning streak on tour, which pushed her back into the Top 10 before the year was through. Collins won her first WTA 500 title here last year -- one week after she won her first WTA 1000 title at the 2024 Miami Open.

The determination to keep her Charleston streak going was evident from Collins on Tuesday, as she powered past 20-year-old Montgomery. Collins won 80 percent of her first-serve points and denied World No. 105 Montgomery any break points all evening.

""I'm most happy with my mindset, and just being relentless,"" Collins said on court, after her win. ""Going after my shots, not getting too down on myself after mistakes, and just giving myself room to breathe.""

Anisimova advances: The night on Credit One Stadium ended with No. 8 seed Anisimova's 6-2, 6-2 victory over the 2021 Charleston champion, Veronika Kudermetova. Anisimova was 0-2 against Kudermetova coming into Tuesday's match, but she finally got her first win over the former Top 10 player.

""It's always nice to be back, the first clay tournament of the year,"" Anisimova said on court after her victory. ""Veronika's a tough opponent, so I'm happy to be into the next round.""

Anisimova reached the semifinals here in 2022, which is her top showing at any WTA 500 event. She will hope to better that this week, during a stretch where she is arguably playing her career-best tennis. She won her biggest career title at WTA 1000 Doha in February, and yesterday she set a new career-high ranking of No. 16.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}"

Charismatic and versatile, he also won praise for memorable roles as Iceman in 'Top Gun' and Doc Holliday in 'Tombstone,' but his unpredictable behavior ruffled some feathers in Hollywood.


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


Val Kilmer, the charisma-oozing leading man who lost himself portraying such tormented, self-loathing characters as Jim Morrison, gunslinger Doc Holliday and Batman during his all-too-brief career, died Tuesday. He was 65.


	Kilmer, who came to fame for playing the competitive naval aviator Tom “Iceman” Kazansky alongside Tom Cruise in Tony Scott's 1986 mega box-office hit Top Gun, died of pneumonia in Los Angeles, his daughter, actress Mercedes Kilmer, told The New York Times.




	Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2015, and Val, a stirring documentary about his life that premiered at Cannes in July 2021, showed him needing a breathing tube.

	His death was announced as the actor was meant to be arriving for a rare red carpet appearance at the Beverly Hills Film Festival on Tuesday night. “It was a shock to find this out. We had just confirmed Val to attend the west coast premiere of American Badass: A Michael Madsen Retrospective this past weekend,” Nino Simone, founder and president of the Beverly Hills Film Festival, said on Wednesday.


	Raised in the San Fernando Valley in the shadow of Hollywood, Kilmer also was known for his meaty performances as Robert De Niro's nasty henchman in Michael Mann's Heat (1995); as Marlon Brando's insane assistant in John Frankenheimer's The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996); as the suave crook Simon Templar in Phillip Noyce's The Saint (1997); and as the homosexual detective Gay Perry in Shane Black's tribute to film noir, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005).


	Kilmer also impressively channeled Elvis Presley in Scott's True Romance (1993), written by Quentin Tarantino, and porn star/cocaine addict John Holmes in Wonderland (2003).


	He was married to British actress Joanne Whalley from 1988 until their divorce in 1996. They met while working together on Willow and wed months later.


	In Oliver Stone‘s The Doors (1991), Kilmer, with long brown hair and skintight black leathers, was eerily realistic as Morrison, the L.A. band's iconic frontman who succumbed to drugs in 1971 at age 27. The actor took months to prepare for the role, and he recorded his baritone voice against the backing of original Doors master tapes for the film.

	











	The soundtrack “combines Morrison's original vocals and new vocals by Val Kilmer so seamlessly that there is never, not even for a moment, the sensation that Kilmer is not singing everything we hear,” Roger Ebert wrote in his review.


	“That illusion is strengthened by Kilmer's appearance. He looks so uncannily like Jim Morrison that we feel this is not a case of casting, but of possession. The performance is the best thing in the movie — and since nearly every scene centers on Morrison, that is not small praise. Val Kilmer has always had a remarkable talent, which until now has been largely overlooked.”


	Kilmer also was quite compelling with his scene-stealing turn as the doomed Holliday, a sickly alcoholic who's quick on the draw, in the modern Western classic Tombstone (1993).


	“He works harder than most actors to make it look believable,” Tombstone director George Cosmatos told the Los Angeles Times in 1993. “He's in the ranks of the great actors in America like [Al] Pacino or De Niro.”


	Kilmer then took the cowl vacated by Michael Keaton to star as the moody Caped Crusader in Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever (1995). The film raked in $336 million at the global box office, and only Toy Story grossed more that year.


	“For me, Val Kilmer was the best Batman,” Schumacher once said, even though they reportedly clashed on the set. (Frankenheimer also didn't get along with Kilmer; after Dr. Moreau, he said that the two things he would never do again were “climb Mount Everest and work with Val Kilmer again.”)

	











	On Batman Forever, “Everything was different about this job than I'd experienced before,” the actor told Entertainment Tonight in 1995. “The size of the character and how strange it was that Michael Keaton had decided not to do it — I just said yes, without reading the script.”


	When he and Warner Bros. couldn't agree to terms, Kilmer was one and done as Batman, opting not to return for Schumacher's Batman & Robin (1997) as George Clooney stepped in.


	Val Edward Kilmer, part Cherokee, Irish, German and Swedish, was born on New Year's Eve 1959 in the L.A. suburb of Chatsworth. His father was an aerospace engineer and real estate developer and his mother a housewife — they would end up divorcing when he was 9 — and he had one older brother, one younger.


	Wesley, his younger sibling, suffered an epileptic seizure and drowned in a swimming pool at the family home that his father had bought from Western movie legends Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. At the time, Kilmer was about to leave to study acting at Juilliard in New York; he was 17 and the youngest person to be admitted to the school's drama division.


	“It was quite an emotional time for me, and in a way, the extremely high standards and the activity of the school I'm sure were good for me, because I was forced to really challenge myself about my very life, you know — what I believe about life and death,” he said in a 2005 interview.

	











	At Juilliard, he co-wrote How It All Began, a play based on the true story of a West German radical, and it wound up being directed by Des McAnuff and produced by Joseph Papp for The Public Theater. He made his Broadway debut in 1983's Slab Boys, also featuring Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon.


	In his first film, Kilmer starred as rockabilly teen idol Nick Rivers in the daffy spy spoof Top Secret! (1984) from Jim Abrahams and the Zucker brothers. (He also was dating Cher around this time.)


	He made an ABC Afterschool Special called One Too Many, in which he played a teenage alcoholic alongside Mare Winningham, then portrayed a lazy laser-technology whiz kid in Real Genius (1985), from director Martha Coolidge.


	When Scott approached him for Top Gun, Kilmer said he wasn't interested. “I told Tony at the meeting, ‘Frankly, I don't like this.' I loved what I'd seen of his work, but I just didn't want to do that movie,” he recalled in the Times interview. “He said, ‘Don't worry, your hair will look great.' He thought that would make a difference. He was infectious that way.”


	For many fans, Iceman was his signature role: “People talk about it pretty much every time I go to an airport,” he said.

	











	Kilmer returned for the 2022 sequel, and his health issues were evident. His brief scenes in the movie, David Rooney wrote in THR‘s review, generated “resonant pathos. There's reciprocal warmth, even love, in a scene between Iceman and [Cruise's] Maverick that acknowledges the characters' hard-won bond as well as the rivalry that preceded it, with gentle humor.”


	Kilmer also provided the voice of K.I.T.T. in a new version of TV's Knight Rider in 2008-09; played opposite Nicolas Cage in Werner Herzog's Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009); portrayed the bad guy Cunth for laughs in MacGruber (2010); starred for Francis Ford Coppola in Twixt (2011); was a creepy building superintendent in The Super (2018); and directed, wrote and starred as Mark Twain in Citizen Twain, a one-man show that he brought to stages around the country and then to the big screen.


	In 2011, Kilmer sold off most of his 6,000-acre ranch outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he had lived for decades. He told THR in December 2017 that his faith as a Christian Scientist helped him deal with his cancer ordeal.


	Survivors include his son, Jack, an actor as well.

The country music star, who a source says walked away from the dress-rehearsal goodnights much like the live show, declined.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	Apparently, the way “to God's country” has a shortcut right through the heart of 30 Rock's famed Studio 8H.


	Country music star Morgan Wallen exited stage dead center midway during Saturday Night Live's “goodnights” late Saturday night/early Sunday morning. The abrupt departure stirred up the internet when, post-show, Wallen posted an Instagram story depicting a jet and the caption: “Get me to God's country.” Wallen hails from Tennessee.




	Wallen has not directly addressed his exodus, but a source now tells The Hollywood Reporter that Wallen did the same thing during dress rehearsal, which is taped. On the dress tape, Wallen could be seen onstage starting the process with everyone else — but after a quick cutaway, he was gone. Show host Mikey Madison (Anora) and others carried on with the hugs and the waves, just as they did for the real deal. SNL's dress rehearsal has a live studio audience (albeit a different one), just like the live show. Dress rehearsal is two hours long versus the live show's 90-minute runtime.

	For the live show, with the director staying centerstage, Wallen's exit at least looked more dramatic. The steady camera angle perfectly and fully captured the route Wallen used to exit. En route to God's country, Wallen walked right off the Studio 8H stage and into your living room, basically.


	Still, at the time, no one really thought much of it, a source recalls. Wallen's team was “so nice” throughout the entire week, the person who spoke with THR on the condition of anonymity, adds. It was the internet that made this a thing, which is what the internet does best.


	Longtime castmember Kenan Thompson says he “definitely” noticed Wallen dip.


	“You see somebody before you get a chance to say hi or say good job or anything like that, they just dipping,” Thompson told Entertainment Weekly. “I thought maybe he had to go to the potty or something.


	“I don't know what goes through people's minds when they decide to do stuff like that,” Thompson said. “I don't know if he understood the assignment or not, or if he was really feeling a certain kind of way.”


	On occasion, especially when a sketch gets cut, an upset performer may not end up joining everyone else. No one forces them up on the stage, the source said.

	











	But this was so much more noticeable, and some amateur internet sleuths believe it was a purposefully visible protest. Wallen appeals to a huge number of conservatives, and SNL skews very liberal.


	Wallen has a bit of a checkered history with Saturday Night Live. In October 2020, SNL canceled Wallen's scheduled debut as SNL musical guest after videos of the singer brazenly violating CDC-recommended social-distancing guidelines went viral. He ultimately performed on the show just two months later and participated in a parody of the incident and its fallout.


	Sketch-comedy conspiracy theorists are now also locking on to the fact that Wallen did not appear in a pretaped sketch, which typically are filmed on a Friday (sometimes a Thursday). That's also not unusual, the source close to the show said. Sometimes the show's musical guests are particularly busy away from the SNL sets — or maybe they just want focus on their musical performance. Sometimes they just don't like the proposed sketch.


	Joe Jonas popped up on Saturday's SNL to sing the bridge on Big Dumb Line, a pretaped musical number about waiting in long New York City lines for viral foods, which grow increasingly stranger in nature. Wallen was asked to the do part, a source says, but he “wasn't available.”


	Wallen performed a pair of songs from his upcoming album, I'm the Problem, on the final SNL of March 2025. And then he was out.


	“I had a wonderful time, thank you all,” Madison said, as the house band played, and the closing credits began to roll. Wallen then gave Madison a hug and said something in her ear.

The much-loved actor died on Tuesday from pneumonia after battling throat cancer for several years. 


							By 

	Abid Rahman


International Editor, Digital


Michael Mann, Francis Ford Coppola, Nicolas Cage and Josh Brolin were among the many entertainment industry figures who paid tribute to Val Kilmer after news of his death was announced. 


	Kilmer died of pneumonia in Los Angeles, his daughter, actress Mercedes Kilmer, told The New York Times. He was 65. The actor was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2015.




	His death was announced as the actor was meant to be arriving for a rare red carpet appearance at the Beverly Hills Film Festival on Tuesday night. “It was a shock to find this out. We had just confirmed Val to attend the West Coast premiere of American Badass: A Michael Madsen Retrospective this past weekend,” Nino Simone, founder and president of the Beverly Hills Film Festival, said on Wednesday.

	The much-loved and incredibly versatile actor had a diverse filmography, excelling both as a leading man (Batman Forever, The Saint, Top Secret!, Willow, The Doors, Real Genius) and as a scene-stealing supporting player (Tombstone, Top Gun, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Heat) in a variety of genres. Kilmer was also the subject of the 2021 documentary Val, which is an intimate portrait of the actor that explores his battle with throat cancer, his artistic passions and his reflections on his career.


	In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, filmmaker Michael Mann said, “While working with Val on Heat I always marveled at the range, the brilliant variability within the powerful current of Val's possessing and expressing character. After so many years of Val battling disease and maintaining his spirit, this is tremendously sad news.”


	Nicolas Cage said in a statement to THR, “I always liked Val and am sad to hear of his passing. I thought he was a genius actor. I enjoyed working with him on Bad Lieutenant and I admired his commitment and sense of humor. He should have won the Oscar for The Doors.”


	Francis Ford Coppola said on Instagram: “Val Kilmer was the most talented actor when in his High School, and that talent only grew greater throughout his life. He was a wonderful person to work with and a joy to know — I will always remember him.”


Josh Brolin wrote on Instagram, “See ya, pal. I'm going to miss you. You were a smart, challenging, brave, uber-creative firecracker. There's not a lot left of those. I hope to see you up there in the heavens when I eventually get there. Until then, amazing memories, lovely thoughts. ❤️💔❤️💔❤️💔💎 #valkilmer #marktwain,” The second hashtag a reference to Kilmer's lifelong passion for Mark Twain, which culminated in the actor portraying the famed writer and humorist twice onscreen and in the theater production Citizen Twain.

	











	Also on Instagram, actor Josh Gad wrote, “RIP Val Kilmer. Thank you for defining so many of the movies of my childhood. You truly were an icon.”


White Lotus star Michelle Monaghan, his co-star in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, shared to Instagram: “A kind, curious, committed, rebellious, and radical gent. I learned from one of the greats. An artist through and through. I treasured my time with you.❤️ Godspeed buddy.”


	Matthew Modine tweeted, “RIP Val Kilmer. If it wasn't for our chance encounter at the Source in 1985, I may never have been cast in FULL METAL JACKET. Thanks, Val. 🙏☮️”


	On Bluesky, Emmy-nominated TV writer and comedian Mike Drucker wrote, “Val Kilmer felt like an actor who, no matter what the material, always understood the assignment.”


	Brian Lynch, the screenwriter behind Minions and Secret Life of Pets, wrote on Bluesky, “The Doors. Top Secret! Tombstone. Top Gun. Real Genius. Willow. Batman Forever. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. True Romance. Macgruber. Heat. There was nobody like Val Kilmer. May he Rest in Peace.”


	On X, Jennifer Tilly offered her memory of Kilmer auditioning for The Doors. “A long time ago, I was auditioning for the movie ‘The Doors' It was kind of a cattle call,” she wrote. “They paired together potential Jims with potential Pamela‘s. And they were running behind so we were spilling out of the casting office, sitting on the porch, the lawn, and the driveway. All of a sudden, a sixties convertible came screeching up, blaring Doors Music at top volume. And a guy jumped out and strode inside: He had wild hair and he was barefoot, shirtless, and wearing nothing but a pair of tight leather pants.”

	











	Tilly added, “We all looked at each other like … Who is this guy? We were more than a little shook by the sheer audacity of his entrance. Well of course it was Val Kilmer and from that minute on, nobody else stood a chance. Rip King.”


	Cher, who dated Kilmer in the '80s, wrote on X: “VALUS Will miss u, U Were Funny, crazy, pain in the ass, GREAT FRIEND, kids 💜 U, BRILLIANT as Mark Twain, BRAVE here during ur sickness.” 


	Lucasfilm executive Pablo Hidalgo wrote on Bluesky, “Oh man, not Val Kilmer. His comedic chops were top notch but he had a fascinating storm roiling beneath the surface. Madmartigan was an icon.”


	Famed movie critic Richard Roeper tweeted, “Val Kilmer should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Tombstone and for Heat. He was a brilliant presence in some of the most enduring films of his generation. Rest well. Thank you for the incredible work.”


	Writer-director Dylan Park-Pettiford tweeted, “Listen, Val Kilmer had me wanting to fly fighter jets, be Batman, rob banks, and hunt lions as a kid. They don't make too many movie stars like him anymore. Generational.”


Ringer owner Bill Simmons tweeted, “There wasn't anyone quite like Val Kilmer. Really enjoyed his work. RIP.”


	On X, the official Top Gun movie account tweeted, “Remembering Val Kilmer, whose indelible cinematic mark spanned genres and generations. RIP Iceman.”


	Like many other users on social media, Indonesian filmmaker Timo Tjahjanto (The Shadow Strays, Nobody 2), posted a famous scene from Heat, where Kilmer's character interacts with Ashley Judd's character for the final time. Tjahjanto wrote, “A masterpiece exercise in saying nothing and expressing everything. Rest in Peace truly.”

	











	Actress Sasha Grey tweeted on X, “Rest In Peace Val Kilmer, an absolute legend. He played some of my favorite characters in some of my favorite movies of all time. Condolences to his family 🫶 He was 65.”


	On Instagram, Harry Potter star David Thewlis wrote about co-starring with Kilmer in The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996): “I spent the most bizarre 5 months of my entire life with Val Kilmer, out in the Australian rainforest, on the ill-fated Island of Dr Moreau. It was so spectacularly bleak and awful it was almost wonderful. Look it up sometime. As Val wrote in his final mail to me: ‘What an incredible story we lived, you and I. One of the greatest.' Bittersweet to be back here in Australia and hear the heartbreaking news. He was one of the most extraordinary people I have ever met. Proud to have called him a friend and co-conspirator.”


	Actor Joe Manganiello shared a tribute on Instagram: “He was one of the main reasons I wanted to become an actor and why I felt it was so important for me to seek out classical training. He could do it all… drama, comedy, classical… He was great with a sword, a gun, a fighter jet, or a shot cup. Then on top of all of that, he could sing… case in point: for most of my life when I tried to picture Jim Morrison, I could only see him. His performances were brave and intelligent, and he showed me that you didn't always have to be the star in order to make the most impact. If the situation presented itself, you could take a tiny, nothing part on paper and elevate it into a scene stealer. Oh, and he got to be Batman. RIP to one of the all time greats…”

	











	The account for Film at Lincoln Center posted on X, “Rest in peace to our former campus mate, the great Val Kilmer (1959-2025), who at 17 was the youngest drama student ever admitted to The Julliard School's Drama Division.”

Johnson and Bilton have scoured tens of thousands of pages of court transcripts and federal investigation files never before seen by the public to tell the story of Wilford “Nappy” Pulawa, Hawaii's first and only mob boss.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	As far as careers goes, Dwayne Johnson has built out several. Actor, athlete, entrepreneur, wrestler. Now get ready for Dwayne Johnson, true crime author.


	Crown, the imprint under a division of Penguin Random House, has preemptively acquired a new true-life crime book to be co-authored by Johnson and award-winning investigative journalist Nick Bilton.




	The non-fiction book will chronicle the mostly untold story of a fierce and defiant Hawaiian crime syndicate known as The Company that battled outsider gangs and corporate invaders during the 1960s and 1970s. And it will shine a spotlight on Wilford “Nappy” Pulawa — the first and only Hawaiian mob boss in history.

	The book deal occurs in tandem with a movie deal inked last week with 20th Century Studios and involves Hollywood heavyweights Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio and Emily Blunt, in addition to Johnson and Bilton. The project was born from the close, ‘ohana-like bond between Blunt and Johnson, who worked closely on Jungle Cruise, with the original idea sparked by Blunt. From there, Johnson and Bilton expanded the concept into a sweeping narrative and investigative book, uncovering the hidden history behind what was one of the most powerful criminal syndicates in America.


	Johnson's Polynesian roots, his formative years in Hawaii, and family ties make the telling of this story a deeply personal endeavor. Johnson and Bilton jumped deep into the volcano to explore tens of thousands of documents, from FBI files to court transcripts, and tracked down those who lived through this hidden chapter of American crime history for personal interviews. For the duo, it was a way to recount Hawaii's systematic theft by outsiders through the lens of this unique era.


	“This isn't just a gangster story, it's about power, identity, and what was taken from the Hawaiian people,” Johnson said in a statement. “What drew me to this project wasn't just the action and the intensity; for me, this story hits close to home. It's not just history, it's personal. My own family lived through parts of this era, and I've seen firsthand the complicated legacy it left behind. Telling this story is a way to honor our Polynesian culture, and honor where we come from and share the untold history of what really happened in paradise.”  

	











	While still a ruthless criminal who rose to control a vast underworld on the islands, Pulawa stood apart from the traditional criminal elements. The book will show his singular focus of protecting his people, who were under both physical and cultural attack from Asia and America. He watched as his people's land, culture, and heritage was systematically taken and exploited by outsiders, from American corporations to powerful Asian crime syndicates.


	Driven by a profound determination to reclaim control and preserve his Hawaiian identity, Pulawa built an unprecedented criminal empire in the late 1960s through the 1970s. Known for his signature aloha shirts and fresh orchid leis, he resorted to unmatched levels of violence because the stakes were personal: his people's very survival. The book will show how Pulawa ascended to power rivaling mainland crime legends like Luciano, Capone and Gotti, until it all dramatically unraveled.


	“This is an astonishing story filled with jaw-dropping twists, devastating cultural stakes, and the kind of unforgettable characters that writers dream about but rarely find outside the pages of fiction,” stated Bilton, the best-selling author of Hatching Twitter and American Kingpin and producer of the Emmy Award-winning HBO documentary The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley. “It's exactly the type of true story that draws me in most, one where you can't easily separate heroes from villains, and every character forces you to reconsider what you thought you knew about right and wrong.”

	











	Bilton continued, “Working with Dwayne, Emily Blunt and the incredible Gillian Blake at Crown on this book has been extraordinary, like excavating a lost history that was never meant to be found. What we have uncovered isn't just a story about crime, it's about power, identity, and the brutal cost of survival in the war for paradise.”


	The deal was negotiated by Jay Mandel and Erin Malone of WME and Blake, who is the executive vp, publisher and editor in chief of Crown. Blake will also serve as the book's editor.  


	“How often these days do we come across an epic and untold American story?” Blake posited proudly. “This is one of those rare moments, and what makes this book even more special is the talent involved: Dwayne Johnson, with his unique and exciting storytelling ability and intimate roots to Hawaiian culture, and Nick Bilton, one of the best investigative journalists writing today.”


	Added Blake: “Crown is setting its sights, like its namesake, to the top. This book will take its place alongside classic organized crime bestsellers like Mario Puzo's The Godfather and Nicholas Pileggi's Wiseguy, while also illuminating a historical period when the fight to preserve the Hawaiian way of life for its people turned deadly.”


	One of the big names in narrative non-fiction, Bilton has written for publications such as Vanity Fair and The New York Times and earned a “Best Book of the Year” honor from The Wall Street Journal and Audible for American Kingpin. He created the Netflix documentary Biggest Heist Ever, based on his “Bitcoin Bonnie and Clyde” magazine feature for Vanity Fair.

	











	Johnson actually made his book writing debut back in 2000 with the publishing of his memoir The Rock Says…, which became a New York Times best-seller. The Hawaiian crime book will be a far cry from the tone of that account, written before Johnson's rise as a Hollywood A-lister. He will next be seen in the upcoming A24 drama The Smashing Machine co-starring Blunt, and written and directed by Benny Safdie.

""Sidney Poitier said, 'You are not Denzel [Washington], and you are not Morgan [Freeman]. You are a breath of fresh air, and don't f*** with that!'"" Murphy recalls.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Eddie Murphy is opening up about some advice Sidney Poitier once gave him that left him surprised.


	In Apple TV+'s new documentary, Number One on the Call Sheet: Black Leading Men in Hollywood, the Beverly Hills Cop actor shared that the Oscar winner told him not to star in 1992's Malcom X. At the time, the film was initially being helmed by Norman Jewison, Poitier's In the Heat of the Night director, who cast Denzel Washington in the lead role before Spike Lee took over as director.




	“They were talking about doing Malcolm X,” Murphy recalled. “Norman Jewison was putting it together. They were gonna use The Autobiography of Malcolm X by Alex Haley. And they approached me about playing Alex Haley. Around that same time, I bumped into Sidney Poitier at something, and I asked him, ‘Yeah, I'm thinking about playing Alex Haley!' And Sidney Poitier said, ‘You are not Denzel [Washington], and you are not Morgan [Freeman]. You are a breath of fresh air, and don't fuck with that!'”

	Murphy admitted he “didn't know” if Poitier's advice “was an insult or a compliment,” but was just shocked to be compared to Washington and Freeman. “I was like, ‘What?'” he added.


	Elsewhere in Black Leading Men in Hollywood, Murphy speculated as to why Poitier didn't put him in the same group as Washington and Freeman. 


	“I was in uncharted waters. For Sidney and all those guys, when I showed up, it was something kinda new,” the Dreamgirls actor said. “They didn't have a reference for me, they couldn't give me advice, 'cause I was 20, 21 years old, and my audience was the mainstream — all of everywhere. My movies [were] all around the world, and they had never had that with a young Black person. So nobody could give me advice, really. Everything broke really big and really fast.”


	While Lee's Malcom X didn't include Haley as a character, the film ended up being a huge critical success, earning two Oscar nominations: best actor for Washington and best costume design for Ruth E. Carter.

Days after the viral moment, the singer has listed T-shirts and trucker hats with the phrase for $45 on his website.


							By 

	Ethan Millman



Morgan Wallen seems to be leaning into his controversial viral moment from Saturday Night Live, as the country superstar is now selling “Get Me to God's Country” merchandise on his website.


	Wallen caused a stir over the weekend as he walked off stage during the closing moments of the show, then posted a picture on his Instagram story of an airplane along with the caption “Get Me to God's Country.” T-shirts and trucker hats with the phrase are listed for $45 each.




	A source familiar with the matter says it wasn't a pre-planned moment, and that discussions about the merch had begun between Wallen and Bravado — Universal Music Group's merchandise arm — as early as Sunday when the singer's post had turned into a viral moment. Bravado had the design done by Monday, and the merch hit his website Tuesday afternoon.

	The “Last Night” singer's abrupt dip and Instagram post have caused speculation for days on what happened, and Wallen himself hasn't addressed the situation. A source told The Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday that Wallen also did the walk-off during dress rehearsal. Wallen was also asked to participate in the “Big Dumb Line” musical sketch that aired Saturday, but a source said he wasn't available, and Joe Jonas did the part instead.


	Wallen has courted controversy in the past, most notably when he was caught on video using the N-word back in 2021, putting a temporary setback on his career. He's got some history with SNL, with his initial debut canceled back in 2020 after a video surfaced of him breaking social distancing protocols at the height of the pandemic. He would make his official debut on the show two months later. 


	Kenan Thompson weighed in on the move in an interview with Entertainment Weekly earlier this week.  


	“I don't know what goes through people's minds when they decide to do stuff like that,” Thompson said. “I don't know if he understood the assignment or not or if he was really feeling a certain kind of way.”


SNL writer Josh Patten, who says he's a fan of Wallen, poked fun at the situation, posting the “God's Country” phrase to highlight a Krispy Kreme truck.

Plus, why Graydon Carter's ghost writer should get a raise and Marvel's extremely weird musical chair stunt breaks livestream records.


							By 

	Benjamin Svetkey and Julian Sancton, Editors



	Yes, politics indeed makes strange bedfellows — in Gavin Newsom‘s case, his ex-wife. Turns out Kimberly Guilfoyle, who was married to the governor when he was mayor of San Francisco in the early 2000s — and who after the divorce became a Fox News star and then, for a time, Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend as well as a major MAGA player — has been helping Newsom with his recent political pivot. According to various reports, Guilfoyle, 56, was the one who persuaded right-wingers Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk to appear on her ex-husband's new extremist-friendly podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, where the potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate is, in his own words, “exploring the other side” to figure out why Republicans are “kicking our ass.” Not surprisingly, Newsom has been taking some serious heat over the dialogues and for his apparent about-face on issues like trans women in sports (“Deeply unfair,” Newsom called it during his chat with Kirk), and not just from his indigo-blue base. “What the hell is going on with Gavin Newsom?” CNN anchor Erin Burnett wondered out loud during a recent segment about the podcasts. According to insiders, though, the least shocking part of Newsom's seeming right turn is Guilfoyle's participation. Newsom, who has been married since 2008 to documentary filmmaker Jennifer Siebel Newsom, has been friendly with Guilfoyle for years despite her palling around with a president who frequently refers to her ex-husband as “Newscum.” Says one insider: “This doesn't surprise me at all. Gavin has had a decent professional connection — or maybe transactional is the word — with Kimberly before she started dating Donald Trump Jr. He wasn't fazed by her political transformation, and he'd talk to her every once in a while. As far as I know, there wasn't a year that they didn't talk.” — ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY PETER KIEFER

	Graydon Carter became a rich and famous magazine editor by publishing juicy gossip about the rich and famous — so, in honor of his just-published memoir, When the Going Was Good, let's do some of that for a while. Rumor has it Penguin Press ponied up something close to $900,000 for Carter's book, in which he details his rise from a Canadian railroad lineman (no joke) to a Time Inc. staff writer to a founding co-editor of the late, great Spy magazine and, finally, to his long tenure as editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair, the pinnacle of glossy publishing during the late 20th century. Nearly a million dollars may sound like a lot by today's standards, but back during VF‘s heyday in the late 1990s, Carter, now 75, would sometimes offer mere magazine writers $500,000 contracts to pen a measly three articles a year. More intriguing is how little Carter's ghostwriter — if ghost is even the term that applies — got paid for the memoir. Sources say James Fox, author of the 1984 best-seller White Mischief as well as Keith Richards' 2010 memoir, Life, was given a stipend of $10,000 a month over the course of a year, earning about $120,000. Aside from the unusual monthly arrangement — ghostwriters are typically paid an advance upfront and the rest of their pay upon delivery and publication — Fox's fee seems notably anemic. “U.K. writers tend to be paid less, but I'd be surprised if Fox were only paid that much,” offers a well-placed source in the ghostwriting industry. “Also, we don't know if Fox did a complete write or whether he just edited what Graydon had written.” No, we don't, and neither Carter's publishers nor Fox responded to Rambling's request for clarification. But Carter recently hinted at how critical Fox had been in getting his memoir between covers. “I'm a writer, so it wasn't the same as when he worked with Keith Richards,” Carter told The Guardian. “But he was instrumental, showing me how to shape it. Not everything happens in a linear fashion. Nobody wants to read a book that begins in Toronto General Hospital.”

	











	What were you doing between 8 a.m. and 1:27 p.m. on Wednesday, March 26? Because several million otherwise rational people were glued to their computer screens — for five hours and 27 minutes — watching a camera panning slowly, so very slowly, across a stage filled only with empty director chairs. This was how Marvel Studios unveiled the cast of its next superhero tentpole, Avengers: Doomsday, with a livestream that played out more like an experimental Andy Warhol movie than a pumped-up marketing stunt. While the names inscribed on the 27 director chairs shown on the feed were certainly impressive — Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, plus a bunch of old-timey X-Men (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and Rebecca Romijn) and assorted other MCU regulars (Chris Hemsworth, Paul Rudd and Anthony Mackie) — none of these stars turned up for the event. Or at least almost none. If you stuck around for the full 316 minutes of chair viewing (sometimes accompanied by a trippy, humming, ambient soundtack), you were treated at the end to a very brief appearance by Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr., who sat in his chair and silently mugged for the camera for a moment. The weirdest, most inexplicable part of the bizarre spectacle? Viewers loved it. Marvel's chair-a-palooza racked up an astonishing 275 million views, making it the biggest livestream in Marvel history. “It was a roaring success,” crows a Marvel source. “Like, very roaring.”

New Line's video game adaptation shared clips at CinemaCon, including Karl Urban as the sunglasses enthusiast.



		By Aaron Couch, Ryan Gajewski 

	April 1, 2025 5:30pm	




Mortal Kombat 2 kicked its way into the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace Tuesday, where New Line chief Richard Brenner introduced the first footage from the film.


	A sizzle reel teased the video game adaptation's key characters, including Karl Urban as Johnny Cage. “I am Johnny fucking Cage,” Urban says in the clip. “It's showtime.”




	Brenner said of Mortal Kombat 2, “Expect amazing fights, epic battles and a few fatalities.” It hits theaters Oct. 24.


	The feature is based on the popular video game franchise that dates back to the 1990s. It arrives four years after the previous Mortal Kombat movie hit amid the pandemic and hails from returning director Simon McQuoid. This time, Urban headlines as fan-favorite character Johnny Cage, with Tati Gabrielle joining the franchise as Jade and Adeline Rudolph joining as Kitana. Returning stars include Ludi Lin (Liu Kang), Mehcad Brooks as Jax, Lewis Tan as Cole Young, Jessica McNamee as Sonya Blade, Hiroyuki Sanada as Scorpion, Tadanobu Asano as Lord Raiden and Joe Taslim as Sub-Zero.

	The sequel centers on the group of ragtag fighters who must defend Earth from the evil forces of Outworld. The films come decades after a pair of Mortal Kombat features made in the 1990s. The first, 1995's Mortal Kombat, was profitable and is still fondly remembered. 1997's Mortal Kombat: Annihilation came and went without making a splash.


	The new feature is produce by Atomic Monster's James Wan and Michael Clear, and Broken Road Productions' Todd Garner. McQuoid and E. Bennett Walsh are also producing.


A previous version of this story misstated the name of the 1997 Mortal Kombat movie.

Warner Bros. recently confirmed that it would be pushing the release date on Gyllenhaal's Frankenstein pic ‘The Bride' from Sept. 26, 2025, to March 6, 2026. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Maggie Gyllenhaal took the veil off The Bride in Las Vegas.


	The filmmaker, joined by title star Jessie Buckley, took to the Colosseum stage inside Caesars Palace on Tuesday afternoon during Warner Bros.‘ studio presentation to offer the first look at her anticipated sophomore feature. They were joined by WB bosses Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy.




The Bride finds Gyllenhaal putting her own spin on Mary Shelley's story, setting it in 1930s Chicago and following a lonesome Frankenstein's monster who enlists the help of Dr. Euphronios to create a companion for himself. They revive a murdered woman, creating the titular bride. Buckley stars opposite Christian Bale, Penélope Cruz, Annette Bening, John Magaro and Julianne Hough. It's also a bit of a family affair, as Gyllenhaal cast her younger brother, Jake Gyllenhaal, and husband, Peter Sarsgaard.

	Gyllenhaal said that after her directorial debut, The Lost Daughter, she was looking for a follow-up that was “pop and big” and “radical” at the same time. Then she went to a party where she encountered a man with a tattoo of the bride of Frankenstein on his arm. “It hooked me and I went home and watched the movie,” she continued. “The bride is in the movie for about three minutes, and she doesn't speak, which could not be more different than our bride.”


	So Gyllenhaal conceived of a bride who is beyond Frankenstein's wildest imagination, a mate who doesn't really fit in a box. She added that she's also interested in monsters. “All of us have a little aspect of something monstrous in us, which is why we love monster movies, probably,” the filmmaker said. “You can run from it your entire life, or you can shake hands with it.”


	As for Buckley, she said when she read Gyllenhaal's script, it felt as if she were being plugged into an electrical current. “It was so wild and so unique. I love her, she's an amazing, amazing woman. She could've asked me to be a sheep, and I would've said yes.”


	Asked to describe The Bride's relationship with Frankenstein, Buckley called it “the punkest love that's ever existed,” with traces of Bonnie and Clyde and Wild at Heart. “Our one has some petrol in its skin and we're holding a match.”


	Gyllenhaal noted that those who have seen the film report back that “they haven't really seen anything like it before.” Gyllenhaal, who also spoke about shooting the film for Imax, enthusiastically addressed theater owners during her comments. “This is a cinematic movie,” he said. “Frankenstein is a lover of movies in our movie. His closest relationship before The Bride is with a movie star. I wanted to make this punk, monstrous love story in a classic cinematic way that really respected these characters.”

	











	She then introduced the footage that showed scenes of a burial, followed by Buckley's character being revived by the monster, who says in a voiceover, “There's nothing left to do now than live.” The following scenes show the pair making their way through various locations and encountering a cast of characters that show an epic journey through vivid landscapes. In a scene reminiscent of Joker and Harley Quinn, Frankenstein is seen violently murdering someone in a street. Across the screen flashed a tagline, “Here Comes the Mother Fucking Bride.” To close it out, Buckley's bride is seen asking, “What's my name? I can't remember.”

A post shared by Maggie Gyllenhaal (@mgyllenhaal)


	Warner Bros. also recently confirmed that it would be pushing the release date on The Bride from Sept. 26, 2025, to March 6, 2026. Gyllenhaal made her directorial debut on Netflix's The Lost Daughter after a long career in front of the camera.


CinemaCon, the annual gathering of cinema owners and Hollywood studios, is hosted in Las Vegas by the newly rebranded Cinema United, which for decades was known as the National Association of Theatre Owners. This year's edition runs from March 31 to April 3.

The ‘Ted Lasso' star also remains in negotiations to reprise her role on the soccer comedy.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Writer


Ted Lasso star Juno Temple is returning to Apple TV+ — in a different series.


	The four-time Emmy nominee will star in a “comedic drama” called The Husbands, based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Holly Gramazio. The show comes from A24, which also produced Sunny and Mr. Corman for the streamer.




	Temple remains in negotiations to reprise her role as Keeley Jones in Ted Lasso, which Apple recently picked up for a fourth season. 


	In The Husbands, Temple will play Lauren, who comes home to her flat in London and is greeted by her husband, Michael. “There's only one problem — she's never seen him before in her life,” the show's description reads. “As Lauren tries to puzzle out how she could be married to someone she can't remember meeting, Michael goes to the attic to change a lightbulb and abruptly disappears. In his place, a new husband emerges. Realizing that her attic is creating an infinite supply of husbands, Lauren confronts the question: If swapping lives is as easy as changing a lightbulb, how do you know you've taken the right path? When do you stop trying to do better and start actually living?”

	Miriam Battye (Succession, Prime Video's Dead Ringers) will be the lead writer on The Husbands, which will run for eight episodes. Battye executive produces with lead director Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) and Annie Marter of Fortunate Jack Productions, Gramazio and A24.


	Temple earned three Emmy nominations for her work on Ted Lasso and a fourth for her lead role in the most recent season of Fargo on FX. Her credits also include Venom: The Last Dance, The Offer and Dirty John.


	Temple is repped by UTA, B-Side Management, Maison 2 and Lichter Grossman. Battye is repped by Independent Talent and UTA. Gillespie and Fortunate Jack Productions are with CAA and Sloane Offer. Gramazio is repped by David Higham Associates, WME and Frankfurt Kurnit.

The New Jersey senator's epic floor session drew many cues from Hollywood, and may teach it a few things too.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	Was it a little like William Wallace's freedom speech in Braveheart?


	Did it contain the drama of Don Larsen working toward that World Series perfect game?




	Or maybe the vibe was more Spalding Gray in Swimming to Cambodia, the monologist as circus master.


	For those steeped in screen entertainment, the analogies came and fast and furious as Cory Booker took the Senate floor Monday night and Tuesday. Fortunately, he gave us a lot of time to come up with them.

					Long Before Cory Booker, Patton Oswalt Delivered an Epic Star Wars Filibuster on 'Parks and Recreation'		
			









	You may not have watched anything but the last hour, or few minutes, or even a second of the Democratic senator's 25-hour, one-sitting (or standing) opus on YouTube or C-SPAN. Trust me then when I tell you the whole thing was the kind of spectacle that should be eligible for an Emmy, so subtle were its layers and so ambitious the performance.

	











	On its face, Booker's speech building an elaborate case against the policies of Donald Trump and Elon Musk was pure political theater — if theater involved a prize for never relying on a chair, food or the bathroom. As he broke Strom Thurmond's 24-hour, 18-minute mark for longest Senate-floor speech in history, the New Jersey lawmaker spoke from giant loose-leaf binders of facts and read anecdotes off index cards; he thanked the Parliamentarian and gave at least his vocal cords a break by deferring to extended questions (that were more of a comment) from other senators. Booker balanced rousing constitutional ideals with basic economic litmus tests, reappropriating Ronald Reagan's famous 1980 debate line of, “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?” as (fittingly for these lightning times), “Are you better off now than you were 71 days ago?”


	But what Booker was doing was nothing less than creating a cinematic spectacle, a binge-worthy awards contender in which all 25 hours happened to drop at once. And while the consequences are deadly serious, the techniques came from some of our most popular entertainment. Focus on different through lines of Booker's performance and you'd experience different arcs; come in at different moments and you'd infer different genres.


	For stretches, the speech had a kind of relaxed podcast vibe, as Booker kidded with other senators or even did quasi-comedy bits (his re-enactment of Elon Musk trying to describe to Joe Rogan why Social Security was a Ponzi scheme, complete with Muskian verbal tics, was especially Laugh Factory-ish.)

	











	He created a series of supporting characters, including his offscreen mother, the Las Vegas-dwelling standby who had a surrogate here in Jacky Rosen, the Nevada senator.


	Like all good heroes, Booker had a catch phrase. “I yield for a question while retaining the floor,” he said, over and over again, each time causing viewers to clench up just a little; should he mix up the words and yield the floor, the game would be up. 


	At times the speech had an air of televangelism, with Booker's booming oration about the “moral moment” or, more literally, when he tossed to Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a Yale Divinity School graduate who proceeded to cite Isaiah and talk about the Bible's attitude toward the poor. When it wasn't God-heavy, the speech had the vibe of secular religion and its High Priest John Lewis, whose story of Civil Rights-era martyrdom and tagline of “good trouble” became a leitmotif for Booker.


	Research was doubtless important — with so many substantive facts and policies on everything from Social Security-office closures to changes in veterans benefits to the details of the Federalist Papers, this was a feat as much of preparation as anything else. Sam Rockwell has his acting coach; Cory Booker has his Hill staffers. But for all the planning, Booker also had to make it look like he wasn't straining. “An actor has to burn inside with an outer ease,” the performance guru Michael Chekhov once said, and the senator seemed to embody that, joking about the length of time he was up there, how much he generally loved the mic and how he wanted not to gaffe his way into giving up the floor, making fun of himself in a way that put us on his side. Far from someone trying to convince us he could break the record, Booker was right there with us sharing our doubts.

	











	The whole will-he-get-there narrative kept recalling to me the 1990s cult documentary Hands on a Hardbody, in which a series of humble strivers try to win a truck by simply outlasting their competitors in keeping their hands on a Nissan. Only this time, the prize was historical supremacy, a turn Booker was happy to lean into. Thurmond made his record-setting speech in 1957 breathing segregationist fury railing against the Civil Rights Act, and Booker reminded us just often enough that Thurmond could now be upstaged by a man with the kind of background he dedicated his career to keeping down.


	Perhaps the secret ingredient — the unknown spice in the must-see TV casserole — is how Booker let us in on the social workings of the Senate, making it seem like just a few friends who were not that different from your own workplace buddies.  Booker would pepper his speech with references to the times he and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy texted; he referenced Ted Cruz's mid-speech kibbitz about pulling a fire alarm; he even, upon getting a request from Chuck Schumer to ask a question, smiled wanly and said it's the only time he'll ever tell him no, like the boss you push back on but still secretly worry about.


	In this regard, Booker may owe his biggest debt to The Kardashians, The Simple Life and other proto-celebrity reality shows, dangling the forbidden glamor only to take us behind the curtain to show how the people there jive like everyone else. Even when Booker said he had a story about another senator but wasn't going to tell it now — a line he used several times — it drew us nearer, like the uncle who says he'll finally tell us the secret if we can just wait till Thanksgiving. 

	











	As the speech went on the audience grew, Booker's YouTube audience going from just 10,000 people Monday night to several times that Tuesday morning as people woke up and realized he was still going. By the time Booker neared the record Tuesday evening, the channel's viewers had swelled to 140,000. (Millions more would watch him on television and in clips on X and Instagram.) What they saw was grand speechmaking that recalled Mr. Smith Goes Washington. And while no one would confuse Booker with a political acolyte, his Jersey accent and references to his college football days instantly undercut any talk about Democratic elites. 


	In fact, Frank Capra's presence hovered in multiple ways. At the very moments Booker was returning to his villainous “the world's most powerful man and the world's richest man,” Elon Musk was seen on various news channels presenting cartoon-sized checks to buy votes in Wisconsin, casting in this It's a Wonderful Filibuster film a ready-made Henry Potter character.


	Booker also understood what Oscar contenders have grasped, from Robert De Niro in Raging Bull to the climbers in Free Solo — audiences love physical commitment. Whether gaining weight for a role or clinging to the side of a mountain with your fingertips, if you show that you've defied some odds of the natural world, you'll immediately endear yourself to a crowd. “I am going to go for as long as I am physically able to go,” Booker said in a social video post Monday before heading out to the floor, a double-barreled statement that suggested both his commitment to the part and his uncertainty of whether he could play it.

	











	That gave the proceeding a level of drama no congressional speech has the right to have, the record both there and not there during the entire run, like the announcers never mentioning a no-hitter even as the linescore shows zeros. As the Bluesky influencer Ben Collins noted, “MSNBC and CNN should be airing this Cory Booker thing in the same way you take over programming if there's a no-hitter or a basketball player with 60 points in three quarters.” MSNBC, at least, eventually did, letting host Ari Melber lead his show with the performance as a clock kept score in the corner.


	The length also pulled meaningfully against our viral-clip era. The speech might have aired on YouTube and TikTok, but it played against their ethos, almost delighting its audience, Brutalist-style, with its longform counterprogramming. Not for nothing did cheering comments flash dizzyingly through the YouTube live-chat or did 400 million (!) like the speech on TikTok.


	Implicit in the endurance feat was also the man Booker was speaking against, who prides himself on treating podiums like ultramarathons. Just a few weeks ago, Trump set a record for longest address to a joint session of Congress with a 100-minute oration — or as Booker calls it, a quick digression. Next to Booker, Joe Rogan seems like a newsflash.


	And of course came the real own, one that right-wing media is unlikely to cop to but that practically vibrated from left-wing quarters: Booker was mastering the medium that gave Trump the presidency in the first place.

	











	None of this should surprise those who've been paying attention to Booker. The senator is hardly a stranger to screen drama, having dated Rosario Dawson for four years ending in 2022; surely Ahsoka Tano taught Grogu a few tricks. And let's not forget that Booker came to national prominence on film, as the charismatic and at times controversial star of Street Fight, Marshall Curry's documentary about the bid by Booker, then a Newark city councilman, to win the city's mayoralty that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival 20 years ago this month. He is both aware, and the beneficiary, of powerful cinematic images.


	In a time when addictive-watching is down, Booker reminded us — and maybe reminded streamers and studios too — of the reasons we liked it in the first place: the unknown finale, the lovable side characters, the sense that we are part of something that matters.


	And in a time when liberal morale is down, Booker was there to pick it up. What the Democrats do from here is the obvious next question, as pundits tried to quantify what this brief momentum-burst meant. “A cool glass of water in the desert,” MSNBC pundit and former Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said after the speech ended. To judge by the live-chat comments, many Democrats felt a sense of pride and hope that has been sparse since the election, and talk quickly turned to a series of rallies planned for this weekend, a Democratic win in that Wisconsin Supreme Court race and other mobilizations.

	











	The size of the speech's halo, of course, can't be predicted. But any actor will tell you the hardest thing is first getting a distracted audience's attention. Booker did that. Now the weight is on the rest of the cast to finish the story.

South Park will finally return for its 27th season on Wednesday, July 9, on Comedy Central.


	What craziness will be parodied in season 27? Well, the teaser includes the line, “I'm just gonna do some ketamine and fuck around with the government a little,” so, that sort of thing.




	The hit animated franchise has been away for a while. The show's 26th season premiered more than two years ago, in February 2023. There was a TV special, South Park: The End of Obesity, in 2024, and a 2023 TV movie South Park: Joining the Panderverse. In 2021, TV movie South Park: Post COVID premiered.

South Park premiered on Comedy Central on Aug. 13, 1997, following a viral animated short, “The Spirit of Christmas,” introducing us to Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny. South Park was created by executive producers Trey Parker and Matt Stone; Anne Garefino and Frank C. Agnone II also executive produce. Eric Stough, Adrien Beard, Bruce Howell and Vernon Chatman are producers. Christopher Brion is the creative director of South Park Digital Studios.


	Watch the season 27 teaser below.


	The teaser itself opens on some live-action images: empty park swings and an airplane wing. And then it gets animated: Randy asks his daughter if she's been taking ketamine, “because I think it could really help you.”


	From there, homes burn, the Statue of Liberty is yanked down, airplanes crash and Diddy joins the boys on some sort of a mission that you probably don't want to know too much about.

The company behind the box office phenomenon ‘Sound of Freedom' confirmed during its CinemaCon presentation that it has set a release date for Aug. 6 for ‘Sketch,' which debuted to raves at TIFF. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Angel Studios has drawn up a deal for Seth Worley's Sketch. 


	The company behind the box office phenomenon Sound of Freedom confirmed during its CinemaCon presentation at Caesars Palace on Wednesday morning that it has acquired the film for distribution and set a release date for Aug. 6. Wonder Project and UTA's Independent Film Group negotiated the deal.




	Written and directed by Worley, Sketch stars Tony Hale, D'Arcy Carden, Bianca Belle and Kue Lawrence in the story of a single dad who is swept up in an insane adventure when his daughter's comically dark drawings come to life and terrorize their small town. Hale also produced with Steve Taylor and Dusty Brown.

Sketch debuted at last September's Toronto International Film Festival to critical raves. “If you were to take the wide-eyed wonder of a Steven Spielberg, the impish mischief of a Joe Dante, plus the vibrant visuals of prime Pixar and somehow blitz them together in a Magic Bullet blender, the resulting concoction might well resemble Sketch, an audaciously gonzo first feature by Seth Worley,” wrote The Hollywood Reporter's film critic Michael Rechtshaffen, who praised it as “dazzlingly inventive.”


	Worley, who has a long list of short films to his credit, released a director's statement about the film, revealing that Sketch is a passion project that took seven years to make. “I've made a movie that is 100 percent me, and I still can't figure out how to describe it to people,” he wrote. “Executives, producers, and financiers would read this movie and either interpret it as The Babadook if it were ‘inappropriately funny and warm' or ‘Goosebumps if it were too good and weirdly dark.' But to me, it's Inside Out meets Jurassic Park. It challenges stigmas surrounding grief and explores childhood emotions, the darker places they can go, and how we live our lives in the wake of trauma.”


	He continued: “This movie is my childhood. This movie is my kids. If I only get to make one movie in my life, this is the one. It's weird, it's thrilling, it's funny, it's deeply emotional, and hopefully, I've put enough of myself into it for you to find yourself in it, too.”


	CinemaCon, the annual gathering of cinema owners and Hollywood studios, is hosted in Las Vegas by the newly rebranded Cinema United, which for decades was known as the National Association of Theatre Owners. This year's edition runs from March 31 to April 3.

Current rights holder Rogers Communications has extended its agreement with the major sports league for another dozen years to the 2037-38 season.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	The National Hockey League has renewed its broadcast rights deal for hockey in Canada with Rogers Communications for another 12 years as part of an CAN$11 billion (US$7.7 billion) agreement.


	In 2013, Rogers signed an initial landmark $4.94 billion deal to secure the exclusive English-language rights to TV hockey on all platforms for 12 years. In the latest deal unveiled on Wednesday, Rogers unveiled a second 12-year agreement for the national media rights to NHL games on all platforms in Canada, this time to run to the 2037-38 season. The latest agreement will start in 2026-27 after the current 12-year deal ends.

	“For more than a decade, Rogers has done an incredible job of conveying what NHL hockey, our players and our teams mean to hockey fans and their communities from coast to coast to coast,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement about the agreement that has Rogers continuing to bring live hockey games to Canadians.


	Rogers had an exclusive negotiating period with the NHL ahead of its current deal with the NHL expiring in two years. The extended deal includes all national TV, digital and streaming rights for all regular season games and all playoff Stanley Cup Final games.


	The agreement also covers all special NHL events programming and out-of-market rights for all regional games. As with the first deal, Rogers will be able to sub-license live game rights to offset the steep costs of the NHL agreement.


	A potential partner could be Amazon, which in Oct. 2024 started streaming NHL games in Canada on Prime Video ahead of the current NHL broadcast rights with Rogers expiring in 2026. The new extension deal resembles the current media rights agreement in seeing annual costs to Rogers escalate through to the final year of the contract term.


	The Canadian media rights deal also sees a major American sports league continue to give all national rights in one country to one broadcaster for a prolonged period. With NHL games a big draw in hockey-mad Canada, both for primetime audiences and advertisers, Rogers will continue to drive live hockey games to Sportsnet, its cable and digital sports channel, which competes domestically with TSN, a division of rival Bell Media.


	“The NHL has been a terrific partner for over a decade, and we're proud to continue our partnership and bring more great fan experiences and best-in-class broadcasts to Canadians,” Tony Staffieri, President and CEO at Rogers, said in his own statement.

Los Alegres del Barranco will not be able to tour the U.S. as planned. 


													By
												

	Natalia Cano



	The U.S. State Department has canceled the work and tourist visas of the members of Mexican corrido group Los Alegres del Barranco after they displayed images of the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, also known as “El Mencho,” during a concert on Saturday (March 29) at an auditorium at the University of Guadalajara.

	The news was confirmed on Tuesday (April 1) by Christopher Landau, the Deputy Secretary of State, in a post on X.

I'm a firm believer in freedom of expression, but that doesn't mean that expression should be free of consequences. A Mexican band, “Los Alegres del Barranco,” portrayed images glorifying drug kingpin “El Mencho” — head of the grotesquely violent CJNG cartel — at a recent concert… pic.twitter.com/neSIib7EC4


	“I'm a firm believer in freedom of expression, but that doesn't mean that expression should be free of consequences,” wrote Landau in his post. “A Mexican band, Los Alegres del Barranco, portrayed images glorifying drug kingpin “El Mencho” — head of the grotesquely violent CJNG cartel — at a recent concert in Mexico. I'm pleased to announce that the State Department has revoked the band members' work and tourism visas. In the Trump Administration, we take seriously our responsibility over foreigners' access to our country. The last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists.”

	











	The State Department, through Secretary of State Marco Rubio, announced on Feb. 20 the designation of eight cartels and transnational organizations — including the Jalisco New Generation Cartel — as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT).


	Prior to Landau's announcement, the concert had caused significant controversy and outrage in Mexico, which has long tried to curb the glorification of drug lords in popular Mexican music and narcocorridos. 


	The concert was condemned on Monday (March 31) by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. It prompted the Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office to launch an investigation for “glorification of crime.”

	On Tuesday (April 1), the governor of Jalisco, Pablo Lemus, wrote in a post on X that his government supports the measures adopted by the University of Guadalajara to prevent criminal acts from being glorified at concerts, as occurred over the weekend at the Telmex Auditorium. The local leader said he signed an executive order to ensure that no singer or group with a history of endorsing criminal activity will perform at events linked to his government. 

	











	“Next week, I will introduce an initiative to ensure that, in any legally sanctioned public event, producers and performers are held accountable for what happens during their shows, and no one can wash their hands of responsibility,” Lemus announced.


	Los Alegres del Barranco were scheduled to play shows in several U.S. cities, where the band was announced as part of the lineup for the Bésame Mucho festival April 5 in Austin, Texas. In a TikTok livestream on Tuesday, Pavel Morales, a member of the Sinaloan group, stated that the majority of their audience supports them and referred to their critics as “confused.”

#polemica #paratiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii #losalegresdelbarranco #pavelmoreno 


Billboard Español reached out for comment to the band's reps, but hasn't received a reply by press time.  Meanwhile, authorities from the municipality of Pedro Escobedo, in the Mexican state of Querétaro, confirmed on Tuesday that the group's scheduled performance for April 19 was canceled because “it does not meet the necessary municipal permits for its realization,” the local government said in a statement on Tuesday.


	The projection of the controversial images took place during a concert titled “Los Señores del Corrido” at the Telmex Auditorium, where Los Alegres del Barranco performed the song “El Dueño del Palenque” (The Owner of the Palenque) and displayed on screen photos of the cartel leader, as well as other images created by AI. 


	The images appeared on multiple videos on social media. They include the moments in which fans burst into cheers when the images of the cartel leader were shown, adding to the controversy.


	In a statement, Auditorio Telmex Adistanced itself from the events, arguing that the venue “has no influence on the selection of the repertoire, speeches, or audiovisual material that artists decide to share with their audiences.” However, it acknowledged that the images of the kingpin could be considered an “exultation of crime.”

	











	The controversy over the alleged tribute to the drug trafficker arises after information has surfaced over how the cartel uses clandestine ranches to recruit people through deceptive job offers, according to federal authorities and media reports. This followed the recent discovery of Izaguirre Ranch in early March in the municipality of Teuchitlán, where acts of torture and murder were allegedly committed, according to the Guerreros Buscadores collective.

The Weeknd has sent at least one song to the Hot 100's tier each year since 2014. Plus, who has the record on the Billboard 200 albums chart?


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Submit questions about Billboard charts, as well as general music musings, to askbb@billboard.com. Please include your first and last name, as well as your city, state and country, if outside the United States.


Or, reach out on Bluesky.


Let's open the latest mailbag.


	Hi Gary,


	Remember when you, myself and another Billboard reader went over music acts with the longest streaks of gaining a new Billboard Hot 100 top 10 year after year? We had come to the consensus that, with 12 years apiece, Mariah Carey (1990-2001) and Prince (1983-94) were the two front-runners in that club. Well, now we have a third.

	











	Thanks to his “Rather Lie,” with Playboi Carti, which debuted on the March 29 chart, The Weeknd has now put a new song in the Hot 100's top 10 for a 12th consecutive year.


	Here's a rundown of all of his top 10s, in chronological order of their peaks:


	Who else to tie such a historic streak than The Weeknd, right? Someone who happens to be: A, one of my favorite popular music acts of all time, and B, known for citing Prince as an influence.


	Regards,

	











	Jake RiveraMashpee, Mass.


	Hi Jake,


	Thanks for pointing out the update, and congrats to The Weeknd on his record-tying streak of Hot 100 top 10s in 12 consecutive years (or more than 600 weekends).


	Notably, another act has joined the mix for potentially matching the mark: Drake is now up to an active streak of 11 years in a row with new Hot 100 top 10s, from 2015 (“Hotline Bling”) through 2025 (“Gimme a Hug” and “Nokia”). He could, thus, tie the record next year — or The Weeknd could claim the honor all to himself with at least one new top 10 in 2026.


	Meanwhile, what about the same feat on the Billboard 200 albums chart? On first thought, a lengthy streak of annual new top 10s might seem less likely there, as, compared to singles, acts for the most part don't release as many as albums, and somewhat rarely every year historically.


	Let's count down the artists, from The Beatles to Taylor Swift, Drake and more, with the most consecutive years of sending at least one new album to the Billboard 200's top 10 (dating to Aug. 17, 1963, when the chart began combining mono and stereo releases into one ranking). The act atop the list might seem surprising, although perhaps less so once looking into why.


	Seven consecutive years with new Billboard 200 top 10s:


	Eight consecutive years:


	Nine consecutive years:


	And, the act with the longest such streak overall …


	12 consecutive years (the same as the Hot 100 record):


	The leading group – of rotating members – tallied all 24 of its Billboard 200 top 10s from Kidz Bop 7 through Kidz Bop 32. (In that run, only Kidz Bop 17 and Kidz Bop 30 missed the tier, both reaching No. 12; meanwhile, the collective has hit a No. 2 best with five releases.)


	The act scored its record run of consistency in the Billboard 200's top 10 thanks to its steady stream of all-ages covers of big pop hits. Kidz Bop Kids additionally earned 101 entries, including 42 top 10s, on the Kid Digital Song Sales chart, both bests in the list's history. Four reached No. 1, led by their family-friendlier take on Meghan Trainor's former Hot 100 No. 1 “All About That Bass,” which led for six weeks in 2015.


	In 2014, Victor Zaraya, then an executive for the ensemble, mused about its win-win nature. “It's favorable to have your song being sung,” he said. “Maybe a kid heard the Kidz Bop cover of an artist's song before they heard the actual version. Will they remember it as a Kidz Bop song? Maybe. Will they remember it with the original artist? Maybe. But it's only furthering that artist's song.”

	











	Beyond remakes of familiar songs, Zaraya noted that the act's singers contributed to the enduring appeal of Kidz Bop, which in 2025 celebrates its 25th year, including with tour dates. To date, the troupe has sold 18.7 million albums and drawn 8.1 billion official streams for its songs in the U.S., according to Luminate.


	“We want to let kids know that [the Kidz Bop Kids] are real — they sing, dance and perform,” Zaraya said. “They can be brand ambassadors for us. They have personalities. They are stars.”

	DePugh and Springsteen grew up together in Freehold, N.J., and played baseball in the same youth league. Their now-legendary chance encounter at a bar in 1973 served as the real-life basis for one of the most iconic verses on Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A. album.

	











	DePugh later confirmed the moment in interviews, recalling how the two reconnected outside the Headliner in Neptune, then spent hours catching up inside.


	“Whenever we're together, it's the same dynamic: I'm the star and he's the guy at the end of the bench,' said DePugh to the Palm Beach Post in 2011. “That's who he has always been to me, my right fielder.”


	” … Once I saw Bruce we went back in and closed the place. He had a little entourage with him. They all sat in a booth, but it was just me and him at the bar. All of a sudden, it's 1:30 (a.m.) and they started blinking the lights.”


	“Glory Days”  reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1985, and DePugh told the Palm Beach Post that he was “tickled pink I would even get into the song.”


	“When I first heard the song, I thought the song said ‘and all we kept talking about was glory days,' “ said DePugh. “And years later, I finally saw the lyrics and saw ‘all he kept talking about was glory days.' And I thought, ‘Huh, (he) took a little shot at me!'


	DePugh and Springsteen remained friends throughout their lives, occasionally crossing paths in Palm Beach County, where Springsteen owns a home and DePugh lived in Lake Worth.


	DePugh died after a battle with cancer. He is remembered fondly by friends, including longtime Freehold teacher and coach Rich Kane, who said: “All he wanted to do was raise his brothers, play baseball, play basketball and just hang in Freehold Borough. This one hurt. Joe and I were very close.”

	Fresh off the back of his early exit from Saturday Night Live over the weekend, Morgan Wallen has launched a new line of “Get Me to God's Country” merchandise.

	Launched on Tuesday (April 1), the new merch options are rather simple, consisting of a white shirt and a hat, with the latter available in two different color variants. All the items feature the same design, however, with the Coors logo worked into a design which bears the words “Get Me to God's Country.”

	Despite the timing of the merch drop, the Club Wallen Instagram account has assured fans it's not part of an April Fools' Day joke.

	











	The nascent run of merch comes just days after the phrase rose to prominence following Wallen's early walk-off from Saturday Night Live. After performing a pair of songs from his forthcoming album, I'm the Problem, Wallen briefly joined the SNL cast at the end of the show, as is customary on the long-running sketch comedy series. He then whispered something into host Mikey Madison's ear, gave her a hug and abruptly walked off the stage at Studio 8H.


	Shortly after the incident, Wallen shared a photo on his Instagram Stories from his private plane, with the caption “Get me to God's country” written over an image of the runway.


	Given the somewhat mysterious nature of the phrase and the swift launch of the merchandise line, it's currently unclear whether the slogan is part of Wallen's new album, or something else entirely. The forthcoming record,  I'm the Problem, is scheduled to be released on May 16 and features a total of 37 tracks, though only a handful of their titles have been released to date.


	In an interview with Entertainment Weekly following Wallen's walk-off, longtime cast member Kenan Thompson said the incident was “definitely a spike in the norm.”


	“We're so used to everybody just turning around and high-fiving us, everybody's saying, ‘Good job, good job, good job.' So when there's a departure from that, it's like, hmm, I wonder what that's about?” Thompson added, noting that Prince had previously done the same thing during his appearance on the show.


	“I'm not saying Morgan Wallen is Prince, but we weren't surprised because Prince was notoriously kind of standoffish. It's just how he was. So we just thought like, ‘Okay, now he's gone back into fantasyland.'”

	











	Wallen is yet to publicly comment on the incident or provide information as to the meaning behind the phrase.

It's the fourth leader for Gomez and first for blanco. The set sold 71,000 copies in the U.S. in the week ending March 27, according to Luminate. It's the best sales week for Gomez since 2015 and blanco's best sales week ever.

	Of the 71,000 sold, vinyl purchases comprise 21,000 – the biggest week on vinyl for either artist. The title – the first album pairing from the real-life couple – also enters at No. 1 on the Vinyl Albums chart.

	











	In total, I Said I Love You First is Gomez's eighth top 10 on Top Album Sales, and the first for blanco.


	Also debuting in the top 10 on the latest Top Album Sales chart: Japanese Breakfast's For Melancholy Brunettes (& Sad Women) and My Morning Jacket's is.


Billboard's Top Album Sales chart ranks the top-selling albums of the week based only on traditional album sales. The chart's history dates back to May 25, 1991, the first week Billboard began tabulating charts with electronically monitored piece count information from SoundScan, now Luminate. Pure album sales were the sole measurement utilized by the Billboard 200 albums chart through the list dated Dec. 6, 2014, after which that chart switched to a methodology that blends album sales with track equivalent album (TEA) units and streaming equivalent album (SEA) units.


	Of the 71,000 copies sold of I Said I Love You First, physical sales comprise 38,000 (21,000 on vinyl and 17,000 on CD) and digital download sales comprise 33,000.


	The opening-week sales of I Said I Love You First were bolstered by its availability across seven vinyl variants (different color editions, some with alternate covers; including a signed version), three CD versions (a standard CD, a signed edition, and a zine/CD version with expanded packaging), a deluxe box set containing branded merch and a CD, and 10 different digital download iterations.


	Of the download editions, firstly, there was a widely available standard set at digital retail. Then, through the album's opening week, nine additional download variants were issued, all initially exclusively available through Gomez's webstore, and each sold for $5. All of the variants included the standard album's 14 songs, plus bonus material. Five of the variants each had one bonus track (“Stained,” “Talk,” “That's What I'll Care [Seven Heavens Version],” “Scared of Loving You [Live From Vevo]” and “How Does It Feel To Be Forgotten [Live From Vevo],” respectively) and one contained two bonus cuts (an acoustic version and extended version of the album single “Call Me When You Break Up”). There was also an Explained: Narrated by Selena Gomez edition (with 14 bonus tracks with Gomez providing commentary on each of the set's 14 songs), a Slowed & Reverbed edition (with 14 bonus slowed and reverbed versions of the album's songs) and an Instrumentals edition (with 14 bonus instrumental versions of the tracklist).

	











	All nine of the variants became available in the iTunes Store on Wednesday (March 26). The variants were only sold in the iTunes Store through March 27, the final day they were also sold in Gomez's store.


	Lady Gaga's chart-topping MAYHEM is a non-mover at No. 2 on Top Album Sales with a little over 13,000 sold (down 44%).


	Japanese Breakfast lands its best sales week ever and highest charting title on Top Album Sales as For Melancholy Brunettes (& Sad Women) debuts at No. 3 with 13,000 sold. (It's the second top 10 for the act.) The album's sales were aided by its availability across eight vinyl variants (including a signed version), along with a standard download, CD and cassette edition. Vinyl sales tallied up to just over 10,000 – the act's best week on vinyl, and it yields at No. 2 debut on the Vinyl Albums chart.


	Kendrick Lamar's former No. 1 GNX is steady at No. 4 on Top Album Sales (a little more than 11,000; down 9%) while The Weeknd's chart-topping Hurry Up Tomorrow jumps 15-5 (11,000; up 92% following the release of a deluxe CD boxed set edition of the album sold in the artist's webstore).


	My Morning Jacket's latest studio album, titled is, debuts at No. 6 on Top Album Sales with nearly 10,000 sold – with 7,000 of that sum on vinyl. It's the fifth top 10-charting effort for the act. It also launches at No. 4 on the Vinyl Albums chart. The set was available across five vinyl variants, along with a standard CD and download edition.


	Rounding out the rest of the top 10 on Top Album Sales: Sabrina Carpenter's former leader Short n' Sweet slips 6-7 (nearly 10,000; down 5%), LE SSERAFIM's HOT falls 1-8 in its second week (8,000; down 80%), Playboi Carti's MUSIC drops 3-9 (just over 7,000; down 51%) and Chappell Roan's chart-topping The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess dips 9-10 (7,000; down 13%).

""If the fact that I think Donald Trump is the worst president in the history of our great country could stop me from coming back, what does that say for Freedom?"" Young asked.

	Veteran Canadian rocker Neil Young has shared his fears over a potential ban from the U.S. that may await him upon his return from Europe.


	The musician – who is a dual citizen of Canada and the U.S. – has not been shy in regard to his criticism of President Donald Trump in the past. Previously, Young has gone so far as to call Trump “a disgrace to my country,” and most recently, claim that “the US has lost its standing” on the world stage under the President's leadership.


	However, with an upcoming European tour set to be followed by a run of dates in the U.S., Young has taken to his Archives website to ruminate on the notion that he too may be barred from entering the country for sharing his critical thoughts on Trump.

	“When I go to play music in Europe, if I talk about Donald J. Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminum blanket,” Young wrote on Tuesday (April 1). “If I come back from Europe and am barred, can't play my USA tour, all of the folks who bought tickets will not be able to come to a concert by me.


	“If the fact that I think Donald Trump is the worst president in the history of our great country could stop me from coming back, what does that say for Freedom? I love America and its people and its music and its culture.”


	As Young continued, he reflected on the constitutional right to freedom of speech within the country, likely referring to recent news stories such as the arrest and orders to deport Syrian-born permanent resident and pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil.


	“By these latest actions of our US government, it seems that those who speak out freely with their own opinions are now vulnerable to a non-existent Trump law,” Young wrote. “Then it seems to me that if you voted for Kamala Harris over Trump, that makes it possible for you to go to jail or be detained, punished in some way for not showing allegiance to what? How spineless is that? Trump is not be able to stand up to anyone who does not agree with his ideas?


	“Remember, all months have 30 days,” he concluded. “One country, indivisible, with Liberty and Freedom for all. Remember that? I do.”


	Young is currently scheduled to launch his forthcoming tour with the Chrome Hearts in Rättvik, Sweden on June 18, with North American dates set to begin in Charlotte, NC on Aug. 8. The rocker's previously-announced plans for a free concert in Ukraine to launch the tour were recently cancelled, with Young citing safety concerns as the reason for the decision.

The Boygenius star also posted that the pop star's praise has her ""shaking.""

	Hannah Dailey



Lucy Dacus just had a magical moment as a Lady Gaga fan. After the Boygenius star covered the pop icon's Mayhem single “Abracadabra” on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge, Gaga left Dacus stunned by showering the rendition with praise on TikTok.


	Commenting on a video of the “Ankles” singer's performance on Wednesday (April 2), Mother Monster wrote, “I LOVE this so much,” adding a crying emoji. “wow,” she added. “captures the purity of the song.”


	On X shortly afterward, Dacus posted a screenshot of Gaga's message and simply wrote, “I'm shaking.”

	











	BBC first shared the cover the day prior. In the video, Dacus substituted the intense, flashy pop of “Abracadabra” with soft vocals, mellow piano and finger-picked acoustic guitar, bringing out an entirely different side of the track. “With a haunting dance, now you're both in a trance/ It's time to cast your spell on the night/ Abracadabra/ Amor oo na na/ Abra ca da bra,” Dacus sang pensively during the performance.


	Gaga dropped “Abracadabra” in February ahead of Mayhem, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 last month. So far, the single has peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100.


	Dacus also shared a new LP in March: Forever Is a Feeling, her first album since Boygenius' Grammy-winning The Record and the Virginia native's own Home Video album from 2021. In a recent interview with Billboard about the project, Dacus — who recently confirmed her romance with Boygenius bandmate Julien Baker — opened up about writing specificity into the love songs on her new record.


	“Once you focus on one thing and one person, it actually recontextualizes everything else,” she said. “And you realize that every detail is its own universe.”

The Hives are returning with ""a new record so full of energy, joy, anger and life that you will be questioning reality as you have known it.""


													By
												

	Tyler Jenke



	Incendiary Swedish rockers The Hives are readying themselves for a big year, with a new album announced alongside a global run of tour dates.


	The veteran quintet – who celebrated their 30th anniversary in 2023 – shared the news of their seventh album in a press release on Tuesday (April 1), with the announcement taking the form of an open letter formally addressed to “whom it may concern,” but clarified to mean “everyone.”


	“This message is to inform you that International Rock Sensation The Hives, the best live band on the planet and still your new favourite band, lauded on all continents for their masterful skill and reckless abandon in the rock music field, have once again, sooner than you expected, created a new body of work the likes of which have never been heard or indeed probably will again,” the message began.

	“A new record so full of energy, joy, anger and life that you will be questioning reality as you have known it,” it continued. “They finally did it. Every single song a single, every single single a hit, every hit a direct hit in the face of the man.”

	











	The record in question is titled The Hives Forever Forever The Hives and will be released via Play It Again Sam on Aug. 29. According to the press release, the 13-track album was “crafted with commitment, abandon and skill in Sweden in cohorts with the esteemed producers Pelle Gunnerfeldt and Mike D of Beastie Boys.”


	The group have also unveiled “Enough Is Enough” as the album's lead single, with a video directed by filmmaker Eik Kockum capturing the group in Bucharest, Romania.


	“Who in their right mind would start a song like this? No one but The Hives,” the group explained. “They are here again sooner than you expected and they have had enough of everyone at this point. Hence the title. Dig? Dig.”


	The Hives will celebrate the release of their forthcoming album with a world tour which launches in Australia in July, before visiting North America, Europe, and the U.K. throughout the rest of the year.


The Hives Forever Forever The Hives arrives as the band's seventh album, and follows on from the release of 2023's The Death of Randy Fitzsimmons – ending an eleven-year gap between releases for the band. 


	The group initially formed in 1993, though largely avoided widespread recognition until the release of the 2001 compilation Your New Favourite Band. The compilation resulted in the re-release of their single “Hate to Say I Told You So,” which peaked at No. 86 on the Hot 100, and saw their following album – 2004's Tyrannosaurus Hives – reach a career high of No. 33 on the Billboard 200.

The rapper joined Cabello on her single ""He Knows"" last summer.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Lil Nas X feels lucky to have Camila Cabello in his friend orbit. The rapper who has been sprinkling singles all over the place in the lead-up to the release of his as-yet-unscheduled Dreamboy album, told Paper magazine that the “I Luv It” singer was really there for him when he was having a crisis of faith in his personal and professional lives.


	“We did a great job at uplifting each other and showing each other how we view the situation and how we view each other from outside of ourselves,” he said of his bestie, who he teamed up with last summer for her “He Knows” single. “Once you made up your mind: ‘Oh, the world doesn't see me as something great or feels like I've done anything amazing.‘ To hear [affirmation] from somebody who you greatly respect and you love what they've done, it feels great, especially because you can feel like it comes from a genuine place, and not like someone trying to get something from you.”

	











	Lil Nas said he had fun hanging out with Cabello at a time when he was just getting comfortable “going out places. It was just genuine fun. It didn't feel like work. Camila made me feel so good, she made me feel so great,” he said. “And that was the beginning of me getting my confidence back. To finally be at this place, where I'm like, ‘Okay, I know who the f–k I am. I know where I'm going. I don't care what none of these b–ches say. I didn't care at first. Why do I care now?'”


	The rapper also said he's taking a completely different approach on the new album than he did with his 2021 full-length debut album, Montero. Whereas last time he said he brought the world to him, this time “I'm bringing myself to the world,” describing Dreamboy as a collection of “everything and anything I've ever loved or hated… it's just me going out there and doing me in whichever form I feel.”


	So far, Lil Nas has released eight songs that could be featured on the album, including “Hotbox,” “Light Again,” “Need Dat Boy,” “Dreamboy,” “Big Dummy!,” “Swish,” “Right There!” and “Lean on My Body,” which he recently collected on the Days Before Dreamboy EP.

Just wow!': Scientists rejoice as NASA's SPHEREx telescope reveals debut images","https://www.livescience.com/space/space-exploration/nasas-spherex-telescope-opens-its-eyes-on-the-universe-taking-stunning-debut-image-of-100-000-galaxies-and-stars","Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:51:33 GMT","

SPHEREx's first images — containing roughly 100,000 points of light stars, galaxies and nebulae — have confirmed that the telescope is working according to its design.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A new NASA space telescope has turned on its detectors for the first time, capturing its first light in images that contain tens of thousands of galaxies and stars.

The Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) arrived in orbit atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on March 11.

The six released images, collected by the space telescope on March 27, were each snapped by three different detectors. The top three images span the telescope's complete field of view, and are captured again in the bottom three which are colored differently to represent varying ranges of infrared wavelengths.

Within each image's full field of view — an area roughly 20 times wider than the full moon — roughly 100,000 light sources from stars, galaxies, and nebulas can be glimpsed.

""Our spacecraft has opened its eyes on the universe,"" Olivier Doré, a SPHEREx project scientist at Caltech and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a statement. ""It's performing just as it was designed to.""

Costing a total of $488 million to build and launch, the new telescope has been in development for roughly a decade, and is set to map the universe by observing both optical and infrared light. It will orbit Earth 14.5 times a day, completing 11,000 orbits during its lifetime to filter infrared light from distant gas and dust clouds using a technique called spectroscopy.

Once it is fully online in April, SPHEREX will scan the entire night sky a total of four times using 102 separate infrared color sensors, enabling it to collect data from more than 450 million galaxies during its planned two-year operation. This amounts to roughly 600 exposures a day, according to NASA.

This dataset will give scientists key insights into some of the biggest questions in cosmology, enabling astronomers to study galaxies at various stages in their evolution; trace the ice floating in empty space to see how life may have begun; and even understand the period of rapid inflation the universe underwent immediately after the Big Bang.

SPHEREx's wide panorama view makes it the perfect complement for the James Webb Space Telescope, flagging regions of interest for the latter to study with greater depth and resolution.

After lofting it to space, NASA scientists and engineers have performed a nail-biting series of checks on the new telescope. This includes ensuring that its sensitive infrared equipment is cooling down to its final temperature of around minus 350 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 210 degrees Celsius) and that the telescope is set to the right focus — something that cannot be adjusted in space.

Based on these stunning preliminary images, it appears that everything has worked out.

""This is the high point of spacecraft checkout; it's the thing we wait for,"" Beth Fabinsky, SPHEREx deputy project manager at JPL, said in the statement. ""There's still work to do, but this is the big payoff. And wow! Just wow!""

Scientists just showcased a humanoid robot performing a complicated side flip.

The company that makes the robot, Unitree, posted a video to Youtube showcasing its acrobatics. In the video, the silver-grey G1 crouches slightly, then launches up before rotating sideways through the air.

The robot catches itself primarily with its left leg and stabilizes almost immediately as the other foot makes contact with the floor. As impressive as it is at full speed, it's even more mesmerizing in slow motion, particularly the ease with which the robot seems to balance and right itself after landing.

Last year, the same model mastered a backflip. To teach G1 its new trick, the company mainly upgraded the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm it used to make the software faster and more responsive, Unitree representatives told Live Science.

""The side flip was performed under reinforcement learning training,"" they added.

The G1 can do more than acrobatics; during a martial arts demonstration, it disarmed a baton-wielding opponent. After a series of feints with its hands, the bot executed a spinning kick that sent the baton flying from its opponent's hands.

Like its human counterparts, the robot's lightweight, compact form helps it perform acrobatic moves with ease.

The G1 stands at just over 4.3 feet (1.3 meters) in height and weighs only 77 pounds (35 pounds) G1 also sports a 3D light detecting and ranging (LIDAR) and depth camera, which gives it a 360-degree view of its environment. Perhaps most importantly, it incorporates 23 degrees of freedom, a measure of the number of joints or axes of movement available to the bot.

The G1 can also walk and run at up to 2 meters per second (4.5 miles per hour or 7.2 kilometers per hour).

The company envisions robots like G1 or its successors doing everything from helping out with chores at home to performing industrial operations to assisting with hazardous rescue missions, the Unitree representative said.

Seismic mapping of North America has revealed that an ancient slab of crust buried beneath the Midwest is causing the crust above it to ""drip"" and suck down rocks from across the continent.

An ancient slab of Earth's crust buried deep beneath the Midwest is sucking huge swatches of present-day's North American crust down into the mantle, researchers say.

The slab's pull has created giant ""drips"" that hang from the underside of the continent down to about 400 miles (640 kilometers) deep inside the mantle, according to a new study. These drips are located beneath an area spanning from Michigan to Nebraska and Alabama, but their presence appears to be impacting the entire continent.

The dripping area looks like a large funnel, with rocks from across North America being pulled toward it horizontally before getting sucked down. As a result, large parts of North America are losing material from the underside of their crust, the researchers said.

""A very broad range is experiencing some thinning,"" study lead author Junlin Hua, a geoscientist who conducted the research during a postdoctoral fellowship at The University of Texas (UT) at Austin, said in a statement. ""Luckily, we also got the new idea about what drives this thinning,"" said Hua, now a professor at the University of Science and Technology of China.

Related: Earth's crust is peeling away under California

The researchers found that the drips result from the downward dragging force of a chunk of oceanic crust that broke off from an ancient tectonic plate called the Farallon plate.

The Farallon plate and the North American plate once formed a subduction zone along the continent's west coast, with the former sliding beneath the latter and recycling its material into the mantle. The Farallon plate splintered due to the advance of the Pacific plate roughly 20 million years ago, and remnant slabs subducted beneath the North American plate slowly drifted off.

One of these slabs currently straddles the boundary between the mantle transition zone and the lower mantle roughly 410 miles (660 km) beneath the Midwest. Dubbed the ""Farallon slab"" and first imaged in the 1990s, this piece of oceanic crust is responsible for a process known as ""cratonic thinning,"" according to the new study, which was published March 28 in the journal Nature Geoscience.



Cratonic thinning refers to the wearing away of cratons, which are regions of Earth's continental crust and upper mantle that have mostly remained intact for billions of years. Despite their stability, cratons can undergo changes, but this has never been observed in action due to the huge geologic time scales involved, according to the study.

Now, for the first time, researchers have documented cratonic thinning as it occurs. The discovery was possible thanks to a wider project led by Hua to map what lies beneath North America using a high-resolution seismic imaging technique called ""full-waveform inversion."" This technique uses different types of seismic waves to extract all the available information about physical parameters underground.



""This sort of thing is important if we want to understand how a planet has evolved over a long time,"" study co-author Thorsten Becker, a distinguished chair in geophysics at UT Austin, said in the statement. ""Because of the use of this full-waveform method, we have a better representation of that important zone between the deep mantle and the shallower lithosphere [crust and upper mantle].""

—Scientists discover 'sunken worlds' hidden deep within Earth's mantle that shouldn't be there

—Earth's crust may be building mountains by dripping into the mantle

—Gargantuan waves in Earth's mantle may make continents rise, new study finds

To test their results, the researchers simulated the impact of the Farallon slab on the craton above using a computer model. A dripping area formed when the slab was present, but it disappeared when the slab was absent, confirming that — theoretically, at least — a sunken slab can drag rocks across a large area down into Earth's interior.

Dripping beneath the Midwest won't lead to changes at the surface anytime soon, the researchers said, adding that it may even stop as the Farallon slab sinks deeper into the lower mantle and its influence over the craton wanes.

The findings could help researchers piece together the enormous puzzle of how Earth came to look the way it does today. ""It helps us understand how do you make continents, how do you break them, and how do you recycle them,"" Becker said.

Surprising results from hypersonic air flow simulations could help design stronger, faster and more durable supersonic vehicles.

A close look at air flow around high-speed shapes reveals surprising turbulence, according to a new study. The findings, published March 7 in the journal Physical Review Fluids, could inform the design of future high-speed vehicles.

In the study, researchers used three-dimensional simulations to reveal unexpected disturbances around fast-moving cones.

At hypersonic speeds — above Mach 5, or more than 5 times the speed of sound (3,836 mph or 6,174 kilometers per hour) — the flow of air around a vehicle's surface becomes complex and bumpy. Most simulations assume that the flow is symmetrical around the whole cone, but until recently, studies of the transition from streamlined to turbulent were only possible in two dimensions so we couldn't be sure that there weren't any asymmetries in flow around a three-dimensional structure.

The findings could help engineers design stronger, faster vehicles able to withstand the extreme temperatures, pressures and vibrations felt during hypersonic flight.

""Transitioning flows are 3D and unsteady in nature, regardless of the flow geometry,"" study co-author Irmak Taylan Karpuzcu, an aerospace engineer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said in a statement. ""Experiments were conducted in 3D in the early 2000s [but they] didn't provide enough data to determine any 3D effects or unsteadiness because there weren't enough sensors all around the cone-shaped model. It wasn't wrong. It was just all that was possible then.""

Using the Frontera supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, Karpuzcu and aerospace engineer Deborah Levin simulated how air flow around a cone-shaped object — often used as a simplified model for hypersonic vehicles — changes in three dimensions at high speed. They studied both a single cone and a double cone, which helps scientists study how multiple shock waves interact with each other.

""Normally, you would expect the flow around the cone to be concentric ribbons, but we noticed breaks in the flow within shock layers both in the single and double cone shapes,"" Karpuzcu said.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

These breaks were particularly prevalent around the tip of the cone. At high speeds, the shock wave lies closer to the cone, squeezing air molecules into unstable layers and amplifying instabilities in the airflow. The team confirmed their findings by running a program that tracks each simulated air molecule and captures how collisions between the molecules affect air flow.

The disturbances also seem to develop at high speeds. ""As you increase the Mach number, the shock gets closer to the surface and promotes these instabilities. It would be too expensive to run the simulation at every speed, but we did run it at Mach 6 and did not see a break in the flow,"" Karpuzcu said.

The breaks could affect design considerations for hypersonic vehicles, which could be used for shipping, weapons and transportation, Karpuzcu said, as engineers will need to account for the newly observed discontinuities.

Potentially Misleading TitleNASA has taken down the Raw Image of the Tiny Mars Tic-Tac Object (self.UFOs)

submitted 14 hours ago * by tcom2222

UPDATE: 

It has been restored around 12pm est! 

-----------------------------------------------------------

Please first see the original Tiny Mars Tic-Tac Object post, link in OP Comment Post so this doesn't get deleted.

Case Update:

Originally there was a panorama that had been put together and a raw photo of the Mars Tic-Tac Object which could be found at mars. nasa . gov however, the panorama was soon taken down, but it was saved by the person who had originally found the object (link and pic in the OP). That being said there was still the raw image itself of the object at their site. I purposefully took a screenshot of this raw image open in my browser, and included the picture in the OP. I was just notified however that, the raw image is now no longer accessible either. ""403 Forbidden. Access Denied"" If you check out the OP and OP comment post you'll still find the image, the link,  and the metadata. Of note, the raw image of the different timeframe where the object is NOT there IS still available to view (link in OP).

NASA, are you new here? Why not just make an age old comment like, ""hey we see that the public took great interest in this object, we don't know what it is for sure, and likely will not without having more data, sorry, however of course we think its swamp gas/natural phenomenon/just a rock of course..."" why take it down and have that be the latest in updates to this case fueling even more speculation? There should be no reason not to leave these images open for public availability, analysis, and scrutiny, especially if its just a perfectly smooth oddly shaped reflective rock mistaken to be flying in one image and gone in another from a different time, “for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its [NASA's] activities and the results thereof.”

Note* Instead of refraining from making a comment on size since its just estimation, I've added ""tiny"" so this doesn't get tagged as misleading. I've included no pictures so this doesn't get deleted. I've included no links so this doesn't get deleted, and below is the mandated DTG&L of the sighting so this doesn't get deleted. Below is a comment post, that will host the links so this doesn't get deleted.
