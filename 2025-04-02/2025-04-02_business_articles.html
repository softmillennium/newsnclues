                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rachel Reeves: UK will not ‘rush into action’ after Trump’s tariffs speech Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated that the UK is unlikely to respond quickly to President Trump should he impose damaging tariffs on goods coming from Britain. In a hearing at the Treasury Committee on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK would not “rush into action to get a quick headline”. “We won’t do anything to put that in jeopardy.” Trade deal negotiations are also “ongoing”, according to Reeves. “We do not want to see trade barriers go up. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said that the UK is “preparing for all eventualities” ahead of Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ announcements. The European Union has drawn up a “strong plan” to retaliate against Trump’s tariffs, Commission chief Ursual von der Layen said on Tuesday. The Chancellor was also questioned by Liberal Democrat MP Bobby Dean on whether she had left herself enough headroom in “volatile times”. “I think we’ve got the balance about right.” Reeves did not rule out further tax rises in the autumn.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exclusive: Hundred franchises could do own sponsorship deals Teams in the Hundred could soon be allowed to negotiate their own front-of-shirt sponsorship deals, as the England and Wales Cricket Board, counties and prospective investors finalise the sale process. The ECB struck deals to sell 49 per cent stakes in the eight Hundred franchises to a variety of international investors earlier this year in deals that valued the teams at close to £1bn. City AM understands a key concession that could be made involves sponsorship deals. The current arrangement sees KP Snacks’ various brands – including Hula Hoops, McCoy’s and Butterkist – adorning team kits as part of a deal that is reported to run until 2028. But prospective Hundred franchise owners could soon be able to do their own deals, beginning by selling space to sponsors on the sleeves of their shirts and then incorporating the front of shirts when the KP Snacks deal concludes. Some – such as India’s mega-wealthy Ambani family and a consortium of tech executives from Google, Microsoft and Adobe – bought 49 per cent stakes, while the Sun Group and RPSG group, owners of Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants respectively, took majority stakes. Those deals aren’t concluded, however, with negotiations ongoing between host counties and the prospective owners in an exclusivity period. Oval Invincibles will have a Mumbai Indians relationship through the Ambani family, Southern Brave have a connection with Delhi Capitals through GMR Group, Manchester Originals will be in the same family as the Lucknow Super Giants and Northern Supercharges will be entirely owned by Sunrisers Hyderabad’s owners. Those new owners could choose to seek sponsors aimed at the UK and European markets or pivot to Indian brands if, as they hope, the Hundred can build a substantial audience in Asia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After being approved by both the US Senate and Congress and having been signed by its previous president, Joe Biden, the prohibition of the Chinese social network in the North American territory was going to enter into force last January. In fact, there were a few hours when Tiktok was forced to cease his activity. Meanwhile, Trump would have been using the threat of tariffs to China to unblock the sale of Tiktok. The latest novelty in this regard would have arrived from Amazon. As reported by the New York Times, the company that was founded by Jeff Bezos would have made a last minute offer to try to control this popular application. At least, three people familiar with this situation would have corroborated. As indicated by the American media, Tiktok faces a deadline, it would have until Saturday to modify its corporate structure in the United States. And Trump himself would have planned to meet on Wednesday with senior White House officials to discuss the fate of the Chinese social network in his country. Even so, it should be remembered that Amazon is not the only one who has postulated to buy Tiktok. Tags: Amazon, trending, international politics, United States, company, Tiktok</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla and BYD are involved in a struggle to become the world's largest electric car company. BYD has tormented its rival this year so far, with a rising sale and turnover while Tesla is stagnating. Business Insider has converted the most important figures into five well -arranged graphs, so that you can see how the two companies are doing. The Chinese electric automaker byd keeps tsla but torment. Now that BYD and Tesla are fighting each other, these five graphs provide insight into how the two companies relate to each other. Tesla and BYD are engaged in a neck-on-neck sales race of electric cars The snag is that BYD, unlike Tesla, sells both hybrids and electric cars. Tesla will have to fight this year to maintain his status as the world's largest manufacturer of electric cars, because the sale has plummeted worldwide in the first few months of this year. The Chinese Automaker reported an annual turnover of $ 777 billion ($ 107 billion) in 2024, an increase of almost 30 percent compared to the previous year. With that, BYD left the annual turnover of Tesla before 2024, which was 97.7 billion dollars. Tesla surpasses BYD when it comes to a profit The car maker shared the net profit of 2024 last Monday, which rose by 34 percent on an annual basis to just over 40 billion Yuan ($ 5.55 billion). This way the company is still lagging behind Tesla, which in 2024 booked a net profit of $ 7.1 billion. For example, last year Tesla earned 21 percent of its turnover through the energy generation and service companies that own it. The Chinese company, which once started making telephone batteries, says that one fifth of the turnover in 2024 comes from "parts for mobile phones, assemblage service and other products". The shares of BYD, on the other hand, rose in 2025 and reached a record high in March after BYD announced new fast chargers with which an electric car can be charged in five minutes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The global image crisis that the automobile brand is experiencing is due to Elon Musk's behaviors in Donald Trump's rallies or their role as an executor of thousands of layoffs and spending cuts in the federal government, but also because it personifies the war of tariffs is going to launch the US against all countries with which it maintains commercial relations. The president of the US Government, Donald Trump, has confessed to his close environment and cabinet members that Elon Musk will abandon in the "next weeks" as a special advisor to the presidency, according to Politico, at the head of the Doge department to focus on his companies such as Tesla, Spacex and also XAI, the artificial intelligence startup that ends up absorbing X (old twitter) valued at more than 33,000 million dollars. Tesla car sales began to resent at the beginning of the year but their fall has accelerated at the end of March in full image crisis by its founder. Specifically, Tesla deliveries in the first quarter were 336,700 electric vehicles, below the 390,000 forecasts that analysts expected. A roller mountain in the stock market Tesla's price lives a Russian mountain since Musk personally got involved in Trump's candidacy. From the end of October to December, the actions of the automobile group rose from $ 210 to $ 490 per title, that is, the company went from worth less than $ 700,000 million to 1.6 billion dollars in a matter of a month and a half. However, Tesla has bounced again about 30% in two weeks to its current level. According to Nasdaq data until March 15, 3% of Tesla's capital had positioned itself on the value with bass bets valued at more than 20,000 million dollars, more than double at the start of 2025. Upside down, if they decide to undo the investment they have to repurchase the shares, which also causes strong movements in the opposite direction.

McLaren team principal Zak Brown has admitted to cynically using Red Bull’s 2024 investigation of Christian Horner to destabilise their Formula 1 rivals. Horner was accused of sending inappropriate messages to a Red Bull colleague, something he denied and was cleared of by an independent investigation last year. Brown, whose McLaren team are looking to defend their Constructor’s Championship this year, has admitted, however, that he saw an opportunity to cause chaos amid the fall out from Horner’s unwanted publicity. “Our sport, perhaps more than others – though I wouldn’t claim to be an expert on other sports – has a highly competitive and political aspect,” he Kaleidoscope’s TechStuff podcast this week. “The goal is to make ourselves as fast as possible, but there’s also a strategy of destabilising the competition. “You’re constantly fighting for employees, drivers, sponsors, and media attention plays a big role. If you can generate some instability in rival teams – and it doesn’t always work in our favor – it can slow them down while we focus on speeding up.” Max Verstappen won the solo crown for a fourth consecutive year but McLaren’s Lando Norris leads this year’s title charge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the eve of the publication of Tesla deliveries figures, Wall Street had anticipated a discouraging result. Some Wall Street analysts had reduced their sales expectations and trimmed their price objectives for Tesla shares in the midst of several signs of decreased demand, including decreases in global deliveries, ongoing protests against the brand and an increase in second -hand teslas lists. Tesla's shares, which closed with a rise greater than 3.5% on Tuesday, fell around 4% in operations prior to the day after the publication. The value has lost more than a third of its value this year, erasing the profits after the elections that led him to achieve a historical maximum in December. In recent weeks, there have been worrying signs for Tesla sales, since several countries have published a monthly figures separately that show a decrease in deliveries. Other European countries, such as Norway, Denmark, Sweden and France, also registered an interannual decrease in sales in February. Tesla's sales also recently decreased in China and the United States, two key markets for electric cars giant. In March, the car manufacturer sold about 79,000 electric vehicles in China, according to data from the sector published on Wednesday, 11.5% less than last year. As the protests have intensified, Tesla dealers and brand owners have become vandalism objectives, with some incidents related to caused fires and shots directed against buildings and vehicles of Tesla. President Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi have promised to treat attacks on Tesla as domestic terrorism. While some Tesla owners who have suffered negative reactions or harassment have declared Business Insider that their experiences have reinforced their support for the company and its leader, other owners have shared their plans to sell their electric vehicles for fear of reprisals and for the shame that they are associated with the controversial brand. The Used Cars Market has also grown, with a 33% increase in Tesla lists used this year, according to Cox Automotive data. Tesla is not the only one: the ads of other electric cars have also increased by 27% so far this year. However, while some attribute this increase in aging of the range of cars, others believe that Musk's influence can be a factor. Tesla, like other electric car manufacturers, faces growth slowing down throughout the sector. Tesla is now trying to change the trend, affirming investors that he expects his vehicle business to "grow again in 2025". Tesla is preparing new products to help boost demand and quickly approaches a June self -imposed period for two important developments. Tom Narayan, an RBC Market Capital analyst, told Business Insider that consumers can be waiting for a cheaper model before making a new purchase of Tesla. The company also plans to launch its Robotaxi service in Texas in June, which would lay the foundations for the eventual launch of its totally autonomous cybercab that, according to the company, could begin to occur next year.

According to the American newspaper, Amazon wants to take over the social media platform in its entirety. The Video app has become an important sales platform for Amazon, because influencers recommend and sell products from the e-commerce giant to viewers. Although the app has its own e-commercial tool, known as Tiktok Shop, many influencers follow followers still to buy products via Amazon, for which they receive compensation per transaction. The Amazon bid comes just before an important deadline for Bytedance, the Chinese parent company of Tiktok. They fear that national security is at stake, because Tiktok is in Chinese hands and at the same time process data from around 170 million Americans. Amazon's bid in question is said to have arrived by a letter to Vice President JD Vance and Minister of Trade Howard Lutnick. Amazon refused to comment against the newspaper and Tiktok was also not immediately available for a response. US President Donald Trump recently said that he was expecting a deal around Tiktok this week. He also said that there were several potential buyers. "There is enormous interest in Tiktok," he emphasized. Trump has also said to consider moving the deadline if an agreement is not forthcoming.

Whilst Wall Street remains calm, the woes for Nasdaq giant Tesla continued on Wednesday. Elon Musk’s electric vehicle firm announced sales had plummeted to their lowest levels since the first quarter of 2025. This was driven by a refresh of its highly popular Model Y, as well as growing backlash against Musk from his ties to the Trump administration. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown: “The brand is under pressure, and while it’ll take a few months to get clean year-on-year delivery comparisons to truly assess the damage, there’s clearly an underlying impact.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump has announced internally that Elon Musk will leave his government. The reason for departure is that he would like to focus on his companies, who have suffered a lot under his participation in the government. But insiders say it has to do with conflicts between musk and other members of government, who describe him as unpredictable and unmanageable. Read also: Elon Musk admits that his work as a cutback chief of Trump hurts himself and Tesla financially US President Donald Trump has said against confidants, including members of his cabinet, that Elon Musk will play his current role in the government in the coming weeks. That writes news site Polito based on anonymous sources. The president is happy with Musk and the results he has achieved with Doge, but both men have decided in recent days that it is time for Musk to return to his companies, who have suffered a lot under his participation in the government, and to play a more supporting role, according to the sources. As a result, many officials already lost their jobs and more redundancies may follow. Musk would be constantly in conflict with other government members and with the Chief of Staff of the White House Susie Wiles, because he regularly shares plans and ideas for Doge on X, who have not yet received official approval. This week Trump seemed to be somewhat prepared for the departure of Musk. During a cabinet meeting, he announced that Musk would leave the government in the short term to better concentrate on his companies. In an interview with Fox News, Musk said that his mission was completed: "I think we have done the most work that is needed to reduce the budget deficit with 1 trillion dollar." "This 'scoop' is sewer journalism," wrote spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt on X, the message service of Musk. "Elon Musk and President Trump both openly stated that Elon will resign as a special government officer once his incredible work is completed at Doge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russians eye up London mansions – but what might they come back to? Before sanctions were put on Russian individuals and assets by the UK government in February 2022, Russians were major players in the super-prime game, owning huge amounts of London residential property, according to Beauchamp Estates. “[If sanctions are lifted], we’re in a whole new ballgame again,” estate agent at Beauchamp Estates, Paul Finch, said. With talks between Russia and the US making headlines across the world, and US President Donald Trump reportedly very anxious to broker a peace settlement, are Russian buyers about to return to the UK capital? A number of Russians have, so far, migrated from London to places like Dubai or the UAE – estate agent Paul Finch says Dubai is “packed” with Russians, but “they’ve always had an affection for London.” “I think we’ll see some of the Russians coming back [if the war ends]… They all want to be in London,” Wetherall said. Higher demand for super-prime properties would likely help to prop up a flagging market: During the first quarter of 2025, only 15.8 per cent of prime London properties had found a buyer marking a 3.9 per cent reduction on the previous quarter, according to Benham and Reeves. The average property in prime central London is 21.2 per cent lower than its peak in June 2014 – a saving of £1.2m on the average prime central London property, which is currently worth £4.6m, according to Savills. While many Russians came to London to live and raise their children, a significant number owned houses on ‘ghost streets’, where owners of houses would only occasionally reside at the property. Transparency International, an organisation that investigates corruption, has previously branded Britain as a “laundromat” for suspicious wealth from Russia. “These figures highlight Britain’s continued role as a global hub for suspicious and illicit wealth, from Russia and elsewhere,” Transparency International said. “The majority of Russians that were here who own property here… stayed here [but] there have been quite a few houses that sat empty,” Wetherell said. “One would hope that as soon as sanctions are lifted, these restrictions will be lifted as well, and these people will be able to either sell their assets or come back and sort of live in them. Read more Government could take Abramovich to court over £2bn from Chelsea sale “Kind of quite what state they’ll be in… we don’t know,” he added. “They’ve been… with the shutters down for nearly three years with weeds growing out of the gutters because they’re not being serviced,” Finch said. There is also legitimate investment from Russian buyers in the capital, but it’s possible that this will be limited by high taxes going forward. “If you want to be in London, it’s like [joining] a club. There’s a joining fee, and then, fantastic,” he added. Many of the reasons for this stem from changes announced in last year’s Autumn budget. Policy changes announced in the budget include Labour’s decision to continue with Jeremy Hunt’s scrapping of the non-dom regime, higher VAT on private schools, and higher taxes on second homes. Stamp duty on a £20m super-prime home is just under 12 per cent for the portion above £1.5m, amounting to around £2.3m – equivalent to years of renting a super-prime property. “The abolition of the non-doms tax regime and imposition of an increased stamp duty surcharge on additional homes sits firmly behind a further easing in prices in central London,” Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills, said. Significant geopolitical tensions between major global players mean that nothing is set in stone. Jeremy Gee, managing director of Beauchamp Estates, said that London prime property benefits from being “stable” compared to other areas, regardless of the ‘joining fee’. “We have continued to see a significant inflow of international buyers into London, dominated by US dollar-based buyers from American, Middle East and Indians based in the UAE… over recent months we have seen an upturn in buyers from continental Europe and Asia.” An inflow of Russian buyers – even if they are buying to live rather than invest – might even boost demand enough to prop up prices. Ultimately, Wetherell doesn’t think enough has changed in the last three years to push legitimate Russian buyers out of London – in fact, he thinks Russian buyers will even look in the same areas of the capital. “They will start buying up… good quality prime central London stock… good quality prime Surrey stock in Wentworth estates and Georges Hill, which they pretty much made their own 10 to 15 years ago. I think they’ll come back to that,” Wetherell said. We will see them as and when the political landscape changes.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aston Villa’s non-dom owner leaves UK for Italy According to registry filings, Nassef Sawiris, Egypt’s richest man, is now a resident of Italy. The chemicals magnate, who owns Aston Villa and is executive chair of OCI Global, has been gradually cutting ties with the UK in recent months. Shortly after, NNS Group was registered in Abu Dhabi, a tax-friendly jurisdiction that is becoming an increasingly attractive bolt-hole for the world’s super-rich. Now Sawris has formally moved away from the UK, just days before the non-dom regime, a 200-year-old tax status allowing wealthy foreigners only to be taxed on their UK income and assets, is annulled on April 6. Sawiris’s decision to quit the UK, first reported by the Birmingham Mail, follows several other high-profile departures of ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) fleeing what they perceive to be a government assault on wealthy investors. And in September last year, German crypto investor Christian Angermayer moved to Switzerland before unleashing a fierce broadside at the government’s plans to scrap the non-dom status. Read more Aston Martin dealt blow after Ferrari F1 team wins key court battle In an interview with Bloomberg, Angermayer said that every non-dom he knew “has left, or [was] about to leave”, and branded the Chancellor’s plans, which had not been formally announced at the time, as a “huge mistake”. Sawiris is now likely to take up Italy’s attractive flat tax scheme. The regime, which is levied at a blanket rate of €200,000 (£166,600), allows wealthy foreign nationals to reside in the Mediterranean country without paying tax on their global income and assets. A representative for the Egyptian billionaire declined to comment. The Adam Smith Institute paper, titled Wealth Exodus: Stopping non-dom flight, argued that a lack of clarity around the TRF – combined with other changes contained in the Finance Bill – means that wealthy foreigners could face an effective tax rate of 67 per cent on foreign businesses.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The controversial activities of CEO Elon Musk as a government advisor of Donald Trump seem to play a role in this. Also read: Americans massively put their Tesla's for sale - announced worldwide protests against the brand. In recent weeks, Elon Musk has pruned hard in the government spending of the United States with a series of solid cuts. However, the political activities of Musk seem to display negatively on sales at Tesla. On Wednesday, the manufacturer of electric cars announced what happened to Tesla sales in the first quarter of this year. Sales in the Netherlands have also been under considerable pressure for a few months. Earlier this week it was announced that more than 60 percent fewer Tesla's were sold in March. In the first quarter of this year, sales halved to fewer than 3500 cars. The Tesla share fell by 1.2 percent on Wednesday. But his role as an adviser to Trump for cutbacks at the US government has caused dissatisfaction with some customers. Musk has also expressed support for the radical-right German party Department. Has started to live a life of its own, because this has unfortunately become a political symbol worldwide," wrote Analyst Dan Ives van Wedbush Securities in a report prior to the publication of the sales figures. He pointed to protests, demonstrations at Tesla dealers and cars that are damaged. Ives expected Tesla to sell between 355,000 and 360,000 cars in the first quarter, a decrease of around 7 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. The actual decrease is therefore a lot bigger. Only a few months ago, analysts expected more than 400,000 Tesla's sold in the first quarter of this year at Wall Street. How strong is the Musk effect at Tesla? Ives attributed the lower sales figures in his prognosis to various things that are not all related to the political actions of Musk. For example, consumers wait for a new version of the model Y and a cheaper new Tesla that will be released later this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is according to figures from price comparator Pricewise that Business Insider Nederland requested. It is remarkable that the higher prices are easy to justify, whereby weight also plays a role. The difference in expected residual value can be absorbed Insuring a car has become an increasingly expensive joke in recent years. In part, all mandatory driving assistance systems are the culprit, which are not only more expensive to repair, they also ensure that cars are more expensive at all. With the transition to electric driving it is striking that there seems to be a co -reducing factor: the powertrain. The price comparator looked at a number of cars to be compared on request to see what the price differences actually are. This made an attempt to compare as many apples as possible with apples and not the rabbining in comparing the most popular cars in every segment. That would result in a crooked comparison, since they are two considerably different cars, regardless of them in the same segment. Two models, one electric car and one petrol car, per segment was chosen to get the widest possible image. In addition, they were all requested by a fictional person born on January 1, 1980, has 10 claim -free years, runs 15,000 to 20,000 kilometers per year, lives in Amsterdam and accepts a maximum deductible of 500 euros. That provides the following picture with the costs of car insurance, where three variants were taken: WA, WA+ and AllRisk. Price differences Car insurance for electric and gasoline can be explained According to PriceWise, the price differences can easily be explained. This applies even more to electric cars because those more expensive parts contain, with the battery pack as the most important example. They also usually have more advanced electronics and specialist knowledge is needed for repairs. Then there are two more factors that make the premium of an electric car higher: performance and weight. In the first instance you would think that these factors are not necessarily connected to an electric cars, but in practice insurers see more risks with the performance and weight of electric cars. Electric cars usually have more power and attract faster, which the insurer labeled as riskyer. You probably didn't see that second, the weight. The extra weight of an EV naturally stems from the fact that he is taking a heavy battery pack. Now it is not so much that the battery pack will drive up the premium, but the fact that insurers state that heavier cars cause more damage in an accident. That must be paid, so a heavier car is more expensive to insure. Given the reasons for insurers to charge higher premiums for electric cars, it does not seem likely that the insurance costs will be drawn in the future, let alone come closer together.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Brit Macer Gifford is a former stock market trader who fought as an international volunteer for the Ukrainian army. He tells Business Insider what he found good and bad about the forces who voluntarily came to Ukraine. According to Gifford, these fighters are generally to be praised, but there were a few "crazy" in between. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, thousands of people around the world reacted to President Volodymyr Zensky's passionate call to help defend his country. Ukraine welcomed a large group of foreign volunteers, from people without combat experience to experienced fighters. He tells Business Insider about the chaotic first inflow of volunteers and the bad and good sides of this international group. "There was a lot of energy, goodwill and passion from the international community," says Gifford, who initially helped with help and training, but felt forced to fight with the Russian troops in Bucha. He says that the military infrastructure of Ukraine was not ready for a large influx of volunteers and that the training and organization was initially bad. It even seemed that the Ukrainian organization would collapse under the large influx, while it was still busy training its own troops. "You saw very capable people with fantastic skills who were eager to share their knowledge," says Gifford. According to him, for example, there were people who were submitted in the field of war medicine or were already familiar with Western weapon systems, the deliveries of which just started at the time. They soon showed themselves very useful in the fight, says Gifford. In 2015 he fought together with the Syrian Democratic forces against ISIS, initially without any experience. According to Gifford, it is about whether people can adapt and how they deal with themselves. There are also "horror stories" about international volunteers, according to Gifford. The international legion of Ukraine, which was founded early to deliver the fighters that Zenskyy asked for, received a very bad reputation. Gifford says he would rather work with Ukrainians. "But to be honest, many should not have been there at all." He thinks they might fling something in their home country, for example an addiction to drinks or drugs. "They saw the war in Ukraine as an opportunity to prove themselves," said Gifford. According to Gifford, the worst kind of volunteer is the volunteer who shows up and thinks he knows everything immediately. People like this "thinks two broadcasts to Afghanistan or Iraq means they can play the boss about people in Ukraine," he says. While the conflict in Ukraine differs enormously from everything that even the most experienced fighters have experienced. Another type of foreigner that pops up at the front in Ukraine is what Gifford calls "the bladder jaw" According to him, a bladder jaw is someone who has put himself entirely in a Ukrainian uniform, but who is often not part of a unity and who is not even in the Ukrainian army. "They wander around and sit in coffee kicks in cities such as LVIV and Odesa, which are completely safe and are outside the radius of a thousand kilometers of the Ukrainian front line," says Gifford. "Ordinary Ukrainians just like it that they are not alone and that there are people who are willing to risk their lives," says Gifford, who was offered drinks and meals from the population. He says that the international volunteers generally went to Ukraine to support the country in times of need.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reeves’ black hole alarmism is creating something scarier: A real one Reeves’ fearmongering has scared Brits into saving. The consequences will be more frightening than Reeves’ ‘black hole’, writes Paul Ormerod A very bad piece of news for the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, slipped out last week with relatively little comment. Obviously, if people save more, they spend less. Consumer spending is just over £1,700bn a year in the UK. So by the end of 2024, people were choosing to spend £70bn less at an annual rate than a year ago. No wonder the economy is teetering on the brink of recession if consumers are becoming much less inclined to spend. It is a major headache for Rachel Reeves and her desire to see the economy grow. But it is also an interesting test of an important theory in macroeconomics, one which has key practical implications. The theory goes back just over 200 years. For 20 years from the mid-1790s, Britain had been engaged in a titanic struggle with Napoleon’s France. The other was to issue government bonds. But an increase in taxes cancels this out. Ricardo believed the private sector would act rationally. People would anticipate that in the future, taxes would have to go up anyway to pay off the debt. As a result, they would save more and spend less now to be able to pay these taxes. This is a key idea in modern macroeconomics, known as “Ricardian equivalence”. The two methods of financing a deficit – taxes and issuing bonds – are equivalent in their impact on total spending in an economy. The modern version of the theory makes a number of qualifications to Ricardo’s original idea. But the basic principle survives: if a government runs a large deficit, the private sector will save more because people anticipate that taxes will have to rise at some point to pay off the public debt. So the deficit rises, which makes even more tax increases likely to fund it. The Chancellor is creating her very own black hole, this time a genuine and frightening one.</p>

Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs could spark a global recession

The world is bracing for Trump’s ‘Liberation day,’ with the President set to impose a fresh batch of tariffs on nations across the globe this evening.

Trump will speak from the White House Rose Garden at 16:00 (21:00 BST) to unveil his new set of levies.

The President’s Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the tariffs will be “effective immediately” after the announcement on Tuesday.

Since his inauguration in January, Trump’s bait and switch on tariffs has caused turbulence in global markets.

The President had previously said in March that tariffs would be reciprocal – charging countries what they charge the US – however, he backtracked at a later date and told reporters the numbers could be lower.

Nigel Wicking, chief executive of Heathrow Airline Operators Committee, which represents airlines that use the west London airport, said there were a “couple of incidents” which made him concerned. “That obviously made me concerned and, as such, I raised the point. Wicking said he believed Heathrow’s Terminal 5 could have been ready to receive repatriation flights by “late morning” on the day of the closure, and that “there was [an] opportunity also to get flights out”. “If we had not done that, we would have had thousands of passengers stranded at the airport at high risk to personal injury, gridlocked roads around the airport, because don’t forget 65,000 houses and other institutions were powered down. Parts of the civil infrastructure didn’t work. “So the risk of having literally tens of thousands of people stranded at the airport, where we would have nowhere to put them, we could not process them, would have been a disastrous scenario.” All that had to be secured before we started operation.” Woldbye added: “I cannot guarantee you whether T5 could have opened an hour earlier. Woldbye said the airport has contracts with energy company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks for “resilient power set-ups”, and “we have to rely on the contracts we have”. But that, of course, comes at a very high cost, and that is the discussion we have to have with airlines, because we cannot make investments without having airlines (agree to them).” I don’t feel that we should be paying more for further resilience.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US tariffs: UK being ‘supine’ and should ‘retaliate’, Lord Rose urges government The UK has been “supine” to US President Donald Trump and should be “firm” and “find some way to retaliate”, Lord Rose has said. He said it’s “quite sad” that the UK is “sitting there with our little begging bowl” in the hope that Trump goes easy on us. The US President is expected to unveil sweeping tariffs at an event at the White House around 9pm UK time, in a move he has dubbed ‘liberation day’. Economists at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) have warned US tariffs could eliminate Reeves’s fiscal headroom against her debt target, requiring more spending cuts or tax rises to meet her economic rules, as well as shrinking the economy by one per cent. While analysis from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggested tariffs on car imports would put 25,000 UK jobs at risk and “completely destabilise the UK car industry”. And we know certainly the EU’s got a plan. Asked if the UK was powerless to respond, Lord Rose insisted: “If you believe that sort of a mantra, I’m afraid we’re all finished. We have actually got a situation here where our trade is relatively balanced. And he added: “It’s quite sad in the 21st century, and I’ve been around a long time, seeing how our relationship has or hasn’t developed with the USA, that we’re sitting there with our little begging bowl, hoping that Trump, because he’s got a Scottish mother, or had a Scottish mother, and he owns a golf club in Scotland, is going to be nice to us.” He urged the government to strike a more positive note and to say: “Look, guys, it’s a bright, sunny morning this morning… things will be fine. It is unclear what Trump will announce on Wednesday, but his administration views the application of VAT rate as discriminating against US goods and could respond with a 20 per cent tariff on imports from the UK. He already announced a 25 per cent import tax will be introduced on all cars imported to the US, a blow to the UK’s automotive industry which sent exports worth £7.6bn there last year. Tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, including from British firms, are already in place.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three months of Trump have shown investors are hard to be spooked Trump’s presidency is yet to spook retail investors. The first three months under Trump have revealed something interesting – while investors are less confident about the markets, they’re not running away. The latest Finimize Modern Investor Pulse, which surveyed over 2,200 modern retail investors, shows that market confidence has fallen significantly – only 60 per cent now believe stocks will be higher in a year, down from 71 per cent. This comes as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has warned the US economy might be entering a “detox period”. The tech sector remains the top choice (65 per cent), followed by energy (49 per cent) and healthcare (36 per cent), showing investors are still confident in specific areas despite recent drops in tech stocks. What’s clear is that regular investors are thinking long-term. They’re not letting short-term market swings rattle them, but are adapting thoughtfully to the changing financial landscape by building more balanced portfolios that can weather whatever comes next. After seven incredible years at Finimize, I’m stepping into the CEO role to lead our next phase of growth. Through Finimize for Business, we’ve helped hundreds of financial institutions connect with modern investors. The rise of retail investing isn’t slowing down, and neither are we. Expect a lot of focus on the biggest US companies: overall, analysts expect S&P 500 firms to show seven per cent first-quarter year-on-year earnings growth, with healthcare, information technology and utilities expected to lead the line – and energy, materials and consumer staples firms to lag. She’s In CTRL by Dr Anne-Marie Imafidon tackles the critical issue of why women are so underrepresented in tech – just about a quarter of the UK’s STEM workforce – and why this matters for all of us. Anne-Marie, a social entrepreneur, computer scientist and one of my dearest friends, successfully challenges the idea that technology is some unchangeable force designed by, and for, a select few. Through personal stories and the spotlighting of female pioneers, she demonstrates how women have transformed the tech landscape despite significant obstacles.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>YES: There is a clear correlation between smartphones and mental health issues This is due to the clear correlation between social media and gaming with mental health issues. If executed correctly, it is a much-needed measure to safeguard our children and govern the unethical practices of some advertisers who target under-16s. It means that advertisers will need to ensure their campaigns are ethically sound and do not contribute to negative outcomes like mental health issues, unhealthy habits or misinformation. Continued innovation around first-party data strategies within advertising will also help with this, ensuring that brands still find value in their campaigns but minimise tracking. While we all know new technology can be a powerful force for good, more research is needed to guide schools, parents and children alike to navigate these new technologies. This is ever more profound and important with the rise of AI. NO: Education – not prohibition – is the key to guiding responsible phone use While the intention behind banning smartphones in schools is understandable, a blanket ban risks creating more problems than it solves. Logistically, schools face serious challenges managing large volumes of phones daily. These are practical issues that can’t be ignored. Reports of students using “burner phones” – handing in old or inactive devices while keeping their real phones – highlight how easily rules can be undermined. Read more SEN children at the heart of legal fight over VAT on private school fees Beyond logistics, we must also consider the role smartphones play in modern life. They’re used to top up lunch accounts, coordinate family plans and stay connected in emergencies. In a world where most adult coordination – from group chats to transport – is done digitally, expecting students to rely solely on receptionists or landlines seems outdated. Simply removing devices doesn’t help students develop digital discipline or understand context-appropriate use. Education – not prohibition – is the key to guiding responsible behaviour. Rather than banning smartphones altogether, schools should focus on structured guidance and clear expectations. Whether you think TV setting policy agenda is a good thing or not, there is no doubt the success of Netflix drama Adolescence could prove significant in moving the dial on the growing debate around online safety for young people. Jack Thorne, who wrote the show alongside actor Stephen Graham and attended a roundtable with Keir Starmer yesterday, has urged the PM to consider a smartphone ban in schools, as recently implemented in Australia. Kids are smart, and will find ways to use them anyway. Better, then, it be done without the added glamour for teenagers of doing something they’re not meant to.</p>

March closes with 21.35 million people affiliated with Social Security, according to the latest data published by the Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration. It is 161,491 affiliates more than in February, a figure higher than that experienced in the Maras prior to the pandemic. In total, 455,679 occupied more than a year ago, with an increase of 2.2%. We are solving structural problems that distanced us from Europe," says the Minister of Inclusion, Social Security and Migrations, Elma Saiz. From the Ministry of Labor they clarify that in 2025, unlike the previous year, "March still does not benefit from the effects of hiring in Holy Week and, on the contrary, it is weighed by adverse weather phenomena." With this data, the registered strike is located at 2.58 million people, below the level of 2.6 million people in unemployment. "The number of unemployed and stops is at its lowest level in a month of March since 2008, 17 years ago," they explain from the Ministry of Labor and Social Economy. Specifically, unemployment has been reduced by 146,865 people in the last 12 months, of which almost 79,000 are women, while the number of unemployed youth this month is in 197,524 people, the lowest in the series in a month of March. Regarding March 2024, interannual strike descends in 146,865 people, which represents a reduction of 5.39%. Regarding the creation of employment, from the Ministry of Social Security they find that "this month the historical maximum of women affiliated with Social Security is reached, with 10,117,058 average affiliates, which represents 47.4% of the total." Only Italy is approaching, with an employment growth of 5.4%. Tags: trending, unemployment, Spain, work, new employment</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exclusive: Law firm Shoosmiths ties bonuses to AI usage Law firm Shoosmiths has become the first major firm to link a firmwide bonus to its workforce’s use of artificial intelligence (AI). The firm exclusively told City AM that it set a “clear and ambitious annual target”: one million Microsoft Copilot prompts to unlock a £1m bonus pot for staff in the new financial year. The bonus metric will form one element of the firm’s multi-million collegiate bonus pool, available to all staff except partners and business services directors. If the AI target is achieved, Shoosmiths staff will share £1m of the reward, which equates to one per cent of each individual’s salary. The firm worked out that if every staff member uses its AI just four times per working day, the target “will be comfortably” surpassed. David Jackson, CEO at Shoosmiths, stated, “This initiative is about creating a culture where everyone plays a role in embracing change and using technology to raise the bar on client service.” Instead, it frees them to spend more time on the human-to-human work that really matters: solving problems, building trust, and supporting clients through complexity,” he added. At the same time, its equity partners each took home over £780,000 in profit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The British Basketball Federation (BBF) has defied Super League Basketball (SLB) clubs by signing a 15-year deal with Marshall Glickman’s GBB League Ltd (GBBL) to operate the men’s professional league from 2026. SLB clubs warned last week that they would take legal action to block the sale of the licence, which they say is illegal. “The GB women’s and men’s teams have both qualified for Fiba EuroBasket this summer, and our progress on the court will be boosted through the LA Olympic Cycle funding recently announced by UK Sport. “To have booming professional leagues which enable our top players to compete in front of British fans, week in and week out, is just what we need in order to fulfil British Basketball’s huge potential.” GBBL also includes partners Chris Dillavou, former COO of the Greg Norman Companies, and Arjun Metre, former investment director in sports, media and entertainment for Intel Capital. “We are fully committed to uplifting the popularity of basketball in Great Britain,” said Glickman. “We are especially focused on making our league attractive to homegrown players, both in terms of economics and development. “It is also essential that we use the league as a platform to celebrate British culture – we believe in the fusion of sports with music, fashion, wellness and equality. We believe basketball is a next generation experience that we will embrace in a variety of ways – both physically and digitally.” How has SLB and its clubs responded to BBF? “The new league operator proposed by the British Basketball Federation has no clubs, fans, arenas or expertise to build the infrastructure and future that British basketball and its communities deserve,” a spokesperson said.

Meanwhile, GBBL will seek to engage with the current SLB owners as well as conducting a process to evaluate opportunities in population centres currently without a presence at the highest level such as Liverpool, Leeds, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Birmingham.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The price of light today April 2 leaves good news and lowers strongly to 27.99 euros megavatio hour (MWh). Customers whose contract is linked to the regulated price must be special care when using the appliances that consume the most expensive time of the day because their price runs runs to almost 104 euros. But not everything is bad news because throughout the day there are up to three hours whose price is negative, according to the latest data of the Iberian Electricity Market (OMIE). The average price of electricity in the wholesale market low this Wednesday, April 2, 2025 to 27.99 euros MWh on average. On this occasion, special attention should be paid at the most expensive time of the day: 104.90 euros. This is the price for time strip today. From 08:00 to 09:00 hours: 104.9 euros/MWh (the most expensive time) Thus, it is interesting to remember the appliances that you consume the most to see if it is in our hand to try to use it less or selecting the most economical hours. It will be necessary to provide special to the washing machine, which in addition to trying to use it in cheap hours you can look for short washing or that it will be launched with not very hot water in order to increase savings. Why the price of light rises in 2025 In figures, this has meant an increase in customer invoices in the free market of almost 56 euros per year for an average profile (about 4.6 euros per month). How to save on the light bill Regarding the fridge, it must be taken into account that about 5 degrees for the refrigerator and about -18 degrees for the freezer "are enough." Another advice is to monitor the standby. "The electronic devices that remain plugged in and waiting to consume unnecessary electrifice, since we are not using it," they indicate. We can also adjust the contracted power. Finally, it is an obvious advice, but we don't always do it: turn off the light when you don't need it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While law firms investigate how to use AI, there are also concerns about what this means for invoicable hours. CEO Sean Fitzpatrick of Legal Database Lexis Nexis thinks more people can start invoicing per hour. Artificial Intelligence gives lawyers "an extra pair of eyes" so that they can provide better service, the top man thinks. Law firms are currently looking for how they can use artificial intelligence to save time, but at the same time, lawyers fear the effect that the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have on their invoicable hours. CEO Sean Fitzpatrick of Legal Database LexisNexis in North America, the United Kingdom and Ireland, is thinking a lot about this question. Last week, during a panel discussion on Legalweek, he tried to take away their worries. Fitzpatrick states that the addition of AI can lead to higher billable hours. Invoicing rates at large offices are currently rising, driven by the continuous consolidation of law firms and the increased demand for legal top talent. Fitzpatrick is convinced that lawyers who use artificial intelligence, from virtual legal assistants to chatbots, will offer their customers an even higher quality of service. During his panel discussion, Fitzpatrick gave a hypothetical example. She is the only person working on it," he said. "Let's say she has almost exactly the same thing tomorrow, but tomorrow she has access to this new technology that helps her with her work. It offers her some extra perspectives and things she hadn't thought of before. "So she is able to create more value for her customer," he continued. Earlier this year, LexisNexis introduced protégé, a system that uses so -called AI agents - or software that can perform tasks without much human help - to write concepts, make timelines of documents and enable users to search their company data. It is built on a patchwork of large -scale and refined models from OpenAi, Anthropic, Mistral, AWS and Microsoft, according to the company. Legal experts, including lawyers and founders of legal-technological startups, shared during the Legalweek with Business Insider that law firms switch to fixed reimbursements instead of invoicable hours. The idea is that artificial intelligence can handle simpler legal tasks, so that lawyers can use more brain power to solve more complex problems. Those lawyers may lose some of the invoicable hours they pass on to clients. He told Business Insider that customers will put pressure on their offices on how they use artificial intelligence to "do more with the hours they have". "The customers of lawyers always want cheaper service and better quality," said Junestrand. "So law firms get a greater chance of offering them."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is likely that at some point you have considered leaving your job. However, there are a number of important issues that you should take into account before presenting voluntary decline. He has founded the labor resources project and, through @recursos_Laborrales, contributes the best possible content every day putting all his love. Throughout your professional career, it is possible that, at some point, you consider resigning. Whether you are not at ease in your current job, because you look for an improvement of your working conditions or because you want to give your life a change, most likely you have to face this circumstance sooner or later. However, a series of issues must be taken into consideration so that, when making this decision, the situation does not end up becoming against you. You will not find yourself in legal unemployment. In that sense, you will need to work again in another position for a few months and that the reason for the decline is the end of your contract to reach its maximum duration or a dismissal. How should you communicate voluntary leave in your job? To prevent them from being penalized, you must notify the aforementioned in your collective agreement or as reflected in your employment contract. Even so, the penalty could be even greater, but in that case you will have to review what is specified in your contract or in your collective agreement. Something that not so many people know is that you can retract once you have presented the voluntary leave. During the notice period, you can cancel your request for loss as long as this does not imply substantial damage to your employer, such as in the event that you have already hired another person to cover your position. With voluntary leaves your employment relationship does not extinguish, but is suspended. In addition, you will have preferential right to re -enter your job. The consequences are the same as those of a voluntary decline: you will not be entitled to unemployment or compensation. On the other hand, if your collective agreement does not say otherwise, you will not have an obligation to give an notice (as it happens when resigning).

As a result, Dutch sectors are both direct and indirectly vulnerable to the rates, according to the economists in their research. American import duties on foreign cars and car parts of 25% At the end of last month, Trump signed a decree in which he indicates 25 percent of US import rates on 3 April to import both foreign cars and car parts. The US has a considerable trade deficit in this sector compared to Mexico, Germany, Canada, Japan and South Korea. Due to the levies, the Netherlands would miss 700 million euros in economic value this year and even 1.4 billion euros next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By converting car factories partly into military production centers, two problems can be tackled at the same time, according to analysts from Deutsche Bank. Read also: German car manufacturers are missing € 3 billion from Trump import duties Germany is on the eve of an unprecedented military redemiation. By using knowledge, personnel and production lines from the car industry for military purposes, two birds can be made in one fell swoop, according to a report published this week by analysts from Deutsche Bank. Germany is going to spend a lot more on Defense Extra defense spending now falls outside the strict budget rules. That amounts to more than 170 billion euros extra in the next three years, according to the analysts of Deutsche Bank. Since peak production in 2017, the number of vehicles produced has fallen by almost a third. In total there are around 100,000 jobs on the nevertheless in the German car industry, with an expected restructuring burden of 10 billion euros. However, that pain also offers opportunities, the analysts of Deutsche Bank say. Companies such as Continental, Schaeffler and even VW are already in conversation with defense companies such as Rheinmetall and Hensoldt about staff exchange or cooperation. Since 2004, Germany has cut substantial cuts on the production of tanks, armored vehicles, Houwitsers and combat aircraft. By redesigning empty or under -occupied car factories, that pace can go up. Repurposing offers a faster road to scaling up and the car industry has an adult production culture: just-in-time logistics, tight process control and experience with series work. Yet the proposed transition is not without bumps. Trading staff takes time and factories often have to be fully redesigned. The analysts of Deutsche Bank therefore argue for more flexible labor legislation, faster safety screening and temporary transition companies that guide employees to a new sector. Although Germany is aiming for more autonomy, the American defense industry will continue to play a leading role on the world stage for years. There are no fully -fledged European alternatives for complex weapon systems such as stealth jets and rockets. Nevertheless, American companies are trying to locate their production more and more often: Northrop Grumman works together with Rheinmetall on F-35 parts, while Lockheed Martin is preparing a German Himars project.</p>

The man was fired because clients from the security company where he worked complained that he smelled "not fresh" and did not have the build to "put drunken guests out". This is apparent from a decision by the Arnhem-Leeuwarden Court of Appeal that was done at the beginning of March and published on 31 March. The Court of Appeal does not agree with that, but states that he is entitled to 5,000 euros on top of the transition payment, because the employer had not offered him a considerable improvement process. He stood at Watcheboutique Tourbillon in the P.C. Eventually he ended up with the pharmaceutical company Kite Pharma in Hoofddorp. All these clients indicated Risk that they were not satisfied with the security guard. Moreover, he would make a "uncertain impression".

However, according to Risk, this work is not suitable for him, because for medical reasons he is not allowed to work until after midnight, while events often last until the small hours. Warning is not yet an improvement process Also Risk managers would have repeatedly pointed out that he could lose his job if the satisfaction of clients did not improve. The Court believes that Risk could have been expected more than only to point out his inadequate functioning. During the session, various options were discussed, such as a coaching process, additional training sessions or a mentor that cooperates with the security guard and evaluates him. For that reason, the security guard receives 5,000 euros in reimbursement. In this judgment, the court has not taken into account that he already receives a transition payment of around 10,000 euros and that Risk has continued a year of wage, while the security guard was not working.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There aren’t many decade-old Guardian articles that still resonate with me, but I can recall (and often revisit) a 2014 column by Oliver Burkeman. He was writing in response to the latest example of institutional failure that week (something to do with the bungled sacking of the New York Times editor) and he was able to list a slew of other gaffes, cock-ups and embarrassments from the recent news cycle (featuring Ed Miliband and Barack Obama) noting that we’re always “shocked whenever authority figures who are supposed to know what they’re doing make it plain that they don’t.” He wrote that stories of incompetence “illustrate one of the most fundamental yet still under-appreciated truths of human existence, which is this: everyone is totally just winging it, all the time.” We like to think that “somewhere, in the highest echelons of society, there are some near-infallible adults in charge,” but look around – in politics, across Whitehall, in public institutions, maybe even at your company – and ask yourself, is this really the case? I’ll never forget being told by a Downing Street official, years after I read the Burkeman column, that “the room with all the really clever people in it doesn’t actually exist.” Do you doubt me? This column isn’t supposed to be nihilistic; on the contrary – it can be liberating to realise that leaders, experts and systems are fallible and, once we appreciate that, we can work with a clear head to make improvements. Nor is this line of argument designed to excuse serious failures or to shield anyone from ultimate responsibility. Instead, it’s about recognising why we so often have to endure what might be termed ‘low level incompetence’ – often masked by a title, a uniform or even institutional secrecy. All of this has served as a rather long winded introduction to the point I set out to make, which is that we shouldn’t be surprised to discover that the Office for National Statistics is making a hash of vital data collection and analysis, and has been for years. The important thing is that now their fallibility is well understood by all concerned, we should demand vigorous efforts to review, learn, test and improve in a spirit of candour and transparency. That might seem radical, but it shouldn’t be too much to ask.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She should adjust rates now while there’s still time to improve public services before the next election? And fix distortive cliff edges while she’s at it, says Will Cooling Rachel Reeves has lost all control over the nation’s finances. For all her talk of tough decisions, she has repeatedly taken the easy way out and as a result has had to return to the well for public spending and welfare cuts. For all her promises to be fiscally responsible, she has given herself no leeway. Scrambling to find a tax she could increase without breaking the letter of her party’s manifesto commitments, she settled on increasing employer rather than employee National Insurance Contributions. This was always a cynical dodge, given that ultimately employers would pass the cost onto their employees through lower wage increases. A problem compounded by another above-inflation increase in the national minimum wage and the impending cost of implementing Angela Rayner’s package of new worker’s rights. What makes her passivity all the more remarkable is that slowly but surely she is increasing income taxes, having signed-up to continue Jeremy Hunt’s plan to freeze the personal allowance until March 2028. But of course that benefit will be back loaded, because she’s waiting for inflation to slowly inflate away the personal allowance. Why not seize the moment and bring that additional income forward? She could also fix the bizarre bottlenecks that have arisen where some higher rate taxpayers are faced with excessive marginal rates when their personal allowance or child benefit is aggressively withdrawn. Surely it would be better to just start the additional rate at a lower level than engage in convoluted kludges that are arbitrarily forcing people to stop working. Before Alistair Darling’s emergency repair job, the personal allowance represented about a quarter of average earnings, something that today would be around £9,000. Bringing the personal allowance down to this level would represent no more than a £60 monthly tax increase for the low paid, something that Labour should be more than able to compensate for by improving public services. Rachel Reeves could not have looked less in control than she did last week. Will Cooling writes about politics and pop culture at It Could be Said Substack</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON, ENGLAND – MARCH 26: British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner arrives for a weekly cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street on March 26, 2025 in London, England. Labour’s only hope for growth is new housebuilding – but Britain doesn’t have the workforce to deliver even the newly downgraded targets. There is an obvious solution, says Jamila Robertson Nevertheless, Angela Rayner’s National Planning Policy Framework was the one bright spot in an otherwise bleak emergency Budget – with the OBR predicting planning reforms would yield 170,000 new homes, boosting growth by 0.2 per cent a year. This will result in 32 ‘homebuilding skills hubs’ to “fast-track training to local areas that need more housing” and ultimately deliver 5,000 more construction apprentices a year. Firstly, the hubs aren’t scheduled to launch until 2028. While admirable, 5,000 apprentices by the end of this parliament will not plug a vacancy gap of 402,000 workers, or deliver 1.3-1.5m homes. While admirable, 5,000 apprentices by the end of this parliament will not plug a vacancy gap of 402,000 workers, or deliver 1.3-1.5m homes One thing Labour’s plans do right is radically reduce the time it takes to train a construction apprentice, halving apprenticeships from 24-30 months to 12-18 months. According to the January 2025 figures, we currently have 1.6m people on Universal Credit searching for work. In 2023, the Conservative government stipulated that benefit claimants who failed to find work for more than 18 months would have to undertake work experience placements. The government should reduce this to six months and insist that roles are taken up in industries like construction, where there are staff shortages and a lot of work. For the young, it should be a no-brainer. On a construction starting salary of £31,787, take-home pay would be £2,200pcm, £1,391 a month more than they would receive on Universal Credit, and much better for their mental health. But, carrot rather than stick will, of course, be the best way to ensure job seekers see construction as the thriving and future-proof industry that it is. There are already great initiatives like Open Doors, which provide the opportunity to see live construction sites in action. These should be embraced by schools and colleges, to inspire those who aren’t yet sure of what they want to do. Encouraging more young people, or career switchers, to consider the industry starts with outlining attractive salaries, explaining roles and opportunities for growth and development, and the option to work for yourself down the line. It also has a lot to do with persuading parents. With traditional first jobs like retail and hospitality facing hiring freezes and redundancies due to Rachel Reeves’ Autumn Budget, now is a great time for the construction industry to present itself as the alternative for young people – and if that doesn’t work, they can always share the story of Pimlico Plumbers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If there’s one thing every economist agrees on, it’s that the only people who benefir from tariffs are cynical politicians, says Daniel Freeman Even if you ask a single economist their view on a subject they will generally give you at least three contradictory positions. The US has now imposed tariffs on various countries and goods. Trump’s protectionist argument goes like this: for decades the US has been reducing tariffs and buying more goods from abroad. This weakened the US manufacturing sector as Americans chose to buy more foreign goods that are cheaper, higher quality or both. The solution to both these problems, they say, is to raise tariffs making foreign goods more expensive for American consumers and therefore boosting demand for US produced goods. Read more No 10 says Donald Trump’s tariffs not responsible for UK economy shrinking While it’s true that the US, like most other rich countries, buys more manufactured goods from abroad than they once did. But this has not been accompanied by a long-run rise in unemployment or reduced growth, in fact the result has been the opposite as people and investment have shifted into higher value sectors in which developed countries have more of a competitive edge. You could just as easily say that I must be being conned by my nearest Chinese takeaway, because I’ve spent hundreds of pounds there and yet they have never bought anything from me. So why do politicians support the economic equivalent of snake oil? Partly there is a nostalgic element to protectionism, particularly in the US. Trump has made repeated references to the high tariffs of America’s late 19th century Gilded Age as a model to follow – even if the work of economic historians like Douglas Irwin and Alex Klein has shown the US industrialised in spite of a high tariff regime not because of it. What was less obvious was (as a later study found) that every additional job in the US manufacturing cost American consumers over $800,000 (£627,000) in higher costs per year. Trump may cynically claim that the bill is being paid by foreigners. But the reality is that trade enriches everyone and when it is choked off, especially in an arbitrary and random way, we all pick up the tab.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The S & P 500 has lost about 3.7% so far in 2025 as investors have been rattled over fickle and potentially draconian trade policy and the effect it could have on consumers and companies. Though Trump during his first term had used market performance as a yardstick for progress, he has seemed less preoccupied with Wall Street this time around. That could change with the president making his "liberation day" announcement on tariffs , said Lee, who is the firm's head of research. "Despite claims to the contrary, evidence strongly indicates Trump does care about stock market performance." .SPX YTD line S & P 500 performance Stocks were trading higher and bond yields advanced ahead of the 4 p.m. tariff announcement in the Rose Garden on Wednesday. While moves have been volatile in both directions, the year has seen a tough slog for stocks but a rush to bonds. Treasury yields have tumbled since Trump's inauguration, meeting one benchmark the administration had staked out early, namely to lower borrowing costs. "Investor perceptions of Trump differ significantly between bond and stock markets, possibly due to political affiliations within these groups. "This division could explain the differential reactions to tariff-related news between these markets." As stocks have slumped, the 10-year Treasury is around its lowest level since early December 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Market update: The S & P 500 is trying to make it three straight days of initially opening lower only to finish the session in positive territory. This comes as the market debates if today's tariff announcements are already priced into stocks, even as we won't fully understand their impact for months. The market will gain some clarity later this afternoon when President Trump unveils his trade plan at a Rose Garden event at 4 p.m. But the size and scope of the tariffs are still unclear, with recent reporting suggesting they could be anywhere from a 20% universal tariff on all imports, to reciprocal charges across different countries, to a more targeted plan. Or will the tariff aggression escalate from here? We'll get a better idea later, which is why at this point we've elected to sit on our hands and do nothing until more information is known. The New York Times reported that Amazon made a late bid to buy TikTok's U.S. operations. It's unclear how serious Amazon's chances are at winning this bid and there's still a possibility of ByteDance retaining control of TikTok. TikTok's fate is anyone's best guess, but this would be a huge get for Amazon if it comes out on top. There are clear synergies for its e-commerce platform, which it could integrate with the social media platform and partner with content creators to sell more goods. TikTok would also provide a huge boost to Amazon's growing advertising business. Nice to have for Amazon, but we wouldn't buy the stock in anticipation of this deal working out. We have a 1 rating on Amazon because it is improving margins by driving efficiencies and reducing its cost to serve retail customers, plus the stock is on sale trading nearly 20% from its February highs. In other news, Amazon said it will send 27 Kuiper Satellites into space later this month. Up next: We will keep a close eye on all the trade and tariff headlines expected to come out later. In addition to the news from the White House, we must be mindful of how other countries respond — and possibly retaliate. We should know more on that by Thursday morning. On the data side, we'll see initial jobless claims, the final read on S & P Global US Services, and ISM services index. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AppLovin is one of the companies in negotiations to potentially acquire TikTok, sources familiar with the situation told CNBC's David Faber on Wednesday.

The Trump administration, which has been trying to shepherd a deal to shift control of the Chinese-owned app to an American company, is "fully aware" of AppLovin's interest in TikTok, the sources said.

Faber said, based on his reporting, that it is unclear whether any of the U.S. parties interested in TikTok will be able to take control of the non-Chinese part of the company's business.

AppLovin shares briefly popped around 5% following the news, but have since given up most of those gains. AppLovin did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

TikTok could be effectively banned in the U.S. on April 5 because of a national security law originally signed by former President Joe Biden that requires Chinese parent ByteDance to divest the app's American operations. ByteDance originally faced a Jan. 19 deadline to sell TikTok, but Trump signed an executive order instructing the attorney general to not enforce the law, granting the company 75 more days to unload the U.S. portion of its business.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors looking to cushion their portfolios in the midst of the recent market volatility may be turning to dividend-paying stocks. Equities are off to a rocky start so far this year thanks to uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariffs and the economy. Stocks with consistent dividends are often thought of as ballast in market storms, since the income generated can help offset any declines in the share price. "Dividends can help reduce volatility in a time of greater uncertainty and geopolitical risks," Morgan Stanley strategist Todd Castagno wrote in a note early last month. Moreover, many of the stocks are underappreciated and ended the first quarter on Monday offering significant upside to analysts' price targets. To find the dividend-paying stocks that Wall Street believes will move higher, CNBC screened for those that both yield more than the S & P 500 's yield of 1.37%, and have at least 30% upside to the average price target, according to FactSet. They also are rated a buy from 60% or more of the analysts covering them. Broadcom is most loved by analysts, with nearly 70% rating it a buy, FactSet data shows. The semiconductor company has a 1.4% dividend yield, which it first began paying a year ago, and about 54% upside to the analysts' average price target. Last month, Broadcom handily beat earnings and revenue expectations in its fiscal first quarter. It also gave strong guidance for its second quarter ending April 30, with CEO Hock Tan saying Broadcom expects continued strength in artificial intelligence revenue. The stock is JPMorgan's top pick in semiconductors. "Overall, the team continues to drive a stable revenue growth profile even in a period of macro volatility given its portfolio breadth/diversification/product cycles," analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note after Broadcom's earnings report. The stock is down almost 27% year to date. The real estate investment trust's fourth-quarter results topped expectations in February. CEO Jim Risoleo told CNBC at the time that the Host Hotels & Resorts' consumer, who is affluent, is "very healthy." Host Hotels continues to see growth in what it calls "out of room spend, ancillary revenues," which includes golf and spa services, the CEO said. Investors get a 3.2% dividend yield with Citigroup , which has 31% upside to the average price target. Led by CEO Jane Fraser, Citi is in the middle of a turnaround to reshape its business. That is why our expenses are temporarily elevated — to make the investments to get there," Fraser said during the earnings conference call. On Tuesday, Delta was downgraded to hold from buy at Jefferies, which cited a likely reduction in Delta's 2025 sales and earnings forecast. The airline is expected to report earnings next week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the market braces for President Donald Trump' s massive tariff rollout, investors should be cautious of some stocks that have meaningful Canada revenue exposure. On Wednesday ahead of the announcement, stocks ticked higher, with all three major averages in positive territory in what has already been a volatile week. Those moves come as the market has seen recent declines. Against this market backdrop, CNBC Pro screened for S & P 500 companies that have significant revenue exposure to Canada. These stocks could also be in for pain if demand is reduced in Ottawa due to boycotts against the U.S. — or if an ensuing trade war tips the U.S.' northern neighbor into a recession. Retail giant Costco is one of the top three names on the list, having almost 14% of revenue exposure to Canada. Shares have slid more than 8% over the past month, but they are up nearly 5% in 2025. In a recent earnings call with analysts, Costco CEO Ron Vachris said "it is difficult to predict the impact of tariffs, but our team remains agile and our goal will be to minimize the impact of related cost increases to our members." He also noted that around one-third of the company's U.S. sales are imported from other countries, with less than half of those being items that come from China, Mexico and Canada. Most analysts are optimistic on Costco over the next several months. Analysts are also mostly bullish on Dayforce , which has the highest Canada revenue exposure on the list at more than 21%. "We … believe that product innovations like Managed Services, Dayforce Wallet, and Flex work are levers that should drive incremental long-term growth," said Siti Panigrahi, a Mizuho analyst, in February. However, shares have considerably lagged the broader market this year. DAY YTD mountain DAY, year-to-date Oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil also found itself on the list, given its nearly 9% of Canada revenue exposure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a bumpy couple years marked by pandemic-era restraint and political polarization, but the American football championship offers an increasingly unequalled viewership too big to pass up. Brands and advertisers are seeking flexible terms as they face uncertainty about how impending U.S. tariffs will affect their businesses. "In this period of uncertainty, we're seeing a significant shift toward more flexible, performance-based advertising models that allow brands to adjust spending quickly if conditions change," said Jonathan Gudai, CEO of Adomni, an artificial intelligence-powered programmatic video-everywhere advertising platform. Buying ads programmatically, or through digital platforms, has taken up an increasingly large part of ad spending, and using AI tools are now often part of the process. Unsteadiness in the economy often mean companies pull back on spending for advertising and marketing. Tariffs aren't the only factor causing advertisers to rethink their budgets, said Kate Scott-Dawkins, global president of business intelligence of GroupM, WPP's media investment group. "We were pretty bullish in our December forecast on [ad spending] growth for the U.S. I think it'll be all those things together that lead to a reduction in our expectations for the year." But traditional TV networks still face lower advertising revenue as consumers shift away from the standard bundle of cable channels, and digital platforms and streaming gobble up a larger share of ad budgets. Some advertising categories such as autos haven't rebounded, however, and companies are unsure what tariffs will mean for spending, the people said. Conversations with chief marketing officers at automakers have been frequent, they added. Trump has announced 25% tariffs on cars and some auto parts not made in the U.S. The tariffs also come weeks before Upfront presentations, when media companies make their annual pitch to advertisers. "Everything I hear about Upfronts and the state of overall trading in the ad world is that it's cautious," said Jonathan Miller, CEO of Integrated Media, which specializes in digital media investments. "There's much more demands for flexibility, and while it's not recessionary, there's a slight holding back...meaning a couple of percentage points of overall growth. Gudai of Adomni added that traditional TV will be one of the areas most vulnerable to ad budget cuts, but brands will also have to broaden their focus when it comes to competing for customers who could face higher prices on goods. "Tariffs potentially create a dual impact — increased costs that may squeeze advertising budgets, but also greater need for targeted advertising as brands compete on factors beyond price," Gudai said. While media executives are open to offering flexibility, they've also been reminding brands that advertising during tough economic times can build brand awareness and help businesses long term, the people said. Some brands are better served not cutting back on ad spending, too, especially if they don't have brick-and-mortar stores or ways outside of marketing to get in front of potential customers. Scott-Dawkins said for some companies it's still worth spending on TV ad spots since it's still considered the most effective way to reach consumers. "In uncertain times, consumers gravitate toward companies that stand for something real.</p>

The stock tumbled a whopping 77.5%, following a 2,230% surge in Newsmax's first two days of trading after debuting on the New York Stock Exchange. At one point, the rally gave the company a market capitalization of nearly $30 billion, surpassing the market cap of legacy media companies such as Warner Bros. Shares of conservative news channel Newsmax plunged more than 70% on Wednesday as its meteoric rise as a new public company proved to be short-lived. Such an offering allows small companies to raise capital without undergoing the full U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission registration process. In this case, it was sold to approximately 30,000 retail investors. GME refers to the meme stock GameStop, which made Wall Street history in 2021 by its speculative trading boom. Newsmax has a small "float," or shares available for trading. The conservative TV news outlet has seen its ratings rise with the election of President Donald Trump and other prominent Republicans, although it still falls behind the dominant Fox News. Overall, Newsmax ranks in the top 20 among cable network average viewership in both prime time and daytime, Nielsen said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta is jumping into the octagon in a big way — and it could help advance the company's push into being more than just a social media powerhouse. A key part of the announcement: Meta will work with UFC to "creatively use their groundbreaking [Meta Ray-Ban] AI glasses in compelling ways at UFC events," according to a press release. Additionally, Meta's text-based platform Threads will become UFC's official social media partner and feature exclusive original content — just a few months after Meta started testing ads on the site . UFC, which holds its fights in an octagon-shaped cage, says it has more than 700 million fans worldwide and more than 300 million social media followers. Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, who started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training during the Covid lockdown, is a longtime MMA fan. This announcement comes as Meta is readying what a Bloomberg News report described as a higher tier of Ray-Ban smart glasses with a built-in screen, which could launch by the end of this year. The price tag on these souped-up frames will be more than $1,000 and could sell for up to $1,400, the Bloomberg report said. It also deepens Zuckerberg's ties to Dana White, the president and CEO of UFC who also is on Meta's board of directors. White, a friend of President Donald Trump , joined the Meta board a few weeks before Trump took office in January. Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses have gained consumer traction, but they're far from achieving mass adoption and being a driver of the company's overall growth. Meta has sold more than 2 million of their smart glasses — a collaboration with Ray-Ban's parent company EssilorLuxottica — since hitting the market in late 2023. The company has been spending billions of dollars on its AI ambitions, both to boost engagement on its apps and make them more appealing to advertisers through improved targeting capabilities. The smart glasses and the Meta AI chatbot, powered by its open-source Llama large language models, are also part of that strategy. Later this year, Meta is expected to release a new version of its Llama LLM that can power so-called AI agents, widely seen as the next phase of the technology. Fellow Club name Salesforce has bet big on AI agents, which can execute various tasks without human intervention. Meta has "all the building blocks to emerge as a leading player in the AI agent era," analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note to clients Tuesday. Bottom line Meta's efforts to push its smart glasses to wider audiences such as the UFC play a significant role in the company's broader ambitions to dominate the wearable tech market, particularly around virtual and augmented reality. Meta's smart glasses are a notable win for Meta's Reality Labs division, which is home to its VR and AR hardware and software pursuits, along with its metaverse initiatives more broadly. At the same time, the glasses are not yet meaningful revenue contributors, compared with its massive social media advertising business. They remain just a small part of our Meta investment case, which centers on the company's dominant ad business along with the successful monetization of its AI initiatives. Of course, we would be thrilled if smart glasses were to become a needle-mover sooner than we expect and to see losses in its Reality Labs metaverse division narrow. We maintain our 2 rating on Meta stock, meaning we would wait to buy on a pullback, and reiterate our price target of $750 per share. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eric Trump says his family was "the most canceled company, probably on Earth."

That was then.

With his dad, President Donald Trump, back in the White House, he sees a new money-making opportunity.

"It actually is what drove us toward cryptocurrency," the president's middle son told CNBC, referring to the Trump family's latest business endeavors. "You realize that cryptocurrency was a lot faster, it was a lot more pragmatic, it was a lot more transparent, it was exponentially cheaper."

In 2022, about two years after the end of President Trump's first term, two subsidiaries of the Trump Organization were convicted by a jury in New York of multiple crimes, including tax fraud, falsifying business records and conspiracy. The guilty verdicts on all 17 charged counts came three weeks after Trump declared his 2024 candidacy.

Last month, the Trump Organization sued Capital One in Florida over allegedly "unjustifiably" closing more than 300 of the company's bank accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. The lawsuit claimed Capitol One was acting on "unsubstantiated, 'woke' beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views."

Prior to Trump's return to the White House, the Trump Organization unveiled a new ethics plan that said it would limit the president's involvement in management decisions and other aspects of the business while he's in office.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump has said tariffs on pharmaceutical products imported into the U.S. were coming soon, but it is not clear if they will be announced at the White House event.

Those potential tariffs would likely drive up U.S. drug prices for patients because even if companies moved to produce those medications domestically, it would take years and cost more than producing medicines abroad, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a note last week.

Predicting the potential impact of tariffs on pharmaceutical companies is difficult since they have vast and complex manufacturing networks with multiple steps, sometimes in different geographies, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said in a note.

But Scala said Eli Lilly , Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie appear better positioned than others to weather tariffs because they have more major manufacturing plants in the U.S. than internationally.

The majority of their sites responsible for producing the active ingredients in drugs are also in the U.S., he added.

Meanwhile, Novartis and Roche "look more at risk" because they have few U.S. plants and a higher share of active ingredient sites that are international, Scala said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump holds an executive order about tariffs increase, flanked by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 13, 2025. When President Donald Trump made it clear that he was serious about implementing dramatic tariffs on top U.S. trading partners, Robin Liss knew her Suvie machines were in trouble. Suvie's products — kitchen gadgets that can whip up dinner in a matter of minutes — are built in a facility in one of China's largest manufacturing hubs and are comprised of more than 500 components sourced throughout the country. Suvie is among the scores of gadget makers scrambling to stay afloat while managing through President Trump's tariff plans and the uncertainty that they bring. The day-to-day changes in rhetoric from the White House has created volatility on Wall Street, where tech stocks just wrapped up their worst quarter since 2022, and a sense of panic for smaller businesses that have less of a cushion to deal with the added costs of operations and potential supply chain bottlenecks. Trump slapped additional tariffs on China earlier this year and is now going much bigger, threatening to strain America's relationships with other longtime trading partners. On Wednesday afternoon, President Trump is expected to deliver remarks at a "Make America Wealthy Again Event" in the Rose Garden, and to announce reciprocal tariffs that follow a bevy of other import duties on goods from China, Canada and Mexico. Those three countries accounted for over $1.3 trillion, or about 40%, of total imports last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. "Folks who thought they had safely moved their supply chain out of China suddenly find themselves wondering if that was a great decision," said Peter Hanbury, a partner at consulting firm Bain. "There's a lot of different options about where you could move things, but you don't want to make that decision if you don't know exactly where the tariff structure is going to land." Liss said her company, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is eating the costs — for now — rather than passing them on to customers. For Suvie, those costs aren't just tied to its appliances, which are about the size of a microwave but offer more than 10 different cooking modes. She also has to deal with higher food prices, as part of Suvie's business is selling meal kits starting at $11.49. The problem for Suvie and other consumer-focused businesses is that just as their costs are skyrocketing due to tariffs and other inflationary pressures, Americans are losing their buying power. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged a "moderation in consumer spending" during the central bank's March policy meeting and said tariffs could put upward pressure on prices. A recent analysis from the Yale Budget Lab estimates that tariffs could cost the average American household an additional $1,600 to $2,000 a year. Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in March that consumers could see imminent price increases on produce items such as strawberries and avocados. The company has 20 U.S. employees and has avoided layoffs thus far, thanks to 80% growth last year that Liss said brought annual revenue to between $20 million and $30 million. If not for recent China tariffs, which hiked the levies she pays on goods to 23% from 3%, Liss said Suvie would be operating at a profit. Liss said that no matter what Trump announces on Wednesday, in what he's calling "Liberation Day," the existing tariffs on goods from China have made it imperative that she find a new country for production. Wherever Suvie goes, the company estimates it can scale up within six months. "That is incredibly fast and almost unheard of," Liss said. Austere, based in Wilsonville, Oregon, south of Portland, makes cable, cleaning, and surge-protected power products. Depending on the item, up to 50% of Ghazarian's components come from China. For her cleaning product solution, which is the most reliant on China, she estimates it would take over a year to move production to Thailand. Ghazarian began stockpiling products last year for the company to get ahead of potential tariffs. The inventory investment has diverted many resources she'd otherwise use for hiring, marketing and scaling. "I'm buying time to figure out my next move," she said. The final step would be hiking prices for consumers, which Ghazarian said many partners she works with are already planning to implement later this week. "This is just devastating to the U.S. economy," said CTA CEO Gary Shapiro. Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary general and global head of policy at the International Chamber of Commerce, said that the cost implications from a 20% to 25% tariff could be severe enough to wipe out a company's entire operating margin, while also complicating it ability to operate abroad. The logistics of moving are unrealistic for many companies. Workers process data cables at a workshop of an electronics company in the economic development zone of Anlong County, Qianxinan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, in Qianxinan, China, on March 12, 2025. Those markets have steadily accrued the best component supply base, labor expertise and cost structures, which are difficult to replicate elsewhere, said Terry Arbaugh, chief commercial officer at SEACOMP, which designs and manufactures electronics such as thermostats and video game devices for customers. Many larger corporations have managed to pivot production to areas like Taiwan, Thailand and India over the years, but have also exhausted much of the existing supply in those smaller markets, Arbaugh said. And making lower cost consumer and medical electronics in volume in the U.S. is not a viable option for many businesses, he added. From there, she'll hop around to other countries in the region for more answers. WATCH: Economists estimate how much revenue tariffs could bring in</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a "Morning Meeting" livestream at 10:20 a.m. Markets are higher on Wednesday, fighting off an ugly open following back-to-back days of gains for the S & P 500. Investors are anticipating President Donald Trump's long-awaited reciprocal tariff announcement at 4 p.m. As we await more details on the tariffs, Jim Cramer said there is "nothing wrong" with investors simply sitting on their hands and avoiding what he called the "bias to action." Jeffries analysts released a positive note on Club name TJX Companies . Analysts said the off-price retailer behind the TJ Maxx chain is well positioned for growth in an environment filled with surplus inventory. Analysts said during a recent store visit, they observed lots of luxury goods up for grabs in both the men's and women's sections. Consumers are always looking for great prices, according to analysts, hence why TJX Companies shares can work. "When you're looking at Macy's closing so many stores, there's really only one place that it goes, and it's these guys," Jim said of TJX, which also operates the Marshalls, HomeGoods and Sierra chains. The ongoing struggles of department stores such as Kohl's has helped boost TJX's market share. On March 11, we added to our position in the company, scooping up 50 shares around $116 apiece. Costco , another Club retailer, also was the subject of encouraging analyst commentary over at TD Cowen. Analysts at the firm met with CFO Gary Millerchip. According to Cowen, some themes from the meeting include seeing more strength in the fresh category as consumers opt to cook at home. Another highlight was consistency in member behavior over the last six months despite consumer confidence being its lowest since 2022. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long TJX, COST .

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If President Donald Trump's long-awaited tariff announcement on Wednesday results in a full-blown trade war with China, Goldman Sachs has some ideas of stocks to avoid. While the full policy is not yet known, Trump said it is intended to be "reciprocal," and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said any levies should be going into effect immediately. Uncertainty around these taxes on trade partners has hampered the stock market. Critics of Trump's plans have raised alarm that affected countries can — and in some cases already have — hit back with retaliatory measures of their own. Given this environment, Goldman Sachs screened for stocks with revenue exposure of at least 25% to the Greater China region, as reported in 2023 fillings. It comes during a pullback for shares, with the artificial intelligence darling's stock down more than 17% in 2025 after two years of monster gains. Following that turmoil, Wall Street expects a rebound ahead for the megacap tech giant and retail investor favorite. The average analyst polled by LSEG has a buy rating and price target suggesting shares can rebound about 58%. While shares have tumbled more than 24% year to date, most analysts have a buy rating and the average price target implies shares can rally nearly 50%, per LSEG. Wynn Resorts, meanwhile, recorded 47% revenue exposure to the Greater China region. Wynn has outperformed its peer, with shares sliding about 4% in 2025. The majority of analysts surveyed by LSEG also have a buy rating, with an average price target implying more than 37% upside.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Switch 2 will hit store shelves on June 5 for $449.99. Nintendo will launch game titles including "Mario Kart World" and "Street Fighter 6" alongside the new hardware. The Switch 2 looks a lot like its predecessor with some differences, including a larger 7.9-inch screen with 1080p resolution which can display gameplay at 120 frames per second. The company's controllers, called Joy-Cons, now attach to the console's screen with magnets, and can work as a mouse when used on a table. One of the biggest changes a new "C" button that brings up a new Nintendo app for chatting with friends called Game Chat. A separate camera accessory will enable users to stream video of themselves playing the game, as well. The improved hardware will allow for bigger worlds and more immersive experiences. For example, 24 racers can compete in Mario Kart World at the same time, Nintendo said. Mario Kart World will cost $80, an increase from $60, which is what Nintendo charged for Switch games. The Switch 2 hardware also got a price increase from its predecessor, which cost $300 at launch.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York City Mayor Eric Adams leaves the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, U.S., February 19, 2025. A judge on Wednesday dismissed the federal criminal case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, nearly two months after the Trump administration controversially sought to drop corruption charges against the Democrat. The DOJ argued the case should be dismissed without prejudice because prosecuting Adams would have interfered with his ability to govern the city and to his ability to cooperate with President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement policies. "Taking a step back from the particulars of this case, DOJ's immigration enforcement rationale is both unprecedented and breathtaking in its sweep," the judge wrote. "DOJ cites no examples, and the Court is unable to find any, of the government dismissing charges against an elected official because doing so would enable the official to facilitate federal policy goals." Ho also wrote that the "DOJ's assertion that it has 'virtually unreviewable' license to dismiss charges on this basis is disturbing in its breadth, implying that public officials may receive special dispensation if they are compliant with the incumbent administration's policy priorities." "That appearance is inevitable, and it counsels in favor of dismissal with prejudice," Ho wrote. The DOJ's "request, if granted, would leave Mayor Adams under the specter of reindictment at essentially any time, and for essentially any reason," Ho noted. "There is no evidence — zero — that they had any improper motives." "This case should have never been brought and I did nothing wrong," Adams said at a news conference. "I'm now happy that our city can finally close the book on this to focus," he said. "I want to thank New Yorkers who stood by my side, who prayed for me, who supported me from day one, that stuck with me while we focused on the work at hand." The DOJ, in a statement to NBC News, said, "This case was an example of political weaponization and a waste of resources." "We are focused on arresting and prosecuting terrorists while returning the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe," the DOJ said. Adams, who is a former New York City police officer, was indicted in September on charges accusing him of a decade-long campaign contribution scheme, bribery and other allegations. The indictment accused Adams of accepting illegal donations to his 2021 mayoral campaign and of accepting free luxury travel as far back as 2016, when he was the Brooklyn borough president. Prosecutors said that a senior official in Turkey's diplomatic establishment facilitated campaign donations to Adams, and also arranged for his and companies to receive free or discounted travel on Turkey's national airline to destinations including France, China, Sri Lanka, India, Hungary and Turkey. Adams in exchange, later pressured the New York City Fire Department to facilitate the opening of Turkey's new consulate building without a fire inspection in time for a visit by Turkey's president, the indictment alleges. After being charged, Adams had curried favor with Trump in what was seen as a bid to have the case dismissed, or to receive a pardon from the Republican. Former acting U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, who resigned in February rather than follow through with an order to dismiss the case, told Attorney General Pam Bondi in a letter that at Adams' lawyers at a meeting with her and top DOJ official Emil Bove "urged what amounted to a quid pro quo" in which the mayor would support Trump immigration enforcement efforts in exchange for dismissal of the case.</p>

Trump was returning to the White House after spending the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida.

Tesla shares rose Wednesday after Politico reported that Elon Musk could leave his post at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, paving the way for the CEO to return his focus on the struggling electric vehicle maker.

The White House later called the report "garbage." Musk also posted on X, "Yeah, fake news," in response to the news.

The stock closed more than 5% higher. At its session lows, it had dropped as much as 6.4% on the back of weaker-than-expected vehicle deliveries for the first quarter.

The report — which cites Trump insiders — noted that, while President Donald Trump is pleased with Musk and the DOGE spending cuts that have been pushed through, the two decided in recent days that the billionaire would soon return to his businesses.

NBC News reported that Trump told the Cabinet that Musk could leave in the coming months. A senior government official told NBC News that Musk would leave at the end of a 130-day stint as a special government employee.</p>

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on auto imports is expected to hit hard for car brands and countries around the world, with economists warning a small landlocked nation in Europe could feel the worst of the impact. Trump is poised to unveil the details of his latest round of sweeping tariffs at around 9 p.m. London time (4 p.m. Trump has already announced a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles, with charges on businesses importing vehicles coming into effect as of Thursday. The White House has said a tax for automobile parts is set to start in May. The president's back-and-forth announcements on tariffs have alarmed global investors, corporate executives and U.S. trading partners in recent months. Germany slammed Trump's 25% auto tariffs as bad news for the U.S., the European Union and global trade. Inga Fechner and Rico Luman, economists at Dutch bank ING, have said that, while Germany is most exposed to Trump's 25% auto tariffs in terms of value, it is Slovakia that may feel the biggest impact. "Germany's car industry is in the eye of the storm and by far most exposed in terms of value, with major players like Volkswagen , BMW , Mercedes , and Porsche likely getting hit by tariffs," ING said in a research note published March 28. "But Slovakia – home to several car plants – is most exposed in terms of total US export volume," they added.</p>

The U.S. on Wednesday reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Taiwan as China extended to a second day its large-scale military exercises off the coast of the democratically governed island.

"In the face of China's intimidation tactics and destabilizing behavior, the United States' enduring commitment to our allies and partner, including Taiwan, continues," Tammy Bruce, U.S. Department of State spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday evening stateside.

China's army, navy and rocket forces on Tuesday launched a joint exercise, with the military describing it as a "stern warning" against forces looking to undermine peace in the Taiwan Strait.

"China's aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to exacerbate tensions and put the region's security and the world's prosperity at risk," the State Department said, adding that the U.S. "opposes unilateral changes to the status quo, including through force or coercion."

Chinese military said it has been practicing assaults on maritime and ground targets and blockade exercises to test the joint operation capabilities of its troops.

On Wednesday, it carried out precision strikes on simulated targets such as ports and energy facilities in the latest exercise code named "Strait Thunder-2025 A," according to PLA's Senior Colonel Shi Yi.

The Defense Ministry in Taipei said it detected 76 aircraft, 15 navy vessels and 4 official ships operating around the island as of 6 a.m. That marked the largest scale of aircraft deployment by PLA since the "Joint Sword-2024B" war exercises last October when Taiwan said China used a record number of military aircrafts.

The armed forces in Taiwan have employed aircraft, navy ships and coastal missile systems in response.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite being positive on Reinsurance Group of America for a bit, JPMorgan finally sees the right moment for investors to jump in as the sector faces a deteriorating economic backdrop. Bhullar's refreshed target suggests shares can rally 19.5% above Tuesday's closing level. "However, we feel that EPS projections are more reasonable." Bhullar cited an individual life reinsurance transaction with primary insurer Equitable Holdings as a key driver of earnings per share projections becoming more rational. That transaction led Bhullar to increase estimates for earnings per share. Shares have struggled since early February, when the company gave what Bhullar described as a "weak" earnings report for the fourth quarter. Elsewhere, Bhullar said the Missouri-based company's business mix makes it more defensive than most life insurers in uncertain macro environments. JPMorgan downgraded life insurance stocks as a whole to neutral from positive, citing a more balanced risk-reward ratio as valuations recover and the macro environment weakens. Despite JPMorgan's upgrade, Reinsurance Group of America shares ticked 0.7% lower before the bell on Wednesday.
