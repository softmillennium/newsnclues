                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As global economic reforms, including pro-crypto policies and institutional adoption, ignite investor confidence, the cryptocurrency market is offering opportunities to smart investors. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate, commanding over 61% of the market's $3.05 trillion capitalisation as of April 2025, according to CoinGecko. However, some altcoins — cryptocurrencies other than BTC — are stealing the spotlight with their innovative use cases and potential for explosive growth. Economic reforms, such as the US approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 and easing regulatory hurdles for blockchain projects, have created a fertile ground for altcoins. One of the best altcoins to buy now is Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), which merges AI and meme culture for long-term potential. Altcoins offer diverse applications, from DeFi to scalable blockchains, making them attractive for investors seeking high returns. According to DeFiLlama, DeFi protocols have already secured over $100 billion in total value locked (TVL) at the time of writing, with Ethereum and Solana leading the charge. These factors create a market ripe for altcoins with strong fundamentals, positioning 2025 as a pivotal year for crypto growth. When selecting the best altcoins to buy, investors should prioritise utility, adoption, and community strength. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), built on Ethereum, combines artificial intelligence with memecoin appeal, offering a unique value proposition. Its clear roadmap and smart contracts audited by SolidProof put the community first, allocating 15% of its 8.88 billion token supply to supporters and 20% to staking incentives, encouraging long-term engagement. With over $3.38 million raised in its presale at press time per its official site, $DAGZ is capitalising on the growing demand for AI-driven crypto projects. Ethereum is also one of the best altcoins to buy now, securing over $100 billion in DeFi TVL, per DeFiLlama. Its transition to proof-of-stake slashed energy consumption by over 95%, making it more eco-friendly and scalable. The Pectra upgrade will enhance wallet usability and staking efficiency, potentially driving ETH's price from $1,800 at the time of writing to new highs. Vitalik Buterin noted that Ethereum's focus on layer-2 solutions could process 100,000 transactions per second, cementing its long-term dominance. Solana's ability to handle 4,000 transactions per second at sub-cent costs has made it a favourite for developers and investors. Chainlink's decentralised oracle network connects smart contracts to real-world data, securing over $9.8 billion in value, per CoinMarketCap. A McKinsey report estimates the RWA tokenisation market, where Chainlink excels, could hit $2 trillion by 2030. The crypto market is evolving, with altcoins outperforming BTC in percentage gains. Although altcoins can carry higher volatility than BTC, with some dropping 90% in bear markets, top picks like $DAGZ, Ethereum, and Solana offer balanced risk-reward profiles due to their utility and adoption. From Ethereum's DeFi dominance to Solana's scalability and Chainlink's oracle prowess, the best altcoins to buy now combine innovation with market traction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As reported, the US dollar index declined 7% year-to-date, one of its worst openings in recent history. Venture capitalist Tim Draper indicated that Bitcoin may serve as an insurance policy against the failure of fiat currencies. He thinks the digital currency will keep appreciating in value relative to the US dollar, particularly as international confidence in fiat currencies falters. Bitcoin might be worth an infinite amount of USD. After starting 1:1 with USD, it ended the war at over 10 million to 1. People lost faith and scrambled to trade their cash in for USD. Draper likened Bitcoin's present surge to a change in monetary behavior. While gold has played that function previously, Draper stated that Bitcoin is starting to fill the position because of its digital format and convenience. Initially, it was pegged at a 1:1 ratio with the US dollar. Draper explained this illustrates how quickly a currency can disintegrate when trust is lost. He cautioned that something like that can happen again if individuals, businesses, and even governments lose faith in the stability of the current system. Gold will usually be the first safe haven when there are financial pressures, but Draper believes that it is no longer number one. He noted that gold has issues such as huge storage fees and physical movement. Bitcoin, however, is a purely online existence and can easily transfer quickly across borders. He also stated that Bitcoin possesses special strengths—like limited supply and autonomy from central banks—that make it more attractive than conventional assets. Draper claims that even some governments are seeking to find out if they should keep Bitcoin reserves. That marks a shifting sentiment towards how cryptocurrencies are perceived, not only among private investors but also public institutions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The current ETH price setup versus Bitcoin closely mirrors 2019, with an oversold RSI and prolonged weakness below key moving averages after a multiyear decline. The current ETH/BTC setup resembles 2019, with both periods marked by oversold relative strength index (RSI), long stretches below key moving averages, and multiyear declines. As of 2025, the pair is down over 80% from its 2021 peak, weighed by skepticism over Ethereum's switch to proof-of-stake (PoS), rising competition, and Bitcoin's growing dominance as an institutional asset. In response to the growing concerns, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed new architecture and protocol-wide standards to make Ethereum simpler, faster, and as maintainable as Bitcoin within five years. One analyst called Buterin's proposal “the most bullish thing for ETH.” The bullish hopes come as ETH/BTC attempts to break free from its multi-year “bearish parabola.” This resistance curve has been instrumental in limiting the pair's upside attempts since December 2021 but showed signs of exhaustion as of May 3. “We might see an end of this bearish parabola,” wrote chartist Jimie. Skeptics like Bitcoin's proof-of-work pioneer, Adam Back, argue that Buterin is overlooking deeper design flaws while proposing to simplify Ethereum in the coming years. Back criticizes Ethereum's account-based system, saying it adds unnecessary complexity compared to Bitcoin's simpler UTXO (unspent transaction output) model. “At this point, just flush ETH before it hits zero and buy Bitcoin,” he wrote, suggesting no upgrade can fix what he views as Ethereum's flawed foundation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Freight Technologies (FRGT), a $4.8 million market cap logistics tech firm focused on cross-border trade between the U.S. and Mexico, has entered an agreement to buy up to $20 million in the Official Trump Token (TRUMP) to build out its crypto treasury. The company said it secured the funding through a convertible note facility with an institutional investor, with an initial $1 million tranche already committed. The capital will be used solely to acquire TRUMP tokens, making it one of the first publicly listed companies to do so. The decision follows a separate investment in AI-linked FET tokens currently valued at $8 million, which the company says supports AI tools used across its logistics platforms. Buying digital assets for publicly traded companies isn't a new strategy. Michael Saylor championed it with a bitcoin strategy, and others, such as Semler Scientific (SMLR), followed through. Most recently, Cantor (CEP) is making a splash with huge dry powder to do the same. The trend is also picking up in Japan, where hotel firm Metaplanet has recently hit 5,000 BTC on its balance sheet and issued $25 million in bonds to fund additional purchases. Smaller firms, including Value Creation, Remixpoint, NEXON, Anap Holdings, and WEMADE are also accumulating the cryptocurrency. Just recently, Trump said he will hold a private dinner with top token holders, drawing outcry from Democratic lawmakers, who cited the president's involvement with the token as potential grounds for impeachment. For Freight, whose stock price plunged nearly 90% in the last 12 months and is heavily tied to cross-border trading, it seems this might be the best way to keep share prices afloat. Freight Technologies' product lineup includes a suite of applications, ranging from cross-border freight booking to transportation management, all aimed at modernizing the flow of goods in North America. Last month, DWF Labs invested $25 million in the decentralized finance protocol backed by Trump and his family, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), as it moved to establish a physical presence in the U.S. The investment gives DWF Labs a governance stake in the project, which has been accumulating various cryptocurrencies and is set to soon launch a stablecoin backed by short-term U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents, called USD1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Bitcoin($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) get most of the headlines, investors often look for “hidden gems” among the thousands of other cryptocurrencies known as altcoins. Finding these hidden gems, often trading at low prices, before they potentially “boom” in value, can lead to massive returns. But how do you find these potentially undervalued projects?We will go through what makes an altcoin promising, and highlights a few interesting options to watch, including the most promising AI-powered newcomer Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), along with three more potential winners in the 2025 crypto market. Based on these factors, here are some interesting altcoins that might be considered hidden gems or have strong potential worth watching in May 2025. Its initial low price point makes it a classic “penny” crypto opportunity, but what truly sets it apart is its unique combination of Artificial Intelligence utility and viral meme coin appeal. This technology has huge potential uses in areas like finance, healthcare, and advertising. As data privacy becomes increasingly important, blockchain solutions like Arpa Chain offering secure computation could see growing demand, making ARPA a potential hidden gem focused on utility. Flare (FLR) is a Layer 1 blockchain aiming to solve the problem of getting reliable, real-world data onto blockchains and enabling different chains to interact securely. It acts as a “blockchain for data,” using two core technologies: the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) to provide decentralized and accurate price feeds (essential for DeFi), and the State Connector to securely fetch information from other blockchains or even traditional web sources. A key feature is its FA ssets system, which aims to allow non-smart contract assets like Bitcoin, XRP, or Dogecoin to be used on Flare in DeFi applications. Because Flare is compatible with Ethereum tools, developers can easily build on it.By focusing on the critical infrastructure needed for trustworthy data and interoperability, Flare offers unique technology that could become increasingly valuable. It uses the Move programming language (known for safety) and a unique way of handling data based on “objects.” This allows Sui to process many transactions simultaneously, potentially leading to much higher speeds and lower fees than older blockchains. Sui targets high-performance applications like advanced DeFi protocols,complex blockchain games, and large-scale commerce applications.The SUI token is used for gas fees, staking to secure the network, and governance. As a project pushing the boundaries of blockchain performance, Sui represents a technology-focused hidden gem potential if it successfully attracts developers and users away from competing networks. It's about finding value and innovation before the wider market does. However, projects that cleverly combine multiple strong elements often stand out the most. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) fits this description perfectly, blending the powerful AI narrative with meme coin virality, real utility plans, staking rewards, and a low entry point post-presale. It represents a uniquely promising venture for investors seeking high-growth potential in May 2025. Whether exploring secure computation networks, data oracles, faster blockchains, or AI-powered meme coins, remember that uncovering these gems requires deep research, patience, and a healthy respect for the risks involved. The biggest risks are high volatility (wild price swings), low liquidity (making it hard to sell), potential for scams or project abandonment (“rug pulls”), and the simple fact that most new projects fail to gain adoption. This unique combination gives a high growth potential compared to many other altcoins. Finding promising projects like Dawgz AI before such a potential boom is the goal for many investors seeking exponential returns.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our team is working diligently to resolve the issue. This article explores the relationship between digital currencies and the banking sector, tracing their journey from fringe concepts to potential mainstream integration. Initially met with skepticism and often dismissed by the established financial industry, cryptocurrencies represented a fundamental challenge to the centralized control banks held over money creation and transfer. Their peer-to-peer nature promised faster, cheaper transactions, particularly across borders, bypassing traditional intermediaries. The banking sector's initial reaction was predominantly one of caution. Concerns revolved around the volatility of cryptocurrencies, their potential use in illicit activities, regulatory uncertainty, and the perceived threat to financial stability. However, as the underlying blockchain technology demonstrated potential beyond just cryptocurrencies, for instance, in streamlining settlements or improving transparency, banks began to shift from outright dismissal to cautious exploration. Recognizing growing client interest and the potential for new revenue streams, some major banks have started integrating digital assets into their services. This includes offering cryptocurrency custody solutions, facilitating trading for institutional clients, and exploring the use of stablecoins (digital currencies pegged to traditional assets) for payments. This move aims to meet customer demand and improve payment efficiency for certain types of transactions. Parallel to the development of private cryptocurrencies, central banks globally are actively researching and developing their own digital currencies, known as CBDCs. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are issued and backed by a country's central bank, representing a digital form of fiat currency. Motivations for exploring CBDCs vary, including improving payment systems, promoting financial inclusion, and addressing the decline in physical cash use and the rise of private digital currencies. Extensive research and pilot programs are underway globally, often discussed in publications such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) reports, highlighting the seriousness with which monetary authorities are considering this development. Integrating digital currencies and blockchain technology will significantly transform various banking aspects. Navigating the complexities of modern finance is crucial for both businesses and individuals. While digital currencies represent one path of innovation, others continue to invest in commodities as a strategy for diversification and value preservation. These new tools could fundamentally alter how financial services are delivered and consumed. Security risks, including hacking and theft from exchanges or digital wallets, are persistent concerns. Scalability issues for some blockchain networks and the environmental impact of specific consensus mechanisms, such as Bitcoin's proof-of-work, also require ongoing attention and solutions. Furthermore, ensuring interoperability between new digital currency systems and existing financial infrastructure is crucial for seamless integration. The future relationship between digital currencies and traditional banking is still unfolding. CBDCs could coexist alongside private cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, each serving different purposes within the broader financial ecosystem. While regulation, security, and scalability challenges persist, the potential for transformation is undeniable. Banks are no longer just observers; many are active participants, exploring how to leverage these new technologies to enhance services, improve efficiency, and remain competitive in an increasingly digital world. The financial ecosystem is evolving, and digital currencies, in their various forms, are set to play a significant role in shaping its future.

Keep reading to find out more about the upcoming rally in ‘digital gold.' We'll also suggest the best altcoins you can add to your portfolio for massive gains. Ever since Trump announced the formation of a US Bitcoin reserve, there has been a race among countries to hoard the asset. During April 21-25, more than $3B were invested in Bitcoin ETFs. Other countries like Ukraine, Bhutan, and El Salvador also own a sizable chunk of $BTC. Institutions like Strategy own around 538,200 Bitcoins, buying more than 4.5 times the amount of $BTC being mined every day. Analysts believe that such heavy institutional buying can propel Bitcoin's price to a whopping $1M. If you're looking to make the most of Bitcoin's bull run but without burning a hole in your pocket, here are three tokens worth buying. If you want to follow the footprints of large institutions and ride Bitcoin's upcoming rally, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is possibly the best crypto to buy now. It's unlike any other Bitcoin-themed meme coin on the market, seeing as it's the only one that gives $BTC in its airdrops to its token holder. Essentially, every time Bitcoin crosses a brand-new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K, $BTCBULL holders who have stored their cryptos in Best Wallet will receive free (and real) $BTC. Another reason we've predicted $BTCBULL to jump nearly 400% by the end of 2026 is its deflationary mechanism. If you're a Bitcoin maximalist, this is the best time to buy into the BTC Bull Token presale, which has raised over $5.2M so far. That's because each token is available for a low price of $0.002495. However, with education in the industry running thin, you'd need a token like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) that can point you towards the best cryptos to invest in. However, we'd like you to think of $MIND as your own crypto investment buddy. This autonomous AI system, which is launching on May 10, by the way, will interact with crypto influencers online, read their biases and insights into crypto, and finally use its hive-mind intelligence to find out which tokens are in a pole position to skyrocket on account of the attention they've been getting from the market participants. What's more, MIND of Pepe will also be launching its own tokens as it develops further. Access to these, too, will be reserved for $MIND holders. If you want to benefit from $MIND's revolutionary powers, become an early investor in the project. It's currently in presale ($8.6M+ raised), and each token is selling for just $0.0037515. Check out our guide on how to buy MIND of Pepe for more info. Even though $TURBO launched in 2023, it didn't gain much attention until June 2024. Now, however, it's one of the top trending cryptos. Similar to the best meme coins, $TURBO, too, runs on community hype and virality. It also means that your investments in crypto aren't guaranteed to fetch you the desired returns if market conditions aren't favorable.

According to KookCapitalLLC on Twitter, Hayden Davis and the Catholic Church have launched a collaborative NFT rug, creating significant buzz in the crypto trading community. This partnership may drive short-term trading volume on associated NFT marketplaces, as rapid price swings and speculative interest typically follow such high-profile collaborations (Source: KookCapitalLLC, Twitter, May 3, 2025). Traders should monitor liquidity and volatility in related NFT collections, as similar events have historically triggered both pump-and-dump patterns and temporary surges in floor prices.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is urging a rethink of the network's increasingly complex architecture. Vitalik critiques Ethereum's sophisticated features that, in hindsight, offer limited practical value. Buterin proposed a “3-slot finality” model, which would simplify consensus by removing components like sync committees and epoch structures. He also called for standardization across the protocol to reduce toolchain complexity and increase accessibility. This call for simplification comes soon after Ethereum Foundation's recent structural overhaul. On April 28, the foundation appointed Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak as co-executive directors, separating operational leadership from long-term vision strategy. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $1,828, with no loss or gain in the past day. Popular crypto analyst Cas Abbe highlighted that ETH's monthly RSI has just retested a rare, multi-cycle support level. Historically, this has resulted in explosive moves each prior retest led to a 340%+ surge. “If history repeats, ETH could breach $8,000 by Q4 2025,” Abbe explained on X. If the indicator moves further upwards, it may indicate bullish momentum is building. Bollinger Bands are tightening with price approaching the upper band, indicating potential for an upcoming breakout. As ETH trades 62% below its all-time high of $4,891, analysts on X are suggesting investors to buy the dip amid bullish predictions. CryptoGoos described ETH as “historically undervalued,” with on-chain metrics pointing to long-term accumulation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This slowness raises an uncomfortable question: is technological disruption really perceived as a priority by European leaders? The burden of administrative requirements kills many initiatives in their infancy. “Startups, in particular, do not want to fight in the legal jungle,” notes Volker Nürnberg, a professor at Munich Technical University. Award-winning projects like electronic prescriptions have never been deployed. And the GDPR, although based on laudable principles, becomes yet another barrier. These regulations may cause Germany to lose its place in the global development of technology. We hope this strictness will become a competitive advantage. But to date, it mainly acts as a brake. Healthcare, on its side, remains a highly regulated field, not prone to boldness. Yet blockchain could transform daily life there: secure data sharing, integrity of clinical trials, drug traceability. Without a common framework, these promises remain empty words. Worse: each country imposes its own standards, making cross-border projects nearly impossible. A technology meant to connect data is, in Europe, hindered by administrative borders. Too often confused with crypto speculation, it inspires more mistrust than enthusiasm. “Some officials still see blockchain as a digital casino,” an expert remarks ironically. However, in the healthcare sector, use cases are solid. Immutable patient records, secure teleconsultations, automated reimbursements via smart contracts… The ground is fertile. Fear of the unknown, reinforced by crypto scandals, blocks institutional curiosity. Even the potential environmental benefits of some blockchains fail to convince. The perceived energy consumption of blockchains deters decision-makers, especially where sustainability is a priority. It is no coincidence that South Korea and the United States are pulling ahead. Without this, blockchain in healthcare will be just one more missed appointment. Maximize your Cointribune experience with our "Read to Earn" program!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cannes, the glitzy capital of film and French Riviera flair, is about to take on a new role: global crypto tourism hub. The city announced plans to roll out crypto payment infrastructure across 90% of local merchants, thanks to a partnership with Web3 payment firm Lunu Pay. What makes this different from previous ‘crypto city' experiments – like El Salvador's Bitcoin Beach or Miami's Bitcoin-branded city campaigns – is the level of coordination. Cannes isn't just slapping QR codes in cafes. The municipality is actively training shop owners and laying down Web3 infrastructure. That's a big deal, because it makes crypto payments truly accessible to regular people – not just hardcore HODLers. And when crypto becomes this real, certain projects stand to benefit more than others. As crypto payments go mainstream in cities like Cannes, one thing becomes clear: the wallet you use – and the token behind it – matters more than ever. Priced at $0.02495 and with nearly $12M already raised in its presale, $BEST isn't just another utility token. It's the backbone of a radically modern, user-first crypto experience. We're talking reduced transaction fees, early access to hot new crypto projects, and even bonus rewards through Best Wallet's iGaming partnerships. $BEST holders also gain access to ‘Upcoming Tokens,' a built-in launchpad tool. It allows users to discover, vet, and invest in new tokens directly in-app – without hopping through shady mirror sites. Built for the next generation of fans and digital platforms, $SUBBD is reimagining the $85B content subscription industry by blending AI, crypto, and premium fan experiences into one seamless ecosystem. Currently priced at $0.0553, with over $300K raised in presale, $SUBBD powers an AI-driven content platform where users can subscribe, tip, and interact with creators using fast, low-fee crypto payments. The platform offers tools like AI-generated photos and videos (approved by the original creators), a chatbot assistant for creators, and customizable staking perks. Holding and staking $SUBBD unlocks exclusive content, early access to drops, and platform bonuses, all while earning up to 20% APY during presale. In a world of flashy new tokens and headline-chasing meme coins, Litecoin ($LTC) continues to quietly do what it does best – enable fast, cheap, and reliable payments. Launched in 2011, it's one of the oldest cryptocurrencies still thriving, and for good reason. It processes transactions four times faster than Bitcoin and with much lower fees, making it ideal for everyday purchases, especially in retail-heavy environments like Cannes. As crypto adoption spreads through tourism and local commerce, $LTC may just be the quiet workhorse powering your next seaside espresso. After regulatory setbacks paused Telegram's direct involvement, the project was revived by an independent community and is now gaining serious momentum. What sets $TON apart is its deep integration with Telegram's massive user base of over 900M people. Through this partnership, users can send $TON directly in chats, use built-in wallets, and access decentralized services without ever leaving the app. As cities like Cannes build crypto into everyday life, Toncoin's seamless messaging-app integration could be a game changer. Tourists and locals alike could one day send crypto payments with the same ease as sending a text – something $TON is already making possible. As Cannes paves the way for real-world crypto adoption, a new era of usability is taking shape. Whether it's paying for coffee with $LTC, unlocking premium features with $SUBBD, securing your assets and the best crypto presales through $BEST, or sending instant payments through Telegram with $TON, these projects are built for the kind of everyday crypto usage that's finally becoming a reality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dive into the Thinkagents.ai protocol, an open-source framework uniting 70+ firms to decentralize AI with autonomous, modular, and secure agents. More than seventy organizations, including Yuga Labs and Magic Eden, have allied for AI decentralization. These supporters endorse the Thinkagents.ai protocol as a fresh, open-source framework for AI autonomy. It enables AI agents to function independently across diverse blockchain networks without central oversight. This collaborative initiative lays the groundwork for democratized, trustless AI development and governance. Traditional centralized AI platforms often restrict data ownership and limit platform capabilities. The protocol reduces deployment costs and complexity by unifying developers under common rules. This framework encourages collaboration over siloed efforts, streamlining innovation in decentralized AI. By adopting the Think Agent Standard, builders can avoid fragmentation and redundant system designs. In turn, AI can be deployed more efficiently with consistent interoperability and reduced development overhead. This event united nine infrastructure providers and attracted thirty thousand live viewers. Its success proved that the protocol can support real-time, cross-network agent cooperation. Developers lacking deep infrastructure or big budgets now gain an accessible entry point for projects. The demonstration showcased seamless agent deployment and management across multiple blockchain environments. This proof-of-concept highlights the protocol's potential to enable broad collaboration in AI development. The protocol supports composability, allowing developers to reuse and combine components instead of rebuilding systems. Any AI agent built on the Thinkagents.ai protocol can now manage wallets, execute contracts, and cross chains. Modules can be assembled flexibly for diverse use cases without starting from scratch. Companies like Alchemy and Venice.ai have already integrated this modular system into practical applications. Their involvement accelerates decentralized AI's shift from theoretical concept to operational reality. The Soul layer defines a unique digital identity for each agent instance. Users maintain full control of their agent's data and activity with digital sovereignty. It enables users to train, personalize, and deploy their own AI agent. Unlike centralized platforms, SOULS preserves privacy by keeping data under user management. AI agents like SOULS offer tailored digital experiences through direct user interaction. Their widespread adoption relies on transparent design, robust security measures, and community trust. Over time, user feedback drives protocol refinement and improved integration across projects. Owning their Think system lets users control what information they share and with whom. The method differs from services like 23andMe that monetize personal data without consent. Under traditional models, bankrupt platforms often sell user information to unknown third parties. By empowering AI agents on user-defined terms, decentralized protocols block such misuse.</p>

World, a start-up backed by Sam Altman, has launched in the United States with the goal of verifying your humanity. Spend enough time in San Francisco, peering into the cyberpunk future, and you may find that weird things start seeming normal. A start-up trying to resurrect the woolly mammoth? Summoning a godlike artificial intelligence that could wipe out humanity? You may even find yourself, as I did on Wednesday night, standing in a crowded room in the Marina district, gazing into a glowing white sphere known as the Orb, having your eyeballs scanned in exchange for cryptocurrency and something called a World ID. The event was hosted by World, a San Francisco start-up co-founded by Sam Altman of OpenAI that has come up with one of the more ambitious (or creepy, depending on your view) tech projects in recent memory. The company's basic pitch is this: The internet is about to be overrun with swarms of realistic A.I. bots that will make it nearly impossible to tell whether we're interacting with real humans on social networks, dating sites, gaming platforms and other online spaces.
