                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett is presided over the company's annual meeting. Track all of the day's news and analysis here. Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting ended Saturday with big news: Warren Buffett said he planned to ask the board to make Greg Abel the company's CEO by year-end. Abel, Berkshire's vice chairman of non-insurance operations, was at Buffett's side on stage when Buffett broke the news, and didn't know these remarks were coming, according to "The Oracle of Omaha." The gathering, known as "Woodstock for Capitalists," is a chance for Buffett to share his views on the markets, investing and life, in general. This year, Buffett was asked about global trade policy and the tariffs that President Donald Trump has proposed as well as the market's recent volatility. "Trade should not be a weapon," Buffett said. Read a full account of the day's events below. Arkansas Rep. French Hill expressed glee following Buffett's announcement about having Greg Abel become the new CEO, which came at the end of Saturday's shareholder meeting. Well, now he's tap dancing out of work. he told CNBC'S Becky Quick and Michael Santoli. "When I got out of government in 1993 and went back to the private sector in investment management, it was Warren Buffett who was my role model – a man I've never personally met, but I've admired all these years," Hill added. Ron Olson, a Berkshire board member, expressed optimism around Greg Abel taking over as CEO. We've known if for a long time," said Olson, who is stepping down from his role because he's no longer eligible, to CNBC'S Becky Quick and Michael Santoli after the meeting. Buffett has "lived a life full of surprises. Very few of his decisions have been anything but sensational. I am very anxious to see Warren become the Charlie Munger for Greg Abel." Even as he signals the end of an era, Buffett's humor remains intact. Buffett announced he will ask Berkshire's board to make Abel CEO of the conglomerate by year-end, leading to a standing ovation from the crowd and Abel. Soon after, Buffett joked: "The enthusiasm shown by that response can be interpreted two ways." Other than his two children, the other board members — including Abel — had not been informed of this decision before Saturday's meeting, Buffett said. "I think they'll be unanimously in favor of it. I would still hang around and conceivably be useful in a few cases, but the final word would be what Greg said in operations, in capital deployment, whatever it might be." It will get given away gradually," he said, to resounding applause and cheers. Buffett continued: "I would add this: The decision to keep every share is an economic decision, because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg's management than mine." His comments were met with a long standing ovation. When asked about cost-cutting and so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Buffett said that controlling the government budget deficit is a problem that is "never fully solved." We don't know whether that means two years or 20 years, because there's never been a country like the United States, but this is something that can't go on forever," Buffett said. While Buffett did not discuss DOGE specifically, he did say it would be a difficult but important job to cut the budget deficit. "Capitalism in the United States has succeeded like nothing you've ever seen. It's a combination of this magnificent cathedral, which has produced an economy like nothing the world's ever seen, and then it's got this massive casino attached," he said. "In the cathedrals, they basically are designing things that will be producing goods and services for 300-and-some million people like it's never been done before in history." Although the temptation to focus all of one's time and energy at this metaphorical casino is quite high, Buffett cautioned that keeping the balance was of utmost importance. "At the casino, everybody's having a good time and there's lots of money changing hands and everything, but you've got to make sure the cathedral gets fed, too," he said. It dispenses rewards in what seems like a terribly capricious manner." Abel, who serves as the chair of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, said that wildfire risk is "not going away" in the United States. Berkshire's approach to managing those risks include maintenance of the infrastructure and powering down when bad weather or a spreading fire approaches, Abel said. He also said that Berkshire can't serve as an "insurer of last resort" in wildfire disasters. That means wildfire damage can cause losses for the insurance business and, if a fire happens in a region where Berkshire's utility operates, create legal liability concerns. "We are not in the business of trying to solve unsolvable problems," he added. The company's first-quarter report reflected a $1.1 billion loss related to Southern California wildfires. Berkshire's special book celebrating six decades under Buffett has sold out, the CEO announced. Buffett said during the second half of his question-and-answer session that he received a note saying all copies of the 60th anniversary book have been purchased. Berkshire printed around 8,000 in total, 3,000 more than originally planned. Berkshire is auctioning off some signed copies for charity. Buffett reassured his shareholders that Berkshire wouldn't put their money to use for things that the company thought was "stupid." If they did, the shareholders "ought to get rid of us," he added. When asked about his views on capital allocation, particularly into new businesses, Abel said that Berkshire had a strong set of values to follow, including maintaining its current reputation. "We have values that we as a management team — as defined by Warren and Charlie and everybody associated with the business — they had great values that really set Berkshire up well for the future," he responded. That will always be a priority, and something that we'll ensure is in the forefront of our minds," he said. Other important values he would stick by include keeping Berkshire's balance sheet strong. Abel said that the company's current "significant set of cash" was an "enormous" and "strategic asset" that he could deploy in the future, one that allows Berkshire to not depend on any banks or other entities for its success. Properly understanding and managing risk is also important, he said, alongside owning a "great set of operating companies that do produce significant cash flows." Buffett said Berkshire halted its buyback program this year partly because of the 1% excise tax on stock repurchases, which was introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Berkshire shares also have significantly outperformed the S&P 500, rising nearly 19% this year. Buffett explained why he thinks that the balance sheet is a good starting point when deciding whether to invest in a company. And Wall Street really doesn't pay much attention to balance sheets, but I like to look at the balance sheets over an eight- or 10-year period before I even look at the income account because there's certain things that are harder to hide or play games with on the balance sheet," Buffett said. "Neither one gives you the total answer," he added. Before tackling the first question, he made a quick movie recommendation: "Becoming Katherine Graham." Despite unique travel challenges for foreign shareholders this year, it was a full house at CHI Health Center in Omaha on Saturday morning as Buffett spoke. Multiple international investors told CNBC they were staying home this year given concerns about traveling to the U.S. in the current political climate. These decisions come after President Donald Trump's plan for contentious tariffs has quickly raised fears of a global trade war. Buffett said during Saturday's gathering that Berkshire's shareholder event held a day prior saw record high attendance of nearly 20,000. The Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting has taken a break for lunch. "What has happened in the last 30, 45 days … is really nothing," said Buffett, noting Berkshire Hathaway's stock was cut in half three times during his 60 years running the company. Given that, he said the U.S. stock market's recent action should not be considered a "huge" move. "This has not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort," Buffett said. The S&P 500 nearly closed in a 20% bear market at its low in April before President Donald Trump paused his most punitive tariffs on countries, causing a rebound that's brought the benchmark back more than halfway. At last check the S&P 500 was down about 8% from its record high. When giving advice to a young investor, Buffett said that finding a way to be fulfilled and happy helps people have long lives. "I think a happy person lives longer than somebody that's doing some things they don't really admire much in life," Buffett said. Jain said that Berkshire Hathaway had not been immune to disruptions from direct competition in the form of private equity firms in recent years. "There's no question the private equity firms have come into the space, and we are no longer competitive in this space. We used to do a fair amount in this space, but in the last three, four years, I don't think we've done a single deal," he said. That being said, Jain added that the private equity strategy of using higher leverage and more aggressive investment strategies works while the "economy is doing great and credit spreads are low." "However, there is always the danger that at some point the regulators might get cranky and say, 'You're taking too much risk on behalf of your policyholders,' and that could end in tears," Jain added. Buffett added that Berkshire was unique from its competitors because he takes a more personal stake in his investments. "They probably have a somewhat different fiduciary feeling about what they're doing, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't work and if it doesn't work, they go on to other things," Buffett said. "If what we do here at Berkshire doesn't work, I spend the end of my life regretting what I've created so it's just a whole different personal equation. There's no property casualty company that can basically replicate Berkshire." When asked about currency considerations and potential hedges for Berkshire, Buffett said he was concerned about the tendency of governments to make decisions that lead to weaker currencies. "Fiscal policy is what scares me in the United States, because it's made the way it is and all the motivations are to doing a lot of things that can cause trouble with money. "The value of currency is a scary thing, and we don't have any great system for beating that," he added. "Paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country's short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency," Buffett wrote in that report. Jain, Berkshire's chairman of insurance operations, lauded Geico CEO Todd Combs' efforts to improve the insurance giant's operations — which include steep job cuts. Jain said that Combs has cut Geico's workforce to about 20,000 from around 50,000 when he took over. In the past five or six years, "we have made rapid strides, and telematics, which used to be a source of competitive disadvantage to us, is no longer so," said Jain. Jain added that the labor force reductions amount to roughly $2 billion a year in saved costs. Buffett offered some of his wisdom for life beyond the investing world that he's become known for over the decades. Buffett cautioned that employees can take on the habits of their colleagues, so it's important to be discerning about where one works. He recommended that while people should be "careful" about who they are employed by, it's less important to fret about factors like starting salaries. "I mentioned that we started out as an agricultural society. We started out as a society with high promises, and we didn't deliver on them very well," he said. "If I were being born today, I would just keep negotiating in the womb until they said you can be in the United States." Buffett revealed that Berkshire almost put $10 billion at work recently, but ultimately didn't pull the trigger. "I mean, those decisions are not tough to make when something is offered that makes sense to us and that we understand and offers good value." However, Buffett noted that the one problem with the investment business is that things don't come along in an orderly fashion. But Jain said that Berkshire is taking a more hesitant approach when it comes to any lofty new technological claims. "I certainly also feel that people end up spending enormous amounts of money trying to chase the next new fashionable thing," he said. However, Jain added that Berkshire wouldn't hesitate to invest once the right opportunity does arise. "Right now, the individual insurance operations do dabble in AI and try and figure out what is the best way to exploit it, but we have not yet made a conscious big-time effort in terms of pouring a lot of money into this opportunity," he added. When discussing Berkshire's cash pile, Buffett joked about the theory that he is planning to hold on to that until the leadership transition occurs, which would let his successor Greg Abel make a big move. "I wouldn't do anything nearly so noble as to withhold investing myself just so that Greg could look good later on," Buffett quipped, drawing laughs from Abel and others in attendance. Buffett said Berkshire will find places to put its record levels of cash to work, likely within the next half decade. "It's very unlikely to happen tomorrow," Buffett said in response to a question about the reasoning for Berkshire's cash hoard. Buffett also said that "the one problem with the investment business is that things don't come along in an orderly fashion." He then cracked a lighthearted joke about longtime business partner and friend Charlie Munger, who died in 2023 at the age of 99. In response to a question about whether Buffett will stop investing in Japan stocks if the Bank of Japan were to raise interest rates in the future, the Oracle of Omaha said he won't be selling shares. "In the next 50 years ... we won't give a thought to selling those," Buffett said, adding that Japan's record has been "extraordinary" and pointing out that Apple, American Express and Coca-Cola, for example, have been doing well in the country. He also said he's been treated "extremely well" by the five Japanese companies he has invested in – namely, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Itochu and Marubeni – and said that building a relationship with the companies is "super long term." They have different approaches to business – that's true around the world – and we don't have any intention in any way of trying to change what they do because they do it very successfully," Buffett said. That will not happen in decades, if then," he continued. "The Japan investment has just been right up our alley." President Donald Trump was not directly referenced during this discussion. Buffett initially took a lighthearted tone as he thanked Apple CEO Tim Cook. "I'm somewhat embarrassed to say that Tim Cook has made Berkshire a lot more money than I've ever made Berkshire Hathaway," Buffett joked. The investor then took on a more serious tone as he noted that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs "really made the right decision" when picking out Cook as his successor. Berkshire sold thousands of its special anniversary book during Friday's shopping event, according to Buffett. The company printed around 8,000, about 3,000 more than initially planned. "In every aspect, we set records," Buffett said of this year's event, citing sales from holding companies at the bonanza and runners signed up for Sunday's 5-K. Berkshire Hathaway has sold more stock than it's bought for 10 straight quarters, according to its earnings report released Saturday morning. The conglomerate dumped more than $134 billion worth of stock in 2024, mainly due to reductions in Berkshire's two largest equity holdings — Apple and Bank of America. "I think that it will be interesting to hear, of course, Warren's thoughts around tariffs — that is the topic of the moment," Samra, a portfolio manager at Artisan Partners, told CNBC's Becky Quick and Mike Santoli. There are some wildfire issues that have been impacting the energy business," he added. "So it will be interesting to see if they have any commentary around that." Berkshire Hathaway posted some disappointing results before its annual meeting was set to begin: Berkshire said President Donald Trump's tariffs and other geopolitical risks created an uncertain environment for the conglomerate, with its vast array of insurance, transportation, energy, retail and other businesses. The firm said it's not able to predict any potential impact from tariffs at this time. "Our periodic operating results may be affected in future periods by impacts of ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical events, as well as changes in industry or company-specific factors or events," Berkshire said in the earnings report. Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events." "We are currently unable to reliably predict the potential impact on our businesses, whether through changes in product costs, supply chain costs and efficiency, and customer demand for our products and services," it said. This year's shopping event in Omaha is more interactive than ever. Featuring a gigantic claw machine, a signed book auction and private jet tours, shareholders are able to see displays and buy merchandise from the different holding companies under Berkshire. Some of the longest lines were for specialty Squishmallow toys that resemble Buffett and Charlie Munger. Click here to go inside the "Berkshire Bazaar of Bargains" held Friday and Saturday with CNBC reporters on the ground. Some investors seeking relatively safe places to hide find Berkshire appealing because of the defensive nature of its huge insurance empire and the conglomerate's unmatched balance sheet — boasting more than $347 billion in cash at the end of March. Ahead of Buffett's address, shareholders are wondering what he'll have to say about President Donald Trump's tariff plans. Buffett in March called tariffs "an act of war, to some degree." I mean, the tooth fairy doesn't pay 'em!" Buffett said in an interview with CBS News. You always have to ask that question in economics. All things considered, tariffs should be a "net negative," according to Adam Meade, author of "The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway." That's because they can hamper businesses within the conglomerate, the Mead Capital Management CEO said during a Friday panel held by Gabelli Funds. Meade said Berkshire's furniture retailers, for example, should see costs rise due to the taxes. Geico's car insurance business can also take a hit, he said, because auto parts coming into the country will cost more on plans that haven't yet seen annual price adjustments. Elsewhere, he said BNSF Railway can see container volumes decline if consumers pull back on purchases once the duties fully take effect. But there's another side to this: Tariff-induced chaos can create a backdrop that's beneficial for Buffett to make a new investment at a discount, according to Christopher Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. Buffett has a record amount of cash on the sidelines, coming in at more than $330 billion at the end of last year. "Tariffs, trade wars, recessions, depressions, financial panics, pandemics, these are net good for Berkshire," Bloomstran said during the Gabelli event. Shareholders began lining up in the early morning hours for a shot at the best seats in Omaha's CHI Health Center. While many attendees can be seen sporting business or casual attire, some die-hard fans for Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett wear their heart on their sleeve — literally. Nora Ridenour landed on a shirt featuring the Oracle of Omaha's face in a variety of colors that was inspired by artist Andy Warhol. "I have a super useful art degree, so this one spoke to me," Ridenour said. Her husband Jay, who wore a shirt from last year's 5-K run with an illustration of Buffett, said he enjoys coming because of the positive energy among attendees. "This is one of the only events that I go to where everybody is just genuinely happy to be here." Polliana Elena Varnier matched other business students in town. The Brazil native's cohort had black hoodies with a black-and-white picture of Buffett sticking his tongue out. "They think it's not a real photo, maybe it's Photoshop," Yin said, referring to the Adobe application for picture editing. Warren Buffett has been mum about tariffs and the recent market turmoil, but will finally get a chance to speak his mind when the 94-year-old investment legend kicks off Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting. This year's annual meeting comes as markets have turned uncertain after President Donald Trump's aggressive rollout of the highest tariffs on imports in generations. Wall Street economists left and right are sounding the alarms that a recession may be in the offing, as recent data pointed to signs of economic weakening. Although Buffett doesn't make predictions of short-term market direction, investors will listen closely for any signals of his continued confidence in the U.S. economy — despite the tariff shock.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett will preside over the company's annual meeting. Track all of the day's news and analysis here. CNBC is livestreaming the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting on Saturday. The annual gathering has long been known as "Woodstock for Capitalists." Buffett is joined on stage by Greg Abel, Berkshire's vice chairman of non-insurance operations and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Ajit Jain, Berkshire's vice chairman of insurance operations. "Capitalism in the United States has succeeded like nothing you've ever seen. It's a combination of this magnificent cathedral, which has produced an economy like nothing the world's ever seen, and then it's got this massive casino attached," he said. "In the cathedrals, they basically are designing things that will be producing goods and services for 300-and-some million people like it's never been done before in history." Although the temptation to focus all of one's time and energy at this metaphorical casino is quite high, Buffett cautioned that keeping the balance was of utmost importance. "At the casino, everybody's having a good time and there's lots of money changing hands and everything, but you've got to make sure the cathedral gets fed, too," he said. It dispenses rewards in what seems like a terribly capricious manner." Abel, who serves as the chair of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, said that wildfire risk is "not going away" in the United States. Berkshire's approach to managing those risks include maintenance of the infrastructure and powering down when bad weather or a spreading fire approaches, Abel said. He also said that Berkshire can't serve as an "insurer of last resort" in wildfire disasters. That means wildfire damage can cause losses for the insurance business and, if a fire happens in a region where Berkshire's utility operates, create legal liability concerns. "We are not in the business of trying to solve unsolvable problems," he added. The company's first-quarter report reflected a $1.1 billion loss related to Southern California wildfires. Berkshire's special book celebrating six decades under Buffett has sold out, the CEO announced. Buffett said during the second half of his question-and-answer session that he received a note saying all copies of the 60th anniversary book have been purchased. Berkshire printed around 8,000 in total, 3,000 more than originally planned. Berkshire is auctioning off some signed copies for charity. Buffett reassured his shareholders that Berkshire wouldn't put their money to use for things that the company thought was "stupid." If they did, the shareholders "ought to get rid of us," he added. When asked about his views on capital allocation, particularly into new businesses, Abel said that Berkshire had a strong set of values to follow, including maintaining its current reputation. "We have values that we as a management team — as defined by Warren and Charlie and everybody associated with the business — they had great values that really set Berkshire up well for the future," he responded. That will always be a priority, and something that we'll ensure is in the forefront of our minds," he said. Other important values he would stick by include keeping Berkshire's balance sheet strong. Abel said that the company's current "significant set of cash" was an "enormous" and "strategic asset" that he could deploy in the future, one that allows Berkshire to not depend on any banks or other entities for its success. Properly understanding and managing risk is also important, he said, alongside owning a "great set of operating companies that do produce significant cash flows." Buffett said Berkshire halted its buyback program this year partly because of the 1% excise tax on stock repurchases, which was introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Berkshire shares also have significantly outperformed the S&P 500, rising nearly 19% this year. Buffett explained why he thinks that the balance sheet is a good starting point when deciding whether to invest in a company. And Wall Street really doesn't pay much attention to balance sheets, but I like to look at the balance sheets over an eight- or 10-year period before I even look at the income account because there's certain things that are harder to hide or play games with on the balance sheet," Buffett said. "Neither one gives you the total answer," he added. Before tackling the first question, he made a quick movie recommendation: "Becoming Katherine Graham." Despite unique travel challenges for foreign shareholders this year, it was a full house at CHI Health Center in Omaha on Saturday morning as Buffett spoke. Multiple international investors told CNBC they were staying home this year given concerns about traveling to the U.S. in the current political climate. These decisions come after President Donald Trump's plan for contentious tariffs has quickly raised fears of a global trade war. Buffett said during Saturday's gathering that Berkshire's shareholder event held a day prior saw record high attendance of nearly 20,000. The Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting has taken a break for lunch. "What has happened in the last 30, 45 days … is really nothing," said Buffett, noting Berkshire Hathaway's stock was cut in half three times during his 60 years running the company. Given that, he said the U.S. stock market's recent action should not be considered a "huge" move. "This has not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort," Buffett said. The S&P 500 nearly closed in a 20% bear market at its low in April before President Donald Trump paused his most punitive tariffs on countries, causing a rebound that's brought the benchmark back more than halfway. At last check the S&P 500 was down about 8% from its record high. When giving advice to a young investor, Buffett said that finding a way to be fulfilled and happy helps people have long lives. "I think a happy person lives longer than somebody that's doing some things they don't really admire much in life," Buffett said. Jain said that Berkshire Hathaway had not been immune to disruptions from direct competition in the form of private equity firms in recent years. "There's no question the private equity firms have come into the space, and we are no longer competitive in this space. We used to do a fair amount in this space, but in the last three, four years, I don't think we've done a single deal," he said. That being said, Jain added that the private equity strategy of using higher leverage and more aggressive investment strategies works while the "economy is doing great and credit spreads are low." "However, there is always the danger that at some point the regulators might get cranky and say, 'You're taking too much risk on behalf of your policyholders,' and that could end in tears," Jain added. Buffett added that Berkshire was unique from its competitors because he takes a more personal stake in his investments. "They probably have a somewhat different fiduciary feeling about what they're doing, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't work and if it doesn't work, they go on to other things," Buffett said. "If what we do here at Berkshire doesn't work, I spend the end of my life regretting what I've created so it's just a whole different personal equation. There's no property casualty company that can basically replicate Berkshire." When asked about currency considerations and potential hedges for Berkshire, Buffett said he was concerned about the tendency of governments to make decisions that lead to weaker currencies. "Fiscal policy is what scares me in the United States, because it's made the way it is and all the motivations are to doing a lot of things that can cause trouble with money. "The value of currency is a scary thing, and we don't have any great system for beating that," he added. "Paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country's short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency," Buffett wrote in that report. Jain, Berkshire's chairman of insurance operations, lauded Geico CEO Todd Combs' efforts to improve the insurance giant's operations — which include steep job cuts. Jain said that Combs has cut Geico's workforce to about 20,000 from around 50,000 when he took over. In the past five or six years, "we have made rapid strides, and telematics, which used to be a source of competitive disadvantage to us, is no longer so," said Jain. Jain added that the labor force reductions amount to roughly $2 billion a year in saved costs. Buffett offered some of his wisdom for life beyond the investing world that he's become known for over the decades. Buffett cautioned that employees can take on the habits of their colleagues, so it's important to be discerning about where one works. He recommended that while people should be "careful" about who they are employed by, it's less important to fret about factors like starting salaries. "I mentioned that we started out as an agricultural society. We started out as a society with high promises, and we didn't deliver on them very well," he said. "If I were being born today, I would just keep negotiating in the womb until they said you can be in the United States." Buffett revealed that Berkshire almost put $10 billion at work recently, but ultimately didn't pull the trigger. "I mean, those decisions are not tough to make when something is offered that makes sense to us and that we understand and offers good value." However, Buffett noted that the one problem with the investment business is that things don't come along in an orderly fashion. But Jain said that Berkshire is taking a more hesitant approach when it comes to any lofty new technological claims. "I certainly also feel that people end up spending enormous amounts of money trying to chase the next new fashionable thing," he said. However, Jain added that Berkshire wouldn't hesitate to invest once the right opportunity does arise. "Right now, the individual insurance operations do dabble in AI and try and figure out what is the best way to exploit it, but we have not yet made a conscious big-time effort in terms of pouring a lot of money into this opportunity," he added. When discussing Berkshire's cash pile, Buffett joked about the theory that he is planning to hold on to that until the leadership transition occurs, which would let his successor Greg Abel make a big move. "I wouldn't do anything nearly so noble as to withhold investing myself just so that Greg could look good later on," Buffett quipped, drawing laughs from Abel and others in attendance. Buffett said Berkshire will find places to put its record levels of cash to work, likely within the next half decade. "It's very unlikely to happen tomorrow," Buffett said in response to a question about the reasoning for Berkshire's cash hoard. "It's not unlikely to happen in five years." Buffett also said that "the one problem with the investment business is that things don't come along in an orderly fashion." He then cracked a lighthearted joke about longtime business partner and friend Charlie Munger, who died in 2023 at the age of 99. In response to a question about whether Buffett will stop investing in Japan stocks if the Bank of Japan were to raise interest rates in the future, the Oracle of Omaha said he won't be selling shares. "In the next 50 years ... we won't give a thought to selling those," Buffett said, adding that Japan's record has been "extraordinary" and pointing out that Apple, American Express and Coca-Cola, for example, have been doing well in the country. He also said he's been treated "extremely well" by the five Japanese companies he has invested in – namely, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Itochu and Marubeni – and said that building a relationship with the companies is "super long term." They have different approaches to business – that's true around the world – and we don't have any intention in any way of trying to change what they do because they do it very successfully," Buffett said. That will not happen in decades, if then," he continued. "The Japan investment has just been right up our alley." President Donald Trump was not directly referenced during this discussion. Buffett initially took a lighthearted tone as he thanked Apple CEO Tim Cook. "I'm somewhat embarrassed to say that Tim Cook has made Berkshire a lot more money than I've ever made Berkshire Hathaway," Buffett joked. The investor then took on a more serious tone as he noted that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs "really made the right decision" when picking out Cook as his successor. Berkshire sold thousands of its special anniversary book during Friday's shopping event, according to Buffett. The company printed around 8,000, about 3,000 more than initially planned. "In every aspect, we set records," Buffett said of this year's event, citing sales from holding companies at the bonanza and runners signed up for Sunday's 5-K. Berkshire Hathaway has sold more stock than it's bought for 10 straight quarters, according to its earnings report released Saturday morning. The conglomerate dumped more than $134 billion worth of stock in 2024, mainly due to reductions in Berkshire's two largest equity holdings — Apple and Bank of America. "I think that it will be interesting to hear, of course, Warren's thoughts around tariffs — that is the topic of the moment," Samra, a portfolio manager at Artisan Partners, told CNBC's Becky Quick and Mike Santoli. There are some wildfire issues that have been impacting the energy business," he added. "So it will be interesting to see if they have any commentary around that." Berkshire Hathaway posted some disappointing results before its annual meeting was set to begin: Berkshire said President Donald Trump's tariffs and other geopolitical risks created an uncertain environment for the conglomerate, with its vast array of insurance, transportation, energy, retail and other businesses. The firm said it's not able to predict any potential impact from tariffs at this time. "Our periodic operating results may be affected in future periods by impacts of ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical events, as well as changes in industry or company-specific factors or events," Berkshire said in the earnings report. Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events." "We are currently unable to reliably predict the potential impact on our businesses, whether through changes in product costs, supply chain costs and efficiency, and customer demand for our products and services," it said. This year's shopping event in Omaha is more interactive than ever. Featuring a gigantic claw machine, a signed book auction and private jet tours, shareholders are able to see displays and buy merchandise from the different holding companies under Berkshire. Some of the longest lines were for specialty Squishmallow toys that resemble Buffett and Charlie Munger. Click here to go inside the "Berkshire Bazaar of Bargains" held Friday and Saturday with CNBC reporters on the ground. Some investors seeking relatively safe places to hide find Berkshire appealing because of the defensive nature of its huge insurance empire and the conglomerate's unmatched balance sheet — boasting more than $347 billion in cash at the end of March. Ahead of Buffett's address, shareholders are wondering what he'll have to say about President Donald Trump's tariff plans. Buffett in March called tariffs "an act of war, to some degree." You always have to ask that question in economics. All things considered, tariffs should be a "net negative," according to Adam Meade, author of "The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway." That's because they can hamper businesses within the conglomerate, the Mead Capital Management CEO said during a Friday panel held by Gabelli Funds. Meade said Berkshire's furniture retailers, for example, should see costs rise due to the taxes. Geico's car insurance business can also take a hit, he said, because auto parts coming into the country will cost more on plans that haven't yet seen annual price adjustments. Elsewhere, he said BNSF Railway can see container volumes decline if consumers pull back on purchases once the duties fully take effect. But there's another side to this: Tariff-induced chaos can create a backdrop that's beneficial for Buffett to make a new investment at a discount, according to Christopher Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. Buffett has a record amount of cash on the sidelines, coming in at more than $330 billion at the end of last year. "Tariffs, trade wars, recessions, depressions, financial panics, pandemics, these are net good for Berkshire," Bloomstran said during the Gabelli event. Shareholders began lining up in the early morning hours for a shot at the best seats in Omaha's CHI Health Center. While many attendees can be seen sporting business or casual attire, some die-hard fans for Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett wear their heart on their sleeve — literally. Nora Ridenour landed on a shirt featuring the Oracle of Omaha's face in a variety of colors that was inspired by artist Andy Warhol. "I have a super useful art degree, so this one spoke to me," Ridenour said. Her husband Jay, who wore a shirt from last year's 5-K run with an illustration of Buffett, said he enjoys coming because of the positive energy among attendees. "This is one of the only events that I go to where everybody is just genuinely happy to be here." Polliana Elena Varnier matched other business students in town. The Brazil native's cohort had black hoodies with a black-and-white picture of Buffett sticking his tongue out. "They think it's not a real photo, maybe it's Photoshop," Yin said, referring to the Adobe application for picture editing. Warren Buffett has been mum about tariffs and the recent market turmoil, but will finally get a chance to speak his mind when the 94-year-old investment legend kicks off Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting. This year's annual meeting comes as markets have turned uncertain after President Donald Trump's aggressive rollout of the highest tariffs on imports in generations. Wall Street economists left and right are sounding the alarms that a recession may be in the offing, as recent data pointed to signs of economic weakening. Although Buffett doesn't make predictions of short-term market direction, investors will listen closely for any signals of his continued confidence in the U.S. economy — despite the tariff shock.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OMAHA, Nebraska — Warren Buffett on Saturday brushed off recent stock market volatility that has rattled investors over the past several weeks. Buffett pointed out that there were three occasions over the last six decades where Berkshire Hathaway stock declined 50%. He noted that there was no fundamental issue with the company during these periods. "I don't get fearful by things that other people ... are afraid of in a financial way," he said. "Let's say Berkshire went down 50% next week, I would regard that as a fantastic opportunity, and it wouldn't bother me in the least." Given that, he said the U.S. stock market's recent action should not be characterized as a "huge" move. "This has not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort," Buffett said. These comments from the "Oracle of Omaha" as investors wonder what's next for markets after the wild trading seen amid concerns over President Donald Trump's contentious tariff policy announced in early April. The S&P 500 on Friday notched its longest winning streak since 2004 as Wall Street claws back losses seen in the initial sell-off following Trump's initial policy unveiling. It marks a stunning rebound for U.S. stocks after the benchmark index at one point entered a bear market on an intraday basis last month, a term used to describe a fall of more than 20% from its recent high, before regaining ground. Buffett said other periods have been "dramatically different" than the current one facing investors. He reminded investors that the market has climbed over the 94-year-old's lifetime, while cautioning that they need to be ready for bouts of troublesome action. He shared that the Dow Jones Industrial Average sat at 240 on his birthday of Aug. 30, 1930, and fell as low as 41. Despite "hair-curler" events he's lived through, the blue-chip average finished Friday above 41,300. "If it makes a difference to you whether your stocks are down 15% or not, you need to get a somewhat different investment philosophy," Buffett said. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warren Buffett hit out at President Donald Trump's global trade war on Saturday, saying trade should not be a "weapon." Speaking at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett did not directly name Trump, but made clear his distaste for tariffs. "Trade should not be a weapon," he said." Buffett called the policies a "big mistake," warning that protectionist policies could have negative repercussions for the US. "I don't think it's right, and I don't think it's wise," he said. I mean, we have become an incredibly important country, starting from nothing 250 years ago. Buffett's comments came after the company reported that its first quarter profits fell by around 14% compared to 2024 to $9.6 billion, while its cash stockpile rose to more than $347 billion. Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has surged despite volatile financial markets since Trump's election last year. The conglomerate is up more than 20% since Trump won victory on November 5, in spite of the S&P 500 being down almost 2% Trump's administration has imposed tariffs of 145% on China, which were countered with retaliatory Chinese levies of 125%.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>

Warren Buffett hailed Tim Cook as a one-of-a-kind leader after selling two-thirds of his stake in Apple last year.

The famed investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO praised the tech titan's CEO in his opening comments at his conglomerate's annual meeting on Saturday.

"Tim Cook has made Berkshire a lot more than I have made Berkshire," Buffett quipped to laughter in the auditorium, nodding to the fact that Berkshire's roughly $35 billion investment in Apple between 2016 and 2018 grew to $173 billion by the end of 2023.

However, Berkshire sold about 67% of its Apple shares in the first nine months of 2024, leaving only 300 million shares at the end of December, worth about $62 billion at Friday's closing price of $205 per share.

Buffett also gave Cook perhaps the best compliment when he favorably compared him to his iconic predecessor and Apple's cofounder.

"I knew Steve Jobs briefly," Buffett said, adding that the creator of the iPhone "of course did things that nobody else could have done."

"Nobody but Steve could have created Apple, but nobody but Tim could have developed it like it has," Buffett added.

Since Cook took the reins in 2011, Apple stock has soared from under $15 on a split-adjusted basis to $205, a roughly 14-fold gain, boosting Apple's market capitalization to north of $3 trillion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Being a parent has become an increasingly harder job, especially as anxiety levels keep rising, even among the youngest kids. We get emails and calls from parents looking for guidance nearly every day. When a child experiences worry that won't go away, parents feel overwhelmed and lost. They desperately want to make it better but don't know how. The first step is to understand what those worries are. Children will compare their lives to highlight reels of friends and complete strangers. When kids use social media without any supervision, it ramps up their anxiety. They see other people's lives online and might start feeling bad about their own, which makes them worry a lot more. In families where academics and extracurriculars take priority from morning to night, there's little room for relaxation. And when children don't have unstructured time to recharge, they are at risk of developing chronic stress. DON'T MISS: How to successfully change careers and be happier at work Be sure to give your kids plenty of free playtime. It's how they learn, process emotions and make sense of what's happening around them. Things don't need to be the same all the time, but last-minute changes in their daily schedule will make kids nervous. Having a caregiver who is often late or says they will be there and then doesn't show up may cause anxiety in a child, too. In the same way, when a child receives conflicting signals from each of their grown-ups, or when rules and expectations change from day to day, children experience a sense of discomfort. Trauma can leave a child feeling devastated, scared or hurt, and it's tough for them to calm down because it triggers their body's stress response. This makes them super alert and unable to relax, constantly worried about their safety. Even small incidents can shake a child's sense of safety. Later, they might see something that reminds them of the event and feel scared all over again. There are many practical coping strategies for your child to manage intense emotions. The key is to teach ahead by introducing these skills during calm moments — well before stressful situations arise. Teach your kids to manage emotions by naming what they feel. Explain that worry likes to hide in the dark and fester, and that sharing it out loud with you or a trusted friend or sibling will help them feel better. Get into the habit of taking three deep breaths with your child before bed. Encourage your child to say it to themselves: "Things are easier the second time around," or "I can do it," during moments of worry or before a big event. Teach them to recite: "It only feels this way for now, but I know even the worst feelings will pass," or "Just because I'm imagining something bad, it doesn't mean it's going to happen." If your kid has free-floating anxiety or feels overpowered by emotions that pop up only to derail them, try scheduling a 15-minute window later in the day for them to worry. When you get home, I'll set a timer and you can think all about it, scream into your pillow, or talk it out with me until the timer goes off." They've trained over 8,000 psychotherapists, psychologists, counselors and parent coaches to support children with anxiety.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OMAHA, Nebraska — Warren Buffett on Saturday criticized President Donald Trump's hardline trade policy, without naming him directly, saying it's a big mistake to slap punitive tariffs on the rest of the world. "Trade should not be a weapon," Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, an annual gathering in front of thousands in Omaha, Nebraska. Trade and tariffs "can be an act of war," added the legendary investor. "And I think it's led to bad things. Just the attitudes it's brought out. In the United States, I mean, we should be looking to trade with the rest of the world and we should do what we do best and they should do what they do best." Buffett's comments, his most direct yet on tariffs, came after the White House's rollout of the highest levies on imports in generations shocked the world last month, triggering extreme volatility on Wall Street. The president later went on to announce a sudden 90-day pause on much of the increase, except for China, as the White House sought to make deals with countries. Still, Trump has slapped tariffs of 145% on imported Chinese goods this year, prompting China to impose retaliatory levies of 125%. China said last week it is evaluating the possibility of starting trade negotiations with the U.S. "It's a big mistake, in my view, when you have seven and a half billion people that don't like you very well, and you got 300 million that are crowing in some way about how well they've done - I don't think it's right, and I don't think it's wise," Buffett said. I mean, we have become an incredibly important country, starting from nothing 250 years ago. The trillion-dollar Berkshire's vast array of insurance, transportation, energy, retail and other businesses, from Geico to Burlington Northern to Dairy Queen, leave Buffett uniquely qualified to comment on the current health of the American economy. Berkshire said in its first-quarter earnings report that tariffs and other geopolitical events created "considerable uncertainty" for the conglomerate. The firm said it's not able to predict any potential impact from tariffs at this time. Buffett has been in a defensive mode, selling stocks for 10 straight quarters. Berkshire dumped more than $134 billion worth of stock in 2024, mainly due to reductions in Berkshire's two largest equity holdings — Apple and Bank of America. As a result of the selling spree, Berkshire's enormous pile of cash grew to yet another record, at $347 billion at the end of March.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why America is returning to the days of double-duty gadgets Basically, she wanted a bag that could do it all. Sarpong's search isn't an isolated instance of a picky shopper. Or even an unassuming ceiling lamp that, you see upon second glance, is also a smart projector and speaker. Faced with rising prices and increasingly busy lives, Americans are arming themselves with products that work like a Swiss Army knife. I'm really drawn to pieces that are multifunctional," Sarpong says. That's where she stores her all-in-one makeup products, which can be variously used on lips, cheeks, and eyelids. Whether it's higher prices, hybrid work, or an ever-rising obsession with efficiency and optimization, there are a slew of reasons Americans are looking for stuff that can fill more than one role. For businesses, expanding their product offering to fill different parts of customers' lives can insulate them from fickle tastes and cushion their bottom lines in leaner times. As multifunctional goods become ever more popular, it's clear that we're living in a three-in-one economy. American consumers are wrestling with a lot of uncertainty these days. And businesses are skimping on the quantity and sizes of their products (whether it's smaller portions at restaurants or fewer sheets of toilet paper per roll) — leaving Americans wondering whether they're really getting a bang for their buck. All these factors are pushing people to look for deals wherever they can: In a recent survey of consumers by the accounting and consulting firm EY, 77% of respondents said they were actively changing their buying habits to seek better value. Hybrid products could be a tool in consumers' inflation-fighting toolbox. Inflation-weary consumers are increasingly turning to these products, especially for appliances and tech gadgets, says Steffen Schenk, the managing director of NielsenIQ's North America tech and durables sector. For example, he points to combination microwave-roaster-grill air fryers that save time and space in small kitchens and self-cleaning robotic vacuums with built-in mops. NielsenIQ has seen growing consumer demand for smart kitchen appliances and tech wearables. "And once again, having those multifunctional devices really helps with that." "If I can find something that is multifaceted or can be used in more than one aspect, I will absolutely buy that over a product I can only use once," Jauregui says. Jauregui has been optimizing her closet for both work and play. Ever since the pandemic, she's swapped out high heels for more comfortable loafers and sneakers that can be worn straight from the office to a night out. Another hybrid product Jauregui has recently started using is solid shampoo, a bar that can be used as shampoo, conditioner, face wash, and body soap. These bars — which Jauregui purchases from the beauty brand Kitsch — have saved her money and time, as Jauregui no longer needs to buy travel-size containers of different toiletries when she goes on trips. According to consulting firm Capgemini, big companies like L'Oreal are hopping on the trend and launching their own solid shampoo products. Hardcore austerity has never been America's strength — when sales spiked after the 2001 stock market crash, former Estée Lauder CEO Leonard Lauder called the need to partake in small luxuries during major downturns the "lipstick effect." Nowadays, consumers stressed from constant budgeting might forgo expensive vacations but still decide to treat themselves to a little retail therapy, Schenk says. "If you look at some of the trends we're seeing around self-indulgence, wellness, and so on, we would expect a similar lipstick effect in this cycle," Schenk tells me. Sarpong has already been indulging in some lipstick effect shopping — literally. The pigment can be used as a blush, lip color, or moisturizer. Multifunctional products can help consumers use some "girl math," as TikTok would say, to justify those nonessential splurges during economic hardship. After all, if the lipstick you purchased doubles as a moisturizer and blush, you're getting much more bang for your buck. In addition to acute economic drivers, longer-term trends have also increased consumer appetite for products that do it all. Saoirse Cleary, the creative strategy director at the marketing agency MG Empower, tells me that the younger generations' emphasis on work-life balance makes them more open to trying new products that offer unique wellness or lifestyle features, such as athleisure wear and multifunctional makeup products. These demographics are also much more likely to find these multifunctional products through social media channels rather than traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Convenience seeking isn't just a Gen Z or millennial thing, though. "Young people tend to be the early adopters," Cleary added. "But if something is hybrid, it makes everyone's lives easier." Yet another driving factor for the three-in-one economy is Americans' desire to optimize every part of their life. Devices and goods that fulfill multiple needs can feed people's drive to be the best, healthiest, or most efficient. Schenk, from NielsenIQ, tells me smartwatches that track health metrics while keeping time have been especially popular. From 2019 to 2023, the number of new products in the wearables category jumped from 5,000 to 80,000 — an increase not seen in any other product category, NielsenIQ GfK Market Intelligence says. Cleary also highlights the rising popularity of wearable technology such as Oura rings, which provide users with various biometric data. "You have to highlight the hybrid benefits of a product nowadays," Cleary adds. Amid this consumer phenomenon, companies are increasingly leaning into the desire for multifunctional goods to add to their bottom lines, especially when those products can satisfy people's craving for a "little treat." Cleary tells me that appealing to people in various walks of life can expand the awareness of a brand outside its core constituency, which helps to lure in new customers who may not have run into the company's offerings otherwise. "A bag that functions for work, the gym, and social outings can be embraced by minimalists, professionals, and fitness enthusiasts alike, creating crossover appeal that strengthens a brand's reach," she says. Cleary adds that in her work helping global brands develop their influencer marketing strategies, she's seen companies launch multifunctional product campaigns. Multiuse products can also deepen relationships with existing customers, especially during an economic downturn. When companies launch value-rich products that make people's lives easier, they build trust within their customer base. On the other hand, price increases and a decrease in perceived product value isolate cash-sensitive shoppers. With consumers like Sarpong and Jauregui putting more thought into their purchases, a multifunctional aspect helps brands make buyers feel like they're getting the best option. When the pandemic hit, businesses shut down, and a toilet paper shortage had people rushing to store shelves. Now, as businesses grapple with tariff-driven uncertainty and DOGE drives federal worker layoffs, consumers are feeling déjà vu. For everyday people, there isn't much you can do to shield yourself from breakdowns in complex supply chains or policy decisions made in DC, but changing your consumption patterns is one actionable way to exert your economic agency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Akaisha Kaderli was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer while traveling the world with her husband, Billy, the couple had to make a decision. They could give up the nomadic lifestyle they've been living for more than 30 years and travel back to the US to navigate treatment through Medicare Advantage. Or they could pay out-of-pocket for healthcare abroad. They chose the latter — and Billy said he never left his wife's side. "She was a trooper about it," he said. And, prior to Akaisha's diagnosis, they spent most of their days trying new cuisines in Southeast Asia and lounging on Italian beaches. A serious medical diagnosis can derail careful retirement planning. Business Insider has heard from dozens of older Americans who spent their 401(k) savings on medical bills, went into debt, or returned to work so they could afford care. For older people with limited savings who primarily live on Social Security, the cost of unexpected doctors' visits and prescriptions can be devastating. As healthcare costs continue to climb in the US, some Americans are opting for "medical tourism." Whether it's for elective procedures or lifesaving treatment, people like the Kaderlis are looking for ways to afford healthcare without breaking the bank. While data is limited, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that millions of Americans seek healthcare in another country every year — most commonly to Mexico, Canada, and the Caribbean. "I'm not looking to die, but I wasn't going to spend my money on hospitals and drugs." Akaisha and Billy say they were early adopters of the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement and have continued to maintain wealth through long-term investments and low-budget living. They invested most of their money in the S&P 500 and, when they stopped working, began traveling — often living for months at a time in low cost-of-living countries. Most US-based insurance doesn't work abroad, and they kept the plan as a safety net for any serious medical needs. But when Akaisha was diagnosed with cancer, the couple said they quickly decided to avoid the American healthcare system. They don't know exactly what cancer treatment would have cost them in the US with Medicare, but Billy said he's confident the choice saved them money, and it "would have taken much longer to go through all the hoops" of finding in-network providers. Stage three breast cancer treatment in the US typically costs over $100,000 — and even patients with insurance can be left with steep bills to pay. "This is the option we would have taken anyway, but I don't like the idea of spending $100,000 or $200,000 on a medical procedure when I can get a wonderful type of care for $20,000." "This is the life we were meant to live."</p>
