US President Donald Trump is pressuring the Mexican government to crack down on Mexican cartels, blaming them for fomenting America's drugs crisis. He's threatened tariffs and even military strikes. Mexico has sent hundreds of troops to the state of Sinaloa, where a war rages between two factions of the infamous Sinaloa Cartel, putting civilians at risk. CNN's Isobel Yeung visits the region – speaking to a member of the Sinaloa cartel, meeting families impacted by the violence and seeing the work soldiers are doing to destroy drug production in the rural countryside.

Follow:


            Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has secured a second term in office in a disastrous night for his conservative rivals, as voters chose stability over change against a backdrop of global turmoil inflicted by US President Donald Trump.
    


            Australia's return of a left-leaning government follows Canada's similar sharp swing towards Mark Carney's Liberal Party, another governing party whose fortunes were transformed by Trump. The loss of Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton's seat mirrors that of Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre.
    


            While Australia wasn't facing the same threats to its sovereignty as Canada, Trump's global tariffs and policy swings have undermined Australians' trust in the US, according to recent surveys.
    


            Albanese's victory makes him the first Australian Prime Minister to win re-election for two decades and he will start his second term with at least 87 seats in the 150-seat lower house, according to the most recent estimates.
    


            A clearly emotional Albanese took the stage to cheers just before 10 p.m. local time to thank Australians for choosing a majority Labor government, defying predictions both major parties would lose seats.
    


            “In this time of global uncertainty, Australians have chosen optimism and determination,” Albanese said, at the Labor victory party in Sydney.
    


            Dutton, who had hoped to end the night as prime minister, lost the outer-suburban Brisbane seat that he's held for more than 20 years, ending a brutal night for the veteran politician who held senior seats in the last Coalition government.
    


            In conceding defeat, Dutton said he accepted full responsibility for the election loss.
    


            “Our Liberal family is hurting across the country tonight,” Dutton said. “We've been defined by our opponents in this election, which is not the true story of who we are, but we'll rebuild from here.”
    


            World powers have been congratulating Albanese. US Secretary of State Rubio called Australia a “valued ally” while UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said “long-distance friendships can be the strongest.”
    


            The candidates' ability to deal with the US president had been a talking point of the campaign. Despite criticism that he had been unable to get Trump on the phone, Albanese said they had shared “warm” conversations in the past and he saw no reason not to trust him. Canberra remains a staunch ally of Washington, despite Trump's tariffs threat.
    


            Dutton entered the five-week campaign on a strong footing. But analysts say his chances were badly damaged by policy misses and reversals, and weighed down by Trump's wrecking-ball approach to the global order.
    


            By contrast, Albanese's Labor Party was able to demonstrate a steady hand – striking an authoritative tone in response to Trump's decision to impose 10% tariffs on Australia, which were later paused, analysts said.
    


            After Trump's April 2 “Liberation Day” announcement, Albanese called a press conference and, flanked by his foreign and trade ministers, said: “This is not the act of a friend.” In contrast, Dutton struggled to shake off comparisons to Trump by his opponents, not just because some policies appeared to have been inspired by the US leader.
    


            During the campaign, the senator he tapped to become shadow minister for government efficiency declared she wanted to “make Australia great again.” Jacinta Nampijinpa Price later said she didn't realize she'd said it. Asked Saturday, if the Trump comparisons had hurt Dutton, Price said: “If you sling enough mud, it will stick.”
    


            In the last three years, Albanese has been credited with improving relations with China, leading to the lifting of tariffs imposed during his predecessor's term. His government has also repaired relations with Pacific Island nations, in part to prevent Beijing from filling a leadership vacuum. On foreign relations, he's promised more of the same.
    


            Within Australia, Albanese's government has been widely criticized for not being aggressive enough in efforts to tame rising living costs during a period of high global inflation. In the years ahead, he's promised a tax cut, cheaper medicines, lower deposits for first-time buyers and 1.2 million houses to ease the housing crisis.

            Albanese first took office in the so-called “climate election” of 2022, with promises to cut Australia's carbon emissions and reach net zero by 2050. Despite a rapid rollout of renewable projects – enough to power 10 million homes – his government has been criticized for also approving new coal and gas projects.
    


            On Saturday, Albanese reiterated his commitment to climate action in contrast to the rolling assault inflicted by the new US administration on environment agencies and research.
    


            All Australians know “renewable energy is an opportunity we must work together to seize for the future of our economy,”﻿ Albanese said to cheers.
    


            The Liberal Party's loss means Dutton's plan to build seven nuclear plants at public expense won't move forward, a proposal critics said was a stalling tactic to extend Australia's reliance on fossil fuels.
    


            “Today's election result shows that Australians have comprehensively rejected the Coalition's Trumpist agenda of climate and nature destruction, and its plan to force dangerous nuclear on communities,” said David Ritter, CEO of Greenpeace Australia Pacific.
    


            Dutton's loss ends a long political career for the ex-police officer who held high-profile roles as minister for defense, immigration and home affairs in the former Coalition government.
    


            Dutton assumed the Liberal leadership after Morrison's election loss in 2022 and brought with him a reputation as a strongman of the party's right wing. During the 2025 election campaign, Dutton chided the prime minister for failing to secure exemptions from the US president's global tariffs, and said he could have negotiated a better deal.
    


            As polls started to suggest voters were turned off by his Trump-style approach, Dutton seemed to try to put some distance between himself and the US leader. But in the final week of campaigning, he seemed to again tap into Trump rhetoric, referring to Australia's national broadcaster and left-leaning newspaper The Guardian as “hate media.”
    


            In 2023, Dutton launched himself into contention as prime minister by successfully campaigning against the government's referendum on the Voice proposal, which included constitutional recognition for Indigenous Australians.
    


            Dutton had called the Voice referendum divisive, because it proposed to give one group recognition over another. For the same reason, he said Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags would no longer be present at press conferences under his leadership – because all Australians should be united under one flag. Albanese took the opposing view.
    


            As he claimed victory, Albanese made a deliberate attempt to cast himself as a “kinder” leader, in contrast to the model offered by an administration he accused his rival of emulating.
    


            “Now that the Australian people have made their clear choice, let us reflect on what we have in common, because no matter who you voted for, no matter where you live, no matter how you worship, or who you love, or whether you belong to a culture that has known and cared for this great continent for 65,000 years, or you have chosen our nation as your home and enrich our society with your contribution, we are all Australians,” Albanese said.

NEW DELHI, May 3. /TASS/. India has reported another ceasefire violation by the Pakistani military on the Line of Control in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.

""On the night of May 2-3, 2025, the Pakistan Army initiated unprovoked small arms fire across the Line of Control opposite the Kupwara, Uri and Akhnoor districts in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir,"" the Indian Army said in a statement quoted by the ANI news agency.

""The Indian Army responded promptly and proportionately,"" the military noted.

New Delhi has recorded nightly cross-border firing by Pakistani forces for the past week, following a terrorist attack in the popular tourist destination of Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir. High-ranking Indian and Pakistani military officials held talks on Tuesday, during which the Indian side lodged a formal protest.

New Delhi has issued a stern warning to Islamabad against further unprovoked ceasefire breaches by the Pakistani Army along the Line of Control.

On April 22, armed men killed 25 Indians and one Nepalese national and wounded many more with machine gun fire in the popular tourist town of Pahalgam in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. According to media reports, Indian intelligence agencies allegedly found evidence that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was involved in the terrorist attack committed by the Lashkar-e-Taiba group (outlawed in Russia).

After the attack, India almost halved its embassy staff in Pakistan, suspended an agreement with Islamabad on the allocation of water resources, declared the military advisors of the Pakistani diplomatic mission in India personae non gratae, and also suspended the issuance of visas to Pakistani citizens.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, May 3. /TASS/. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) has granted neutral status to 43 Russian athletes, according to FIG documents reviewed by TASS.

As of May 3, 17 of these athletes specialize in rhythmic gymnastics. They include Alexandra Khabibullina, Vladislava Nikolayenko, Varvara Toporova, Arina Yankovskaya, Arina Kovshova, Diana Chugunikhina, Arina Tkachuk, Ulyana Janus, Viktoria Chumakova, Anastasia Ivanova, Milena Bukina, Polina Semyonova, Kseniia Savinova, Karolina Pakhtusova, Maria Borisova, Alexandra Borisova, and Anna Vakulenko.

An additional 14 athletes compete in artistic gymnastics: Maria Agafonova, Alena Glotova, Zlata Osokina, Ilya Zaika, Daniel Marinov, Vladislav Polyashov, Kirill Prokopiev, Grigory Klimentev, Angelina Melnikova, Lyudmila Roshchina, Anna Kalmykova, Kseniya Zelyaeva, Ranel Safiullin, and Leyla Vasilyeva.

Additionally, 30 Belarusian athletes received neutral status.

Earlier, TASS reported that Russian athletes in artistic and rhythmic gymnastics would not participate in upcoming FIG tournaments, despite obtaining neutral status. This decision was attributed to numerous unjustified and biased refusals to grant neutral status to certain athletes.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

As infections pummel communities in the US, Mexico and Canada, fear of ‘the most contagious human disease' grows

A leading immunologist warned of a “post-herd-immunity world”, as measles outbreaks affect communities with low vaccination rates in the American south-west, Mexico and Canada.

The US is enduring the largest measles outbreak in a quarter-century. Centered in west Texas, the measles outbreak has killed two unvaccinated children and one adult and spread to neighboring states including New Mexico and Oklahoma.

“We're living in a post-herd-immunity world. I think the measles outbreak proves that,” said Dr Paul Offit, an expert on infectious disease and immunology and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

“Measles – because it is the most contagious of the vaccine-preventable diseases, the most contagious human disease really – it is the first to come back.”

The US eliminated measles in 2000. Elimination status would be lost if the US had 12 months of sustained transmission of the virus. As of 1 May, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 935 confirmed measles cases across 30 jurisdictions. Nearly one in three children under five years old involved in the outbreak, or 285 young children, have been hospitalized.

Three large outbreaks in Canada, Mexico and the US now account for the overwhelming majority of roughly 2,300 measles cases across the World Health Organization's six-country Americas region, according to the health authority's update this week. Risk of measles is considered high in the Americas, and has grown 11-fold compared with 2024.

Only slightly behind, data released earlier this week from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and WHO also noted that measles cases across Europe were up tenfold in 2024 compared to 2023. That data also indicated that the 2024 measles cases in Europe followed a seasonal pattern, which was not previously noted in 2021 through 2023.

Of the European cases, which reportedly hit 35,212 for 2024, 87% were reported in Romania. The ECDC said the dip in vaccine rates has impacted the recent spike in measles, with only three countries, Hungary, Malta and Portugal, having coverage of 95% or more for both doses of the measles vaccine.

“This virus was imported, traveling country to country,” said Leticia Ruíz, the director of prevention and disease control in Chihuahua, Mexico, according to the Associated Press.

Many cases are in areas with large populations of tight-knit Mennonite communities. The religious group has a history of migration through the American south-west, Mexico and Canada.

Mennonite teaching does not explicitly prohibit immunization, according to an expert in the religion. However, as some in the Mennonite community in Texas resist assimilation and speak a dialect of Low German, community members may have limited contact with public health authorities, leading to lower vaccination rates.

Immunologists fear the rate of infection of such diseases – and the unnecessary suffering they bring – will increase as the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, spreads misleading claims about vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases, undermines public confidence in vaccines' benefits, threatens to make some vaccines less accessible, guts public health infrastructure and pushes leading vaccine experts out of the department.

The National Institutes of Health said it would launch a “universal” influenza vaccine trial with $500m in funding, but the news comes as the administration displays hostility toward Covid-19 vaccines.

“Here, Robert F Kennedy Jr is exactly who he has been for the last 20 years. He's an anti-vaccine activist, he is a science denialist and a conspiracy theorist,” said Offit.

“He has a fixed belief that vaccines are doing more harm than good – as he's said over and over again.”

Although Kennedy has tepidly endorsed the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to prevent measles, he has also made false and inflammatory claims about the vaccine. Just this week, Kennedy told a crowd that it contains “aborted fetus debris”. The rubella vaccine, like many others, is produced using decades-old sterile fetal cell lines derived from two elective terminations in the 1960s.

Kennedy's health department also stated this week that it would implement new safety surveillance systems and approval requirements for vaccines, but did not provide any specifics about the design.

Experts said running certain trials, such as for a decades-old vaccine like MMR, would be unethical because it could expose people to a dangerous disease when an intervention is known to be safe.

Kennedy recently visited the most affected community in Texas, centered in Gaines county, in his capacity as health secretary. There, he made misleading claims about measles treatment, including that the antibiotic clarithromycin and steroid budesonide had led to “miraculous and instantaneous recovery”.

The overwhelming scientific consensus is that the best way to treat measles is through prevention with the MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective. Still, Kennedy has said he will ask the CDC to study vitamins and drugs to treat the viral disease.

Measles is a virus. There is no cure for the viral disease and it is not considered “treatable” by leading physicians' groups, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).

“There is no cure for measles, and it can result in serious complications. It's misleading and dangerous to promote the idea that measles is easily treated using unproven and ineffective therapies like budesonide and clarithromycin,” the AAP has said of Kennedy's claims.

Measles kills about one in 1,000 children who become infected with the disease, and has similar rates of brain swelling, called encephalitis, that can result in lifelong disability. Measles infection suppresses the immune system, which can lead to other infections.

Measles vaccination is believed to have saved more than 93 million lives worldwide between 1974 and 2024 and reduced overall childhood mortality.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Unlike the traditional snags sold to raise funds for schools and churches that host polling booths, these are prepared at ‘democracy sausage stores'

“Democracy sausages” have long been a fixture of the Australian election – but this year food delivery behemoth Uber Eats is cashing in on the beloved tradition.

Uber Eats is offering voters “democracy sausages” on 3 May for “hardworking Australians” who don't have access to a snag on election day.

But unlike the regular democracy sausages, which are a fundraising opportunity for the schools, churches and community halls where polling centres are located, these snags are prepared at “democracy sausage stores” operated by Maverick, an external marketing company.

In Sydney, for instance, they are being cooked and packed for delivery at a temporary kitchen available for hire in Ultimo, according to Uber Eats.

The sausages are only available in certain inner parts of Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney on Saturday from midday until sold out, with 1,000 available in each city. Users outside the delivery zone are told they can buy ingredients to construct their own on the Uber Eats app.

Guardian Australia ordered a vegetarian sausage and a meat sausage with sauces and onion on Saturday afternoon. It cost $11.60 for both sausages including delivery and service fee. Uber said $3.50 for every sausage would be donated to Australian Red Cross partners, to the maximum value of $10,500.

The products arrived in less than 30 minutes, in green boxes which read “democracy sausage delivered”. Inside the boxes were a single sausage on a piece of white bread, sauce sachets and another quote reading “exercise your democratic bite”.

The sausages, which were reasonably cold, were contained in a sheet designed to look like ballot paper. But rather than listing candidates, the paper ticked the customer's preferences for sauces, onion and variety of sausage, with a disclaimer noting “this is not an official voting form”.

The managing director of Uber Eats Australia, Ed Kitchen, said “thousands” of Australians were likely to miss out on democracy sausages as not every polling place had a barbecue.

“For those of you able to make use of a local sausage sizzle, I strongly encourage you to support the community fundraising efforts first and foremost – that's what I'll be doing,” he said.

The company enlisted celebrity chef Iain “Huey” Hewitson to promote the deal. He said he was “pleased to don my sausage suspenders to help ensure finding a democracy sausage is obtainable this year in areas where the local school might not be turning over these tasty morsels”.

Some social media users raised their eyebrows at Uber capitalising on the trend.

Many polling centres are located at schools, which take the opportunity to fundraise by offering a barbecue, cake stall, or selling plants or books.

“That is so unAustralian,” one user posted on Facebook. “Schools or community groups are meant to make a few dollars selling a sausage sizzle. Not some big corporations.”

Another labelled it a “thoughtless tone deaf publicity stunt”, while a third simply wrote: “who wants a cold limp sausage? It's democracy manifest.”

The democracy sausage has grown in popularity in recent years and was listed as the word of the year by the Australian National Dictionary Centre in 2016, cementing its place in the Australian lexicon.

Alex Dawson from the Democracy Sausage project had uploaded more than 1,600 sausage stalls and other stands operating around the nation to its grassroots website days out from the election, 900 more than the last federal election in 2022.

There were reports of election day sausage sizzles at every continent in the globe this year – including Antarctica.

According to Kate Armstrong at the Museum of Australian Democracy (MoAD), the term “democracy sausage” was coined around 2010 when a Snag Votes website first listed and mapped polling places offering a sausage in bread.

“The popularity of the democracy sausage is in part due to voting being compulsory in Australia,” she said.

“Polling places are typically primary schools and community halls, and polling days are on Saturday … naturally this presents an ideal opportunity for local associations and parents and friends' groups to fundraise by setting up food- or refreshment-based activities around their polling place.

“Early on it was cakes, jams and even crafts, but with the rise in popularity of the portable gas barbecue in the ‘80s, this extended to the much-loved Aussie sausage sizzle.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US intelligence agency videos target lowly officials who are trapped working for a wealthy corrupt elite and whose fate is ‘precarious' 

The CIA is on a recruitment drive for foreign spies. In their sights are Chinese officials and workers, who the US intelligence agency hopes to turn against Beijing via some newly released glossy videos.

The two videos touch on probable anxieties among some inside the Communist party machine – getting stuck in a lowly job assisting an increasingly wealthy corrupt official, or becoming victim to the endless purges that have targeted millions of party members at all levels since Xi Jinping came to power.

“As I rise within the party, I watch those above me being discarded like worn-out shoes, but now I realise that my fate was just as precarious as theirs,” a narrator says in one video, adding that he must protect his family whose fate is tied to his.

In another, the narrator declares: “Our leaders' failure to fulfil repeated promises of prosperity has become a well-known secret … It's time I start working towards my own dreams.”

The two Chinese-language videos released on Thursday come as trade hostilities between the two superpowers continue to spiral. Accessible on Youtube, they are titled in Chinese: “Why I contacted the CIA: to take control of my fate” and “Why I contacted the CIA: for a better life”.

“Do you have any information about economic, fiscal, or trade policies?” the CIA asks in the caption.

“Do you work in the defence industry? Do you work in national security, diplomacy, science, advanced technology, or deal with people who work in these fields? Please contact us. The information you can provide is important and we value your insights on these topics.”

The videos end with encrypted contact information for the agency.

The campaign follows earlier efforts which began in October, with instructions posted online for potential assets in China, Iran and North Korea to get in touch with the CIA. The agency has said it has had previous success enlisting Russians.

“If it weren't working, we wouldn't be making more videos,” a CIA official told Reuters, which said officials were confident the videos were getting past China's strict internet controls.

In recent weeks Russian military recruitment videos have spread across Chinese social media, looking for mercenaries to fight in its war on Ukraine, but it's not clear if Chinese authorities have allowed those videos to spread or simply been unable to stop them.

The CIA has a particular focus on rebuilding an espionage network inside China. A couple of years before Xi came to power in 2012, China's ministry of state security reportedly dismantled a US spy ring, jailing and executing at least a dozen CIA assets.

In return, China has strengthened anti-espionage laws and encouraged citizens to carefully monitor and report the suspicious activities of those around them.

The US now considers China to be its most serious military and cyber threat.

“It is intent on dominating the world economically, militarily, and technologically,” CIA director John Ratcliffe said in a statement. “Our agency must continue responding to this threat with urgency, creativity, and grit, and these videos are just one of the ways we are doing this.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The memory of blood dripping from trucks loaded with the mangled bodies of US soldiers arriving at a nearby war cemetery from the battlefield in 1945 still gives 91-year-old Marcel Schmetz nightmares.

It also instilled a lifelong sense of gratitude for the young soldiers from the US and around the world who gave their lives fighting to end World War II. Schmetz even built a museum at his home in the Belgian Ardennes to honor their sacrifice.

“If the Americans hadn't come, we wouldn't be here,” the Belgian retiree said.

That same spirit also pervades Normandy in northern France, where the allied forces landed on June 6, 1944, a day that became the tipping point of the war.

ETERNAL GRATITUDE

In Normandy, Marie-Pascale Legrand is still taking care of the ailing Charles Shay, a 100-year-old American who stormed the bloodied beaches on that fateful “D-Day” as a teenager and fought to help liberate Europe for many more months.

“Gratitude for me means that I am eternally indebted, because I can live free today,” Legrand said.

It would take almost another year of fierce fighting before Germany would surrender on May 8, 1945. Commemorations and festivities are planned for the 80th anniversary across much of the continent for what has become known as Victory in Europe Day, or V-E Day.

FRAYING BONDS

Ever since, for generation upon generation in the nations west of the “Iron Curtain” that sliced Europe in two, it became a day to confirm and reconfirm what were long seen as the unbreakable bonds with the US as the two stood united against Soviet Eastern Europe.

No more. Over the past several months, the rhetoric from Washington has become increasingly feisty.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has questioned the vestiges of the decades-old alliance and slapped trade sanctions on the 27-nation EU and the UK. Trump has insisted that the EU trade bloc was there to “screw” the US from the start.

The wartime allies are now involved in a trade war.

“After all that has happened, it is bound to leave scars,” Ghent University European studies professor Hendrik Vos said.

HONORING THE FALLEN

Yet deep in the green hills and Ardennes woods where the Battle of the Bulge was fought and Schmetz lives, just as along the windswept bluffs of Legrand's Normandy, the ties endure — isolated from the tremors of geopolitics.

“For all those that criticize the Americans, we can only say that for us, they were all good,” Schmetz said. “We should never forget that.”

After watching the horrors of the dead soldiers at the nearby Henri-Chapelle cemetery as an 11-year-old, Schmetz vowed he would do something in their honor and gathered war memorabilia.

A car mechanic with a big warehouse, he immediately started to turn it into the “Remember Museum 39-45” once he retired more than three decades ago.

For the treasure trove of military artifacts, what truly stands out is a long bench in the kitchen where US veterans, their children and their grandchildren come and sit and talk about what happened, and the bonds uniting continent, memories all meticulously kept by his wife Mathilde, to pass on to new visitors and new generations of schoolkids.

Shay, who is now bedridden in Normandy, was part of the 1st Infantry Division and came through the Ardennes region before heading to Germany. He started making visits to the D-Day beaches about two decades ago. 

He became increasingly sick over the years, and Legrand took him in to her home in 2018. 

REAGAN'S IMPACT

The moment everything changed for Legrand was listening to then-US president Ronald Reagan in 1984 speaking on a Normandy bluff of the sacrifice and heroism of American soldiers.

Barely in her 20s, she realized that “their blood is in our soil and we have to show gratitude. We have to do something. I didn't know what at the time, but I knew I would do something to show it.”

She had long volunteered to help Allied veterans before she met Shay. He was lonely, sick and frail when she took him in and began caring for him at her Normandy home.

“It is a strong symbol, which takes on a new dimension in this day and age,” she said, referring to the tumultuous trans-Atlantic relations that have put the bonds between allies that Trump called “unbreakable” only six years ago, under extreme pressure.

Central in Trump's criticism of European NATO allies is that they have happily hunkered far too long under US military supremacy since World War II and should start paying much more of their own way in the alliance. He has done so in such terms that many Europeans sincerely fear the break-up of the trans-Atlantic bonds that were a core of global politics for almost a century.

“The naive belief that the Americans will, by definition, always be an ally — once and for all, that is gone,” Vos said. It also raises a moral question for Europeans now.

“Are we doomed to be eternally grateful?” Vos asked.

TRUMP EFFECT: 
                                        The win capped one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian political history after the Conservatives had led the Liberals by more than 20 points                                        Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney yesterday pledged to win US President Donald Trump's trade war after winning Canada's election and leading his Liberal Party to another term in power.
Following a campaign dominated by Trump's tariffs and annexation threats, Carney promised to chart “a new path forward” in a world “fundamentally changed” by a US that is newly hostile to free trade.
“We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,” said Carney, who led the central banks of Canada and the UK before entering politics earlier this year.
“We will win this trade war and

Next week's conclave to elect the successor to Pope Francis as leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics is a solemn affair steeped in centuries-old traditions, but far from the Sistine Chapel where cloistered cardinals are to cast votes, people are placing bets on who would be chosen as the next pope. 

From cash bets on Web sites to online games modeled after fantasy football leagues and casual wagers among friends and families, the popularity of guessing and gambling on the future of the papacy is increasing worldwide, experts and participants say.

It has even topped the Europa League soccer tournament and Formula One drivers' championship, said Sam Eaton, UK manager for Oddschecker, an online platform analyzing odds across sports, events and other betting markets.

“There's a huge level of interest globally,” he said. “I don't think we've had a market like this where we've had so many countries interested in seeing odds.”

Around the world, thousands of bets on the next pope

Hundreds of thousands of people from some 140 countries have visited Oddschecker to review each cardinal's chances of becoming the next pope, Eaton said. 

In the UK, about ￡30,000 (US$39,813) has been wagered with one leading online betting platform as of this week, Eaton said, with the conclave days away.

Betting on elections, papal conclaves and all manner of global events is almost a tradition of its own in the UK, but such betting is not legal in the US. BetMGM, one of the world's top sports-betting companies, said it would not have any bets up.

In the unregulated, illegal space, one of the biggest sites has US$10 million wagered so far in pope bets, Eaton said.

In Italy, betting on the papal election — and all religious events — is forbidden.

Some people in Rome are making friendly, informal wagers — the equivalent of US$20 on a favorite cardinal, with the loser pledging to host a dinner or buy a pizza night out.

Others are turning to an online game called Fantapapa, or Fantasy Pope, which mimics popular fantasy football and soccer leagues. More than 60,000 people are playing, each choosing 11 cardinals — as if for a soccer team — whom they believe have the best shot at becoming the next pope.

They also draft the top contender, or captain. As with online wagers, the No. 1 choice for fantasy players has been Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, closely followed by Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle.

“It's a really fun game to play with friends and have a laugh,” Italian student Federico La Rocca, 23, said. “Initially my dad sent it to me ironically, but now that it's going to be the conclave, I decided to have a go and try it.”

La Rocca said he chose Tagle because “he looks like a nice guy and fun person.”

Players' selections determine the number of points they rake in, but what is the jackpot?

“Eternal glory,” said Mauro.

No fixtures were played on Friday or Saturday because of the funeral of Pope Francis in Rome, meaning the full round of Serie A matches took place on Sunday and yesterday. 
Matias Soule's first-half strike for Roma knocked Inter off top spot earlier in the day before new Napoli opened up a three-point buffer with victory in Sunday's

Japanese delegation visits 

A five-member parliamentary delegation from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is scheduled to meet with President William Lai (賴清德) during a four-day visit to Taiwan that runs through Tuesday. The delegation, led by former Japanese minister of economy, trade and industry Yasutoshi Nishimura, a member of the lower house of the Japanese Diet, would also meet with former president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement yesterday. Nishimura is joined by four other LDP representatives: Kosaburo Nishime, Kazuo Yana, Hajime Sasaki and Ryusho Kato, the ministry said. Nishimura, 62, has also served as Japanese minister of state for economic and fiscal policy and as minister of economic revitalization. He promoted bilateral cooperation between Taiwan and Japan in the semiconductor industry while heading the economy and trade office from 2022 to 2023, the ministry said. The delegation is also scheduled to visit the Hsinchu Science Park and meet with Minister of Economic Affairs J.W. Kuo (郭智輝), it said.

Coffin exhibit returns 

Five graduating students from Chinese Culture University yesterday brought back their thought-provoking “coffin experience” exhibit at Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab (C-LAB), following high demand after its initial presentation in March. The team, which call themselves “Wanderers,” are from the university's Department of Mass Communication. Through photography, they explore the themes of life and death, inviting visitors to lie in an actual coffin to contemplate their own mortality. The students said that by breaking the taboo of encountering coffins only in the context of death, they aim to create a space for visitors to reflect on what truly matters in life — who they love and what remains unsaid. The exhibit, which first debuted at the “Wetland” art space in Taipei in March, attracted about 500 visitors in two days and sparked online discussion. The exhibit would be featured as part of the department's graduation show, “ViewFinder.” The show is to run from 10am to 7pm today on the second floor of the C-LAB Library Exhibition Space in Taipei.

Shen Ming-shih (沈明室), a researcher at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said he made the assessment after two Japanese military experts warned of emerging threats from China based on a drill conducted this month by the Chinese People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Eastern Theater Command.

A Russian Su-30 fighter jet was destroyed by a sea drone strike carried out by Ukraine's military intelligence, marking the first time a sea drone takes down a jet, Ukraine's military intelligence said on May 3.

The intelligence agency, HUR, said the unprecedented operation took place on May 2 near the Russian port of Novorossiysk in the Black Sea and published the video of the strike. The strike was carried out by Group 13, a special unit within HUR, using a Magura sea drone equipped with a missile warhead.

""This is the world's first destruction of a combat aircraft by a naval drone,"" the statement read.

The Kyiv Independent can't independently confirm the Ukrainian intelligence report.

The multi-role Su-30 fighter, valued at approximately $50 million, was reportedly hit in midair and crashed into the sea.

The operation was conducted in coordination with Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) and the country's defense forces, according to the intelligence agency.

Ukraine had previously used the Magura V5 drone to down two Russian Mi-8 helicopters on Dec. 31, 2024, in what was then considered a world-first drone strike on airborne targets from the sea.

Overnight on May 3, local Russian officials claimed that a Ukrainian drone attack on Krasnodar Krai injured four people, and damaged homes and a grain terminal in Novorossiysk. A state of emergency was declared in the city, while the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that over 170 Ukrainian drones and several naval drones were intercepted across Crimea and the Black Sea.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

On this World Press Freedom Day, stand with those who bring you the truth.

“How do we continue convincing our few remaining allies that journalists' work is important?”

Last month, I was sitting on stage at the International Journalism Festival in Perugia, Europe's biggest journalism conference, when I heard this question from an audience member.

The answer came to me fast. 

“Point at who is killing journalists,” I suggested.

I then reminded the room about the case of Viktoriia Roshchyna, a Ukrainian journalist killed in Russian captivity. She took a huge risk to go into occupied territories to report about Russian torture chambers there — only to end up in one. In October 2024, her family was told she died in captivity, a month earlier. 

Since then, two separate journalistic investigations found that Viktoriia was subjected to torture and abuse. Everything points to the fact that she was killed — whether they murdered her last Septmber, or slowly killed her through months of abuse, torture, and starvation. 

She was only 27 years old. 

“If Russia, a huge authoritarian country, was so afraid of this small woman that they killed her in prison — all because she was a journalist,” I said, “then journalists must be doing something very important — something that the worst people of this world are really afraid of.”

While I was speaking on that stage, I didn't yet know that Viktoriia's body was already in Ukraine. Russia returned it in February, but it was in a condition that made it difficult to identify. The body was missing a number of organs, including the brain, eyes, and trachea, and was initially marked as male. An impressive collaborative investigation by several newsrooms found the details of her imprisonment, and mentioned that the missing organs point to an attempt to hide the fact that she died from asphyxia. 

A few people on the Kyiv Independent's team knew Viktoriia. Some worked with her in other publications, others knew her through friends — Kyiv's media crowd is relatively tight. I didn't know her personally but by now, it almost feels like I did — because of how many personal tributes to her I have read.

Viktoriia put herself in mortal danger by going into Russian-occupied territory because she believed that finding out the truth was worth the risk. One of her former colleagues said it was almost like she couldn't believe that something bad could happen to her because of how enormously important the mission to find out the truth was.

It's a dark irony that Russia is, in a way, on the same page. Authoritarian regimes recognize the weight of truth, the power of real story — and that's why, everywhere in the world, they make truth their target number one. 

For Russia, it meant killing Viktoriia to discourage others from finding out the truth about its treatment of Ukrainian civilians in the occupied territories. That truth — the persecution, forced Russification, torture and killings — doesn't fit well into Russia's narrative that claims they are liberating these territories. 

These revelations could be especially damaging to Russia now that ceasefire negotiations are underway, and where it unfortunately appears the U.S. is ready to recognize Russian control over occupied Ukrainian territories — completely disregarding the fate of the millions of Ukrainians living there.

Russia tried to silence Viktoriia Roshchyna — instead, it proved her right.

Oppression of press freedom is by far not limited to Russia — the latest Press Freedom Index, released every year by Reporters Without Borders for World Press Freedom Day on May 3, shows an alarming picture. The overall level of press freedom globally is the lowest since the start of the index in 2002. 

One major factor is the deteriorating economic climate in the media sector. In Ukraine, it was especially felt earlier this year, when the new U.S. administration abruptly ended USAID projects around the world. In Ukraine, U.S. grants funded many media outlets, including small front-line newspapers and prominent teams behind anti-corruption investigations. Grants like those cut came without interference in the content produced by the media — allowing them to maintain independence while paying their bills. 

I wrote about it here. Since then, the Kyiv Independent held a fundraiser to help local outlets in areas near the front lines. Our community rose to the occasion in the most inspiring way — and we were able to quickly give some bridge funding to three newsrooms. 

The Kyiv Independent itself is one of very few independent media outlets that wasn't affected by the U.S. grant cuts because we are lucky enough to be backed by our readers. As of today, 17,500 people from around the world are members of the Kyiv Independent — they stand with us in our mission to bring the truth about Ukraine and Russia's crimes to the world, and we are immensely grateful to them.

As I'm writing this on World Press Freedom Day, looking at the dispiriting assessments of the state of free press globally, I keep coming back to them. 

That gives me a ray of hope in the otherwise gloomy landscape — our community reminds me that press freedom has enough champions for the truth to not be subdued. And while some of the worst and most powerful people in the world are keen to end free press, some of the best are standing up to defend it.

If you're reading this, consider supporting free press today. Pick a newsroom you believe in. Buy a subscription, a membership, or donate. If you can, donate to a Ukrainian newsroom.

There are many who can't afford to pay for the news — and every donation means that people in any circumstances can have access to truthful information.

If you can't afford a subscription or donation, those aren't the only things you can do to show your support. Write a short email with words of encouragement to a newsroom you follow. It always means a lot to receive them. My inbox is a curious mix of “Die, Ukrainian propagandists. Russia will win!” and “You're doing a great job, thank you so much!” — but there are many, many more of the latter kind. 

And if you already are one of the many champions of free press worldwide — on behalf of our team, thank you. We are doing something right — together. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy spoke to U.S. Vice President JD Vance on May 2, during which the two leaders discussed Russia's war against Ukraine.

Following intensified efforts to broker a peace settlement to end Russia's war against Ukraine, the U.S. has said it will scale back its role as a mediator. ""We are not going to fly around the world at the drop of a hat... that is now between the two parties,"" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on May 1.

Lammy condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin for failing to engage in meaningful talks to end Russia's war against Ukraine. 

""Putin has stalled and hampered discussions for long enough. The world is losing patience,"" Lammy said.

The U.S. and the U.K. are committed to ending Russia's war against Ukraine, Lammy said. Ukraine's allies met in London on April 23, where they discussed reaching a peace settlement.

""(W)e reaffirmed our shared desire for an end to Russia's barbaric invasion of Ukraine and our commitment to a lasting peace,"" Lammy said.

Lammy and U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey met with Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov at the London meeting on April 23.

""We are grateful to the U.K. for its leadership and support. We will discuss ways to strengthen Ukraine and guarantee long-term peace and security,"" Sybiha said.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre speaks to supporters on election night in Ottawa on April 29.Chris Young/The Canadian Press

In the very early hours of Tuesday morning, Pierre Poilievre delivered an extraordinary speech to the few hundred Conservative faithful still gathered in the loveless embrace of a slick downtown Ottawa convention centre. 

It reminded me of something else I once saw, but we'll get to that.

By the time Mr. Poilievre appeared on election night, several seats were still in flux, but it was clear that Canada's next government would be Liberal. Again. Somehow. Incredibly.

The Conservative Leader delivered an election result better than expected, given how Donald Trump upended the political landscape. And that outcome was nowhere near the crushing Conservative majority that seemed certain just months ago, when Mr. Poilievre was the prime minister in-waiting and the actual prime minister was a dead man walking. 

But Mr. Poilievre did not arrive on the stage in that room full of blue to deliver a concession speech. After paying tribute to his wife, Anaida, he thanked Conservative candidates, volunteers and supporters, and then laid it on the line immediately: I'm not going anywhere, and this isn't over. 

“It will be an honour to continue to fight for you and to be a champion of your cause as we go forward,” Mr. Poilievre told the party that had chucked its past two leaders out a window after a single election loss. 

Opinion: The good and unnecessarily bad of Pierre Poilievre

He emphasized that Canadians had voted for “a razor-thin minority government, a virtual tie in the vote count,” though by morning, that wouldn't be the case. Mr. Poilievre congratulated Prime Minister Mark Carney, and when the crowd booed, the Conservative Leader quelled them by saying the time would come to hold the government to account, but the country came first. 

“Conservatives will work with the Prime Minister and all parties with the common goal of defending Canada's interests and getting a new trade deal that puts these tariffs behind us, while protecting our sovereignty and the Canadian people,” Mr. Poilievre said.

Somewhere, there's an alternate universe in which he said that or something similarly magnanimous back in November or March or two weeks ago. It‘s hard not to wonder what might have changed if he had. 

He outlined how the loss was really a win if you looked at it right, telling his fellow Tories that they had “much to celebrate,” gaining more than 20 seats and landing the largest share of the popular vote since Brian Mulroney's 1988 landslide. 

“We hear your stories, we will carry those stories with us into Parliament,” he said. He must have known, even as he said it, that he had lost his own Carleton riding to a newbie Liberal and wouldn't be returning to the House of Commons himself, at least not right away. 

There was another time when that sprawling suburban-rural region on the edge of Ottawa voted for an upstart and turfed a political veteran. 

The day after that election, in 2004, CPAC interviewed a panel of newly elected MPs, and the host began by introducing the Conservative rookie who had just toppled Liberal cabinet minister David Pratt as “a bit of a giant killer.” And there sat 25-year-old Mr. Poilievre, with chubby cheeks, owlish glasses and a too-big suit jacket. 

Canadian voters had just handed a bedraggled Liberal government a fourth-term minority, and the newly united Conservatives under Stephen Harper had come up short of expectations. When the host asked about this, that freshman version of Mr. Poilievre instantly framed that loss as a victory, too: It was the best popular vote a centre-right party had achieved since 1988, he said, and they'd gained more seats than anyone else.

He argued that this new Parliament needed to democratize things, because there had been a corrosive concentration of power in the Prime Minister's Office. And he wanted to “give people the right to fire their members of Parliament by petition if they break their word,” which he would propose in a private member's bill.

“That‘s exactly the genius of our party, is that you have the ability to speak up as an individual member of Parliament,” he said, adding, “These are the kinds of things that Liberal members of Parliament are not able to do because of the intense party discipline that comes down from the top.”

Earlier this year, Mr. Poilievre told Jordan Peterson that he's never changed his mind on anything. And it is certainly some kind of remarkable that the same points he was raising in teenage letters to the editor or an undergraduate essay about becoming prime minister are, almost verbatim, how he fought this election campaign to try to land that job in real life. 

But it‘s not quite true that all of his ideas are bolted to the floor. He used to believe that there was too much top-down control of MPs, and then at some point, he became a party leader who refused to allow local candidates to do interviews or debates, and doled out speaking time to his caucus as a reward for following instructions. 

Sometimes, it seems, we grow in ways that surprise even us. 

The real message that the present-day Mr. Poilievre wanted to bring home on election night was the idea he underlined over and over again: A big shift doesn't happen all at once, and you have to be patient enough to let it unfold.

In that inky postmidnight hour, when they were still tallying the ballots but the answer that counted was already clear, Mr. Poilievre was trying to persuade his party that this result, in all its hijacked strangeness, was a down payment on a victory deferred. He was good for the rest if they would just wait a while and put their knife-sharpening kits away. 

“I know that some of you might be disappointed that change did not get over the finish line tonight. Change takes time,” he said. “Most of all, it requires that we never give up, because our people and our country are worth fighting for.”

This wasn't something 25-year-old Pierre Poilievre had given attention to in that long-ago interview. The way time stretches and slips, and the value of second chances, doesn't shape a young man's view of the world like it does when you're older.

The CEO of Canadian Pacific Kansas City, the first North American railway, is pitching his trains as a way for businesses in Canada and Mexico to bypass Trump's America. Will they take him up on it?

In late March, a train hauling rail cars filled with oats set out from a mill north of Regina and headed for the United States.

No surprise there. Each year, the U.S. imports roughly $500-million worth of the nutrient-rich cereal grain from Canada, making it the largest market for Canadian oats by far. Nearly every oat product Americans consume hails from the Canadian Prairies, whether that‘s oat milk in their lattes, as cereal or as the key ingredient in “Oatzempic,” a blended beverage popular with the TikTok weight-loss crowd.

But the train, operated by Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd., didn't unload its freight in the U.S. Instead, it sped right through the country to its final stop deep in Mexico, which has emerged as a fast-growing alternative market for Canadian oats.

For CPKC chief executive officer Keith Creel, the debut of the 4,800-kilometre oat express from Canada to Mexico – the first single-line service of its kind that requires no interchanges or rail transfers – represents an emerging bright spot for the railway and many of its customers at a time of extreme uncertainty.

A “land bridge” across America for 

Canada-Mexico trade

When Canadian Pacific first proposed a merger with Kansas City Southern, the goal was to create the first and only North American rail network and benefit from tighter integration between Canada, the United States and Mexico. Now with the U.S. trade war, CPKC is pitching itself as a “land bridge” for companies in Canada and Mexico to bypass America and trade with each other. In recent months, a number of products have started to move between the two countries along its tracks.

Born out of the 2023 tie-up between Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern (KCS), CPKC became the only rail network to seamlessly connect Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. It was a US$27-billion bet that CPKC would reap decades of profits from an increasingly integrated North American market, with the powerful U.S. economy at the centre of it all.

Then Trump 2.0 happened, and CPKC, like all railways that haul goods across borders, has been left scrambling to deal with the tariff fallout. CPKC‘s solution, for its Canadian and Mexican customers at least, is to now help them bypass the U.S. altogether and trade more with each other.

CPKC head says railway can withstand a trade war ignited by Trump

“We‘ve become a land bridge across America,” said Mr. Creel in an interview. He rhymed off some of the other products CPKC has recently begun hauling between the two markets, including aluminum, refined fuels, French fries, furniture and fruit.

It‘s a strategy that, to fully succeed, depends on the long-neglected trading relationship between Canada and Mexico sparking to life. That‘s no easy task. After all, with such a large consumer magnet sitting between them, businesses in both countries have naturally gravitated to the U.S., largely ignoring each other in the process.

But as U.S. President Donald Trump tries to force manufacturers and producers to move their operations from Canada and Mexico to the U.S. by erecting tariffs to discourage imports, a scramble is on to find customers and suppliers in new markets away from the U.S.

“This crisis has created uncertainty but, at the same time, it‘s been a huge motivation to create new trade opportunities that frankly would not have occurred for a decade or even longer,” said Mr. Creel. So, after years of shipping Canadian and Mexican goods into the U.S., “now we're connecting the bookends.”

From the start, Mr. Creel has framed the creation of CPKC in historic, continent-building terms. Just last year the company celebrated the deal by running restored steam locomotive 2816 from Calgary to Mexico City and back, with a stop at the Kansas City, Mo., yard where the CP and KCS rail networks connected and where Mr. Creel had previously hammered a ceremonial last spike.

And having watched businesses rush to bring their supply chains closer to home amid the COVID-19 pandemic, in a process known as nearshoring or friendshoring, Mr. Creel's resolve only strengthened. As he told investors during one 2022 conference call, “there‘s never been a greater need for positive free trade between Mexico, Canada and the United States.”

Of course, with Mr. Trump rhetorically eviscerating America‘s northern and southern allies and erecting tariff barriers against them, much of the pre-Nov. 5, 2024 world of global trade can seem otherworldly.

To be clear, Mr. Creel doesn't for a moment believe the concept of North America as a deeply-intertwined trading bloc will come to an end, despite Mr. Trump‘s apparent best efforts. The practicalities and market efficiencies that bind the three countries are too powerful, he said, while the threat from global rivals such as China means “we all will still need each other.”

Nevertheless, the dynamic between the U.S. and its trading partners will be changed by Mr. Trump, Mr. Creel predicted, with each country becoming “stronger and more independent.” And CPKC can “uniquely enable and uniquely facilitate” that body-building exercise with its single-line rail network, allowing shippers to seamlessly move bonded freight across the U.S. without the need to clear American customs, faster than trucks or rival railways can.

Trade is massively important to the railway. In 2024, roughly 41 per cent of the company's $14.2-billion in revenue was generated by cross-border traffic.

That uncertainty has been reflected in CPKC‘s stock price, which has been battered down since Mr. Trump won last November‘s election, though the company has fared better than many other railways.

One reason for the relative outperformance is the flexibility the CPKC deal has given the combined company to develop trade corridors that didn't exist prior to the merger, said Will Guy, an analyst at Veritas Investment Research who covers CPKC and has a “buy” recommendation on the stock.

On Wednesday, CPKC reported its first-quarter results, which beat expectations in part because of new Canada-Mexico direct trade.

“With the optionality of touching all three nations and having access to multiple ports, the company has quite a number of growth levers it can pull,” said Mr. Guy.

“You‘re seeing that with the land bridge between Canada and Mexico.”

The oat-laden train that left Saskatchewan in March isn't the only new product being hauled from Canada to Mexico on CPKC‘s rails.

In mid-March, the railway began moving weekly loads of Mexico-bound frozen French fries produced in Alberta by McCain Foods Ltd. to Laredo, Tex. For now, the fries are offloaded there and put on trucks for the final leg into Mexico because the railway does not have cold storage capabilities there.

That will change soon. Later this year the company is aiming to open its first refrigerated facility in Mexico in co-operation with Americold Realty Trust Inc., with other chilled warehouses underway in Kansas City and at the port in Saint John.

For McCain, the new rail infrastructure “is a positive step that enables greater flexibility and resilience in our supply chains, supporting export growth and helping us respond to evolving trade dynamics,” said Charlie Angelakos, vice-president of global external affairs and sustainability, in an e-mail, noting Mexico has long been an important market for the company.

Meanwhile, CPKC has begun carrying liquid petroleum gas (such as propane), refined fuels and plastics from the Edmonton area to Mexico. In recent months, those products have added roughly $100-million in new business for CPKC “that would not have existed before,” said Mr. Creel.

The trade benefits flow the other way, too, with trainloads full of fruits and vegetables, home appliances and furniture regularly departing Mexico for Canada, where they can provide cheaper alternatives to American-made goods that are subject to Canada‘s countertariffs.

In a recent investor presentation, Mr. Creel said CPKC had begun moving Mexican produce into Canada for Loblaw Cos. Ltd. In February, the grocery chain's CEO, Per Bank, posted on social media about its trade war response, writing that for products it has had to purchase from the U.S., “we will look for alternatives including products from Mexico which has also been subjected to these unnecessary tariffs.”

It‘s not that these are the first or only shipments to move between Canada and Mexico tariff-free. Railways have long partnered to move bonded freight using each other's tracks.

However, that type of arrangement is more susceptible to interchange delays where the railways' tracks meet, said Mr. Guy at Veritas.

“The general rule of thumb in railroading is the more you have to touch a car, the more expensive that freight is,” he said.

The question is, then, are we seeing the start of a flourishing new trading relationship, or just a temporary Trump-induced blip?

It‘s remarkable how little trade flows directly between Canada and Mexico, especially considering the countries are signatories to not one, but two free trade deals – the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement as well as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. Mexico also has a younger population than Canada, a sizable consumer market and a growing middle class.

“They're our biggest trading partner's biggest trading partner,” said Shauna Hemingway, a former Canadian ambassador to the Dominican Republic and deputy head of mission in Mexico City, who serves as a senior special adviser to the Business Council of Canada.

Yet Canada and Mexico currently account for only a tiny slice of each other‘s exports and imports, far less than what their relative populations would suggest. Canada is roughly one-tenth the size of the U.S. by population, yet we buy just 3 per cent of Mexico‘s exports.

The export picture the other way is even more meagre. Mexico has close to 40 per cent of America‘s population, yet it takes in just 1.1 per cent of our total exports.

And that includes the flow of motor vehicles and auto parts, which account for nearly one-third of Canada‘s exports to Mexico and close to half of all imports from Mexico.

Those numbers may not reflect all the goods flowing between the two countries since the U.S. plays a middleman role, said Shawn Doyle, principal of the Latin America practice at McCarthy Tetrault, who is based in Chile.

“Whether captured by stats or not, there is some amount of indirect trade that should now become direct trade,” he said.

The sorry state of Canada-Mexico trade is reflected in CPKC‘s own freight records. Goods moving from Canada to Mexico and vice versa on its tracks accounted for only a combined 2 per cent of the railway's freight revenue last year.

While Canadian politics has come alive with a sense of multipartisan urgency to limit our trade exposure to the U.S., it‘s not clear Mexicans feel the same. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in early March her country may have to “look to Canada and other countries” if U.S. tariffs continue, but Mexico's response has been subdued.

One reason for the less-panicked tone is experience.

“It‘s new for Canada to be a topic in U.S. politics, but Mexico has been a piñata in U.S. elections since I was a teenager,” said Eduardo Suarez, vice-president of Latin America economics at Bank of Nova Scotia.

Mr. Creel, an American-born CEO of a railway with deep Canadian roots that date back to Confederation, finds himself navigating a tense political line in all this.

“I've lived in three provinces, I've worked in Canada for two decades, I uniquely understand the Canadian pride in the flag, in the country and it's sovereignty and I understand how offensive that rhetoric is,” he said of Mr. Trump's threats to annex Canada.

However, America also faces “undeniable societal problems”, said Mr. Creel, pointing to illegal immigration, open borders and the fentanyl crisis. “Those issues are getting addressed in a way that, as shocking as it is, it's necessary.”

That doesn't mean he expected this level of disruption. “The gravity of the trade imbalances and President Trump's focus on rebalancing them through the use of tariffs was not expected to the standard he‘s set,” said Mr. Creel.

“But as a leader you get paid to produce, not make excuses.”

While some Canadian goods have started to flow to Mexico, it‘s not a simple process for businesses to diversify their supply chains.

“If you have a tense period with the Americans, you can‘t just start diversification that day, it can take years before you see an outcome,” said Meredith Lilly, a professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs.

Oats are a case in point.

When Shawna Mathieson became executive director of the Prairie Oat Growers Association early last decade, 97 per cent of all Canadian oat exports went to the U.S., a concentration that “raised a huge red flag as not sustainable,” she said.

The organization launched a campaign aimed at Mexico in 2014, including an annual recipe contest using oats – winners included oat tortillas to oatmeal churros – and collaborating with health care workers to promote oat consumption as a way to manage diabetes, the leading cause of death in Mexico.

Since then, oat exports to Mexico have nearly quadrupled in volume, worth an average of $29-million annually over the past five years.

CPKC‘s direct rail route is a welcome alternative for future shipments she said – previously some shippers loaded oats on trains bound for Vancouver to be transferred to ships for the journey to Mexico.

Meanwhile, there are still plenty of other areas Canada and Mexico can boost direct trade, said Ms. Hemingway. Simply put, we sell a lot of the same goods to China that Mexico imports from China, she said, such as fertilizer and machinery.

“There is a lot of overlap in many sectors that are an opportunity for us to keep more of the trade in North America,” she said.

Given the urgent need for trade diversification and Canada‘s meagre success to date tapping the Mexican market, governments should take a more active role to spur businesses to think beyond America, said Mr. Creel, who is just beginning to take that message to federal and provincial governments.

“If you want a new market for Canadian manufacturing to protect Canadian jobs, why not create a market in Mexico?” he said.

For instance, he suggested a temporary tax incentive for exporters that develop net new business beyond the U.S. “It doesn't have to be forever, but once you create these markets and this new muscle memory, some of this will stick,” he said.

Experts see room for such incentives. “If it‘s important for Canadian society to increase trade diversification for the long term, we do have to create incentives,” said Prof. Lilly, whether that‘s a tax incentive or investing more in trade infrastructure that encourages diversification.

Whatever the case, she said it‘s imperative that newly-elected Prime Minister Mark Carney “pick up the phone and reset relations” with Ms. Sheinbaum, particularly in the wake of comments by Ontario Premier Doug Ford and others who argue Canada and the U.S. should consider excluding Mexico from the USMCA, which is up for renegotiation next year.

As for Mr. Creel, now that the Canadian election is over, he said he believes the USMCA talks will be pulled forward to this year, allowing businesses that have been hurt by uncertainty, including his, to begin to plan and invest again. On May 6, Mr. Carney is set to have his first meeting as Prime Minister with Mr. Trump in Washington.

“There are all kinds of scenarios in this thing where I think when it all shakes out, we all get stronger as a result,” he said. But the trade war may finally have given Canadian businesses the push they needed to look further beyond the U.S. market.

“We're never going to get away from the United States – it‘s too big of an opportunity and too important to our prosperity in Canada. But becoming a little less reliant on America is a good thing.”

The Indian government said the ban on Pakistani imports is ""imposed in the interest of national security and public policy."" Pakistan meanwhile says it has test fired a ballistic missile.

India on Saturday said it has banned imports of goods originating from or transiting via Pakistan as relations between the two neighboring countries continue to worsen since the recent deadly attack on tourists in the disputed Kashmir region.

India's Directorate General of Foreign Trade said that the ban will take effect immediately.

""Direct or indirect Import or transit of all goods originating in or exported from Pakistan, whether or not freely importable or otherwise permitted, shall be prohibited with immediate effect, until further orders,"" a notification by India's Commerce Ministry read.

""This restriction is imposed in the interest of national security and public policy,"" it added.

Pakistan's military on Saturday meanwhile said it conducted a training launch of a surface-to-surface missile weapons system.

""Pakistan today conducted a successful training launch of the Abdali Weapon System -- a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450 kilometres,"" the military statement read.

""The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile's advanced navigation system and enhanced manoeuvrability features.""

India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed countries, have exchanged gunfire for nine consecutive nights along the militarized Line of Control, the de facto border, according to Indian defense sources.

Islamabad has earlier said it has ""credible intelligence"" that India intends to launch military action.

Following the attack in Kashmir's Pahalgam where 26 tourists were killed, New Delhi and Islamabad closed the Wagah Attari border, which was the sole permissible trade route between the two countries.

India has also suspended the Indus Water Treaty, which governs how water in the Indus basin is shared between India and Pakistan.

While India has blamed Pakistan for backing the attackers, Islamabad has denied responsibility.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he has given his military ""full operational freedom"" to respond to the attack. 

Responding to India's diplomatic action, Pakistan halted all border trade, closed its airspace to Indian flights and expelled Indian diplomats.

Pakistan also warned that the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty by India would be considered an act of war.

The Kashmir region, which is divided but claimed by both India and Pakistan in its entirety, is gripped in fear as the threat of military action looms large.

Trump administration officials have condemned the move by Germany's domestic intelligence agency to designate the far-right AfD party an extremist group, setting off a diplomatic row between the two NATO allies.

Top-ranking officials in US President Donald Trump's administration were quick to criticize Germany's domestic intelligence agency BfV on Friday for designating the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a ""right-wing extremist"" entity.

The agency said the party's positions on ethnicity were incompatible with democracy, noting that the AfD ""aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society.""

It also highlighted the party's use of hateful rhetoric and incitement to undermine democratic institutions.

The BfV had previously designated several local AfD branches as right-wing extremist groups, but it now said it decided to give the entire party the label due to its attempts to ""undermine the free, democratic"" order in the country.

The designation gives authorities greater powers to monitor the party's activities.

The AfD slammed the decision as ""politically motivated.""

It also drew sharp criticism from across the Atlantic, with Trump administration officials slamming the move.

US Vice President JD Vance on Friday accused Germany of rebuilding a ""Berlin Wall.""

""The West tore down the Berlin Wall together. And it has been rebuilt — not by the Soviets or the Russians, but by the German establishment,"" Vance wrote on X.

In February, Vance met with AfD leader Alice Weidel in Munich after delivering a contentious speech at the Munich Security Conference in which he accused European nations of failing to defend free speech, calling out Germany in particular.

Vance complained that the AfD was being ostracized and called for it to end. The US vice president's statements angered officials in Berlin.  

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also waded in on Friday, calling the AfD designation as a right-wing extremist outfit as ""tyranny in disguise.""

""Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition,"" Rubio said on X. ""That's not democracy — it's tyranny in disguise.""

He said ""Germany should reverse course.""

The German Foreign Ministry replied directly to Rubio on X to say: ""This is democracy.""

The ministry said that the ""decision is the result of a thorough and independent investigation to protect our constitution"" and could be appealed.

""We have learnt from our history that right-wing extremism needs to be stopped,"" the ministry said.

The AfD, founded in 2013, has surged in popularity over the past few years by capitalizing on fears over migration.

It is now Germany's largest opposition party, after securing over 20% of the vote in February's election, a record result and behind only the center-right CDU/CSU bloc.

The AfD, however, remains excluded from government due to the other parties' refusal to collaborate with it due to its extremist tendencies.

Recent opinion polls have put the party neck-and-neck or even slightly ahead of the CDU/CSU alliance.

Several lawmakers from across the political spectrum have already been working to get enough support for a ban of the AfD party.

The spy agency's decision now may give that effort new momentum.

Still, legal hurdles to ban a political party are very high in Germany because of the country's history.

As seas rise along South Africa's coastlines, a natural counterforce is at play, drought. New research reveals that parts of the country are slowly lifting out of the ocean due to water loss underground. 

Rising seas threatenSouth Africa's coastlines, battering cities with floods and erosion. Yet in a surprising twist of climate science, the ground beneath parts of the country seems to be rising.

Researchers from Germany believe drought and resulting water loss due to global warming may be causing parts of South Africa to lift out of the ocean by two millimeters each year. 

South Africa's coastal cities like Cape Town, Durban, and Port Elizabeth experience eroding shorelines,frequent flooding, and the loss of critical infrastructure and natural habitats.

The country also experienced a series of extreme weather events in 2017: massive waves, storm surges, heavy rainfall, wildfires, and hurricane-force winds that devastated the southwestern cape. 

The storms resulted in at least eight deaths and damaged 135 schools. Approximately 800 homes in Cape Town were flooded. 

Such incidents underscore the growing risks to South Africa's coastal regions posed by increasing weather hazards, which scientists predict will be more frequent and intense due to rising global temperatures. 

David Willima, an ocean governance policy researcher in South Africa, said integrating climate and ocean concerns at the policy level was important to effectively address the rising sea level threat.

""The problem has been that South Africa hasn't successfully linked climate and ocean discussions, they're often treated as separate issues,"" Willima said. 

Just as threats of rising seas grow, scientists have observed that parts of South Africa's coastal regions are gradually lifting.

Changes in land elevation have usually been attributed to deep earth processes such as the movement of hot materials beneath the crust. 

However, a recentstudyled by Makan Karegar, a geodesist at the University of Bonn, challenges that view.

The research points to droughts as the primary driver. 

""Groundwater adds weight to the land,"" Karegar told DW. ""A lot of rain and flood put weight on the Earth's crust, surface and that weight causes [it] to go down."" 

During drought, as water is lost from the soil and underground reservoirs, the land becomes lighter and can rise up, similar to the way a sponge expands when it dries.

The researchers used GPS measurements, satellite data, and hydrological models to study the correlation between areas experiencing severe droughts and significant land uplift.

Jasper Knight, a geoscientist at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who was not involved in the study, considers the research scientifically sound. 

""They used high-quality data and strong modeling techniques and the ways in which they are applying it for southern Africa is of interest,"" Knight said. 

""They suggest that climate variability is an important determinant of systematic variations in land surface elevation across the region compared to a kind of traditional idea, based upon a tectonic uplift of the land surface.""

While the phenomenon may appear to offer a natural buffer against rising sea levels, Knight cautions against drawing overly optimistic conclusions.

""Of course, you may say if the land surface is rising, then in a relative sense the sea level may be static or may be going down,"" Knight said.

""But of course, that may be at the expense of less water being present on the land surface. And here if I had to decide between a decreasing sea level rise at the coast versus drought in the interior, I would choose sea level as the least-worst option.""

Karegar adds that while some countries artificially raise land elevations by injecting wastewater underground to reduce flooding risk, South Africa's situation is a byproduct of natural drought. 

Still, he said the insights from the study could aid broader environmental management.

""These findings could help improve drought and flood monitoring, guide groundwater management, and inform more strategic water resource planning and climate adaptation efforts,"" he said.

“America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country”, declared Mark Carney in his victory speech, after Canada's general election this week delivered his Liberal Party a plurality of seats in parliament. “These are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us”, Carney continued, promising that Trump's oft-repeated plans to absorb Canada as America's 51st state are “never, ever going to happen”.

Trump's apparent designs on Canada, which appeared to begin with a social media post calling Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau “governor Trudeau”, weighed heavily on the country's election. The Conservatives still polled their best results since the 1980s, and Carney will have to lead a minority government, but the spectacle of a foreign leader looming so decisively over the elections of a major democracy is Ruritanian to the point of comedy.

Next week's meeting between Carney and Trump at the White House could well be an awkward affair.

But Canadian statehood might not be such a great idea for our home and native land. Doubling the size of the country is not unknown in the annals of American history. Thomas Jefferson did it in one vast real estate deal in 1803, when he purchased the Louisiana Territory from Napoleonic France. That was before the rest of the American West came into US ownership via settlement, conquest, annexation, and purchase.

Absorbing Canada would double the amount of territory America would have to defend, however, while only increasing its population by about 12 per cent. Canada's military contribution would be even smaller. According to the global firepower index, America has almost 20 times the number of active duty servicemen that Canada deploys and spends about 22 times more on its military budget. Canada, long a beneficiary of America's leading role in both Nato and North American continental defence, ranks roughly on par with Argentina and Algeria.

With extended Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic coastlines, and vastly extended proximity to Russian and Chinese forays in those regions, a supersized America would have to stretch its existing resources to stand on guard with relatively little help from its new citizens.

It would also face the financial burden of having to care for them. Canada's economy is in the doldrums of a long-term economic slump, with cost of living, housing affordability, and opportunities for financial advancement fading for younger Canadians. Election polling suggested that their glowing hearts cared far more about improving their lives and prospects than electing another Liberal government with little to recommend it beyond a jingoistic promise to stand up to Trump.

Since 2010, Canadian growth has languished at European levels, averaging at about 1.6 per cent annually, compared to over 2 per cent for the United States, with nothing even close to US levels of high-tech innovation. Canada's unemployment rate sits stubbornly at 6.7 per cent, compared to 4.2 per cent for Americans. The mercy mission of taking over Canada's flagging economy would mean a disproportionately higher number of welfare payments going out to our new fellow citizens, with likely more to come as Canada's expensive social services are harmonised with American policies and priorities.

For Trump, adding Canada's politics anywhere outside of staunchly conservative Alberta would also be a disaster. As the election results revealed, Canadian voters skew considerably to the Left of their American counterparts. This is the case even within its Conservative Party, which claims to be a “big tent” accommodating both national populists and so-called “Red Tories”, who – in line with the British rather than the American political concept of “Red” – lean far enough Left on economic and social issues that they would fit more comfortably within the US Democratic Party than among Republicans.

If Canada were to enter the US as one large state, in other words, it would almost certainly elect Democrats or politicians aligned with Democrats to the expanded US Congress. That would mean two more Democratic senators in Washington. Matters would be even worse in the House of Representatives, where at current levels there would be one new congressman for roughly every 780,000 Canadians, or at least 51 new legislators, most if not all of whom would also likely be Democrats or Democrat-aligned. In the tight congressional balance Republicans now face, it would be like adding a second California, whose population is of roughly equal size.

Trump could be having an extended joke that has seriously unnerved America's northern neighbours. But he may want to limit his expansionist goals to Greenland and Panama.

Progressive economist Gerald Epstein says global capitalists may no longer see the US as a “safe haven” under Trump.

Progressive economist Gerald Epstein says global capitalists may no longer see the US as a “safe haven” under Trump.

The first 100 days of Donald Trump's second presidency have brought about big, destructive changes in U.S. society and culture as well as on the environment. They have also caused real damage to the economy, which has gone on reverse on almost all fronts since Trump took office. By talking out of both sides of his mouth on tariffs, Trump has managed in a very short time to harm U.S. businesses, weaken the dollar and compel investors to dump U.S. government bonds. No wonder why he has the lowest 100-day approval of a president in 80 years.

In the interview that follows, renowned progressive political economist Gerald Epstein delves into the impacts that Trump's economic policies are having on the U.S. economy and its currency, the once-mighty dollar. He also explains the reasons why Trump keeps attacking the Federal Reserve and ponders the future of international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank as Trump's economic policies threaten global stability. Epstein is professor of economics and co-director of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. His most recent book is Busting the Bankers' Club: Finance for the Rest of Us. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity.

C.J. Polychroniou: Trump's erratic reciprocal tariffs represent an unprecedented shift in U.S. trade policy and are having dramatic impacts on both the U.S. and global economies. The U.S. dollar has also experienced a sharp decline due to the Trump administration's tariffs chaos. Why are tariffs weakening the dollar? And isn't this bad news for the average U.S. consumer and a slam for the working-class voters that support Trump?

Gerald Epstein: Trump's tariffs are creating havoc in the world economy and for U.S. businesses, consumers and workers. Part of the problem lies in the nature of the tariffs themselves, and part of it results from the huge uncertainty generated by the on-again-off-again, maybe-maybe-not quality of them. With respect to the issue of uncertainty, economists of many stripes, from John Maynard Keynes to Milton Friedman, have argued that for capitalism (and capitalists) to prosper, uncertainty must be held in check. The main reason is that long-term investment drives the economy. Mainstream economists extol the economic importance of consumers, but we have known from at least the time of Marx that it is investment (what Marx called “accumulation of capital”) that underpins the system. But since most useful investment is relatively long lasting and requires significant upfront expenses, capitalists are reluctant to make such commitments when uncertainty is through the roof, as it is now. The result is not only a likely reduction in investment in plants, equipment and technology, but, through a downward multiplier process, a reduction in demand and employment spread throughout the economy.

Then there is the structure of the tariffs themselves.

Here there are at least two issues of relevance to the impact on the economy. The first is the massive, indeed prohibitive level of tariffs on China, in combination with high tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Together, these countries account for more than one-third of U.S. trade, so the tariffs are obviously extremely disruptive to their economies and ours. The second issue is the fact that the U.S. tariffs did not distinguish between imports of final goods and imports of parts and other intermediate products. If Trump wants to reshore manufacturing production and jobs, he is making that goal more difficult by slapping tariffs on products that these firms will have to use to produce their newly onshored final goods like cars.

Together, these policies are tanking expected corporate profits in the U.S., threatening unemployment for U.S. workers and slashing plans for corporate investment.

In this environment, profit prospects for U.S. companies based in the U.S. are way down. As a result, financial investment into the U.S. is less profitable and riskier. Hence, there is less demand for U.S. dollars to invest in the U.S. This is one main reason why the value of the dollar is going down and shows a direct connection between Trump's tariffs and the dollar.

But there is a further reason why the dollar is falling. And this relates to a possible disruption of the trust by global capitalists in the United States as a “safe haven” in times of trouble and turmoil.

Trump has gone to war with the U.S. Federal Reserve and would have liked to be able to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over interest rates. First, what's the connection between Trump's trade deals and the Fed? Second, why is the Fed holding interest rates steady?

The Trump administration either wants to completely control international organizations for its own purposes or wants to destroy them.

The connection is simple. Trump's bumbling tariff war creates big problems for the Fed: The war creates pressures for both inflation and recession. When tariffs go up, prices of goods will go up: That will drive up inflation at least temporarily. And for the reasons I discussed earlier, the tariff war threatens a recession. This immobilizes the Fed because it has no good policy option: Increasing interest rates could fight inflation but will make recession worse; lowering interest rates would cushion the recession but could increase inflation by keeping demand high. So, the Fed is just holding steady until events become clearer.

Investors are selling off U.S. government bonds. Why is this happening now? 

Part of the reason they are selling bonds is because they are worried about higher inflation which makes these bonds less valuable in real terms. But another reason — and the one that really got investors and economists' attention — is the concern that they are selling off bonds because of a loss of confidence in the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar as a “safe haven” in a turbulent world.

Could the U.S. dollar lose global reserve currency status on account of Trump's tariff war? If so, how could this impact the international monetary system as well as the direction of the U.S. economy?

The U.S. dollar is unlikely to completely lose its global reserve currency status now, largely for two reasons: One is inertia. Much of the rest of the world already has a lot of business of various kinds connected to the dollar: their foreign exchange reserve holding; the financial trades they make with derivatives and other financial instruments; their offshore financial activity — for example, in London, that often does not even involve U.S. financial institutions but nonetheless is denominated in dollars; and so on.

And the second reason is the lack of a clear better alternative that could completely take over for the dollar. The two rivals are the European Union (EU) and China. But Europe is not only decentralized and lacks a unified economic and military strategy, but it is also being undermined by the same forces that Trump is unleashing — economic uncertainty and an emboldened Russia. As for China, it is still perceived as “lawless” and as a potential enemy of the global capital class.

But just because the U.S. dollar is unlikely to completely lose its status in the coming period does not mean that the dollar's role won't significantly decline in some areas, especially in the case of the official role of reserve holdings and in trade within a growing Chinese economic bloc in Asia and inside the EU.

An interesting question is whether this likely decline will negatively impact the United States and affect the operations of the global financial system. Economists debate the issue of whether the dollar's global role provides the U.S. with an “exorbitant privilege,” to use the derogatory term used by the French and others. The idea is that the dollar's role allows U.S. institutions, including the government, to borrow more extensively and more cheaply from the rest of the world than they would be able to otherwise. This idea leads to the term that the U.S. can run “deficits without tears.” This is also tied to the idea that the U.S. and its dollar are seen as “safe havens” when global turmoil erupts. When the dollar fell and U.S. government interest rates went up in the wake of the recent market tariff kerfuffle, many commentators suggested that the dollar's safe haven “exorbitant privilege” was at risk: that Trump was wrecking a valuable U.S. advantage. I believe that this privilege is real and important, even though it has often been difficult to assess because it has been so secure. Now we are witnessing a “natural experiment” in the disruptions caused by Trump and his trade adviser, Peter Navarro.

Will the rest of the world be able to benefit from this loss of “privilege?” If chaos ensues as a result in the short-to-medium run, it seems unlikely. If China or Europe seize the moment, then they might be able to benefit and capture some of this privilege. The best thing would be for the international community to issue more international “currencies,” such as the special drawing rights issued by the IMF, and transition to a more global currency that could spread these privileges around. But this is unlikely to happen as long as the U.S. is around to block these institutions from stepping out on their own.

Trump took the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement and withdrew it from the World Health Organization. That's bad news, indeed. But there are also concerns that he will kill the Bretton Woods System by withdrawing the U.S. from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which may or may not be such bad news. Your thoughts on this matter?

This question leads us to the role of the United States in international organizations, such as the IMF, the World Bank, and other organizations. It seems pretty clear that the Trump administration either wants to completely control international organizations for its own purposes or wants to destroy them. This seems like the approach it will take with respect to the IMF and the World Bank. Since these are such big and powerful institutions, the Trump administration will first try to control them and manipulate them so as to pursue its own agenda of slashing investments in preventing and adapting to climate change, slashing programs to help support women economically, and so on. The only thing possibly forcing Trump to keep the U.S. in these organizations is the fear that China might take them over.

As such, countries in the rest of the world will have to make one of the following choices: (a) give in to Trump's destructive demands; (b) align with China and wrest control of these institutions that way or (c) develop a truly third way to control these institutions themselves. I am not knowledgeable enough about this situation to be able to predict an outcome. But, in my view, resisting Trump and Trumpism should be the first order of business.





We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

A Trump official spoke of an “autism registry” then walked it back. Organizers still fear infringements on rights.

A Trump official spoke of an “autism registry” then walked it back. Organizers still fear infringements on rights.

When Robert F. Kennedy Jr., longtime promoter of the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, was confirmed as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, autistic advocates warned he could use his position to further endanger our community. Soon after his confirmation, Kennedy announced his plans to launch a large-scale initiative to fast-track efforts to identify the cause of autism, the details of which have since deeply troubled the autistic community.

An especially concerning aspect of the initiative was revealed when National Institutes for Health (NIH) Director Jay Bhattacharya stated during a presentation that the National Institutes for Health would be “developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism.” After autistic people and advocates raised concerns, however, the Department of Health and Human Services quickly issued a statement to clarify that it is not creating an autism registry.

The clarification, first reported by STAT, walks back the use of the term “registry” to refer to the new autism research initiative. This word had especially caused alarm among civil rights and disability advocates. Historically, government registries were used to subject disabled people to human rights violations at the hands of the state, including forcible sterilization and institutionalization.

These dynamics persist today, via conservatorships, criminalization, and other legal processes that diminish the autonomy and self-determination of disabled children and adults, especially autistic people who are nonspeaking, cannot mask their autistic traits and behaviors, are institutionalized and/or have an intellectual disability. Forced sterilization of disabled individuals without consent is still legal in some states.

In a similar statement to CBS News, the Department of Health and Human Services described the project as a “real-world data platform” that will “link existing datasets to support research into causes of autism and insights into improved treatment strategies.”

After the Department of Health and Human Services' assertion that it is not in fact creating an autism registry, many disability justice organizers asserted the walk-back was a matter of semantics only and said their privacy concerns persisted over the National Institutes for Health data aggregation plans. Other social media users questioned if such a project would be possible due to HIPAA and informed consent requirements for human subjects research.

There are many registries already at the National Institutes for Health for various health conditions, but these registries are generally de-identified — they are not permitted to contain information that could be used directly (either alone or in combination) to identify individuals. Multiple autism registries specifically also exist, although not at the federal level. These lists are managed by several U.S. states and private foundations. Some contain personally identifying information to assist with identifying those who could be eligible for services.

Community concerns surrounding the new autism research initiative were focused on the aggregation of health information across many sources, such as pharmacies, medical records, genetic testing and data from consumer products like smartwatches. There are large de-identified datasets at the National Institutes for Health and elsewhere that include the “real-world” health data of millions of Americans generated by various sources linked together, including data from health records, insurance claims and consumer product use.

Health product companies with offerings ranging from wearable devices to period-tracking apps regularly monetize user data by receiving compensation for granting researchers access to “anonymized” user information, such as for training AI models. This data sharing often occurs by way of third-party data aggregators that merge information across multiple sources, including claims data from health insurance companies.

Autistic people with more autonomy must organize in solidarity with those who are nonspeaking, have an intellectual disability, are more disabled, or are otherwise more marginalized.

The ubiquity of Big Data and Big Tech in medical care and the wellness industry has led to the creation of many multisource health datasets. Centralized datasets and shared data have vast benefits for research and medical care, but health data fragmentation avoids the privacy risks inherent when linking datasets containing private health information.

Even with high de-identification standards, privacy advocates are still wary. Some fear re-identification of sensitive data; others take issue with a consistent lack of transparency, especially related to data storage and security measures.

“Real world” data is regularly used via an “opt-out” model rather than the explicitly “opt-in” nature of human subjects research requiring the informed consent of study participants. This includes research conducted at academic medical centers or government agencies, such as survey research and clinical trials. Such researchers are required to enact extensive measures to protect data privacy and security, with special consideration paid to highly sensitive information.

This new autism research “real-world data platform” is more representative of the norm than a stark deviation, but that doesn't mean there's no cause for concern. Rather, the present discussion highlights the tension between the status quo surrounding data aggregation and the very reasonable concerns people have about how their health data is used and stored, de-identified or not.

News that diagnosis data from health records would be incorporated into the new autism “real world data platform” led many late-identified autistic adults to express regret at having pursued a formal diagnosis — or relief that they hadn't.

But some autistic advocates, including Devon Price, a social psychologist who writes about autistic liberation, point out the inherent privilege in ever having a choice as to whether to be identified as autistic on official documents, including lists maintained by government agencies. Price has long urged caution regarding diagnosis: While it sometimes opens up access to supports, a formal autism diagnosis can pose serious risks related to discrimination and civil rights, in particular related to family policing and immigration.

There are many additional reasons to be alarmed by the new autism research initiative taking shape under Kennedy, who has already tapped David Geier, a discredited vaccine researcher, to be a key player in his new autism research initiative.

The comments made by Kennedy at a press conference on April 16 drew harsh criticism from autistic people, advocates and caregivers. The press conference was held a day after the Department of Health and Human Services published a press release regarding a finding published by the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: The prevalence of autism in the United States has increased from 1 in 36 children to 1 in 31.

The framing of this reported increase in autism prevalence as an “epidemic” was widely criticized. Leading autism organizations released a joint statement in response to the press release and related press conference. They called the language used to describe autism damaging and inaccurate, noting that claims that autism is “preventable” are not supported by scientific consensus and arguing that such claims perpetuate stigma. Citing examples from the press release and Kennedy's comments, they write: “Language framing Autism as a ‘chronic disease,' a ‘childhood disease' or ‘epidemic' distorts public understanding and undermines respect for Autistic people.”

Kennedy's characterizations of autistic people and their lives during the press conference particularly outraged autistic people and their caregivers: “They'll never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go out on a date,” he said. “Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”

Many autistic self-advocates condemned these falsehoods by pointing to the reality that they themselves do pay taxes, write poetry, have been married for years, and much more. The ability of some autistic people to successfully live independently or maintain employment is indeed evidence that this characterization of autism is inaccurate. But this argument fails to respond to the deeper problem: Kennedy simultaneously presumes the very existence of people who do live with these significant limitations should be “prevented” and assigns value only to productivity and independence. These perspectives are core tenets of eugenics.

Autistic writer Collette Grimes also noticed our community trending toward “propping up our most successful, six-figure earning spokespeople,” and had similar concerns, writing, “I can't help but feel that measuring autistic people by our productivity does more harm than good.” Grimes goes on to argue that these community reactions only serve to uphold the very same capitalist hierarchies of worth at the heart of the ableist beliefs underpinning not only these specific comments by Kennedy but also the material systemic oppression of all disabled people.

These appeals to respectability also reify the very same divisions within our community that are being pushed by Kennedy and his allies. During his presentation, Bhattacharya emphasized “a range of manifestations” of autism, “from highly functioning children to children who are quite severely disabled.” He added, “of course the research will account very carefully for that.”

This comment reflects renewed public discussion about returning to the previous diagnostic schema when Asperger's was given as a separate diagnosis to those autistic people without an intellectual disability or language delay. However, neither scientific nor community knowledge supports the further separation of the autism diagnosis beyond the levels already used to describe the amount of support an autistic person requires. Separating the autistic community — whether by labeling some as having “profound autism” or giving “level 1” autistic people a different diagnosis altogether — could allow the Department of Health and Human Services to undermine efforts of these individuals to obtain accommodations and simultaneously enable it to justify further infringement on the autonomy of autistic people with higher levels of support needs.

As we resist these attacks on our community, autistic people with more autonomy must organize in solidarity with those who are nonspeaking, have an intellectual disability, are more disabled, or are otherwise more marginalized, and work to end abusive practices including seclusion and restraint, dangerous pseudoscientific “cures” and electric shock therapy to which institutionalized and other autistic people with high support needs are especially vulnerable.

Solidarity with our transgender autistic community members is also crucial. The struggles for gender justice and disability justice both center on rights to bodily autonomy and self-determination and are directly linked via the weaponization of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diagnoses to deny access to gender-affirming care. On April 28, the U.K.'s National Health Service announced plans to screen trans youth for neurodevelopmental conditions including autism and ADHD; while trans people are more likely to be autistic, the change is being made in response to the Cass Review, a report commissioned by the U.K.'s National Health Service that is unsupportive of access to gender-affirming care for youth, which suggests it's a move toward limiting access to care.

In the U.S., the fact that autistic youth are more likely to be trans is cited in at least two state laws that ban gender-affirming care for minors. It's notable that in the 400-page report on released on May 1 by the Department of Health and Human Services on gender dysphoria in youth, autism is mentioned six times, including a cited quote that recommends “extended diagnostic periods” when autism is suspected or diagnosed — a euphemism for delaying and/or denying life-saving medical care. The notion that autism prevents one from knowing oneself — along with other similarly dehumanizing beliefs based in anti-autistic stigma — underpins the use of autism diagnoses to discredit the gender identities of transgender people of all ages, especially youth.

The dehumanization of autistic people epitomized by Kennedy's stigmatizing comments also contributes to violence against autistic people, including police violence, which disproportionately affects autistic and disabled people, especially autistic people of color. Earlier this month in Idaho, police killed Victor Perez, an autistic teenager with cerebral palsy. Despite his family stating they were not threatened by Perez, police shot him multiple times in his front yard. Autistic people with more privilege and autonomy must also engage with abolitionist organizing to end police violence and criminalization.

The hypothetical fears of a potential loss of autonomy, privacy, and other basic rights expressed by many late-identified autistic people reflect the present reality for many autistic people who can't mask their autism, work, live independently, or otherwise have a high level of engagement with services and the state. Disability justice teaches that we must center the needs of community members who are currently most impacted by intersecting forms of oppression, not just fight to maintain our own relative privileges.

Rather than validate ideas that tie our worth to our productivity, we all must affirm the humanity of autistic people who have higher support needs. The strength of the autistic community depends on us acting in solidarity with our most disabled members as we strive for liberation for all.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

A 25 percent tariff on imported automobile parts took effect on May 3, marking a significant step in President Donald Trump's effort to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign supply chains and boost domestic manufacturing jobs.

The tariffs affect imports from all countries, although parts that meet U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) requirements are exempt, in a bid to preserve the tightly interwoven North American auto supply chain.

Specifically, manufacturers can offset 3.75 percent of the total Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) value of U.S.-assembled vehicles produced from April 3, 2025, through April 30, 2026, and 2.5 percent for those assembled in the following year. The offset roughly corresponds to imported parts making up 15 percent of a vehicle's value in year one, and 10 percent in year two.

In a proclamation, Trump said the revised tariff structure would “more effectively eliminate the national security threat” by accelerating the shift away from foreign manufacturing and reinforcing U.S. capacity to produce critical automotive components.

While the Trump administration says the tariffs will ultimately revitalize the U.S. auto industry, industry analysts warn of short-term consequences, including higher prices and supply disruptions.

Stephanie Brinley, associate director of auto intelligence at S&P Global, cautioned that the most severe impacts on production and sales are likely to emerge in 2026.

While the full impact of the auto parts tariffs may not be felt immediately, the May 3 rollout represents another milestone in Trump's global trade policy reset.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

The U.S. government is settling a lawsuit filed over a Capitol police officer's fatal shooting of Ashli Babbitt, a supporter of President Donald Trump, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021.

Judicial Watch, an advocacy group, filed the $30 million wrongful-death suit in 2024 on behalf of Babbitt's estate and her husband, Aaron Babbitt.

His comments came after a federal judge held a hearing in the case in a Washington courtroom.

After the hearing, Judge Ana C. Reyes ordered both sides to submit a status report by May 6, the court's docket shows.

Babbitt, 35, an Air Force veteran who lived in the San Diego area, came to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, to support Trump, who was still serving his first term in office. At the time, the president and many of his supporters were alleging that his loss in 2020 may have been a result of a “rigged” election.

The proposed settlement follows several actions that Trump and his new administration have taken regarding Jan. 6 cases since his return to the White House early this year.

Dozens of police and protesters were hurt during the Capitol breach. No police officers died that day, despite initial reports to the contrary.

Videos and photos show Babbitt wearing a Trump flag tied around her neck like a cape, as many other Trump supporters did that day.

A government watchdog agency recently confirmed that FBI informants mingled with the crowd that day, both inside and outside the Capitol, amid lingering questions over whether agent provocateurs incited the violence. Past government officials, including former FBI director, Christopher Wray, have denied such accusations.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agreed to settle a lawsuit with Maine on May 2, after it withheld around $3 million in grant funding for nutrition programs in that state.

In exchange, Maine will drop its suit within two calendar days.

“But we are pleased that the lawsuit has now been resolved and that Maine will continue to receive funds as directed by Congress to feed children and vulnerable adults.”

The USDA and White House have not yet responded to a request for comment.

“You'd better comply, because otherwise you're not getting any federal funding,” Trump told Mills during a White House speech addressing the nation's governors on Feb. 21.

“We'll see you in court,” Mills replied.

Both sides made good on their threats: USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins informed Mills on April 2 that she “was freezing Maine's federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools.”

Frey responded with a lawsuit against the USDA on April 7, and U.S. District Judge John Woodcock Jr. ordered the funds unfrozen four days later.

Although Friday's agreement has settled the issue around food funding, questions about Title IX remain a source of legal friction between Maine and the federal government.

During that announcement, Bondi read a letter from Frey in which he said Maine and the government were “indeed at an impasse” about the regulations.

“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls' and women's sports teams,” Frey said.

The DOJ stated that Title IX is “a civil rights law that guarantees women and girls equal protection in education and athletics.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

            Astronomers have been trying to determine the cosmic origins of the heaviest elements, like gold, for decades. Now, new research based on a signal uncovered in archival space mission data may point to a potential clue: magnetars, or highly magnetized neutron stars.
    


            Scientists believe lighter elements such as hydrogen and helium, and even a small amount of lithium, likely existed early on after the big bang created the universe 13.8 billion years ago.
    


            Then, exploding stars released heavier elements like iron, which became incorporated in newborn stars and planets. But the distribution of gold, which is heavier than iron, throughout the universe has posed a mystery to astrophysicists.
    


            “It's a pretty fundamental question in terms of the origin of complex matter in the universe,” said Anirudh Patel, lead author of the study published Tuesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and a doctoral student of physics at Columbia University in New York City, in a statement. “It's a fun puzzle that hasn't actually been solved.”
    


            Previously, the cosmic production of gold has only been linked to neutron star collisions.

            Astronomers observed a collision between two neutron stars in 2017. The cataclysmic clash released ripples in space-time, known as gravitational waves, as well as light from a gamma-ray burst. The collision event, known as a kilonova, also created heavy elements like gold, platinum and lead. Kilonovas have been likened to gold “factories” in space.
    


            It is believed that most neutron stars mergers occurred only in the past several billion years, said study coauthor Eric Burns, assistant professor and astrophysicist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.
    


            But previously indecipherable 20-year-old data from NASA and European Space Agency telescopes suggests that flares from magnetars that formed much earlier — during the infancy of the universe — may have provided another way for the creation of gold, Burns said.
    


            Neutron stars are the remnants of the cores from exploded stars, and they are so dense that 1 teaspoon of the star's material would weigh 1 billion tons on Earth. Magnetars are an extremely bright type of neutron star with an incredibly powerful magnetic field.
    


            Astronomers are still trying to work out exactly how magnetars form, but they theorize that the first magnetars likely appeared just after the first stars within about 200 million years of the beginning of the universe, or about 13.6 billion years ago, Burns said.
    


            Occasionally, magnetars unleash a bonanza of radiation due to “starquakes.”
    


            On Earth, earthquakes occur because Earth's molten core causes motion in the planet's crust, and when enough stress builds up, it results in volatile movement, or the ground quaking beneath your feet. Starquakes are similar, Burns said.

            “Neutron stars have a crust and a superfluid core,” Burns said in an email. “The motion under the surface builds up stress on the surface, which can eventually cause a starquake. On magnetars these starquakes produce very short bursts of X-rays. Just like on Earth, you (have) periods where a given star is particularly active, producing hundreds or thousands of flares in a few weeks. And similarly, every once in a while, a particularly powerful quake occurs.”
    


            The researchers found evidence suggesting that a magnetar unleashes material during a giant flare, but they didn't have a physical explanation for the ejection of the star's mass, Patel said.
    


            It's likely that the flares heat and eject the crust material at high speeds, according to recent research by several coauthors of the new study, including Patel's adviser Brian Metzger, a professor of physics at Columbia University and senior research scientist at the Flatiron Institute in New York City.
    


            “They hypothesized that the physical conditions of this explosive mass ejection were promising for the production of heavy elements,” Patel said.
    


            The research team was curious to see whether there might be a connection between the radiation from magnetar flares and the formation of heavy elements. The scientists searched for evidence in wavelengths of visible and ultraviolet light. But Burns wondered whether the flare might create a traceable gamma ray as well.
    


            He looked at gamma ray data from the last observed giant magnetar flare, which appeared in December 2004 and was captured by the now retired INTEGRAL, or INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory, mission. Astronomers had found and characterized the signal, but did not know how to interpret it at the time, Burns said.
    


            The prediction from the model proposed by Metzger's previous research closely matched the signal from the 2004 data. The gamma ray resembled what the team proposed the creation and distribution of heavy elements would look like in a giant magnetar flare.
    


            Data from NASA's retired RHESSI, or Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager, and the Wind satellite also supported the team's findings. Long-term federally funded research enabled the discovery, Burns said.
    


            “When initially building our model and making our predictions back in December 2024, none of us knew the signal was already in the data. And none of us could have imagined that our theoretical models would fit the data so well. It was quite an exciting holiday season for all of us,” Patel said. “It very cool to think about how some of the stuff in my phone or my laptop was forged in this extreme explosion (over) the course of our galaxy's history.”

            Dr. Eleonora Troja, an associate professor at the University of Rome who led the discovery of X-rays emitted by the neutron star collision in 2017, said the evidence for heavy element creation from the magnetar event “is in no way comparable to the evidence collected in 2017.” Troja was not involved in the new study.
    


            “The production of gold from this magnetar is a possible explanation for its gamma-ray glow, one among many others as the paper honestly discusses at its end,” Troja said.
    


            Troja added that magnetars are “very messy objects.” Given that producing gold can be a tricky process that requires specific conditions, it's possible that magnetars could add too much of the wrong ingredients, such as an excess of electrons, to the mix, resulting in light metals like zirconium or silver, rather than gold or uranium.
    


            “Therefore, I wouldn't go so far as to say that a new source of gold has been discovered,” Troja said. “Rather, what's been proposed is an alternative pathway for its production.”
    


            The researchers believe that magnetar giant flares could be responsible for up to 10% of elements heavier than iron in the Milky Way galaxy, but a future mission could provide a more precise estimate, Patel said.
    


            NASA's Compton Spectrometer and Imager mission, or COSI, expected to launch in 2027, could follow up on the study's findings. The wide-field gamma-ray telescope is designed to observe giant magnetar flares and identify elements created within them. The telescope could help astronomers search for other potential sources of heavy elements across the universe, Patel said.

Follow:


            The federal criminal trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs will begin next week.
    


            Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges of racketeering conspiracy, transportation to engage in prostitution and sex trafficking. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


            The embattled music mogul has been in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn since his September 2024 arrest.
    


            Here's how to follow the trial:
    


            Jury selection for the trial will begin on May 5, with opening statements anticipated to begin May 12. The trial is expected to take several weeks.
    


            Combs is facing five counts total relating to the charges.
    


            In September 2024, Combs was arrested in New York City after he was indicted on one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking and one count of transportation to engage in prostitution.
    


            He pleaded not guilty to those charges. In April, prosecutors filed another superseding indictment that added one additional count of sex trafficking and one additional count of transportation to engage in prostitution.
    


            He once again pleaded not guilty.
    


            Prosecutors claim Combs coerced at least three women to engage in sex acts with him and, at times, with male prostitutes, during occasions known as “Freak Offs” where the women were allegedly drugged and forced to engage in sex for days.
    


            Authorities also allege Combs recorded some of the sex acts and controlled his victims by promising financial and career opportunities, as well as through threats of violence and other harm.
    


            In addition to his criminal case, Combs is the subject of dozens of civil lawsuits from alleged victims, including those who were minors at the time of their allegations, who claim they were drugged and sexually assaulted by the embattled music mogul. The civil suits are not part of Combs' federal criminal trial and will not be considered during it.
    


            The judge in Combs' federal criminal trial ruled during a hearing in April that most evidence about prior sexual assault allegations against Combs that are not included in the indictment would not be allowed at trial.
    


            Combs' trial will not be televised, per the rules of Federal court. Any visuals from inside the courtroom will likely come from a sketch artist.
    


CNN will have reporting from journalists inside and outside the court, across linear and digital platforms, as the trial unfolds.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian will be presiding over Combs' trial.
    


            Subramanian took the bench in 2023 after being nominated by President Joe Biden in 2022. He has spent most of his career at the law firm Susman Godfrey as a civil litigator after working as a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
    


            Magistrate Judge Robyn F. Tarnofsky was the first judge Combs stood before following his arrest. Combs' case was then then randomly assigned to District Judge Andrew Carter, who later recused himself before the case was transferred to Subramanian.
    


            Carter and Tarnofsky previously denied Combs' lawyers requests for him to be released on bail following his arrest. He was denied for the third time in November, with Subramanian ruling that there were no conditions that alleviated concerns that Combs could engage in witness tampering.
    


            Marc Agnifilo and Teny Geragos are the two lead attorneys representing Combs. Brian Steel, who represented rapper Young Thug in his recent racketeering trial in Georgia, was added to Combs' legal team in April.
    


            Agnifilo has also previously represented “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli, Nxivm founder Keith Raniere and former Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng. He worked for the law firm Brafman & Associates from 2006 until 2024, when he split off to co-found the firm Agnifilo Intrater.
    


            Geragos is a founding partner at Agnifilo Intrater and the daughter of Marc Geragos, a powerful criminal defense attorney whose clients have included the Menendez brothers and Michael Jackson.
    


            The US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York indicted Combs in 2024, with Assistant U.S. Attorneys Meredith Foster, Emily A. Johnson, Christy Slavik, Madison Reddick Smyser and Mitzi Steiner handling the case for the government, according to a news release from the US Attorney's Office.
    


            The government has identified four victims in court filings who are expected to testify at trial.
    


            During an April 18 pre-trial hearing, Judge Subramanian ruled that three of the four alleged victims mentioned in the indictment can testify under pseudonyms. The person referred to as “Victim 1” in the indictment, Combs' former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, has chosen to testify under her own name. “Victim 3” has also chosen to testify using her own name, according to a court filing.
    


            Ventura filed a lawsuit against Combs in 2023 where she alleged he raped her in 2018 and subjected her to years of repeated physical and other abuses over the course of their relationship. Combs denied Ventura's allegations at the time and they settled Ventura's lawsuit the day after it was filed.
    


            In May 2024, Combs was seen striking and dragging Ventura in a 2016 surveillance video first published by CNN. Two days after the video was published, Combs apologized for physically assaulting Ventura.
    


            “My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,” he said in a video statement posted on Instagram.
    


            During a pre-trial hearing in April, Subramanian ruled that the footage will be shown to the jury at trial after Combs' lawyers' numerous attempts to exclude it.

Their views now echo Israel's rightward shift","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/03/middleeast/these-kibbutzniks-used-to-believe-in-peace-with-palestinians-their-views-now-echo-israels-rightward-shift","Sat, 03 May 2025 04:01:00 GMT","

Follow:


            Sitting inside her new apartment in kibbutz Tzora, a leafy community just west of Jerusalem, Almog Holot ran her fingers over a bowl of crystals as the wind chime on her balcony blew in the breeze.
    


            Eighteen months ago, she spent 12 hours gripping the handle of her safe room door in kibbutz Nirim as she, along with her mother and her children – then 6 and 8 years old – hid from Hamas militants, who threw grenades at their house, ransacked their home and terrorized their community.
    


            Five people were killed and another five were kidnapped from Holot's kibbutz on October 7, 2023, when Hamas and other militant groups launched a coordinated terror attack on Israeli communities and military posts, killing 1,200 and kidnapping 251 people.
    


            Holot and her family survived. But her belief in peace did not.
    


            “I don't know what I believe in, but it's not peace,” she told CNN.
    


            Holot and her ex-husband, who is from Nirim, a kibbutz about 2 kilometers (approximately 1.2 miles) from the Gaza border, had decided to raise their family there, believing it was the best place for their children.
    


            “Kibbutzes are like paradise on earth in many ways,” she said. “You live in a community where money is not the most important thing… people know each other, people care about each other, and people help each other.”
    


            While her children grew up “in a reality in which in every single second of every single day, a rocket might hit them,” Holot said that before October 7,  such attacks were rare.
    


            “Most of the time it was really peaceful,” she said. “My children knew to answer people that the people who threw rockets were just Hamas, and most of the people in Gaza are good – just like them.”
    


            Like many residents of kibbutzim – or communal settlements – located near the Gaza border, Holot says she holds left-leaning political views. And like many so-called kibbutzniks, she too believed in, and advocated for, peace with Palestinians.
    


            People from outside of her kibbutz used to tell her that her views were “naïve,” she said. Now she believes they were right.
    


            “I can no longer say that 95% of them (Palestinians) want to live in peace,” Holot said, adding that many in her community were “surprised” by the attacks, but not because of the actions of Hamas.
    


            “We thought (Gazans) were like us. And it turned out, no, they're not,” she said, alleging that “common people of Gaza” were involved in the looting of October 7 and expressed support for the attacks.
    


            It's an attitude that Avida Bachar, from nearby kibbutz Be'eri also shares. Bachar lost his wife, his teenage son and his right leg in the attacks, in which 100 of the kibbutz's 1,100 residents were killed.
    


            Prior to October 7, Bachar believed that Palestinians and Israelis could coexist.
    


            “I thought that we want to live together… like two states… we can work together, we can live together,” he told CNN.
    


            Now, he believes that Israel should raze Gaza and take complete control of it.
    


            “We have to take the border, to move the border, and put potatoes and peanut fields there (in Gaza), until the sea. That is a different system, and we have to do it,” he said, acknowledging that his support of such an extreme idea would have surprised him prior to the war.
    


            Such shifts in attitudes aren't surprising for survivors of extreme trauma, said Merav Roth, a Haifa-based clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst.
    


            Roth, who established a philanthropic long-term therapeutic organization for the victims of October 7 and who regularly works with survivors and returned hostages, told CNN that survivors rely on disassociation as a coping mechanism.
    


            “It takes most of your energy just to survive mentally. And that's why they don't have spare energy to think of ‘the other,'” Roth said, adding that they are often in “fight or flight” mode and react in “binary, primitive ways.”
    


            “When you're in chaos, when you're intimidated, when you're threatened, you split the world into two: total good and total bad… and revenge is an illusion of becoming strong,” Roth said.
    


            So, by operating with a mentality of “I don't want to think about them. I don't want to solve anything,'” Roth said, survivors are able to create a sense of protection for themselves.
    


            It's the type of protection Holot seeks for herself and her children, who both suffer from PTSD.
    


            While Holot said that she does not support US President Donald Trump or Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu politically, their call to relocate Palestinians in Gaza to third countries – a “voluntary” emigration plan approved by Israel's cabinet in March that critics say could amount to ethnic cleansing – has given her pause.
    


            “Would I want to get up tomorrow morning, wake up and see that all the people in Gaza disappeared and everything is peaceful? Yes. On the same note, I would like to get up tomorrow morning and find out that all the people in Gaza want peace,” she said, before adding: “But do I think (either) is possible? No.”
    


            In the 1990s and 2000s, the conflict was a dividing line between left and right, split 50-50 along political lines, according to Tamar Hermann, a public opinion and polling expert at the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI), a Jerusalem-based think tank.
    


            Holot and Bachar's views mirror a wider shift in attitudes among Israeli Jews to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the idea of a two-state solution since October 7.
    


            But over the years, Jewish Israeli society has made a significant shift to the right, with only 13% of that population now self-identifying as on the left, compared with 30% in the center, and 55-60% on the right, Hermann said.
    


            While the right remains staunchly against a Palestinian state, a view that has only hardened since the war began, the center is now much more aligned with the right than it used to be, she said.
    


            But the major shift has been among those on the left, who used to support a two-state solution but now see a Palestinian state as unfeasible anytime soon, she said.
    


            Meanwhile, across all political lines, very few Jewish Israelis (5%) believe that Hamas would end its struggle against Israel even if there was a Palestinian state, according to an IDI opinion poll conducted 13 months ago.
    


            Holot, who still identifies as on the left, said she believes left-wing activists outside of Israel who demonstrate for a “Free Palestine” do not fully understand Hamas' ideological stance, instead only focusing on images of Palestinian suffering.
    


            Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 52,000 people since October 2023 – among them 16,000 children – according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. 2,100 Palestinians have been killed since Israel reignited its aerial and ground campaign last month, breaking a two-month-old ceasefire.
    


            “I'm very sad for this reality, but I'm very stable about knowing that it's not our fault and their leaders brought it upon them,” Holot said, echoing a wider national sentiment.  Nearly all Jewish Israelis (94.5%) believe that Hamas bears a great deal of responsibility for the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, according to the IDI poll.
    


            “Murderousness is infectious, aggression is infectious,” Roth said of the vicious cycle of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
    


            But Roth, who believes in a two-state solution, still has hope for peace. She said some of the returned hostages and survivors she's worked with have told her: “'I will fight for the two-state solution. We still need peace.”
    


            “They are amazing, and it's inspiring,” Roth said. “They keep their higher selves, even after all that they went through.”
    


            In between lectures, 21-year-old Gili Avidor walks under trees on the perimeter of the Tel Aviv University campus. Like the survivors – and much of Israeli society – she, too, has undergone a profound personal and political transformation since October 7.
    


            But her story is very different than most.
    


            After her former boyfriend was killed at the Nova music festival in southern Israel, she too, wanted revenge. “We were first loves. It was really difficult,” Avidor told CNN last month.
    


            “I remember telling my sister that I want everyone in Gaza dead,” said Avidor.
    


            “Now I am ashamed and frightened of the fact that these words came out of my mouth,” Avidor, who describes herself as being from a right-wing family, said: “I was completely inside the Israeli narrative. That's the only reality I knew.”
    


            As Israel escalated its war on Gaza, Avidor said something changed for her.
    


            “I thought, there is probably some other girl on the other side of the gate in Gaza that is feeling exactly what I feel, that someone she loved got killed, and revenge is the answer…(but) revenge is what makes such things to happen in the first place.”
    


            Avidor began to engage with left-wing activist groups that support Palestinian self-determination and volunteered as a “protective presence” for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, who have suffered an increasing number of attacks by Jewish settlers since the start of the war.
    


            It's hard to stand up to your own society, she said, adding that individual and collective trauma has been weaponized to empower extremists to perpetuate the conflict and dehumanize Palestinians.
    


            Still, she remains committed to a different way forward, saying that it is her “duty” to advocate for “human beliefs in this very dark time.”
    


            Avidor acknowledges that she did not experience the first-hand trauma that many kibbutzniks did, and expresses deep sympathy for them.
    


            “I can understand that people who endure such a trauma (flips) their life upside-down,” Avidor said.
    


            But she pushed back on the idea that October 7 is a reason for them to stop seeing a path forward to peace with Palestinians.
    


            “I mean, they say: ‘Okay, we were the the good Jews who helped you and took you to the hospital when you're sick…' but now they strip them from their humanity,” she said.
    


            “The notion that human rights is something that people need to gain and to be thankful for? That makes me angry. And I think they're hypocrites,” Avidor added.
    


            Not every survivor has faltered in their vision for peace.
    


            At her father's graveside at kibbutz Nir Oz several weeks ago, Sharone Lifschitz read one of his poems to friends and family attending his headstone-setting ceremony, as the sound of bombs exploded a mile away in Gaza.
    


            “In the poem, he makes a small wish, and the little prayer is that there will be a week in which no Palestinians will be killed,” Lifschitz told CNN. It was written in the 1980s, during the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising.
    


            Oded Lifschitz, a lifelong peace activist, was kidnapped age 83 from the kibbutz on October 7, along with his wife Yocheved, who was freed weeks after her capture.
    


            “My father used to say that peace is inevitable, that just the question is how much blood is shed before that,” Lifschitz told CNN.
    


            She and her mother continue to embody Oded's ideology, saying that peace with Palestinians is the only way forward.
    


            Roth, the psychologist, believes Israel's most “severe danger as a society is if we become the atrocity we experience.”
    


            “This will be really the victory of Hamas, if the Israeli people will lose their values, their higher selves, their morality, (capacity for) seeing the other,” she said.
    


            Back in kibbutz Tzora, Holot says she still holds liberal values, and is focused on healing herself and her children.
    


            “I don't want to teach them bad things about humanity. So, I prepare them to keep thinking that Hamas is bad and the people are good… even if I don't feel it myself,” she said.

            President Donald Trump appeared to dismiss growing concerns that his economic policies could cause a recession, telling NBC News that the economy would be “OK” in the long term even if a recession happens in the near future.
    


            “Some people on Wall Street say that we're going to have the greatest economy in history. Why don't you talk about them? Because some people on Wall Street say this is the greatest thing to ever happen,” Trump said in an interview clip from “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” released on Friday.
    


            Pressed on whether he would be okay with a recession in the short term to achieve his long-term goals, the president said, “Look yes, everything's OK. What we are — I said, this is a transition period. I think we're going to do fantastically.”
    


            Trump's economic policies — and particularly the trade war he has ignited with his whipsaw, abrupt tariffs — have already sent the world's largest economy into reverse: Gross domestic product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the economy, registered at an annualized rate of -0.3% in the first quarter, as businesses hoarded goods and consumer spending decelerated, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.
    


            That was far worse than economists had expected, and it marked the worst quarter since 2022.
    


            Trump has warned previously that Americans would see some economic “disturbance” throughout a transition period as his policies reset the global economic order for friend and foe alike. He has imposed sweeping global tariffs (and paused some of them), and he has levied especially high import taxes against China, a major US trading partner.
    


            Earlier this week, for example, he acknowledged that tariffs could lead to shortages and higher prices for everyday Americans.
    


            “You know, somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are going to be open,'” Trump said. “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.”
    


            Trump and some administration officials have also previously signaled that tariffs may plunge the economy into a recession — and that may be an acceptable outcome.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested America needed a “detox” period. If Trump's tariffs succeeded at restoring America's manufacturing prowess, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said a recession would be “worth it.” And Trump has sometimes declined to rule out a recession as a result of his actions.
    


            The US economy is powered by consumption — about two-thirds. And throwing sand into that growth engine can cause major disruptions.
    


            The economy is weakening, certainly. But it's too early yet to tell if the US is in a recession; the official definition of a recession in the United States is “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.”
    


            The clip is part of a larger interview expected to air on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday.

            Polls have closed in Australia in a national election dominated by cost-of-living concerns that's being closely watched abroad for signs of a Donald Trump-inspired swing against conservative candidates.
    


            Early counts suggest a swing towards Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's center-left government, according to national broadcaster the ABC and CNN affiliate Sky News.
    


            Albanese is defending his position against challenger Peter Dutton's center-right Liberal Party, which is promising to get the country “back on track” after three years in opposition.
    


            Albanese voted in his safe Labor electorate of Grayndler in Sydney early on Saturday afternoon, flanked by his son Nathan, fiancée Jodie and dog Toto.
    


            Dutton cast his ballot alongside his family in the Brisbane electorate of Dickson, which he currently holds by a margin of just 1.7%. Labor is bullish about the chances its local candidate, Ali France, could end Dutton's two decades in parliament – and the early vote-count showed the Liberal leader could be in trouble.
    


            Pre-election national opinion polls firmed in Labor's favor, but Australia's preferential voting system and the declining dominance of the two major parties makes it difficult to predict who'll make up the 150-member House of Representatives.
    


            Observers will be examining the results for signs of blowback against Australia's conservative candidates from US President Trump's whirlwind 100 days in office – after comparisons were drawn between Dutton's policy offerings and those of the US leader.
    


            Another center-left prime minister, Mark Carney of Canada – which like Australia is a G20 and Commonwealth nation, as well as US ally – recently scored an election win widely chalked up to anti-Trump sentiment.
    


            In Australia, almost half of the 18 million registered voters cast their ballots before election day, and the remainder are expected to attend voting centers to comply with compulsory voting laws, with the threat of fines for no-shows.
    


            Polling centers on election day often resemble a series of small community fairs, taking advantage of the guaranteed flow of customers by selling what's known as “democracy sausages” – a sausage, sauce, and maybe onions, on a slice of white bread.
    


            The tradition began decades ago but in recent years has become more organized with an online map built by volunteers showing where voters can find a ballot box with a barbecue.
    


            “Everybody has to show up to vote. As long as you're showing up anyway, why not connect with the community through the fair-like atmosphere of a sausage sizzle and whatever other fundraisers are available on the day,” said Alex Dawson from the Democracy Sausage Team.
    


            A warm Autumn Saturday allowed a dip in the ocean before voting for some, with many swimmers on Sydney's Bondi Beach heading to the ballot box in their Speedos.
    


            Over the last five weeks, the two major parties have been locked in a battle for votes, using the promise of tax cuts, rebates and other relief measures aimed at easing a cost-of-living crisis.
    


            Australian elections tend to focus on domestic issues – housing, health and the economy – but this one has been influenced by international events.
    


            Albanese called the election in late March, just before Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs, sending global markets into a tailspin.
    


            As with almost all other US allies, Australia was not spared from the tariffs, something Albanese criticized as “against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship.”
    


            On the campaign trail, the incumbent government has presented itself as a steady pair of hands as the initial hit to stocks broadened into fears of an impending global recession. Now, Labor says the Australian economy is turning the corner, pointing to a recent fall in inflation to 2.9%, the lowest since December 2021.
    


            Dutton has placed the blame for inflationary pressures firmly on the Labor government, routinely questioning whether voters feel “better off than they were three years ago.”
    


            Both parties say they'll make it easier for first-time buyers to get a house, by either cutting the size of the minimum deposit, or offering tax deductions on mortgage repayments – both measures analysts say will likely drive house prices higher.
    


            This year, for the first time, younger voters will outnumber older demographics and analysts expect them to extend the decline of the two-party system with more votes for minor parties and independents.
    


            A fierce competition for young voters has played out on social media, making this election “drastically different” from those of the past, said Andrea Carson, a professor of political communication at La Trobe University in Melbourne.
    


            “Instagram and TikTok (are) really taking over some of the space that was occupied by Facebook,” Carson said.
    


            However, the lack of any regulation requiring truth in political advertising has allowed political parties, as well as third-party campaigners, to say whatever they like about their rivals.
    


            Many electorates, such as the hotly contested Wentworth in Sydney's east, have seen a deluge of flyers and signs pushing personal attacks against candidates. The Australian Electoral Commission stated in April that it “cannot, and has never been able to, regulate truth.”
    


            Commentators will be watching this year to see if more seats go to so-called Teal candidates, independents backed by funds raised through campaign group Climate 200.
    


            The Teals were the talk of the last election three years ago, when Australians turfed out the Liberal-National Coalition after nine years of rule, in a vote dubbed Australia's “climate election.” This year, 35 are competing as independents with a shared goal of promoting integrity, gender equality and greater climate action.
    


            In 2022, the new Labor government committed to net-zero targets and immediately began the work of driving carbon emissions down in a country which derives a significant portion of its wealth from extracting fossil fuels.
    


            However, despite escalating the rollout of new renewable projects, it's been criticized for also approving new coal and gas projects.
    


            The Liberal Party's response to the country's energy demands has been to propose a shift to nuclear power, with a plan to build seven nuclear power stations in the coming decades, funded by taxpayers.
    


            This time around, there has been no promise of bolder climate action from Labor, even as activists have ambushed leaders on the campaign trail.
    


            “When will you listen to young people?” one protester yelled at Albanese on April 8 at a press conference to announce more funding for mental healthcare.
    


            For the candidates who've worked for weeks to push their message through the noise of competing election campaigns, Saturday could turn into a long, tense evening.
    


            Voters are also electing 40 of 76 seats in the upper house (Senate), replacing senators who are at the end of their six-year term.

CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — The deaths of at least six Italian and Chinese tourists in a fiery van crash in Idaho near Yellowstone National Park are a reminder that the roads leading into the popular international destination can be as dangerous as the region's grizzly bears and boiling hot pools.

The van collided with a pickup truck Thursday on a highway just west of Yellowstone. Both vehicles caught fire, and the survivors were taken to hospitals with injuries, according to police. The tourists who were killed were from Italy and China, officials said.

The Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco said eight Chinese citizens were injured in the crash. The accident comes after a crash in 2019 of a bus from Las Vegas carrying Chinese tourists that rolled over near southern Utah's Bryce National Park, killing four people and injuring dozens more.

Where the van in Thursday's accident was coming from and going was unknown. Some Yellowstone roads, including the one south of Old Faithful — the park's most famous geyser — were still closed after the snowy winter.

The highway where the accident happened south of West Yellowstone, Montana, offers a way to get between Yellowstone and Grand Teton at this time of year, before a north-south route is plowed and the park fully opens for summer.




According to the most recent data from the International Trade Administration, 36% of international visitors who arrived to the U.S. by air listed visits to national parks and national monuments as their top leisure activity while in the U.S.

Seventeen percent of Yellowstone's visitors came from other countries in 2016, according to a park visitor use study with the most recent comprehensive data available.

Visitors from Europe and Asia accounted for the majority of travelers from outside the U.S., with 34% from China, 11% from Italy and 10% from Canada.

The COVID-19 pandemic changed those numbers significantly, said Brian Riley whose Wyoming-based business, Old Hand Holdings, markets the Yellowstone region in China and runs tours.

“Every Chinese is taught how great Yellowstone is in their elementary school,” Riley said Friday.

The pandemic put a sharp brake on tourism of all kinds but especially from China, which has yet to recover, Riley observed. Now, visits by people already living in the U.S. account for most visits by Chinese, he said.

“Foreigners in general they don't feel safe over here like they did before,” Riley said Friday. “The Chinese are kind of preaching that behind the scenes.”

The U.S. tourism industry expected 2025 to be another good year for foreign visitors. But several months in, international arrivals have been plummeting. Angered by President Donald Trump's tariffs and rhetoric, and alarmed by reports of tourists being arrested at the border, some citizens of other countries are staying away from the U.S. and choosing to travel elsewhere.

Riley, who grew up in Jackson, Wyoming, just south of Grand Teton and lived in China for a time to learn Mandarin and why Chinese wanted to visit the U.S., is more focused of late on getting them to visit Hawaii, a state perceived as less dangerous.

Yellowstone's crowds peak in the summer, but international tourism peaks in spring and fall, according to Riley and West Yellowstone Mayor Jeff McBirnie. 

Many foreign visitors are parents of international students at U.S. colleges and universities.

“They're like, ‘Hey let's drop our kid off and go on vacation for a week.' Or kid's graduating, let's get them through college and go on vacation,'” said McBirnie, who owns a pizza place in town. “They really bring a huge economic impact to this town.”

Yellowstone suffered a one-two punch between the pandemic and devastating floods in 2022 that cut off access to parts of the park for months.

Tourism rebounded with 4.7 million visitors last year, Yellowstone's second-busiest on record.

Winding roads and natural distractions help fuel numerous accidents in and around the park.

The first death involving a passenger vehicle in Yellowstone came just a few years after the park was completely motorized and a fleet of buses replaced the stage coaches and horses used for transport in the park's early years.

In 1921, a 10-passenger bus went off the road in the Fishing Bridge area of the park and down an embankment, killing a 38-year-old Texas woman when her neck was broken, according to park historian Lee Whittlesey.

Whittlesey in his book “Deaths in Yellowstone.” chronicles deaths by all means –- from drownings in hot springs, to bear maulings, airplane crashes and murders. Auto deaths, Whittlesey wrote, are “legion” in the park, to the point that he felt them too ordinary to include in his tally of fatalities.

Another accounting of deaths in Yellowstone says at least 17 people died inside the park in motor vehicle crashes since 2007, ranking it the second most common cause of deaths behind medical issues.

Whittlesey presaged the chapter of his book covering road deaths with a quote attributed to the 15th century soothsayer Mother Shipton: “Carriages without horses shall go, And Accidents fill the world with woe.”

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic has cut short a visit to the United States and returned to Serbia after feeling sudden chest pain apparently caused by high blood pressure, doctors said on Saturday.

Vucic, 55, suddenly fell ill during a meeting in the U.S. on Friday and decided to return home against the advice of U.S. doctors, said cardiologist Dragan Dincic, from Belgrade's Military Hospital, where Vucic was treated upon arrival.

Dincic said Vucic took additional therapy after the incident and was now in “stable and satisfactory condition.” Dincic added that Vucic won't be hospitalized but “cannot be expected to return to his regular activities for several days.” 

Vucic was previously in Miami, Florida, where he had met with former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. Vucic had said he also was hoping to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump. 

Richard Grenell, U.S. presidential envoy for special missions, expressed hope that Vucic would recover. “Sorry to miss you but hope all is ok,” Grenell wrote on X.

Serbia's populist leader also has said he would travel to Russia later this month to attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow, despite warnings from European Union officials that this could affect Serbia's bid to join the bloc. 

Vucic has refused to join Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. He also has been under pressure at home following six months of persistent anti-corruption protests triggered by the collapse of a roof at a train station in the country's north that killed 16 people.

Idaho State Police say seven people died when a pickup truck and a tour van collided in eastern Idaho Thursday evening near Yellowstone National Park. Both vehicles caught fire after the crash, which remains under investigation.

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A pickup truck collided with a tour van carrying a number of foreign travelers on a highway leading to Yellowstone National Park, leaving seven people dead and eight others injured, Idaho State Police said.

The crash happened just before 7:15 p.m. Thursday on U.S. Highway 20 near Henry's Lake State Park in eastern Idaho, police said in a news release. The state park is roughly 16 miles (26 kilometers) west of Yellowstone National Park.

Police have not said what exactly caused the wreck, but the Dodge Ram truck was traveling west while the Mercedes van was traveling east toward Yellowstone when it happened. Video from the scene showed clear weather conditions at the time.




Both vehicles caught fire, police said. The driver of the pickup and six people inside the Mercedes passenger van died. The truck driver was identified Friday as Isaih Moreno, 25, of Humble, Texas. Identifying the others will take some time, according to police.

Fremont County coroner, Brenda Dye, told The New York Times that she was waiting for DNA test results to identify the six others because the bodies were unrecognizable. She said all six were from outside the U.S. Two were from Italy.

China's Consulate General in San Francisco said that five Chinese citizens were killed in the accident and another eight were injured. 

“The consulate expressed deep condolences for the dead and sincere sympathy to the injured and the families of those affected,” according to the official Xinhua news agency. It was in contact with the family members and providing support, it said. 




It was not immediately clear why there was a discrepancy between the figures given by Chinese officials and the Fremont County coroner.

The van was carrying a tour group of 14 people, and the surviving occupants were taken to hospitals with injuries, police spokesperson Aaron Snell said. 

Two were flown to an Idaho Falls hospital and one was flown to a Bozeman, Montana, hospital, according to police. Their conditions were not released. The others were taken to area hospitals with injuries believed to be non-life-threatening, police said.

The crash remains under investigation.

Roger Merrill, 60, was driving home when he saw flames engulfing the two vehicles as bystanders tried to care for survivors from the van on the side of the highway. Merrill said he often sees tourist vans on the highway.

“It is a very dangerous highway because it leads to the main entrance of Yellowstone National Park,” he said. “It's extremely busy.”

Merrill captured video of the wreckage with smoke blanketing the van. Due to the remote location, Merrill said he anxiously awaited the help of first responders.

“It took an unnervingly long time for help to arrive just because of the location,” he said.

Police said Friday that a Fremont County sheriff's deputy arrived shortly after the crash and, with the help of bystanders, immediately helped injured van occupants as it caught fire.

The state is working with local officials to get “answers on what led to this terrible tragedy,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in a social media post.

The Idaho Transportation Department had identified the highway for safety improvements aimed at reducing the severity of crashes, but the project was still in the research and planning phase. An average of about 10,500 vehicles traveled that portion of the highway daily in 2023, according to the agency.

Fox News Digital asked travelers about REAL ID at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in D.C., with some passengers sharing why they're skipping the new identification. 

While many public policy leaders believe implementation of REAL ID requirements across the country will bolster national security, some more libertarian critics say the Bush-era protocol could come at a cost to individual liberty and bigger government, with one expert telling Fox News Digital it essentially sets up a de facto national ID system and treats law-abiding Americans with suspicion.

When Congress debated REAL ID in 2005, libertarian Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, strongly opposed the move, positing that it constituted a national ID card that had no limitations on what type of information could be stored on it, posing a significant threat to American civil liberties.

After being signed into law, the implementation of REAL ID was repeatedly postponed during administrations of both political parties, including the first Trump administration during the height of the COVID pandemic. This year, however, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) set a new deadline for obtaining a REAL ID of May 7. Having REAL ID-compliant identification will be required to board domestic commercial airline flights and to access some federal facilities like courthouses or military bases.

So, should citizens be concerned about getting a REAL ID? Fox News Digital spoke to two policy experts, one supportive and one critical, for their views.

WHAT IS REAL ID? DEADLINE APPROACHES FOR NEW IDENTIFICATION CARDS REQUIRED TO FLY DOMESTICALLY

When Congress was voting on REAL ID in 2005, prominent libertarian Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, strongly opposed the move, positing that it constituted a ""national ID card"" that had no limitations on what type of information could be stored on it, posing a significant threat to American civil liberties. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images | Fox News Digital)

Simon Hankinson, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation's Border Security and Immigration Center, told Fox News Digital that requiring additional documentation to obtain a REAL ID will have a significant impact on identifying and cracking down on terrorism and other illegal activity in the U.S., including illegal immigration.

By requiring a REAL ID to fly, Hankinson explained that IDs offered by liberal states to illegal immigrants will no longer allow those illegals to easily move about the country unchecked.  

He pointed to the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, in which several of the al Qaeda terrorists involved had obtained valid state licenses, which were accepted for boarding their flights.

And while Hankinson acknowledged that concerns about data privacy are legitimate, he pointed out that most Americans already have much of their information stored in databases such as that of the Social Security Administration.

Hankinson said the government will have to be held to the highest standards to uphold citizens' privacy. Still, he compared the risk-reward scenario posed to the nation by REAL ID to nuclear power.  

""If it's done right, you can mitigate the risks, and you can have, like France, 75, 80% of your power from nuclear power plants,"" he said. ""If you cut corners, and you put the wrong people in charge and you take risks, then you end up with Chernobyl.""

But Jim Harper, a senior fellow of digital privacy and constitutional law at the American Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital that though REAL ID is not technically a national identification card, since it is issued by individual states, obtaining one enters private citizens into a national database, effectively making it a national identification system.

""REAL ID is a national ID system. And historically, national ID systems have been used for terrible things,"" he said. ""We want to make sure that we don't position ourselves in the United States ever to have that much authority reside with the government. And so, for two decades now, I've been arguing against REAL ID, simple as that.""

What is the problem with being entered into a national system? Harper explained that his concern is that setting up such a system treats American citizens as suspects before they have committed any crimes.

He granted that the dangers of REAL ID are ""not as urgent"" as something like the Patriot Act, which was passed in the wake of 9/11 and significantly expanded the scope and powers of law enforcement and intelligence operations in the U.S., but that it similarly expands the ability of the government to control and monitor its citizenry.

""I reject the idea of having law-abiding American citizens put into a national I.D. system because they might be terrorists. That's not the way we do law enforcement in this country, to treat people as suspects from go,"" he said. ""I don't think natural born citizens should, should be put into a national I.D. system for immigration control. That's the that's the problem of illegal immigration being visited on the citizen. That's not how it's supposed to work.""

In his view, the ""burden"" of the reasons for having a national ID ""all falls on the citizen, on the individual who's not accused of any crime or any wrongdoing. That's not the way to do it.""

Harper predicted that the federal government will ultimately bend on enforcing REAL ID requirements and continue to ""kick the can down the road"" as they have done for two decades.

What's more, according to both Hankinson and Harper, citizens in most states will still have other options available to them if they want to opt out of getting a REAL ID.

In the end, the decision of whether to obtain a REAL ID or to accept the risks of not doing so rests with individual citizens.

The UN warns a crisis in Haiti is escalating as gang violence across the country continues to worsen. (Video courtesy of AP, thumb courtesy of Reuters) 

The Trump administration on Friday officially designated two of Haiti's most powerful gang networks, Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif, foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) and specially designated global terrorists (SDGTs).

The move is aimed at disrupting the gangs' operations and supporting efforts to restore order in the troubled Caribbean nation.

The announcement was made in a formal statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who declared that ""the age of impunity for those supporting violence in Haiti is over.""

""These gangs have killed and continue attacking the people of Haiti, Haitian security forces and multinational security support (MSS) mission personnel and are committed to overthrowing the government of Haiti,"" Rubio said. ""Their ultimate goal is creating a gang-controlled state where illicit trafficking and other criminal activities operate freely and terrorize Haitian citizens.""

The designations bring serious legal consequences. Individuals or entities that provide material support to Viv Ansanm or Gran Grif could face criminal charges, loss of immigration benefits or removal from the U.S.

Viv Ansanm formed in September 2023 through an alliance between Haiti's two main gang factions, G-9 and G-Pép. The coalition has carried out coordinated attacks on Haitian infrastructure, including prisons, government buildings and the Port-au-Prince international airport. These attacks were part of a broader campaign that helped force the resignation of former Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry.

POPULAR CRUISES SUSPEND ISLAND STOP OVER ESCALATING GANG VIOLENCE: WHAT TO KNOW

Gran Grif operates mainly in the Artibonite region, a vital agricultural area. The State Department said the gang has been responsible for 80% of civilian death reports in that area since 2022. In February 2025, Gran Grif was linked to an attack that killed a Kenyan officer with the MSS mission.

According to NPR reporting from 2024, Viv Ansanm was spearheaded by Jimmy Chérizier, known as Barbecue, a former police officer turned gang leader. 

Chérizier helped unify rival gangs under a shared goal of opposing the Haitian government. In an interview with NPR, he defended the gang's actions and blamed Haiti's political elite for fostering the lawlessness. Though he acknowledged the violence, he claimed the government had enabled the conditions leading to it.

""These designations play a critical role in our fight against these vicious groups and are an effective way to curtail support for their terrorist activities,"" Rubio said. He also warned that U.S. citizens and lawful residents who engage in transactions with these groups are exposing themselves to sanctions and prosecution.

Rubio praised the Haitian National Police and international partners for their efforts in pushing back against the gangs. ""We commend the extraordinary bravery of the Haitian National Police and all international partners supporting the MSS mission for their ongoing efforts to establish stability and security in Haiti,"" he said.

He called on Haitian political leaders to focus on restoring peace. 

""We urge all of Haiti's political leaders to prioritize the security of the Haitian people, find solutions to stop the violence and make progress toward the restoration of democracy through free and fair elections,"" Rubio said.

The State Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","CCP officials and Chinese state entities poured donations into UC Berkeley: Report","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/education/3399770/ccp-officials-state-entities-china-donations-berkeley/","Sat, 03 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Newly obtained donor records revealed that hundreds of thousands of dollars have flowed from entities linked to the Chinese government into the coffers of the University of California, Berkeley, one of the most prestigious public institutions in the nation. 

Members of the Chinese Communist Party, a sanctioned Chinese research university, and Chinese state-owned enterprises have all routed donations to UC Berkeley, according to documents received by the Washington Free Beacon via a public records request. The outlet's report came on the heels of the Trump administration launching an investigation into the university over its failure to disclose a $220 million research deal with China's Tsinghua University — a state-run institution with deep ties to the People's Liberation Army.

Tsinghua isn't the only Chinese university with questionable ties that UC Berkeley has financially entangled itself with. The University of Science and Technology of China sent $60,000 to UC Berkeley to support its chemistry program in 2023. Just a year later, the Department of Commerce blacklisted the Chinese university for “acquiring and attempting to acquire U.S.-origin items in support of advancing China's quantum technology capabilities, which has serious ramifications for U.S. national security given the military applications of quantum technologies.”

Vincent Cheung Sai Sing, a longtime member of an advisory body to the CCP, provided UC Berkeley with $336,000 to fund “research units” in 2023. Additionally, the university received $160,000 from a charity funded by Charles Yeung, a CCP National People's Committee member, and $75,000 from ByteDance early investor Duane Ziping Kuang for the university's international relations and business programs, respectively.

Syngenta, a Chinese state-owned agricultural technology company, donated $21,000 to UC Berkeley's natural resources program in 2022. Although Syngenta is Chinese-owned, the university listed the contribution as coming from Switzerland, where it is headquartered.

Much more of China's financial links to U.S. higher education will likely be revealed to the public after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in April directing the secretary of education to “take appropriate steps to reverse or rescind any actions by the prior administration that permit higher education institutions to maintain improper secrecy regarding their foreign funding.”

The order is an apparent reference to the Biden administration not requiring universities to list the names of the foreign donors but merely their country of origin.

A federal judge ruled President Donald Trump‘s executive order seeking to revoke contracts and security clearances from the Perkins Coie law firm is unconstitutional.

In the executive order, Trump said the top Democratic-linked law firm conducted “dishonest and dangerous activity,” noting its connections to pushing the Russia collusion claims during Trump's first term. 

“No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: ‘The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers,'” Judge Beryl Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said in her Friday ruling in favor of Perkins Coie.

Perkins Coie celebrated the ruling as affirming the “core constitutional freedoms all Americans hold dear,” in a statement after the ruling.

“Today, the Court permanently blocked the unlawful Executive Order targeting our firm. This ruling affirms core constitutional freedoms all Americans hold dear, including free speech, due process, and the right to select counsel without the fear of retribution. We are pleased with this decision and are immensely grateful to those who spoke up in support of our positions,” the law firm said.

“As we move forward, we remain guided by the same commitments that first compelled us to bring this challenge: to protect our firm, safeguard the interests of our clients, and uphold the rule of law,” the statement added.

TRUMP'S PERKINS COIE ORDER IS ‘NOT DESIGNED TO PUNISH': DOJ

The Justice Department previously defended the order as “not designed to punish” but rather “designed to fulfill the concerns that were laid out” in the executive order.

The executive order was one of several targeting law firms linked to the Democratic Party and firms that had been adversarial toward Trump. Some law firms negotiated with Trump either after being targeted or to avoid being targeted, while others, like Perkins Coie, challenged the orders in court.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","How Trump is testing the limits of executive power","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3398534/how-trump-testing-limits-executive-power/","Sat, 03 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump's second term is testing the boundaries of Article II executive power like no presidency before. 

Through sweeping legal battles over federal firings, immigration crackdowns, budget authority, and attacks on liberal institutions, Trump is aiming to reshape the office's reach for decades — and the courts have been the battleground since the first weeks of his reunion with Washington, D.C.

More than 200 lawsuits have challenged Trump's record-breaking 139 executive orders issued in his first 100 days, with at least 11 emergency appeals already landing at the Supreme Court. 

Legal scholars who spoke to the Washington Examiner say the outcomes could permanently alter the balance of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, while sparking some of the most consequential immigration litigation in U.S. history.

Trump has aggressively targeted federal employees seen as obstacles to his agenda, from career bureaucrats to political appointees. 

His administration is targeting a long-standing Supreme Court precedent known as Humphrey's Executor, a 1935 opinion that saw a unanimous high court rule that presidents lack authority to remove heads of independent agencies unilaterally.

“The reasoning of the Supreme Court's decision in Humphrey's Executor is widely considered to be incorrect,” said Chad Squitieri, a law professor at the Columbus School of Law. 

This term, Trump has tested legal limits by seeking to remove officials from bodies such as the Merit Systems Protection Board and National Labor Relations Board, claiming broad presidential authority under Article II. That request is now pending before the Supreme Court and is poised to mark the next major power battle that the justices will decide.

He has also leaned on Cabinet secretaries' discretion and civil service loopholes to oust probationary employees and senior figures like Hampton Dellinger, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden and served at the U.S. Office of Special Counsel until his firing earlier this year.

Dellinger fought his firing in court and ultimately lost during his second examination at the federal appeals court level in Washington, D.C., prompting him to drop his case.

“The Court has, for some years now, taken a series of steps to move away from that mistaken precedent,” Squitieri said. “If the Supreme Court were given the opportunity to formally reconsider Humphrey's Executor outright, I think the court would overrule the decision.”

Legal fights over his removal of lower federal worker positions have played out across the courts. 

In April, the Supreme Court paused a lower court's order requiring the reinstatement of 16,000 federal workers fired from six agencies, a move that gave his administration more confidence that they are on the right side of Chief Justice John Roberts's jurisprudence.

Other appeals courts have issued similar stays on orders protecting probationary workers, with no clear timeline for final arguments.

Trump's immigration moves are at the heart of what some experts call the most pivotal era of immigration law since the nation's founding.

He has invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, historically used only during wartime, to expedite deportations of alleged gang members, including those in Tren de Aragua and MS-13.

But on May 1, a federal judge in Texas dealt a major blow to that strategy — for now.

Judge Fernando Rodriguez, a Trump appointee, ruled that Trump did not meet the necessary conditions under the AEA to justify the mass removal of Venezuelan migrants, finding that no evidence had been provided that Tren de Aragua was invading the United States on behalf of the Venezuelan government — a key legal threshold under the statute.

“The historical record renders clear that the President's invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute's terms,” Rodriguez wrote in his order. He emphasized that allowing the president to define invasion conditions unilaterally would erase statutory limits on the executive and gut the courts' role in reviewing such powers.

The case, brought by three Venezuelan nationals with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, challenged their imminent deportation under the law. Rodriguez's ruling not only blocked their removal but also approved class certification for all possible deportees in the Southern District of Texas — a move legal experts say is highly unusual in this type of immigration case.

“You can't do class actions,” said Andrew Arthur, a resident fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies. “Not everybody in that class is exactly the same … there should be individual cases.”

Arthur added that the ruling was surprising given the historic deference courts have shown to presidential authority during times of invasion or threat, dating back to World War II.

“Most American press outlets don't really understand Tren de Aragua, or they put it in the same bucket as MS-13,” Arthur said, noting how the gang has entrenched itself in parts of Colombia, Chile, and Brazil. 

Arthur explained that the administration is making the pitch that Tren de Aragua could also attempt to gain further footholds in the United States without these deportation efforts, thus creating an argument that their members' presence is a significant national security threat.

Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, concurred in part with Arthur's position.

“Traditionally, the Alien Enemies Act was invoked when there was an actual war. Here, Trump is using it in response to his declared ‘invasion or incursion.' I don't think it should make a difference what the basis is,” Blackman said, adding that most importantly, courts lack “authority to scrutinize his actions under the law.”

Despite last week's setback before the Trump-appointed judge in South Texas, legal experts expect the administration to appeal to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, where Arthur believes the government might fare better.

A senior DHS official told the Washington Examiner that Rodriguez's decision will not stop their immigration agenda, saying, “A single judge cannot stop the will of the American people for a safe and secure homeland.”

Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, said he could “easily see a judge in a separate jurisdiction ruling that there is an invasion,” underscoring the chaotic elements of having a single district judge determining the legality of the 18th-century law.

“This is 100% going to be appealed,” he said.

Trump's moves to slash government spending have revived sharp legal fights over the president's power to withhold or redirect congressionally appropriated funds.

The 1974 Impoundment Control Act, passed in response to President Richard Nixon's refusal to spend funds for programs he opposed, says money can only be drawn from the Treasury “in consequence of appropriations made by law.”

Trump, however, has treated congressional appropriations as ceilings, not floors — arguing the executive has discretion to spend less than allocated.

“Trump's actions are pushing the limits of the Impoundment Control Act, which was designed to prevent presidents from withholding or redirecting funds without Congress's consent,” said George Carrillo, CEO of the Hispanic Construction Council. 

“By freezing funds for programs like infrastructure or climate initiatives, Trump is testing whether the courts will uphold the ICA's restrictions. So far, courts have blocked these actions, but the administration seems intent on provoking a Supreme Court review,” Carrillo said.

Trump's legal agenda has also targeted DEI initiatives, higher education policies, and even major law firms he views as hostile to his administration.

His administration has invoked Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to challenge race-conscious policies at colleges and universities.

“Not only is the administration on firm legal ground withholding funding, this is exactly what Title VI is for,” said Shawna Bray, general counsel for the Center for Equal Opportunity. “You may not discriminate on the basis of race, color, or national origin — the end.”

“People want to believe there's discrimination that should be allowable because they'd like it to be, but it's simply not supportable under any statute,” Bray added. “Many DEI trainings and initiatives push concepts that drift far from what the Civil Rights Act actually says — they're teaching something else entirely, and in some cases, they're effectively training people to violate the law.”

The administration's transgender military ban, blocked by lower courts, has also reached the Supreme Court in the form of a petition to the justices. The administration argues the ban is necessary for military readiness, while challengers say four years of open service under the Biden administration produced no evidence of harm.

Trump's aggressive targeting of major law firms, many of which have advocated liberal policy positions and clients, also marks a striking new front in his second-term legal battles, as the administration pressures firms seen as politically hostile or unwilling to back its agenda.

From cutting off government contracts to raising questions about security clearances, the administration has sharpened its tools to challenge the legal industry's influence — moves that critics call retaliatory and defenders describe as an overdue assertion of executive power.

“The president has the right to say which law firms the government will or won't hire,” said Raul Gastesi, partner and co-founder at Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella. “But once you start taking away their security clearances, you better have a real good reason — and I don't know that he always does.”

Trump's public attacks on judges who blocked his policies have raised liberal fears of a so-called “constitutional crisis.”

On social media, Trump has lambasted them: “These people are Lunatics, who do not care, even a little bit, about the repercussions from their very dangerous and incorrect Decisions and Rulings.” He has accused the courts of ignoring the 77 million votes that returned him to office and treating the presidency as if it required 80 million votes to govern.

But Trump's outrage is not entirely unwarranted. No modern president has faced as many nationwide injunctions as he has. During his first term, courts issued 64 nationwide injunctions against his administration, compared to 12 under Barack Obama, 12 under Bill Clinton, 14 under Joe Biden, and just six under George W. Bush. Already in his second term, Trump has racked up 17 more as of this spring, fueling his argument that the judiciary is overreaching and unfairly targeting his policies at a scale no prior president has experienced.

In April, the House passed a bill to limit the power of individual federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, but its fate in the Senate is uncertain.

Meanwhile, two federal judges are investigating whether the Trump administration has defied their orders, a possible trigger for contempt proceedings. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg accused the administration of “willful disregard” for his order blocking certain deportations under the AEA.

The final Supreme Court argument on May 15 will be one to watch on the issue of Trump's gripes with nationwide injunctions. Justices will hear a case surrounding three lower courts that stalled his efforts to curtail birthright citizenship, but the underlying question will be more closely tied to whether the justices have an appetite to rein in lower courts' abilities to enjoin presidential policies universally.

As Trump presses forward into the next 100 days and beyond of his second term, more court decisions will be made — and the closer he will get to seeing final resolutions in some of his more contentious executive order fights.

Other experts also agreed that these court clashes could force Congress to revisit its broad delegation of powers to the executive branch and reshape the fundamental architecture of governance.

Rahmani, the former prosecutor, suggested it might be time for lawmakers to step in and “do their job.”

“Congress can say, ‘You don't have a right to see an immigration judge in these types of cases.' That way, DHS doesn't have to force things through like a square peg in a round hole,” Rahmani said.

“If immigration courts are backed up, and you don't want to give people these rights, then you don't have to give them,” he added.

TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE POWER STRUGGLES: WHAT'S STALLED AND WHAT'S ADVANCING

Time is also of the essence for Trump. With approximately 18 months until the 2026 midterm elections, it is incumbent upon his administration to pass any of his agendas that are the most likely to sustain scrutiny in courts through Congress, or risk having portions of his agenda blocked.

As more court challenges pile up, the closer the Supreme Court will get to taking on more challenges over his orders on the merits, and it is likely the fall term will include multiple oral argument hearings over the cases being adjudicated in lower courts now.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A drop in maritime traffic suggests that the worst is yet to come.

Stock markets plunged for days after President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on imports from around the world. The sell-off ebbed only when he suspended most, but not all, of the new measures for 90 days. The ticker tape is just one indicator of an economy, and other signs are growing more and more ominous—including at the Port of Los Angeles, where high tariffs on China are crushing maritime traffic. “Essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,” Eugene Seroka, the executive director of the port, said on April 24.

Trump views tariffs as essential to rebuilding the manufacturing economy that the United States once had. But his erratic tariff announcements have badly disrupted the economy that the country has today, and that pain is already being felt in the world of logistics.

“These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.”

Listen: Trump didn't actually undo tariffs

The Port of Los Angeles, the busiest in the Western Hemisphere, processes about 17 percent of everything the United States imports or exports in shipping containers. The adjoining Port of Long Beach accounts for another 14 percent. Over the years, a whole ecosystem has arisen to support the loading and unloading of the cars, clothes, electronic gadgets, and other things that people want. There are workers and warehouses, trucks and loading pads, security structures and rail lines.

Seroka estimated that cargo arrivals would soon be down 35 percent over the same time last year. At the moment, the drop in traffic seems likelier to accelerate than to reverse. The number of cargo ships canceling port calls or entire voyages is on the rise. A number of shipments now under way were instigated before Trump's so-called Liberation Day tariff announcement, on April 2. According to Forto, a cargo-management and -tracking company, reservations for shipping products must normally be placed two weeks before a cargo vessel launches. The trip from China from California typically takes two or more additional weeks. In other words, the full effects of U.S. tariff policies on maritime traffic may not be apparent for some time.

The economy, and the supply chains that allow it to function, can adjust fairly quickly to certain shocks, including weather disasters and even a pandemic. Early in the COVID shutdowns, toilet paper was in short supply as Americans spent more time at home and less at workplaces and schools. The problem eased as manufacturers ramped up production, transportation systems adapted, and consumer anxiety decreased.

But Trump's trade war is different because it is unpredictable and indefinite. Even if he were to renounce tariffs tomorrow, Trump has already shaken global confidence in American economic-policy making. No one can comfortably make business decisions based on what he does. Unless the Republican-controlled Congress steps in to quickly take away the president's ability to impose import duties at will, a failed effort so far, even foreign trading partners who believe they have a deal with the United States could be at risk of capricious new taxes on their products.

Tariffs don't just reduce the flow of goods coming into the country; they also cause an atrophying of the logistics system that moves products into, out of, and around the United States. “Less cargo volume, less jobs. That's the rule here,” Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach, said recently, describing how one in nine jobs in the greater Los Angeles region arises directly or indirectly from its ports. “Port complexes are like your baby toe on your foot,” Peter Neffenger, the former commander of the Coast Guard sector that includes Los Angeles and Long Beach, told me. “You don't think about it until you break it one day and realize, ‘I can't walk.'”

Like the shipping business into and out of Los Angeles, the nationwide trucking industry is slowing down, because drivers have a lot less cargo to move. Without inventory arriving or en route, small businesses will falter; bigger industries will shrink; shelves will be empty.

This week, Trump blamed former President Joe Biden, rather than his own policies, for the recent turmoil on Wall Street. What's happening in Los Angeles suggests that, if anything, financial markets have yet to fully price in how much Trump's tariff war is hurting the economy. The stock market goes up and down. Maritime indicators keep on sinking.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

What illness taught me about true friendship

When I first entered the kingdom of the sick, I wasn't interested in befriending my fellow denizens. Only 22, with a limited understanding of grave illness—or loss—I found the idea of a cancer support group for young adults wholly depressing, and I didn't want to get too comfortable with the identity of the cancer patient. Unsurprisingly, a year into treatment, I was as isolated and lonely as I'd ever been in my life.

Read: The Art of Survival

When it came to friendship, I had always prioritized quantity over quality. Attending six schools on three continents before the age of 12 meant that I was skilled at quickly forming friendships but not necessarily at sustaining them. While moving around, I maintained pen-pal correspondences with my best friend Molly in upstate New York, and my best friend Ranya in Tunisia, and my best friend Eléonore in Switzerland. But without a clear idea of when (or even if) we'd see each other again, and with all the address changes, our letters would peter out. The message I took from it was that relationships have a shelf life.

In college, I was a social butterfly, flitting from group to group, making fast but not necessarily deep friendships. Many of those friends disappeared when I got sick, and I felt hurt, angry, and betrayed. With time, I came to realize it wasn't some huge failing on their part—of course the people I played beer pong with were not at my bedside when my hair was falling out. To sustain a relationship through that kind of crisis requires stronger bonds.

Then one day, I was sitting in the hospital waiting room when a woman with a knit ski cap over her bald head and a face mask across hollowed cheeks fell into the chair next to mine. Her name was Anjali, and she was pretty and petite, with tawny skin and a beaked nose like mine. Though shorter than me and frail from months of bed rest, she exuded fierceness.

“I know who you are,” she said, with a trace of an Indian accent. “You write that fucking column.” What she meant was: Hello, it's nice to meet you. I simply wasn't good at reading between her lines yet.

Over time, we traded stories and learned that we had many in common—stories of immigration, of being the only kid on the first day of school who didn't speak English, of feeling like a misfit wherever we went. I learned that her parents were dead and she was estranged from her brother, who'd never returned her call about being her bone-marrow donor. I came to understand that was why she wore so much armor: She felt she had to protect herself to survive.

Anjali and I also shared the same diagnosis. We did the same chemotherapy regimens at Mount Sinai Hospital, administered by the same doctors. We both transferred to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to undergo bone-marrow transplants around the same time. A hundred days post-transplant, we both received our biopsy results. Mine came back clean: no sign of leukemia. Hers showed that she had already relapsed, and further treatment was not an option.

By then, I was 24. I had never been a caregiver, much less accompanied someone as they neared the end. But I understood the pain of having people not show up—and here was an opportunity for me to show up. For the next few months, I brought Anjali food, went with her to doctor appointments, and brought her home with me on holidays. Then, when she got too sick and weak to live at home alone, I called an ambulance to take her to Bellevue Hospital's hospice ward.

When the ambulance arrived, Anjali looked at me and howled. She called me a traitor, said I was a terrible friend, said that she hated me. But I didn't take it personally. I knew how fear and pain could make you angry. I myself had lashed out at loved ones in ways that I hadn't known I was capable of before illness. I understood that her rage was not toward me but toward a world in which she had never fully belonged, a world from which she'd soon be gone.

I rode with her in the back of that ambulance, and for the next week, I held a round-the-clock vigil by her bedside. The day before she died, Melissa and Max, whom I'd also befriended in treatment, and another friend named MJ, who was a cancer survivor (and who may or may not have volunteered as our weed supplier in those pre–medical marijuana days), joined me there. A talented musician, MJ brought a guitar, a shruti box, and a harmonica and played a few songs, including “Love More” by Sharon Van Etten. We all sang along: “She made me love / She made me love / She made me love more.” Anjali was so close to the veil that her hearing was failing. I didn't know whether she could actually hear the music or she was only seeing us experience it, but it seemed to make her happy.

I remember a nurse watching us from the hallway. Later, she told me that in all her years of working in hospice, she had never seen that before—other young people with bald heads and waifish bodies ushering a fellow patient through their final days. I understood why she was taken by the sight. To watch anyone die is scary, and it's even scarier to watch someone die from the same disease that might kill you. No one would have blamed us for avoiding it, but we were all struck by the fact that Anjali had no family. Her great fear was that she would die alone, and we wouldn't let that happen.

Being with Anjali through those days remains one of the most harrowingly beautiful and meaningful experiences of my life. I felt like I got to meet Anjali the child—the Anjali who had not yet been hurt, betrayed, or abandoned by the world. She softened; she became calm. Every time her eyelids fluttered open, she would reach for my hand. She was so skinny, and her big, dark-brown eyes seemed even bigger by contrast. Tender, open, unarmored, she seemed—paradoxically—healed.

When we think of love, we think of romance and happily-ever-after fairy tales. By telling this story, I want to invoke something different—the radical power of seeing, understanding, and showing up for another human. As Alain de Botton writes in A Therapeutic Journey, the word love “is so fatefully associated with romance and sentimentality that we overlook its critical role in helping us to keep faith with life at times of overwhelming psychological confusion and sorrow.”

In the four years I spent in treatment, illness took a toll. I lost my romantic relationship, my sense of self, and my trust in the future. I lost friends—Anjali, then Melissa, then Max. I was deep in grief, and I felt an almost primal impulse to shut down, to retreat like a wounded animal. I thought, If I never get close to anyone again, I will never be hurt again.

But I had learned another lesson too. Illness had taught me how much we need one another, how we come into this world needing so much care, how we die needing so much care, how we get that from the people we love and who love us: our family—blood or chosen—our partners, our friends, our communities.

I knew I had to keep turning toward love and other people to navigate my grief and uncertainty. Loneliness is a health issue—studies show that social isolation is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, stroke, depression, anxiety, and premature death, and that being socially disconnected can have the same impact as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. As far back as 2017, the U.S. Surgeon General at the time, Vivek Murthy, began calling attention to loneliness, arguing that we can live healthier, more fulfilled lives by strengthening our relationships. “Answer that phone call from a friend,” he wrote in a 2023 report. “Make time to share a meal. Listen without the distraction of your phone. Perform an act of service.”

Each of these proposed actions is, at its core, an act of generosity: Be fully present, listen, give of yourself to another human. Of course, this can't be done with a transactional mentality. People can sense whether you're helping them only to make them obligated to help you—and that feels terrible. What I'm talking about is connecting with another human as an end in itself. It's knowing someone simply to know them.

Anjali died on Valentine's Day. The last word she said to me was love.

Building a meaningful life is hard for young people to do right now.

This is an edition of The Wonder Reader, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a set of stories to spark your curiosity and fill you with delight. Sign up here to get it every Saturday morning.

Think back to a good time you recently had with a loved one: an hours-long conversation with a friend or a perfect night of watching TV on the couch with family. I'd venture to guess you still feel a little surge of warmth when you recall it. It's an intuitive truth that everybody needs these experiences to live a happy life, and recent happiness research suggests that young people can only really flourish when they have “real-life human contact and love,” Arthur C. Brooks writes. Social connection and community is important for human well-being—not least because it aids in the process of finding meaning and feeling that one's life has purpose, Brooks notes.

But young people are facing a series of roadblocks to finding that meaning: Institutions such as organized religion are in decline, and alternative communities are hard to find, especially when young adults are glued to technology. These trends are by now well-known—and yet the path to a better life might come down to incorporating a few basic principles, Brooks argues. The first one? “Put close relationships with family and friends before virtually everything else.”

A good life and a good society require an ongoing search for understanding and knowledge.

The nation's leading universities are locked in an unprecedented battle with a president and an administration that have chosen to withhold billions of dollars in vital federal research funding in order to take control of institutions for which freedom of thought and expression are among their most essential values.

For many, including me, this has eerie echoes of the MAGA-admired campaign by Hungarian President Viktor Orbán to rid his country of the Central European University. The school had been founded specifically to help revitalize civil society and its values, including academic freedom, in the region's transition from dictatorship to democracy after decades of Nazi and then Communist control. Silencing and capturing universities and the free press—both of them crucial sources of knowledge essential to democratic self-governance and more—have long been at the top of the authoritarian to-do list.

From the May 2025 issue: America's future is Hungary

But the roots of American higher education, and the essential role of our colleges and universities in the nation's rise to global leadership, run deep. Indeed, in the case of Harvard University and several peer institutions—such as the one I used to lead, Columbia University—those roots predate the founding of our republic. These institutions have contributed enormously to the country's development for centuries.

It is especially ironic that, just as we began the countdown to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, with commemorations at Lexington and Concord, this contemporary battle over the future of universities took a dangerous new turn in nearby Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the Trump administration sent a shocking list of demands for ideological and political control over core matters of Harvard's academic governance and freedom.

That earlier battle to establish the United States as a free, self-governing republic was itself a product of the 18th-century Enlightenment, in which the search for truth according to norms of reason, objectivity, and scientific experiment was asserted as a primary end of life and society. Many have noted the Enlightenment's influence on our Founders, represented most significantly in the First Amendment, with its deceptively simple words: “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.”

This was a revolutionary moment in human history. It upended the political universe, declaring that sovereignty lies in the people, not in the divine right of kings. It was equally profound in declaring that a good life and a good society require an ongoing search for understanding and knowledge—not a mentality of obedience or submission, but one of active engagement with the myriad ideas that emerge from a system of extreme openness.

The connection between a good society and the quest for understanding became the principal theme when the Supreme Court finally got around to interpreting the First Amendment, more than a century after its ratification. Public protests against American involvement in the First World War, including against military conscription and anti-Bolshevik intervention in Russia, had led to federal enactment of the Espionage Act of 1917, amended by the Sedition Act of 1918. In Abrams v. United States (1919), pro-Bolshevik activists were convicted under these laws for distributing pamphlets urging a general strike against U.S. munitions factories. In another case, the Socialist Party presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs was convicted and jailed for giving an anti-war speech praising draft resisters (while carefully avoiding encouraging others to join them).

In what would turn out to be the seminal dissenting opinion in Abrams—one of the most compelling and commanding statements ever made about the meaning of freedom of speech—Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. began by describing how difficult it is, given our natural impulses, to align ourselves with our higher interests in seeking truth.

Of the impulse to censorship, he wrote: “Persecution for the expression of opinions seems to me perfectly logical. If you have no doubt of your premises or your power and want a certain result with all your heart you naturally express your wishes in law and sweep away all opposition. To allow opposition by speech seems to indicate that you think the speech impotent, as when a man says that he has squared the circle, or that you do not care whole heartedly for the result, or that you doubt either your power or your premises.”

From this central observation about the “logic” of intolerance, Holmes then continued with a stirring expression of what a good life is and of how the Constitution reflects that understanding. He explained that when people “have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas—that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out.” It is worth emphasizing that in the First Amendment, Holmes found not just a simple limit on government power, but also a way to create a good life—in other words, he offered us a path toward the meaning of life subsumed within a constitutional check on government power.

Finally, as if to demonstrate a mind always prepared to see the contingent nature of beliefs, Holmes modestly asserted: “That at any rate is the theory of our Constitution. It is an experiment, as all life is an experiment. Every year, if not every day, we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge. While that experiment is part of our system I think that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions we loathe and believe to be fraught with death, unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an immediate check is required to save the country.” From this cogent statement has come our rich, intricate, and far-reaching First Amendment jurisprudence.

Holmes's foundational opinion about the meaning of the First Amendment has been challenged and amended in the decades since, most notably by scholars such as Alexander Meiklejohn, who wanted to substitute the idea that free speech is related only to the process of self-governance in a democracy, and not to the broader conception of a search for truth. But politics, after all, is only part of life. So while other theories of the First Amendment have also sprouted up over the past century (including my own, rooted in the idea of “tolerance”), none has ever supplanted that of the search for truth, which remains the lodestar for the First Amendment to this day.

If the pursuit of knowledge and truth is embedded in our founding document and, in particular, the First Amendment to the Constitution, then it is the broad network of American colleges and universities that represent the organized means by which we achieve this fundamental human goal. Universities, and especially our research universities, are charged with the mission of discovering, preserving, and passing on knowledge. They pursue this task with a unique set of qualities, securing a lifelong commitment from some of the best and brightest of each generation. These individuals work in a physically discrete space—a campus—under extraordinary intellectual norms that demand a depth of expertise in their field, a focused determination to expand that knowledge, and a host of special character traits, including an exceptional (some would say abnormal) openness to ideas, full attribution to others when appropriate, comprehensive explanations of one's ideas, and a continual readiness to reexamine whatever conclusions have been reached. I have called this the “scholarly temperament,” noting its intense intellectual discipline, and how it is the absolute condition of membership in the academic community. It is also a matter of entrenched culture, reinforced by the specific and intimate spatial and institutional character of the typical university. Colleges and universities are created in unique ways in order to maximize the fundamental human value of the need to know. You sense this immediately when you walk onto a campus.

And, as such, the Supreme Court has over time acknowledged that these qualities entitle universities to a special standing within First Amendment jurisprudence. In a well-known opinion (Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 1957), Justices Felix Frankfurter and John Marshall Harlan II concurred in the decision to protect a professor whose lectures prompted a sweeping investigation by the attorney general of New Hampshire into possible links to communism. The Court recognized academic freedom as a core constitutional interest and offered this caution, clearly mindful of McCarthyism's damaging impact on academic life during those years: “Scholarship cannot flourish in an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust. Teachers and students must always remain free to inquire, study and to evaluate.”

Going further, Justice Frankfurter warned of the “grave harm resulting from governmental intrusion into the intellectual life of a university.” Citing a statement by senior scholars at two “open” universities in South Africa, Frankfurter and Harlan proclaimed: “It is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment and creation. It is an atmosphere in which there prevail ‘the four essential freedoms' of a university—to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study.”

The idea that universities have special standing is not a fully developed doctrine. The most apt analogy is to how we have come to think about the role of the press within First Amendment doctrine. There has been a long-standing debate in First Amendment jurisprudence over whether the press should be regarded as playing a distinct systemic role, which begins with a notable argument made by Justice Potter Stewart in the 1970s about how we should understand the First Amendment. Certain major cases—such as The New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), a libel case, and The New York Times v. United States (1971), the Pentagon Papers case—arguably were decided with the special concerns for the press and its role in public debate very much in mind. However, several major Court decisions, notably Branzburg v. Hayes (1972), rejected a specific claim by the press for a special privilege against having to testify in a grand-jury proceeding about sources. Several other decisions denied a special right of access for the press to government facilities (prisons, in those cases).

Nicholas B. Dirks: Academia needs to stick up for itself

This is a very complicated debate. Yet the fact that this is a serious issue with respect to the press supports the proposition that we should be thinking similarly about universities. It is true that the “press” is explicitly mentioned in the First Amendment, and “universities” are not, but there are many reasons consistent with First Amendment jurisprudence to justify affording universities a comparable special role. Above all, universities have a distinctive mission consistent with the principal First Amendment rationale: the search for truth.

So, here is my thesis: American universities are rooted in the bedrock of human nature and the foundations of our constitutional democracy. They are every bit as vital to our society as the political branches of government or quasi-official institutions such as the press (often even referred to as the “fourth branch” of government). Universities, as institutions, are the embodiment of the basic rationale of the First Amendment, which affirms our nation's commitment to a never-ending search for truth.

In some ways, universities are a version of the press: They make a deep inquiry into public issues and are always on call to serve as a check on the government. But if their deadlines are far longer, the scope of their work and remit in pursuing truth reach to everywhere that knowledge is or may yet be. Their role in society touches the full panoply of human discovery, never limited by what may be newsworthy at a given moment. And, as many have noted in today's debate over federal funding, the results of academic research and discovery have benefited society in more obviously utilitarian ways, including curing disease, cracking the atom, and creating the technologies that have powered our economic dynamism and enhanced our quality of life.

Universities and university leaders need to become more deliberate about undergirding and explaining this special role. The outlines are there—they trace a major theory—but there is no doubt that the interior must be filled. What we need is a decision or two by the Supreme Court affirming this direction. This is what happened with the idea of the press having a unique role to play within the American political system. The New York Times v. Sullivan and The New York Times v. United States breathed life into the notion that the press deserves a special solicitude under the Constitution. The press seized the moment and thereafter portrayed itself as having this identity.

I do not know the right moment or issue for universities to make their case—but it may be right now. The Trump administration's threats to withdraw substantial funds from Harvard and exert governance across the university provide myriad strong claims of substantial constitutional violations. In times of high crisis, one can often find the opportunities to delineate more sharply our doctrines and values. By filing its own lawsuit against the administration, Harvard has seized that opportunity.

Here is another concrete example to show the potential for what I am talking about. When I was president of Columbia, there was an inquiry as to whether we might take and hold the Snowden papers—millions of official documents relating to national security. Under the Pentagon Papers decision, there was, I believed, a very strong argument that the press—a newspaper, for instance—would be protected if it held on to those documents and then was subjected to criminal action under the Espionage Act of 1917. In my view, the same philosophy should extend to a university keeping possession of that same material for scholarly purposes. For a variety of reasons, we chose not to proceed with the acquisition—but that could have been an interesting case in which to establish a favorable precedent. Others may appear—for instance, university resistance to turning over tenure files to a congressional committee investigating protests and alleged discrimination. In any event, this process may well take years, or even decades, as developed jurisprudence typically does, but the key point is that we need to be thinking about and planning for this.

Universities are most certainly under assault, and the risks appear likely to grow. I am not naive. There is no question that when facing a determined and hostile government, it is difficult to win in the end, whatever the courts ultimately rule. Even with solid protections, constitutional or otherwise, the tactics of initiating investigations, filing lawsuits, and freezing or revoking funding can make life unbearable and unsustainable. In these circumstances, maintaining your sense of self and your integrity is crucial. Strategies of appeasement never work out. And at some point, when sanity returns, you will be seen as having sacrificed your principles when under pressure, and that will undermine your case forever.

Franklin Foer: Trump has found his class enemy

Two more points are worth noting. The first is that receiving federal funding does not necessarily give the government the legitimate power to take it away or use it as a lever to strip you of otherwise valid constitutional rights. The Supreme Court once held, for example, that the federal government could not create the system of public broadcasting and at the same time forbid those broadcasters from engaging in “editorializing” on controversial public issues. This area of so-called unconstitutional conditions is painfully complex, but there should be no license under the First Amendment for the government to use its funding as leverage to try to bring universities to heel. The second point, looking ahead, is that in this time of rising authoritarianism—where the playbook, again, is always to go first after the press and then the universities—those of us who have led these institutions should acknowledge the mistake of not having taken financial steps to better insulate them from this kind of vulnerability by setting aside financial reserves to withstand the storm. The fears of those who worried decades ago about the political risk of federal funding have clearly been borne out under this administration.

Finally, we must come to some working resolution over how to think about “political” perspectives within the academic mission. (I am not here speaking of faculty participating as citizens in a public forum, where traditionally we have protected their rights to the same extent as all other citizens.) Although an argument might be made that a professor should never take a political position, I think that is both unrealistic and undesirable. Just as with the professional press, a natural and, indeed, expected role of a university is to be a societal critic, to bring flaws to our attention and to urge us to be better than we have been.

I remember a very famous journalist, a paragon of the profession, saying of himself that he would “get up every morning asking the question, ‘I wonder what the bastards are up to today.'” Universities, like the press but even more so, explore every facet of existence, including questions of justice, fairness, and the character of our political and social life. It is entirely appropriate for points of view to emerge from this work, on subjects big and small, so it is wrong to say the work of universities should never become involved in controversial issues of public importance—and we should defend that. Universities at their best will at times serve, like the press, as the public's check on government, but they will also serve as a check on the public itself. It takes a mature and wise society to accept a robust system of criticism (like the best kings and queens and their jesters). But that is the ambition.

To be sure, that is not always a welcome role. There is a long tradition of populist disdain for the unconventional thought and progressive values of many university campuses and college towns. Today's political right has, as in earlier eras of our history, skillfully elevated and made an easy target of the most extreme picture of the academic world. And the academic world has undoubtedly provided fodder for that image, especially in not responding more forcefully to the anti-Semitism that too often manifested on campus after October 7, well beyond constitutionally protected political debate and public protest of Israel's government.

Above all, we should understand that government efforts to control the core academic decision making of universities, as the Trump administration has demanded be done with Harvard, are in profound conflict with America's traditions. Nothing could be in sharper contrast with the Enlightenment values of our Founders. Nothing could be more threatening to our nation's continued global leadership in research and education, which attracts the best minds from here and from around the world to discover and disseminate knowledge.

A new prosecutor, a surprising defense team addition, and a whole lot of controversy.

by  Aja Romano

It's the same courtroom, the same judge, and nearly all of the same players — but it's a whole different atmosphere inside Norfolk County Superior Court in Massachusetts, for the retrial of Karen Read, who is accused of murdering her boyfriend John O'Keefe.

Last year's explosive trial divided the city of Boston, and eventually the entire country, over the question of whether Read backed into and ran over O'Keefe in the early hours of January 29, 2022 — or whether O'Keefe, who was headed to a late-night house party in suburban Canton full of police officers like himself, had in fact been killed inside the house, in front of witnesses who then staged the scene outside in the snow.

While that might seem like a question that should be easy to answer, in court it was anything but, thanks mainly to a botched police investigation led by now-former state trooper Michael Proctor. Proctor's conduct shifted an alleged case of deadly domestic violence into a public referendum on Boston police corruption: He made reprehensible comments about Read in texts with his co-workers, including misogynistic slurs, and seemed to view her as guilty before he did any investigation — an investigation in which he allegedly lied and obscured evidence. His testimony was so damning for the prosecution in the first trial that he was ultimately fired, a fate which almost never befalls troopers in Massachusetts. 

By contrast, Read was a ready-made cause celèbre, a “girl next door” college professor turned outspoken advocate for her own innocence. Depending on your perspective, she was either an innocent victim of the system or a manipulative femme fatale — and audiences were eager to pick a side. 

The police mishandling of the case, along with a lot of arguably weird behavior from the party attendees, gave the defense plenty of room to argue its conspiracy case in earnest. The result was a mistrial — though according to four of the jurors, the jury actually wasn't all that divided. They were reportedly torn on the weakest of the charges — leaving the scene of a fatal accident — but had reportedly intended to find Read not guilty on the main charges of second-degree murder and leaving the scene of a fatal accident. They inaccurately told the judge that they were deadlocked on all the charges instead.

That series of fiascos set the stage for the current retrial, and the addition of special prosecutor Hank Brennan, who now has the advantage of knowing most of what the defense's arguments will be in advance. Still, the prosecution has to overcome the specter of Proctor, as well as what the defense, and Read's legions of supporters, claim as reasonable doubt pertaining to nearly every piece of evidence in the case.

“The conventional wisdom is that the second trial is better for the prosecution,” Mark Geragos, an attorney giving his perspective as a spectator to the retrial, told News Nation. “I don't think that's the case here.”

Let's break down what's new, what's changed, and what's still contentious in a case that continues to be a hotbed of controversy.

Every single aspect of Read's retrial is up for debate — including whether it should be happening at all. Her defense team appealed the retrial all the way up to the US Supreme Court, arguing that since jurors in the first trial had reportedly reached a unanimous “not guilty” verdict on the two main charges, retrying her was double jeopardy. The problem? The jurors never officially recorded that verdict. The Supreme Court rejected Read's petition just as the retrial was getting underway. 

And so yet another jury has to try and make sense of the bizarre case details that complicated the first trial. They remain as confounding as ever: 

Even the facts that seem straightforward and damning at first glance are, upon closer scrutiny, anything but. The search that witness and party attendee Jen McCabe allegedly made on her phone in the wee hours of the morning for “hos long to die in cold” would be a bombshell for the defense, if only the experts could agree on the timestamp. If she made it at 2:27 am, when the browser tab was opened, that would mean she knew O'Keefe was on the lawn hours before anyone claims to have seen him there. But if she made it when both she and the prosecution expert claim she did, at 6:23 am, that would come after she and Read discovered the body.

Then there's the mysterious fitness tracking data that officially recorded O'Keefe climbing stairs shortly before his phone stopped moving, around 12:24 am. That might be a strong indicator that O'Keefe went inside the house, as Read claims, before his activity suddenly halted. Except the prosecutor's forensic analyst claims that the phone data is inaccurate, and that a more likely explanation is that instead of climbing stairs, O'Keefe was riding in a car as it was going up a hill, likely traveling to the Albert house shortly before he stopped moving.

The prosecution's strongest argument this time around is arguably the recorded temperature of O'Keefe's cellphone battery, which they claim began to rapidly fall in temperature shortly after O'Keefe stopped moving — surely a sign he was outside in the snow, right? Wrong, according to the prosecution's own analyst, who admitted on the witness stand under cross-examination that the phone could have still been inside the house while its temperature was dropping. 

Surely nothing could be more straightforward than Read herself, declaring to anyone and everyone, “I hit him, I hit him,” at the scene, right? Not according to the litany of actual statements given by witnesses, which have varied wildly in consistency and accuracy about who Read spoke these words to, how many times she said them, and whether she was speaking declaratively or out of panic, asking, “Did I hit him?” or “Could I have hit him?” or doing some combination of all of the above.

And, of course, there's the shoddy investigation itself — conducted during a blizzard by officers using solo cups and plastic bags instead of evidence bags and forensic technicians. That grave mistake was overseen by Proctor, who seemed to want to wrap the case up as quickly as possible, and, as his own text messages indicate, without involving the Albert family. 

Given that the case itself remains a trainwreck, what, then, is new? Mainly the special prosecutor. Brennan, an attorney most well-known for defending Boston mobster Whitey Bulger, comes across as dweebish in the courtroom but has a track record of hard-hitting and effective trial tactics.He won an acquittal for ice skater Nancy Kerrigan's brother Mark Kerrigan in the 2010 death of their father, as well as controversial acquittals in two rape cases for disgraced former attorney Gary Zerola. 

The defense is mostly the same. Attorney Alan Jackson, who famously prosecuted Phil Spector, then went on to represent Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, has handled the opening statements and most of the cross-examinations himself. Yet the defense isn't without its own potential new lawyerly ace card: Victoria George, a Princeton-educated lawyer, who was chosen as an alternate juror for Read's first trial and sat through most of it before being dismissed. (She has implied her dismissal alongside that of another juror were signs of Judge Beverly Cannone's bias against Read; the actual reasons for their dismissal have never been made public.) 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

After the first trial concluded, George reached out to Read's defense team and signed on to assist as counsel — and that assistance could be invaluable, given that she experienced the case being presented to her in real time by the lawyers, as jurors are likely experiencing it now. “It is unbelievable, the insight you get from the jurors after they have sat on [a jury],” Geragos told News Nation about his own experiences working with previous jurors like George. 

The defense may well need all the help it can get to counter what seems to be the prosecution's stripped-down approach to the retrial. Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally, who oversaw the first trial, is still working with Brennan on the retrial, but so far Brennan has been handling most of the presentation and cross-examination himself, focusing mainly on forensic data that he claims is irrefutable, commonsense evidence that Read did it. (It's also the evidence least likely to be tainted by Proctor himself.) 

The prosecution has also been using Read's own interviews with media, given during and after the first trial, against her. Over the defense's repeated objections, Cannone has allowed clips to be shown from Read's interviews with outlets like 20/20 and Dateline that include her discussing her initial fear that she hit O'Keefe. Brennan believes they show Read's “consciousness of guilt,” but the jury could potentially be seeing the clips as indicating her confusion over what happened. 

The defense in turn has largely focused on undermining witness testimony by highlighting changing memories and inconsistencies across their statements given in police interviews, at the grand jury, and the previous trial. Another theme the defense has called out repeatedly is the close-knit Canton community of which O'Keefe was a part; everyone from the police to the first responders in this case seems to know everyone else. Read, the defense insists, was an outsider to the insular group that is now accusing her. 

Cannone has limited the defense's ability to point to members of that community as potential alternate suspects in O'Keefe's death — meaning the emphasis on a mysterious group conspiracy that underpinned the defense at Read's first trial is largely absent. Instead, the defense has leaned heavily on the “dog bite” theory, promising to call a forensics expert to testify that the gouges on O'Keefe's arm came from an attack by the Alberts' dog, Chloe, who was abruptly rehomed not long after his death.

It likely won't be clear what an impact these changes by both sides will have on the trial until Proctor, who is listed as a potential witness for both sides, takes the stand. Still, his presence looms over the court. Some lawyers watching the trial have criticized Brennan for not confronting the albatross of Proctor's role in the investigation directly in his opening statement, leaving an opening for Jackson to lead with it in his own. Jackson described Proctor as a “malignancy” infecting the entire case. 

Another unexpected moment from Brennan's opening statement came when he remarked casually, while recounting the experience of a firefighter at the accident scene, that Read's claims to have hit the victim “didn't reconcile with the injuries” — an extremely surprising admission for the prosecutor to make. 

That even the prosecutor himself can't help introducing ambiguity into his own arguments reminds us what a frustrating standard of proof “reasonable doubt” can be. As with everything else about Karen Read and her case, it's in the eye of the beholder.

Political scientist Frances Lee examines the “noble lies” and truth-seeking failures of the pandemic.

by  Sean Illing

There are lots of stories to tell about the Covid pandemic, but most of them, if you drill down, are about politics. It's about who made the decisions, who set the priorities, who mattered, who suffered the most, and why?

Frances Lee is a professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University and the co-author of a new book called In Covid's Wake: How Our Politics Failed Us. It's a careful book that treats our response to Covid as a kind of stress test for our political system. Lee and her co-author Stephen Macedo look at all the institutions responsible for truth-seeking — journalism, science, universities — and examine how they performed. 

Were they committed to truth and open to criticism? Did they live up to the basic norms of liberalism and science? Were we able to have a reasonable conversation about what was happening — and, if we weren't, why not? 

The book isn't really an attempt to grade our Covid policies. There are no villains in their story. It's more about the quality of the debate and deliberation that surrounded those policies. Which is more than just an academic exercise. The conceit of the book is that it's worth knowing what broke down during our response to Covid because those same things might also break down when the next crisis arrives.

So I invited Lee onto The Gray Area to talk about what she learned and what she thinks are the most important political lessons of the pandemic. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

How would you characterize the debate we had in this country about our response to Covid?

Well, it was a fast-moving crisis, and so it's not surprising in retrospect that the debate was truncated. But it is surprising, as we looked back and did the research for this book, the extent to which the decisions that were made in the early going of the pandemic departed from conventional wisdom about how to handle a pandemic and violated recommendations that had been put on paper in calmer times about how a crisis like this should be handled.

Countries around the world sort of scrapped preexisting pandemic plans in order to follow the example set in Wuhan, and then in Italy, with Italy having the first nationwide lockdown and improvising along the way. There wasn't a scientific basis for the actions that were taken, in the sense that there was no accumulated body of evidence that these measures would be effective. It was hoped that they would be, but there was a lack of evidence.

If you go back and take a look at a report that was prepared by the World Health Organization in 2019, just months before the pandemic broke out, that document goes through each of the proposed “non-pharmaceutical interventions,” meaning the measures that are taken to keep people apart in the context of an infectious disease pandemic, like masking or social distancing, business closures, school closures. 

Across the board, the evidence base is rated as poor quality. Several such measures are recommended not to be used under any circumstances in the context of a respiratory pandemic. Among those were border closures, quarantine of exposed individuals, and testing and contact tracing. And then all those measures were of course employed here in the US and around the world in the context of the Covid pandemic without any kind of reckoning with the reasons why those measures were not recommended in the pre-pandemic planning.

Let's get into the core of your critique, which is about the decision-making process. You quote a health official in the book, who said, “I simply could not tolerate the notion of having 10 percent, 1 percent, or even 1/10 percent of Americans die a preventable death.” So what's wrong with saying, as a matter of policy, that the most important thing is to save lives at all costs?

I believe that that's a quote from Deborah Birx. She was the coordinator of the Coronavirus Task Force. She was not able, she said, to do a cost-benefit analysis where she could calculate how much a life was worth. I mean, that's a very understandable response and attitude. But you have to remember that as policymakers were faced with the kinds of measures that were being employed to control the spread of a disease, lives are on both sides of the equation.

Let's begin with one of the first measures taken, which was the shutting down of so-called nonessential health care, and it was defined quite broadly. There were a lot of cancer treatments that were canceled and regarded as nonessential depending on how advanced the cancer was. So you're trading off future risks to life to preserve health care capacity now. 

When you are exacerbating inequalities, when you are depriving people of education that has long-term health effects, you're trading the present for the future, and these are very difficult choices. The reason why we do cost-benefit analysis is in order to be responsible as policymakers. You can't only focus on one threat to human beings when we're facing many different threats.

But you're also arguing that health officials were intolerant of criticism and skepticism. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just trying to be as fair as possible to the people in the fire at that time. I can imagine that one reason for that intolerance is that they really were in a tough position. I'm not here to defend any particular people or decisions, but do you have sympathy for the predicament that these people were facing? 

Well, I do have sympathy. I also know, and experts should be cognizant of this as well, that they have their limitations. We have our limitations, and there's always a risk of hubris. They should have acknowledged the possibility of failure, that these measures wouldn't work as well as they hoped that they would, and that should have been factored into their decision-making. 

It's not just lives versus the economy. It's also the question of how many lives are you even saving? Are these policies workable for society? There was a lack of evidence based on that. And so you can't just make policy affecting the whole of a society on a wing and a prayer — and to a great extent that is what they were doing.

An important part of the argument is that there was a disjunction between what health officials like Anthony Fauci and Birx were saying in private and what they were saying in public. Can you give me examples?

Well, in her memoir, Deborah Birx is quite frank, that two weeks to slow the spread was just a pretext and it was just an effort to get Trump on board for initial closures and that, “As soon as those closures were in place,” she says, “we immediately began to look for ways to extend them.”

I think one of the more devastating noble lies that was told during the pandemic was to go out there in spring and summer 2021, even into the fall of 2021, with the vaccine mandates and tell people that if you get vaccinated, you can protect your loved ones from catching the disease from you, that you will become a dead end to the virus. They did not have a scientific basis for making that claim. The vaccine trials had not tested for an outcome on transmission.

We also knew that a systemically administered vaccine, meaning a shot — it's not a nasal vaccine — doesn't prevent you from contracting the virus and for it proliferating in your nasal cavity so that you can transmit. That was known. And so you shouldn't have gone out there and just reassured people that this would work and you'd be able to protect your loved ones. Everybody found out in rather short order, that getting vaccinated for Covid didn't prevent you from getting Covid and also from transmitting it to others.

If you were in one of those rooms making these decisions about what to tell the public, what would you do if you were faced with a choice where you could either mislead the public with a “noble lie” that you were absolutely convinced would save thousands of lives, but you also knew that if the public were to learn about the lie later, it would shatter trust in scientific institutions for maybe a generation? 

This is a very important question. The question I return to is: What is the basis for believing that these measures would work? You have to be able to accept uncertainty. If you're a scientist, there's a lot we just don't know about the world. To a great extent, the more expertise you develop, the more you learn about what we don't know. And so you have to come to terms with your ignorance as a policymaker, and so you may be wrong about what you think is going to work.

Under those conditions, now you're trading your future credibility for measures that will be suboptimal and may not have nearly the effectiveness that you hope for. That, I think, is the greater failing to not confront the limits of our knowledge.

So here's where I think we see failures in other truth-seeking institutions. Where were the academics? Where were the journalists asking hard questions of policymakers during that time? Critical thinking got suspended during the pandemic. And so then government officials, including public health officials, are not being held accountable in the way they should be to justify themselves.

Do you think Covid shattered the delusion that there's a value-free science, that we can make policy choices like these based on science alone?

One should not think that it is possible for science to settle political questions in the way that politicians talked about the Covid response, that they were just “following the science.” That was never responsible rhetoric. It was never a responsible way to make policy. 

You have to come to terms with the reality of politics, which is diverse values and diverse interests, and that when you make policy choices, there are always winners and losers. And you have to see that with clear eyes and you try to make as many winners as possible and you try not to harm people unnecessarily. But you can't blind yourself to the effects of the choices that you make by pretending like there was no choice at all.

It's interesting to me that there are no real villains in this story, at least not in the story you tell in the book.

The book Steve and I have written is not a muckraking book. We're not accusing officials of nefarious motives or corruption. It's not about the “Plandemic.” It's more a story of folly than villainy. 

What's the most important takeaway from all this? 

The acknowledgement of uncertainty, the willingness to keep learning. And then resist that impulse towards moralized antagonism, dismissing the perspectives of people you disagree with on the other side, politically. Resist that. Listen to them and try to evaluate what they say on the merits. And don't assume that you have nothing to learn from people you think are bad people.

What we saw in the pandemic was society sort of turning on itself. Democrats blaming Republicans, Republicans blaming Democrats, all these different divides, where the root problem was that we did not have the technology to control or stop this crisis. All we could really do is mitigate it. And acknowledging our frailties as human beings, that's difficult. It's much easier and more comfortable just to blame the bad things that are happening on the people you don't like anyway. We saw an awful lot of that.

Warren Buffett hailed Tim Cook as a one-of-a-kind leader after selling two-thirds of his stake in Apple last year.

The famed investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO praised the tech titan's CEO in his opening comments at his conglomerate's annual meeting on Saturday.

""Tim Cook has made Berkshire a lot more than I have made Berkshire,"" Buffett quipped to laughter in the auditorium, nodding to the fact that Berkshire's roughly $35 billion investment in Apple between 2016 and 2018 grew to $173 billion by the end of 2023.

However, Berkshire sold about 67% of its Apple shares in the first nine months of 2024, leaving only 300 million shares at the end of December, worth about $62 billion at Friday's closing price of $205 per share.

Buffett also gave Cook perhaps the best compliment when he favorably compared him to his iconic predecessor and Apple's cofounder.

""I knew Steve Jobs briefly,"" Buffett said, adding that the creator of the iPhone ""of course did things that nobody else could have done.""

""Nobody but Steve could have created Apple, but nobody but Tim could have developed it like it has,"" Buffett added.

Since Cook took the reins in 2011, Apple stock has soared from under $15 on a split-adjusted basis to $205, a roughly 14-fold gain, boosting Apple's market capitalization to north of $3 trillion.

Why America is returning to the days of double-duty gadgets

Keisha Sarpong needed a new work bag to ferry her documents and laptop to the office. But as she started looking, she realized she didn't want the bag to make her look too much ""like a lawyer with a briefcase"" when she went to happy hour, Sarpong, a 30-year-old nonprofit worker who also runs a TikTok fashion account, tells me. Oh, and it'd be nice if it had enough space for her to take it on a trip. Basically, she wanted a bag that could do it all.

The bag Sarpong eventually settled on features a stylish black leather finish, a laptop sleeve, and plenty of space for a water bottle and notebooks, plus an adjustable strap that can secure it on a rolling suitcase. It may not be perfect for everywhere, but it's pretty close.

Sarpong's search isn't an isolated instance of a picky shopper. She's part of a growing cohort of consumers demanding more from the products they spend their hard-earned money on. It's not just bags that you can work and play and travel with. It's air fryers that can cook almost anything. Makeup products that double as skincare items. Or even an unassuming ceiling lamp that, you see upon second glance, is also a smart projector and speaker. Faced with rising prices and increasingly busy lives, Americans are arming themselves with products that work like a Swiss Army knife.

""If I'm going to invest in a quality staple, I want to make sure I'm going to get a lot of use out of it. I'm really drawn to pieces that are multifunctional,"" Sarpong says. It's not just her bag that she's making work overtime — she also tells me she owns travel cubes that do triple duty as a purse organizer and cosmetics pouch. That's where she stores her all-in-one makeup products, which can be variously used on lips, cheeks, and eyelids.

Whether it's higher prices, hybrid work, or an ever-rising obsession with efficiency and optimization, there are a slew of reasons Americans are looking for stuff that can fill more than one role. And as tariffs threaten to raise prices even further, people are trying to find value wherever they can get it. For businesses, expanding their product offering to fill different parts of customers' lives can insulate them from fickle tastes and cushion their bottom lines in leaner times. As multifunctional goods become ever more popular, it's clear that we're living in a three-in-one economy.

American consumers are wrestling with a lot of uncertainty these days. Years of COVID-driven inflation have left people unsure of just how much things are supposed to cost. Economic upheaval has people worried about their jobs. And businesses are skimping on the quantity and sizes of their products (whether it's smaller portions at restaurants or fewer sheets of toilet paper per roll) — leaving Americans wondering whether they're really getting a bang for their buck. All these factors are pushing people to look for deals wherever they can: In a recent survey of consumers by the accounting and consulting firm EY, 77% of respondents said they were actively changing their buying habits to seek better value.

How do you make your dollar go further in this environment after you've already followed the classic budgeting advice? Hybrid products could be a tool in consumers' inflation-fighting toolbox. Inflation-weary consumers are increasingly turning to these products, especially for appliances and tech gadgets, says Steffen Schenk, the managing director of NielsenIQ's North America tech and durables sector. For example, he points to combination microwave-roaster-grill air fryers that save time and space in small kitchens and self-cleaning robotic vacuums with built-in mops. NielsenIQ has seen growing consumer demand for smart kitchen appliances and tech wearables.

""The reality is that convenience is now one of the key drivers of choice across most categories,"" Schenk says. ""And once again, having those multifunctional devices really helps with that.""

Kristen Jauregui, a 35-year-old payroll specialist who runs a lifestyle blog, has been putting a bigger emphasis on budgeting than she has in the past amid the chaos of tariffs and elevated inflation. Jauregui tells me that she's consuming much more mindfully, whether it's buying less, doing more price comparison before hitting ""check out,"" or looking for products that serve more than one occasion.

""If I can find something that is multifaceted or can be used in more than one aspect, I will absolutely buy that over a product I can only use once,"" Jauregui says.

Jauregui has been optimizing her closet for both work and play. Ever since the pandemic, she's swapped out high heels for more comfortable loafers and sneakers that can be worn straight from the office to a night out. Another hybrid product Jauregui has recently started using is solid shampoo, a bar that can be used as shampoo, conditioner, face wash, and body soap. These bars — which Jauregui purchases from the beauty brand Kitsch — have saved her money and time, as Jauregui no longer needs to buy travel-size containers of different toiletries when she goes on trips. According to consulting firm Capgemini, big companies like L'Oreal are hopping on the trend and launching their own solid shampoo products.

In addition to everyday essentials, consumers are turning to products with various uses to justify their desire to splurge. Hardcore austerity has never been America's strength — when sales spiked after the 2001 stock market crash, former Estée Lauder CEO Leonard Lauder called the need to partake in small luxuries during major downturns the ""lipstick effect.""

Nowadays, consumers stressed from constant budgeting might forgo expensive vacations but still decide to treat themselves to a little retail therapy, Schenk says. If consumer sentiment continues to decline and tariff-induced uncertainty drags down the US economy, Schenk expects the lipstick effect to kick in during the back half of this year.

""If you look at some of the trends we're seeing around self-indulgence, wellness, and so on, we would expect a similar lipstick effect in this cycle,"" Schenk tells me.

Sarpong has already been indulging in some lipstick effect shopping — literally. She's a big fan of the beauty brand Rhode's pocket blushes, which come in a small, unassuming cylinder, not unlike a glue stick. The pigment can be used as a blush, lip color, or moisturizer.

""It's in the name. It's a nice handheld size, so I can bring it with me everywhere,"" Sarpong tells me. ""I can touch it up on my cheek but also my lips. It's a nice two-for-one.""

Multifunctional products can help consumers use some ""girl math,"" as TikTok would say, to justify those nonessential splurges during economic hardship. After all, if the lipstick you purchased doubles as a moisturizer and blush, you're getting much more bang for your buck.

In addition to acute economic drivers, longer-term trends have also increased consumer appetite for products that do it all. One is the pandemic-driven downfall of the five-day in-office expectation. As the divide between where work ends and where the rest of our lives begin has become less clear, consumers seek products that can cross over from one side of the divide to the other. This cross-functionality appears to appeal especially to Gen Z and millennials. Saoirse Cleary, the creative strategy director at the marketing agency MG Empower, tells me that the younger generations' emphasis on work-life balance makes them more open to trying new products that offer unique wellness or lifestyle features, such as athleisure wear and multifunctional makeup products. These demographics are also much more likely to find these multifunctional products through social media channels rather than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.

Convenience seeking isn't just a Gen Z or millennial thing, though. ""Young people tend to be the early adopters,"" Cleary added. ""But if something is hybrid, it makes everyone's lives easier.""

Yet another driving factor for the three-in-one economy is Americans' desire to optimize every part of their life. Devices and goods that fulfill multiple needs can feed people's drive to be the best, healthiest, or most efficient. Schenk, from NielsenIQ, tells me smartwatches that track health metrics while keeping time have been especially popular. From 2019 to 2023, the number of new products in the wearables category jumped from 5,000 to 80,000 — an increase not seen in any other product category, NielsenIQ GfK Market Intelligence says.

Cleary also highlights the rising popularity of wearable technology such as Oura rings, which provide users with various biometric data.

""People started out with just wanting to track their steps with a wearable device or on their phone, and now it's about period tracking, sleep tracking, and heart rate tracking,"" Cleary says.

""You have to highlight the hybrid benefits of a product nowadays,"" Cleary adds. ""Everybody wants to self-optimize, so everything you buy has to be the best version of what you could get.""

Amid this consumer phenomenon, companies are increasingly leaning into the desire for multifunctional goods to add to their bottom lines, especially when those products can satisfy people's craving for a ""little treat."" Cleary tells me that appealing to people in various walks of life can expand the awareness of a brand outside its core constituency, which helps to lure in new customers who may not have run into the company's offerings otherwise.

""A bag that functions for work, the gym, and social outings can be embraced by minimalists, professionals, and fitness enthusiasts alike, creating crossover appeal that strengthens a brand's reach,"" she says.

Cleary adds that in her work helping global brands develop their influencer marketing strategies, she's seen companies launch multifunctional product campaigns.

Multiuse products can also deepen relationships with existing customers, especially during an economic downturn. When companies launch value-rich products that make people's lives easier, they build trust within their customer base. On the other hand, price increases and a decrease in perceived product value isolate cash-sensitive shoppers. With consumers like Sarpong and Jauregui putting more thought into their purchases, a multifunctional aspect helps brands make buyers feel like they're getting the best option.

Twice in the past few years, the fragility of our global economic system has been pushed to the forefront. When the pandemic hit, businesses shut down, and a toilet paper shortage had people rushing to store shelves. Now, as businesses grapple with tariff-driven uncertainty and DOGE drives federal worker layoffs, consumers are feeling déjà vu. For everyday people, there isn't much you can do to shield yourself from breakdowns in complex supply chains or policy decisions made in DC, but changing your consumption patterns is one actionable way to exert your economic agency.

""The way that we've used technology has changed. The way that we shop has changed. The way we interact with people has changed. So I try to make sure that anything I purchase is multifaceted,"" Jauregui tells me.

""I've changed how I purchase makeup and skincare products because I want to make sure they're versatile,"" Jauregui adds. ""If something happens tomorrow, and the world shuts down, will I be able to find a way to get this?""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","An American retiree spent $18,807 for cancer treatment abroad. She said medical tourism saved her money and stress.","https://www.businessinsider.com/medical-tourism-boomer-cancer-treatment-save-money-medicare-insurance-2025-5","Sat, 03 May 2025 08:03:00 GMT","

When Akaisha Kaderli was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer while traveling the world with her husband, Billy, the couple had to make a decision. 

They could give up the nomadic lifestyle they've been living for more than 30 years and travel back to the US to navigate treatment through Medicare Advantage. Or they could pay out-of-pocket for healthcare abroad. They chose the latter — and Billy said he never left his wife's side.

""She was a trooper about it,"" he said. ""I watched her every night and every morning.""

The early retirees said their jetsetting ""isn't a vacation, it's a lifestyle."" And, prior to Akaisha's diagnosis, they spent most of their days trying new cuisines in Southeast Asia and lounging on Italian beaches.

A serious medical diagnosis can derail careful retirement planning. Business Insider has heard from dozens of older Americans who spent their 401(k) savings on medical bills, went into debt, or returned to work so they could afford care. For older people with limited savings who primarily live on Social Security, the cost of unexpected doctors' visits and prescriptions can be devastating.

As healthcare costs continue to climb in the US, some Americans are opting for ""medical tourism."" Whether it's for elective procedures or lifesaving treatment, people like the Kaderlis are looking for ways to afford healthcare without breaking the bank. While data is limited, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that millions of Americans seek healthcare in another country every year — most commonly to Mexico, Canada, and the Caribbean.

""We're 72 and we've had a great life,"" Akaisha said. ""I'm not looking to die, but I wasn't going to spend my money on hospitals and drugs.""

Akaisha and Billy say they were early adopters of the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement and have continued to maintain wealth through long-term investments and low-budget living. Before retiring in their late 30s, Akaisha ran a restaurant while Billy held jobs as a chef and in a brokerage firm. They invested most of their money in the S&P 500 and, when they stopped working, began traveling — often living for months at a time in low cost-of-living countries.

The Kaderlis said they kept an American health insurance plan through their mid-50s so they could receive care in the US if they needed it. Most US-based insurance doesn't work abroad, and they kept the plan as a safety net for any serious medical needs. They later enrolled in Medicare Advantage around the time they qualified for Social Security at age 62.

But when Akaisha was diagnosed with cancer, the couple said they quickly decided to avoid the American healthcare system. They don't know exactly what cancer treatment would have cost them in the US with Medicare, but Billy said he's confident the choice saved them money, and it ""would have taken much longer to go through all the hoops"" of finding in-network providers. Stage three breast cancer treatment in the US typically costs over $100,000 — and even patients with insurance can be left with steep bills to pay.

For a total of $18,807 out of pocket, Akaisha received diagnostic testing in Thailand, follow-up exams in Vietnam, mastectomy surgery and radiation in Mexico, and some recovery care in the West Indies. Her treatment regimen lasted a few months from the day of her diagnosis.

""I wanted to live my life, and so I took the cheapest option,"" Akaisha said. ""This is the option we would have taken anyway, but I don't like the idea of spending $100,000 or $200,000 on a medical procedure when I can get a wonderful type of care for $20,000.""

Now, Akaisha is done with her treatment and is recovering. She and Billy don't plan to slow down their lifestyle anytime soon: they're living in Arizona for a while before spending the summer in Mexico and Thailand, the colder months in the Caribbean, and the spring in the Mediterranean.

""It just gets better and better,"" Akaisha said. ""This is the life we were meant to live.""

A jolt of staff upheaval this week made Marco Rubio the first person in 50 years to hold the top two national security jobs in the US government, the culmination of a journey from his role as Donald Trump's rival for the presidency to one of his most prominent aides.

Rubio's ascent to both secretary of state and interim national security adviser coincided with the fall of Mike Waltz, whose hawkish foreign policy stances made Trump's MAGA base wary. Waltz was ousted from his West Wing job after inadvertently including a journalist on a Signal group chat about military actions and will be nominated to be Trump's ambassador to the United Nations.

Anthony Albanese and his partner Jodie Haydon, outside a polling station during a federal election in Sydney, May 3.

Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was on track to lead his party to its biggest election victory since World War II, giving him a strong mandate to tackle much-needed economic reform and bargain with the Trump administration on tariffs.

Albanese will enter his second term as a Labor hero after back-to-back wins in Saturday's election, the first prime minister to do so since 2004, while in a shock outcome opposition leader Peter Dutton lost his seat. With 60% of votes counted, Labor led by 55.9% to the opposition's 44.1%, the Australian Electoral Commission said. That was a much stronger result than polls predicted, with Labor now projected to win at least 86 of the parliament's 150 seats with 14 still undecided.

Economic data has been uneven, as the impact of Trump's sweeping tariffs is only starting to hit. 

The stock market is on a heater. After rising for nine straight sessions and gaining 10% in that time, the S&P 500 Index closed out the week on its longest winning streakBloomberg Terminal in more than 20 years, recouping all of its losses since April 2, when President Donald Trump launched his global trade war. 

The question is why. And the answer appears to be, with so much of Wall Street's institutional money staying on the sidelines, bullish individual investors are driving the gains. History says there's little sense in fighting this enthusiasm. To paraphrase the famous statement from former Citigroup CEO Chuck Prince in 2007 right before the global financial crisis hit, for now the music is still playing, so you have to dance.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett will preside over the company's annual meeting. Track all of the day's news and analysis here.

To watch the meeting in the Mandarin translation, click here.

CNBC is livestreaming the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting on Saturday.

The annual gathering has long been known as ""Woodstock for Capitalists."" Each year the event draws thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders from around the world to hear the latest thoughts and reflections from the 94-year-old Warren Buffett.

Buffett is joined on stage by Greg Abel, Berkshire's vice chairman of non-insurance operations and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Ajit Jain, Berkshire's vice chairman of insurance operations.

Here are some of the highlights:

Buffett called the U.S. a shining example of capitalism, making the analogy of a cathedral attached to a casino.

""Capitalism in the United States has succeeded like nothing you've ever seen. It's a combination of this magnificent cathedral, which has produced an economy like nothing the world's ever seen, and then it's got this massive casino attached,"" he said. ""In the cathedrals, they basically are designing things that will be producing goods and services for 300-and-some million people like it's never been done before in history.""

Although the temptation to focus all of one's time and energy at this metaphorical casino is quite high, Buffett cautioned that keeping the balance was of utmost importance.

""At the casino, everybody's having a good time and there's lots of money changing hands and everything, but you've got to make sure the cathedral gets fed, too,"" he said. ""It's very important that the United States in the next 100 years makes sure that the cathedral is not overtaken by the casino.""

Buffett continued: ""It's an interesting system we developed, but it's worked. It dispenses rewards in what seems like a terribly capricious manner.""

Abel, who serves as the chair of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, said that wildfire risk is ""not going away"" in the United States.

Berkshire's approach to managing those risks include maintenance of the infrastructure and powering down when bad weather or a spreading fire approaches, Abel said.

""We have clearly recognized as a team that we have to de-energize those assets,"" Abel said.

He also said that Berkshire can't serve as an ""insurer of last resort"" in wildfire disasters.

Berkshire's portfolio includes insurance and utility holdings. That means wildfire damage can cause losses for the insurance business and, if a fire happens in a region where Berkshire's utility operates, create legal liability concerns.

Buffett seemed to express concern about the future of the utility business.

""Every part of the country is going to need electricity and there are going to be places where privately held electric utilities would be foolish to operate. ... How that will be resolved in our democracy, we will find out,"" Buffett said about the liability concerns.

""We are not in the business of trying to solve unsolvable problems,"" he added.

The company's first-quarter report reflected a $1.1 billion loss related to Southern California wildfires.

Berkshire's special book celebrating six decades under Buffett has sold out, the CEO announced.

Buffett said during the second half of his question-and-answer session that he received a note saying all copies of the 60th anniversary book have been purchased. It's the only item for sale at Bookworm, the on-site bookstore.

Buffett said at the start of Saturday's gathering that about 4,400 copies sold the day prior. Berkshire printed around 8,000 in total, 3,000 more than originally planned.

Berkshire is auctioning off some signed copies for charity.

— Alex Harring

Buffett reassured his shareholders that Berkshire wouldn't put their money to use for things that the company thought was ""stupid.""

If they did, the shareholders ""ought to get rid of us,"" he added.

""It's easier to do stupid things with other people's money than it is with your own money. That's one of the problems government has generally. We don't want to bring it to private enterprise,"" Buffett quipped.

— Lisa Kailai Han

When asked about his views on capital allocation, particularly into new businesses, Abel said that Berkshire had a strong set of values to follow, including maintaining its current reputation.

""We have values that we as a management team — as defined by Warren and Charlie and everybody associated with the business — they had great values that really set Berkshire up well for the future,"" he responded. ""There are a couple that are absolutely critical.""

The first of these, said Abel, was keeping up the legacy that has already been established.

""One, we'll maintain the reputation of Berkshire and that of our company, and I view that in investing or how we operate things across each of our businesses. That will always be a priority, and something that we'll ensure is in the forefront of our minds,"" he said.

Other important values he would stick by include keeping Berkshire's balance sheet strong. Abel said that the company's current ""significant set of cash"" was an ""enormous"" and ""strategic asset"" that he could deploy in the future, one that allows Berkshire to not depend on any banks or other entities for its success.

Properly understanding and managing risk is also important, he said, alongside owning a ""great set of operating companies that do produce significant cash flows."" 

""It's really the investment philosophy and how Warren and the team have allocated capital for the past 60 years,"" he added. ""Really, it will not change. And it's the approach we'll take as we go forward.""

— Lisa Kailai Han

Buffett said Berkshire halted its buyback program this year partly because of the 1% excise tax on stock repurchases, which was introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. 

""It does make it slightly less attractive than it was before,"" he said, referring to the 1% tax. 

Berkshire shares also have significantly outperformed the S&P 500, rising nearly 19% this year. Class A shares climbed 1.8% Friday to a new all-time high of $809,350.

— Yun Li

Buffett explained why he thinks that the balance sheet is a good starting point when deciding whether to invest in a company.

""I spend more time looking at balance sheets than I do income statements. And Wall Street really doesn't pay much attention to balance sheets, but I like to look at the balance sheets over an eight- or 10-year period before I even look at the income account because there's certain things that are harder to hide or play games with on the balance sheet,"" Buffett said.

""Neither one gives you the total answer,"" he added.

— Jesse Pound

Buffett returns to the stage after a brief lunch break, and quickly begins the afternoon question-and-answer session. 

Before tackling the first question, he made a quick movie recommendation: ""Becoming Katherine Graham."" The documentary about the Washington Post publisher quotes Buffett in its trailer. 

—Christina Cheddar Berk 

Despite unique travel challenges for foreign shareholders this year, it was a full house at CHI Health Center in Omaha on Saturday morning as Buffett spoke.

Multiple international investors told CNBC they were staying home this year given concerns about traveling to the U.S. in the current political climate. These decisions come after President Donald Trump's plan for contentious tariffs has quickly raised fears of a global trade war.

Buffett said during Saturday's gathering that Berkshire's shareholder event held a day prior saw record high attendance of nearly 20,000.

— Alex Harring

The Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting has taken a break for lunch. 

Buffett is expected to return to the stage for another round of shareholder questions at about 12 p.m. ET. 

—Christina Cheddar Berk 

""What has happened in the last 30, 45 days … is really nothing,"" said Buffett, noting Berkshire Hathaway's stock was cut in half three times during his 60 years running the company. 

Given that, he said the U.S. stock market's recent action should not be considered a ""huge"" move.

""This has not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort,"" Buffett said.

The S&P 500 nearly closed in a 20% bear market at its low in April before President Donald Trump paused his most punitive tariffs on countries, causing a rebound that's brought the benchmark back more than halfway. At last check the S&P 500 was down about 8% from its record high.

—Alex Harring, John Melloy

When giving advice to a young investor, Buffett said that finding a way to be fulfilled and happy helps people have long lives. 

""I think a happy person lives longer than somebody that's doing some things they don't really admire much in life,"" Buffett said.

— Jesse Pound

Jain said that Berkshire Hathaway had not been immune to disruptions from direct competition in the form of private equity firms in recent years.

""There's no question the private equity firms have come into the space, and we are no longer competitive in this space. We used to do a fair amount in this space, but in the last three, four years, I don't think we've done a single deal,"" he said.

That being said, Jain added that the private equity strategy of using higher leverage and more aggressive investment strategies works while the ""economy is doing great and credit spreads are low.""

""However, there is always the danger that at some point the regulators might get cranky and say, 'You're taking too much risk on behalf of your policyholders,' and that could end in tears,"" Jain added. ""We do not like the risk-reward that these situations offer, and therefore we put up the white flag and said we can't compete in this segment right now.""

Buffett added that Berkshire was unique from its competitors because he takes a more personal stake in his investments.

""They probably have a somewhat different fiduciary feeling about what they're doing, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't work and if it doesn't work, they go on to other things,"" Buffett said. ""If what we do here at Berkshire doesn't work, I spend the end of my life regretting what I've created so it's just a whole different personal equation. There's no property casualty company that can basically replicate Berkshire.""

— Lisa Kailai Han

When asked about currency considerations and potential hedges for Berkshire, Buffett said he was concerned about the tendency of governments to make decisions that lead to weaker currencies.

""Fiscal policy is what scares me in the United States, because it's made the way it is and all the motivations are to doing a lot of things that can cause trouble with money. But that's not limited to the United States, it's all over the world,"" Buffett said.

""The value of currency is a scary thing, and we don't have any great system for beating that,"" he added.

The comments echoed what the annual report said on the topic.

""Paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country's short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency,"" Buffett wrote in that report.

— Jesse Pound

Jain, Berkshire's chairman of insurance operations, lauded Geico CEO Todd Combs' efforts to improve the insurance giant's operations — which include steep job cuts.

Jain said that Combs has cut Geico's workforce to about 20,000 from around 50,000 when he took over. He also credited Combs with Geico's incorporation of telematics, which for years was an area Geico lagged in.

In the past five or six years, ""we have made rapid strides, and telematics, which used to be a source of competitive disadvantage to us, is no longer so,"" said Jain. ""I would argue that, at Geico, our telematics are as good as anyone else's today. That's been one huge catch-up.""

Jain added that the labor force reductions amount to roughly $2 billion a year in saved costs.

— Fred Imbert

Buffett offered some of his wisdom for life beyond the investing world that he's become known for over the decades.

When answering a question about the plan for successor Greg Abel, Buffett gave advice about choosing a job and launching a career.

""You really want to work at something you enjoy,"" Buffett said during Saturday's gathering.

Buffett cautioned that employees can take on the habits of their colleagues, so it's important to be discerning about where one works. He recommended that while people should be ""careful"" about who they are employed by, it's less important to fret about factors like starting salaries.

""If you find people who are wonderful to work with, that's the place to go,"" he said.

— Alex Harring

Buffett is still all in on the U.S. despite growing concern among investors about the direction of the country's economy and its standing on the world stage.

""I mentioned that we started out as an agricultural society. We started out as a society with high promises, and we didn't deliver on them very well,"" he said. ""We're always in the process of change. We'll always find all kinds of things to criticize in the country, but the luckiest day in my life is the day I was born [because] I was born in the United States.""

""We've gone through great recessions, we've gone through world wars, we've gone through the development of an atomic bomb that we never dreamt of at the time I was born, so I would not get discouraged about the fact that it doesn't look like we've solved every problem that's come along,"" he continued. ""If I were being born today, I would just keep negotiating in the womb until they said you can be in the United States.""

""We're all pretty lucky,"" he stressed. This is despite his criticisms of the current trade policy earlier in the session. 

— Sean Conlon

Buffett revealed that Berkshire almost put $10 billion at work recently, but ultimately didn't pull the trigger.

""We came pretty close to spending $10 billion, not that long ago, for example, but we'd spend $100 billion,"" he said. ""I mean, those decisions are not tough to make when something is offered that makes sense to us and that we understand and offers good value.""

However, Buffett noted that the one problem with the investment business is that things don't come along in an orderly fashion.

— Yun Li

When asked about artificial intelligence's ability to transform the insurance industry, Ajit Jain admitted that the technology could be a ""real game changer"" in the way the business currently assesses, prices, and sells risk; and how it currently pays claims.

But Jain said that Berkshire is taking a more hesitant approach when it comes to any lofty new technological claims.

""I certainly also feel that people end up spending enormous amounts of money trying to chase the next new fashionable thing,"" he said. ""We are not very good in terms of being the fastest or the first mover. Our approach is more to wait and see until the opportunity crystallizes, and we have a better point of view in terms of risk of failure, upside, downside.""

However, Jain added that Berkshire wouldn't hesitate to invest once the right opportunity does arise.

""Right now, the individual insurance operations do dabble in AI and try and figure out what is the best way to exploit it, but we have not yet made a conscious big-time effort in terms of pouring a lot of money into this opportunity,"" he added. ""My guess is we will be in a state of readiness and should that opportunity pop up, we'll be in a state where we'll jump in promptly.

— Lisa Kailai Han

When discussing Berkshire's cash pile, Buffett joked about the theory that he is planning to hold on to that until the leadership transition occurs, which would let his successor Greg Abel make a big move.

""I wouldn't do anything nearly so noble as to withhold investing myself just so that Greg could look good later on,"" Buffett quipped, drawing laughs from Abel and others in attendance.

— Jesse Pound

Buffett said Berkshire will find places to put its record levels of cash to work, likely within the next half decade.

""It's very unlikely to happen tomorrow,"" Buffett said in response to a question about the reasoning for Berkshire's cash hoard. ""It's not unlikely to happen in five years.""

Buffett also said that ""the one problem with the investment business is that things don't come along in an orderly fashion.""

The Oracle of Omaha added that ""probabilities"" of finding a good buy ""get higher as you go along"" and that it's ""kind of like death."" He then cracked a lighthearted joke about longtime business partner and friend Charlie Munger, who died in 2023 at the age of 99.

— Alex Harring

In response to a question about whether Buffett will stop investing in Japan stocks if the Bank of Japan were to raise interest rates in the future, the Oracle of Omaha said he won't be selling shares.

""In the next 50 years ... we won't give a thought to selling those,"" Buffett said, adding that Japan's record has been ""extraordinary"" and pointing out that Apple, American Express and Coca-Cola, for example, have been doing well in the country.

He also said he's been treated ""extremely well"" by the five Japanese companies he has invested in – namely, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Itochu and Marubeni – and said that building a relationship with the companies is ""super long term.""

""They have different customs. They have different approaches to business – that's true around the world – and we don't have any intention in any way of trying to change what they do because they do it very successfully,"" Buffett said.

""We will not be selling any stock. That will not happen in decades, if then,"" he continued. ""The Japan investment has just been right up our alley.""

— Sean Conlon

Buffett criticized the idea of tariffs and trade protectionism, saying that ""trade should not be a weapon.""

""In the United States, we should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best, and they should do what they do best,"" Buffett said.

President Donald Trump was not directly referenced during this discussion.

— Jesse Pound

Buffett initially took a lighthearted tone as he thanked Apple CEO Tim Cook.

He said that following Apple's latest earnings release, he tuned into Cook's call on Thursday afternoon, the ""only investment quarterly call"" that he listened to.

""I'm somewhat embarrassed to say that Tim Cook has made Berkshire a lot more money than I've ever made Berkshire Hathaway,"" Buffett joked. ""Credit should be given to him.""

The investor then took on a more serious tone as he noted that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs ""really made the right decision"" when picking out Cook as his successor.

""I knew Steve Jobs briefly,"" Buffett said. ""Steve died young, as you know, and nobody but Steve could have created Apple, but nobody but Tim could have developed it like it has. So on behalf of all of Berkshire, thank you.""

— Lisa Kailai Han

Berkshire sold thousands of its special anniversary book during Friday's shopping event, according to Buffett.

Buffett said around 4,400 copies of the book focused on the 60th anniversary of Berkshire under his leadership were snapped up by shoppers during the day. The company printed around 8,000, about 3,000 more than initially planned.

It's the only book for sale at Bookworm, the on-location book store, this year.

— Alex Harring

Buffett shared some statistics from Friday's Berkshire convention.

— Jesse Pound

Audience members cheered as Buffett began speaking. He said the meeting, which is his 60th, should be his biggest and best yet.

""In every aspect, we set records,"" Buffett said of this year's event, citing sales from holding companies at the bonanza and runners signed up for Sunday's 5-K.

— Alex Harring

Berkshire Hathaway has sold more stock than it's bought for 10 straight quarters, according to its earnings report released Saturday morning.

The conglomerate dumped more than $134 billion worth of stock in 2024, mainly due to reductions in Berkshire's two largest equity holdings — Apple and Bank of America. As a result of the selling spree, Berkshire's enormous pile of cash grew to yet another record, at $347 billion.

— Yun Li

Investor David Samra said that tariffs are the ""topic of the moment"" ahead of the start of Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting.

""I think that it will be interesting to hear, of course, Warren's thoughts around tariffs — that is the topic of the moment,"" Samra, a portfolio manager at Artisan Partners, told CNBC's Becky Quick and Mike Santoli.

He added that he was also excited to hear from Ajit Jain, Berkshire's vice chairman of insurance operations.

""It's fantastic to have Ajit [Jain] up on the stage to be able to address those issues. There are some wildfire issues that have been impacting the energy business,"" he added. ""So it will be interesting to see if they have any commentary around that.""

— Lisa Kailai Han

Berkshire Hathaway posted some disappointing results before its annual meeting was set to begin:

—John Melloy, Fred Imbert

Berkshire said President Donald Trump's tariffs and other geopolitical risks created an uncertain environment for the conglomerate, with its vast array of insurance, transportation, energy, retail and other businesses. The firm said it's not able to predict any potential impact from tariffs at this time.

""Our periodic operating results may be affected in future periods by impacts of ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical events, as well as changes in industry or company-specific factors or events,"" Berkshire said in the earnings report. ""The pace of changes in these events, including international trade policies and tariffs, has accelerated in 2025. Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events.""

""We are currently unable to reliably predict the potential impact on our businesses, whether through changes in product costs, supply chain costs and efficiency, and customer demand for our products and services,"" it said.

— Yun Li

This year's shopping event in Omaha is more interactive than ever.

Featuring a gigantic claw machine, a signed book auction and private jet tours, shareholders are able to see displays and buy merchandise from the different holding companies under Berkshire. Some of the longest lines were for specialty Squishmallow toys that resemble Buffett and Charlie Munger.

Click here to go inside the ""Berkshire Bazaar of Bargains"" held Friday and Saturday with CNBC reporters on the ground.

Berkshire Hathaway is kicking off its annual meeting on a high note with shares hitting a record high Friday.

Class A shares climbed 1.8% Friday to a new all-time high of $809,350. The stock has rallied more than nearly 19% this year, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.

Some investors seeking relatively safe places to hide find Berkshire appealing because of the defensive nature of its huge insurance empire and the conglomerate's unmatched balance sheet — boasting more than $347 billion in cash at the end of March.

— Yun Li

Ahead of Buffett's address, shareholders are wondering what he'll have to say about President Donald Trump's tariff plans.

Trump's levies have been top of mind for investors as the market has whipsawed over the past month. Buffett in March called tariffs ""an act of war, to some degree.""

""Over time, they are a tax on goods. I mean, the tooth fairy doesn't pay 'em!"" Buffett said in an interview with CBS News. ""And then what? You always have to ask that question in economics. You always say, 'And then what?'""

All things considered, tariffs should be a ""net negative,"" according to Adam Meade, author of ""The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway."" That's because they can hamper businesses within the conglomerate, the Mead Capital Management CEO said during a Friday panel held by Gabelli Funds.

Meade said Berkshire's furniture retailers, for example, should see costs rise due to the taxes. Geico's car insurance business can also take a hit, he said, because auto parts coming into the country will cost more on plans that haven't yet seen annual price adjustments.

Elsewhere, he said BNSF Railway can see container volumes decline if consumers pull back on purchases once the duties fully take effect.

But there's another side to this: Tariff-induced chaos can create a backdrop that's beneficial for Buffett to make a new investment at a discount, according to Christopher Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. Buffett has a record amount of cash on the sidelines, coming in at more than $330 billion at the end of last year.

""Tariffs, trade wars, recessions, depressions, financial panics, pandemics, these are net good for Berkshire,"" Bloomstran said during the Gabelli event. ""You want a little bit of excitement.""

— Alex Harring

Shareholders began lining up in the early morning hours for a shot at the best seats in Omaha's CHI Health Center.

Attendees near the front told CNBC they gathered as early as 1 a.m. local time.

As has become an unofficial tradition, participants could be seen sprinting to the frontmost seats on the arena floor around 7 a.m. CT. Buffett is set to take the stage around 8 a.m. CT.

— Alex Harring

While many attendees can be seen sporting business or casual attire, some die-hard fans for Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett wear their heart on their sleeve — literally.

Nora Ridenour landed on a shirt featuring the Oracle of Omaha's face in a variety of colors that was inspired by artist Andy Warhol. Ridenour, who came with her husband from Iowa, bought this shirt during her first trip to the meeting in 2019.

""I have a super useful art degree, so this one spoke to me,"" Ridenour said.

Her husband Jay, who wore a shirt from last year's 5-K run with an illustration of Buffett, said he enjoys coming because of the positive energy among attendees. The family has owned the stock for more than a decade.

""Everybody here is excited,"" he said. ""This is one of the only events that I go to where everybody is just genuinely happy to be here.""

Polliana Elena Varnier matched other business students in town. The Brazil native's cohort had black hoodies with a black-and-white picture of Buffett sticking his tongue out.

""We love the way he thinks and the way he lives,"" she said. ""He's not just an investor, he's almost a philosophy.""

At a networking event near CHI Health Center, Tina Yin was seen in a shirt screenprinted with a picture of her and Buffett. While she met Buffett in 2017, the Hong Kong-based investor said some people inquired about the photo's authenticity.

""They think it's not a real photo, maybe it's Photoshop,"" Yin said, referring to the Adobe application for picture editing.

— Alex Harring

Warren Buffett has been mum about tariffs and the recent market turmoil, but will finally get a chance to speak his mind when the 94-year-old investment legend kicks off Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting.

This year's annual meeting comes as markets have turned uncertain after President Donald Trump's aggressive rollout of the highest tariffs on imports in generations. (Many were suspended for 90 days afterward.) Wall Street economists left and right are sounding the alarms that a recession may be in the offing, as recent data pointed to signs of economic weakening.

The world is eager to hear if Buffett, the most famous advocate of value investing, used the April market meltdown to hunt for bargains and lay the groundwork for deals. Although Buffett doesn't make predictions of short-term market direction, investors will listen closely for any signals of his continued confidence in the U.S. economy — despite the tariff shock.

— Yun Li

CNBC will be livestreaming Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting on Saturday, beginning at 8:30 a.m. ET. Watch as Warren Buffett answers shareholder questions.

In this article

(Follow along with our full coverage of Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting here. Warren Buffett begins talking at 9 a.m. ET.)

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter results on Saturday that showed a steep drop in operating earnings from the year-earlier period. The conglomerate, which owns a vast array of insurance, transportation, energy, retail and other businesses also warned that tariffs may further hit profits.

Operating earnings, which include the conglomerate's fully owned insurance and railroad businesses, fell 14% to $9.64 billion during the first three months of the year. In the first quarter of 2024, they totaled $11.22 billion.

On per share basis, operating earnings were $4.47 last quarter, down from $5.20 per class B share in the same period one year ago. That compares to an estimate of $4.89 per class B share from UBS and an overall consensus estimate from 4 analysts of $4.72 a share per FactSet.

Much of that decline was driven by a 48.6% plunge in insurance-underwriting profit. That came in at $1.34 billion for the first quarter, down from $2.60 billion a year prior. Berkshire said the Southern California wildfires led to a $1.1 billion loss in Q1.

Berkshire's bottom line also took a hit from the dollar losing value in the first quarter. The company said it suffered an approximate $713 million loss related to foreign exchange. This time last year, it benefited from a $597 million forex gain.

The dollar index fell nearly 4% in the first quarter. Against the Japanese yen, it lost 4.6%.

Berkshire said President Donald Trump's tariffs and other geopolitical risks created an uncertain environment for the conglomerate, owner of BNSF railway, Brooks Running and Geico insurance. The firm said it's not able to predict any potential impact from tariffs at this time.

""Our periodic operating results may be affected in future periods by impacts of ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical events, as well as changes in industry or company-specific factors or events,"" Berkshire said in the earnings report. ""The pace of changes in these events, including international trade policies and tariffs, has accelerated in 2025. Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events.""

""We are currently unable to reliably predict the potential impact on our businesses, whether through changes in product costs, supply chain costs and efficiency, and customer demand for our products and services,"" it said.

Berkshire's cash hoard ballooned to a fresh record during the first quarter, climbing to more than $347 billion from around $334 billion at the end of 2024, showing that Buffett did not use the first-quarter drop in the stock market to deploy the money. In fact, Berkshire was a net seller of stocks for a 10th quarter in a row. 

The company's overall earnings also plunged nearly 64% year over year, as Buffett's portfolio of publicly traded names took a hit to start the year. That said, Berkshire always advises investors to look past these quarterly changes.

""The amount of investment gains (losses) in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,"" Berkshire's release said.

The report comes as Berkshire enjoys a stellar year-to-date performance, while the broader market languishes. In 2025, Class A shares of Berkshire are up nearly 19%, while the S&P 500 is down 3.3% as uncertainty from tariffs pressures tech and other sectors.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Trump posts AI-generated photo of himself dressed as the pope","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/03/trump-pope-ai-image.html","Sat, 03 May 2025 13:24:58 GMT","



The White House posted an AI-generated photo of President Donald Trump depicted as the pope on Friday, days after he joked that he'd ""like to be pope.""

The image — which first appeared on Trump's Truth Social account — comes as cardinals are set to begin conclave on May 7 to elect the next pope.

Trump attended Pope Francis' funeral in Rome last weekend, during which he also met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

On Tuesday, days after returning from Francis' funeral, Trump joked to reporters outside the White House that he'd ""like to be pope,"" adding, ""that would be my number one choice.""

He followed up by saying that he has ""no preference"" over who is ultimately selected.

Vice President JD Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met with the Roman Catholic pontiff one day before his death.

Francis died of a stroke that ultimately led to irreversible heart failure, according to a death certificate issued by the Vatican.

The post of the AI-generated image sparked widespread social media response, with some users defending it as a joke and others strongly denouncing the image.

The New York State Catholic Conference, which represents the state's bishops, starkly condemned the post, saying, ""there is nothing clever or funny about this image.""

""We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter,"" the conference said in a post on X.

""Do not mock us,"" the post continued.

Former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, an outspoken Trump critic, criticized the post and said it ""affirms how unserious and incapable [Trump] is.""

It's not the first time that the White House shared a controversial AI-generated image of Trump.

In February, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich posted an AI-generated image of Trump depicted as a king, after the administration moved to eliminate New York City's congestion pricing program.

Trump referred to himself as the king in a Truth Social post touting that ""congestion pricing is dead.""

""Manhattan and all of New York, is saved. Long live the king,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social in February.

OMAHA, Nebraska — Warren Buffett on Saturday criticized President Donald Trump's hardline trade policy, without naming him directly, saying it's a big mistake to slap punitive tariffs on the rest of the world.

""Trade should not be a weapon,"" Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, an annual gathering in front of thousands in Omaha, Nebraska. ""I do think that the more prosperous the rest of the world becomes, it won't be at our expense, the more prosperous we'll become, and the safer we'll feel, and your children will feel someday.""

Trade and tariffs ""can be an act of war,"" added the legendary investor. ""And I think it's led to bad things. Just the attitudes it's brought out. In the United States, I mean, we should be looking to trade with the rest of the world and we should do what we do best and they should do what they do best.""

Buffett's comments, his most direct yet on tariffs, came after the White House's rollout of the highest levies on imports in generations shocked the world last month, triggering extreme volatility on Wall Street. The president later went on to announce a sudden 90-day pause on much of the increase, except for China, as the White House sought to make deals with countries. The pause has stabilized the market somewhat.

Still, Trump has slapped tariffs of 145% on imported Chinese goods this year, prompting China to impose retaliatory levies of 125%. China said last week it is evaluating the possibility of starting trade negotiations with the U.S.

Buffett explained that protectionist policies could have negative consequences over the long term for the U.S., after it's become the leading industrial nation in the world.

""It's a big mistake, in my view, when you have seven and a half billion people that don't like you very well, and you got 300 million that are crowing in some way about how well they've done - I don't think it's right, and I don't think it's wise,"" Buffett said. ""The United States won. I mean, we have become an incredibly important country, starting from nothing 250 years ago. There's not been anything like it.""

Investors had been waiting to hear from the 94-year-old ""Oracle of Omaha"" for his guidance to navigate the uncertain macroenvironment as well as his assessment on the state of the economy. The trillion-dollar Berkshire's vast array of insurance, transportation, energy, retail and other businesses, from Geico to Burlington Northern to Dairy Queen, leave Buffett uniquely qualified to comment on the current health of the American economy. The first-quarter GDP was just reported to have contracted for the first time since 2022.

Berkshire said in its first-quarter earnings report that tariffs and other geopolitical events created ""considerable uncertainty"" for the conglomerate. The firm said it's not able to predict any potential impact from tariffs at this time.

Buffett has been in a defensive mode, selling stocks for 10 straight quarters. Berkshire dumped more than $134 billion worth of stock in 2024, mainly due to reductions in Berkshire's two largest equity holdings — Apple and Bank of America. As a result of the selling spree, Berkshire's enormous pile of cash grew to yet another record, at $347 billion at the end of March.

A federal judge on Friday struck down President Donald Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie in a blistering opinion calling the president's efforts ""an unprecedented attack"" on the U.S. judicial system.

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell issued a permanent injunction barring the enforcement of any part of Trump's order from March, which focused on the firm's representation of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and its work with billionaire donor George Soros.

""No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: 'The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers,'"" Howell wrote.

""The importance of independent lawyers to ensuring the American judicial system's fair and impartial administration of justice has been recognized in this country since its founding era,"" Howell wrote, referencing John Adams' decision to represent eight British soldiers charged with murder in connection with the Boston Massacre.

She said Trump's order ""violates the Constitution and is thus null and void.""

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday night.

Trump's executive order limited Perkins Coie employees' access to government buildings, revoked security clearances at the firm, and ordered the heads of all federal agencies to terminate contracts with the firm and refrain from hiring employees who worked there.

Howell had grilled Justice Department lawyer Richard Lawson at a hearing over the measure last week, and Lawson was unable to answer basic questions about the other firms that had reached deals with the White House to avoid their own executive orders.

Howell also used a footnote in Friday's order to criticize firms that took deals with the White House, writing that ""some clients may harbor reservations about the implications of such deals for the vigorous and zealous representation to which they are entitled from ethically responsible counsel, since at least the publicized deal terms appear only to forestall, rather than eliminate, the threat of being targeted in an Executive Order.""

Trump's ""multi-year history of lodging public attacks"" on Perkins Coie and ""his promises during the 2024 campaign to act on his displeasure"" toward the firm if he won further demonstrates that the executive order ""was issued to seek retribution against plaintiff for the Firm's representation of clients in political campaigns or litigation, about which President Trump expressed disapproval, dating back to 2017,"" Howell wrote.

""This purpose amounts to no more than unconstitutional retaliation for plaintiff's First Amendment protected activity,"" Howell wrote.

Being a parent has become an increasingly harder job, especially as anxiety levels keep rising, even among the youngest kids.

As child and family therapists, over the years, we've worked with thousands of parents and children struggling with anxiety and stress. We get emails and calls from parents looking for guidance nearly every day.

When a child experiences worry that won't go away, parents feel overwhelmed and lost. They desperately want to make it better but don't know how. The first step is to understand what those worries are.

Here are the top six things kids worry about the most that many parents don't even realize:

As kids grow up and begin figuring out who they are, they start to care about what their friends think. They want to fit in and feel liked.

When children are different from their peers, whether due to their appearance, interests, cultural background, race or any other aspect of their identity, they may worry or become the target of bullying or teasing.

Adding social media to the mix amplifies kids' worries about social dynamics and negatively impacts their self-worth. Children will compare their lives to highlight reels of friends and complete strangers.

When kids use social media without any supervision, it ramps up their anxiety. They see other people's lives online and might start feeling bad about their own, which makes them worry a lot more.

Moving to a new house or a new school can be both exciting and scary for kids. Even if the change is supposed to be a good thing, they might feel like they're losing something before they can see the benefits.

For example, before they can enjoy having a new sibling, they might feel sad about no longer being the only child. And some changes are just plain tough, with little upside — like a parent moving out or a friend changing schools.

In families where academics and extracurriculars take priority from morning to night, there's little room for relaxation. And when children don't have unstructured time to recharge, they are at risk of developing chronic stress.

DON'T MISS: How to successfully change careers and be happier at work

Be sure to give your kids plenty of free playtime. It's how they learn, process emotions and make sense of what's happening around them.

Things don't need to be the same all the time, but last-minute changes in their daily schedule will make kids nervous. Having a caregiver who is often late or says they will be there and then doesn't show up may cause anxiety in a child, too.

In the same way, when a child receives conflicting signals from each of their grown-ups, or when rules and expectations change from day to day, children experience a sense of discomfort.

Trauma can leave a child feeling devastated, scared or hurt, and it's tough for them to calm down because it triggers their body's stress response. This makes them super alert and unable to relax, constantly worried about their safety.

Even small incidents can shake a child's sense of safety. A dog bite, a car accident or seeing someone get hurt can deeply affect them. Later, they might see something that reminds them of the event and feel scared all over again.

There are many practical coping strategies for your child to manage intense emotions. The key is to teach ahead by introducing these skills during calm moments — well before stressful situations arise.

Teach your kids to manage emotions by naming what they feel. Explain that worry likes to hide in the dark and fester, and that sharing it out loud with you or a trusted friend or sibling will help them feel better.

It even works when they say it in their heads: ""I am so anxious about what my teacher thinks of me.""

Get into the habit of taking three deep breaths with your child before bed.

Have them put a hand on their tummy and feel the breath fill it up ""like a belly balloon."" Trace their hand with each breath: up a finger, breathe in, and down a finger, breathe out, and repeat.

Lend your pearls of wisdom for tough moments. Encourage your child to say it to themselves: ""Things are easier the second time around,"" or ""I can do it,"" during moments of worry or before a big event.

Teach them to recite: ""It only feels this way for now, but I know even the worst feelings will pass,"" or ""Just because I'm imagining something bad, it doesn't mean it's going to happen.""

If your kid has free-floating anxiety or feels overpowered by emotions that pop up only to derail them, try scheduling a 15-minute window later in the day for them to worry.

You can say, ""I know you're feeling worried. I have an idea that might help. When you get home, I'll set a timer and you can think all about it, scream into your pillow, or talk it out with me until the timer goes off.""

Arizona will not be investing in bitcoin (BTC), at least not this year. 

Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill on Friday that would have allowed the state to hold the digital asset as part of its official reserves.

The legislation, known as Senate Bill 1025, proposed using seized funds to invest in BTC and create a digital assets reserve managed by the state. After passing the state House in a narrow 31–25 vote, the bill reached Hobbs' desk, where it was swiftly struck down.

“The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments. Arizonans' retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currencу,” Hobbs wrote in a statement.

The veto ends a push that could have made Arizona the first state to set up a cryptocurrency reserve, and it could have even outpaced the U.S. Treasury Department in doing so.

 Arizona's plan to invest in Bitcoin has ended in a veto, with Governor Katie Hobbs citing concerns over using public funds for ""untested assets."" 

Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has vetoed a bill that would have allowed the state to hold Bitcoin as part of its official reserves, effectively ending efforts to make Arizona the first US state to adopt such a policy.

The Digital Assets Strategic Reserve bill, which would have permitted Arizona to invest seized funds into Bitcoin (BTC) and create a reserve managed by state officials, was formally struck down on Friday, according to an update on the Arizona State Legislature's website.

“Today, I vetoed Senate Bill 1025. The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments,” Hobbs wrote in a statement aimed at Warren Petersen, the President of the Arizona Senate.

“Arizonans' retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currency,” she added.

On April 28, the bill passed a final vote in the state House when 31 members of the Arizona House voted in favor of the bill, with 25 opposing. 

Hobbs had previously stated she would veto any legislation not tied to a bipartisan agreement on disability funding.

A companion bill, SB1373, which would authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of Arizona's rainy-day fund into digital assets like Bitcoin, has not yet reached a final vote.

Arizona joins several other states where similar efforts have failed. In recent months, similar proposals in Oklahoma, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming have stalled or been withdrawn.

In contrast, North Carolina's House passed the Digital Assets Investment Act on April 30, allowing the state treasurer to invest up to 5% of certain funds in approved cryptocurrencies. The bill has now been moved to the state Senate for consideration.

The state-level efforts to create Bitcoin reserves come amid a push from US President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers to do the same in the federal government. 

Trump signed an executive order in March with a proposal for a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.”

 Institutional investors are driving a new era in Bitcoin mining, capitalizing on favorable US regulations and infrastructure diversification into AI. 

Opinion by: Fakhul Miah, managing director of GoMining Institutional

The Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry has never been more attractive to institutional investors. Fintech giants are investing in Bitcoin mining rather than just accumulating the asset, all thanks to the favorable regulatory environment in the US and the profitability margin of BTC. 

Then, numerous companies are diversifying by allocating computing power to AI, further strengthening their economics and, thus, investment attractiveness. For now, it looks like the future of the foundational layer for the Bitcoin network could mark the new gusher age.

Bitcoin mining is still profitable. CoinShares, a digital asset investment firm, shared that the average cost to mine 1 BTC for US-listed miners reached $55,950 in Q3 2024. Two other popular models — one from MacroMicro and another dubbed the Glassnode Difficulty Regression Model — give different estimates. 

On the very same day of Feb. 20, MacroMicro.me data shows that the average cost to produce 1 BTC hovers above $92,000; Glassnode's Difficulty Regression Model estimates the cost to mine a single BTC at approximately $34,400, all while the cryptocurrency's price hit $98,300 on that day.

On a global scale, mining costs differ based on the region. For example, the electricity cost to produce 1 BTC in Ireland is roughly $321,000, but it costs just over $1,300 to mine 1 BTC in Iran. Electricity is only part of the equation — hardware, labor and maintenance costs also play a crucial role.

Recent data from CoinShares and MacroMicro.me paints a challenging yet nuanced picture for Bitcoin miners in the United States. While some institutional miners remain profitable, the broader landscape reveals increasing operational pressures that could reshape the mining industry.

What happens if the challenges aren't addressed? Mining institutions with high profitability rates could start to expand their operations and possibly acquire struggling miners at bargain prices, potentially putting retail and smaller miners at risk.

In addition to receiving the block rewards, miners also benefit from the Bitcoin network's transaction fees, which depend on network usage. Data shows that the daily Bitcoin transaction fees have been hovering between $360,000 and $1.3 million over the past month — reaching an average of $595,000 daily. 

This additional revenue stream bolsters Bitcoin mining's economic appeal and strengthens the resilience of the mining business model by diversifying income sources.

It's not only mining that mining hardware is used for. High computational power, captive power supplies and ready-made infrastructure make miners uniquely equipped to support AI and high-performance computing. In simple terms, mining firms can now rent out their hardware to process AI tasks instead of only focusing on mining Bitcoin.

The combination of transaction fee revenue growth and AI computing diversification creates a more resilient and profitable industry model (the existing one has never been quite appealing to institutional investments in the US). 

The appealing revenues in the Bitcoin mining industries brought huge attention from institutional investors. This process is easy to spot: Bitcoin mining pools in the US accounted for over 40% of the global Bitcoin network's hashrate in 2024. 

According to research by EY-Parthenon and Coinbase, 83% of the 352 global institutions plan to increase their crypto allocations this year, while 51% of the asset managers are considering investments in digital asset companies, including mining companies. That's why I'm not surprised to witness huge investments in Riot Platforms, CoreWeave and other mining industry players. 

The favorable market sentiment has paved the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) and specialized funds targeting mining companies. In addition to securing the $650-million investment, CoreWeave aims to go public with a $4-billion IPO to help the Nvidia-backed company reach a $35-billion valuation.

Bgin Blockchain, a Singapore-based crypto miner manufacturer, recently filed to go public in the US. Renaissance Capital, an investment advisory firm, expects Bgin Blockchain to raise $50 million for its IPO.

This surge in institutional momentum is set to benefit the Bitcoin mining industry by driving up demand and tightening available supply on the market. As more large players accumulate and hold Bitcoin, market scarcity could increase, supporting higher prices and, in turn, boosting miner profitability.

The strong support from institutional investors comes as the optimism around crypto-friendly policies has significantly increased after Donald Trump won the US presidential elections in November 2024.

Establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in early March, seen as a massive policy shift, triggered positivity in the crypto and mining sectors. This sector gained importance. Last year, Bitcoin mining operations significantly contributed to the US economy, generating roughly $4.1 billion in gross domestic product and creating over 31,000 jobs nationwide. The industry is also revitalizing rural areas by generating tax revenue and repurposing remote locations for mining operations. It sounds like the gusher days of the oil industry a century ago, doesn't it?

The latest investments, leadership appointments and IPOs show that Bitcoin mining firms have a significant tailwind. Meanwhile, they are no longer just about BTC — they are becoming data infrastructure providers for the AI sector, turning into hybrid data processing giants.

Taking advantage of this shift, the US could potentially become the leader in the digital asset and Bitcoin mining space due to the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration and fulfill its stated goal of being the “crypto capital of the world.”

As institutions double down on Bitcoin mining and AI convergence, the question isn't if this industry will evolve but who will lead the charge. The modern digital gold rush is underway, and the smartest capital is already claiming it.

The crypto market has successfully regained momentum with the top tokens continuing to retest their upper price levels. With this, the market capitalization of the crypto industry has increased to $3.03 trillion, a change of +0.58% over the last 24 hours.

Reportedly, the Bitcoin price has sustained its value above the $96,000 mark, highlighting an increase in the bullish presence. Moreover, its dominance has now increased to 63.98%, suggesting an ongoing Bitcoin season in the crypto space.

Following in the footsteps, the altcoin market has displayed a positive action with the Ethereum price reclaiming its $1,800 mark. While XRP price struggles around the $2.20 mark, Solana price continues juggling around the $150 level.

Are you planning on entering the ocean of crypto? In this write-up, we will understand the market analysis and technical sentiment of the top 3 cryptocurrencies by valuation (excluding stablecoins) and their weekly price predictions.

As the volatility in the market increases, the price of Bitcoin is back above the $96,000 mark. With an intraday trading volume of $23.16 billion, it has recorded a change of -0.78%. With a circulating supply of 19.85 million, it has a market capitalization of $1.907 trillion.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) records a constant decline in the green histogram. However, its SMA indicator constantly supports the Bitcoin price chart in the daily time frame. This suggests a rising uncertainty for the largest crypto token in the market.

If the bullish sentiment in the market sustains, this could result in the price of Bitcoin smashing its $100,000 mark and heading toward its upper price target of $105,000. Conversely, a strong bearish pullback may slit the price toward its low of $90,000 during the upcoming week.

The Ethereum price today continues hovering above the $1,800 mark with an intraday trading volume of $10.336 billion. Marketers are raising concerns about the future prospects of this project as it has recorded a variation of less than 2% over the past 30 days.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues hovering above the neutral point in the Ethereum price chart. Furthermore, the average trendline acts as a strong support. On the other hand, the EMA 50-day records a major resistance above the ETH price action. This highlights an increase in the buying-and-selling pressure for the largest altcoin in the market.

Suppose, the bulls regain momentum, in that case, the Ethereum price could retest its multi-month high of $2,100 this month. However, if the crypto market experiences unexpected liquidity, this could pull the ETH token toward its low of $1,500.

The XRP price has entered into a consolidated phase over the past week. With this, altcoin has displayed a neutral action in the last 7 days. However, considering the longer time frame, this altcoin has added approximately 10% to its valuation in 30 days. The Ripple token has a market dominance of 4.27% with a valuation of $128.63 billion.

While the EMA 50-days displays a bullish convergence, the 200-day EMA acts as a strong support around the $2,000 mark. Adding to this, the MACD indicator records a neutral trend in the 1D time frame. This indicates a mixed price action for the 2nd largest altcoin by market capitalization.

If the crypto market witnesses an increase in the accumulation of XRP, the coin's price may regain momentum and head toward its important resistance level of $2.50. On the contrary, a negative action could result in it plunging toward its low of $2.00 soon.

About us

Copy link

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wants to strip the protocol down to its essence. And in five years, he says, it could be as “beautifully simple” as Bitcoin.

In a blog post published on Friday, Buterin outlined a sweeping plan to simplify Ethereum's core protocol and shift away from years of growing technical complexity.

He says that the blockchain should prioritise simplicity alongside scalability and security, arguing that overly complicated systems increase maintenance costs, security risks, and create barriers to participation in protocol development. 

The long-term goal, he wrote, is for Ethereum to become “close to as simple as Bitcoin.”

One proposed change would overhaul Ethereum's consensus system using a new model that would reduce code size and simplify validator responsibilities. 

On the execution side, Buterin backed transitioning from the ageing Ethereum Virtual Machine to a cleaner, faster architecture like RISC-V, which would open the door to improved performance and easier smart contract development.

He compared it to Apple's use of Rosetta — a way to handle legacy features without letting them weigh down the core system.

The blog post echoes a similar shift inside Ethereum's inner circles. 

After years of favouring rollups — layer 2 blockchains that execute transactions cheaply off mainnet — the Ethereum Foundation recently signalled it would refocus on the base layer. 

The Foundation's new co-directors have pledged to prioritise performance, affordability, and user experience.

As part of that change, developers on Monday scrapped a planned EVM upgrade known as EOF from the upcoming Fusaka hard fork, citing its limited benefit to users.

Bitcoin has emerged as the market's top hedge option against rising geopolitical uncertainty and cross-border tensions. The institutional adoption of $BTC has increased during the last couple of months.

Sergej Kunz, founder of 1inch (exchange aggregator), said that retailers might not have much time to accumulate the digital asset.

Keep reading to find out more about the upcoming rally in ‘digital gold.' We'll also suggest the best altcoins you can add to your portfolio for massive gains.

Ever since Trump announced the formation of a US Bitcoin reserve, there has been a race among countries to hoard the asset.

During April 21-25, more than $3B were invested in Bitcoin ETFs. As of May 1, these ETFs and institutional funds hold more than $128B worth of $BTC.

Countries like the UK, the US, and China hold more than $130B worth of the asset. Other countries like Ukraine, Bhutan, and El Salvador also own a sizable chunk of $BTC.

Institutions like Strategy own around 538,200 Bitcoins, buying more than 4.5 times the amount of $BTC being mined every day.

Analysts believe that such heavy institutional buying can propel Bitcoin's price to a whopping $1M.

Bitcoin is being increasingly viewed as a safe haven in times of uncertainty, similar to how gold is viewed.

Currently trading around $97K, $BTC is nearing the $100K mark and may soon break its all-time high of around $109K.

With the price still ripe, this is the best time to buy Bitcoin. However, there's no arguing that it's really expensive.

If you're looking to make the most of Bitcoin's bull run but without burning a hole in your pocket, here are three tokens worth buying.

If you want to follow the footprints of large institutions and ride Bitcoin's upcoming rally, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is possibly the best crypto to buy now.

It's unlike any other Bitcoin-themed meme coin on the market, seeing as it's the only one that gives $BTC in its airdrops to its token holder.



Essentially, every time Bitcoin crosses a brand-new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K, $BTCBULL holders who have stored their cryptos in Best Wallet will receive free (and real) $BTC.

Another reason we've predicted $BTCBULL to jump nearly 400% by the end of 2026 is its deflationary mechanism.

If you're a Bitcoin maximalist, this is the best time to buy into the BTC Bull Token presale, which has raised over $5.2M so far. That's because each token is available for a low price of $0.002495. Here's how to buy it.

A Bitcoin bull run is likely going to result in increased market penetration for crypto assets as a whole. That means more and more people will be owning cryptocurrencies.

However, with education in the industry running thin, you'd need a token like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) that can point you towards the best cryptos to invest in.

At its heart, $MIND is an AI agent designed to study social trends and community sentiment to identify cryptos that could be the next to explode. However, we'd like you to think of $MIND as your own crypto investment buddy.



This autonomous AI system, which is launching on May 10, by the way, will interact with crypto influencers online, read their biases and insights into crypto, and finally use its hive-mind intelligence to find out which tokens are in a pole position to skyrocket on account of the attention they've been getting from the market participants.

What's more, MIND of Pepe will also be launching its own tokens as it develops further. Access to these, too, will be reserved for $MIND holders.

If you want to benefit from $MIND's revolutionary powers, become an early investor in the project.

It's currently in presale ($8.6M+ raised), and each token is selling for just $0.0037515. Check out our guide on how to buy MIND of Pepe for more info.

Turbo ($TURBO) has been one of the most successful meme coins in recent times.

Even though $TURBO launched in 2023, it didn't gain much attention until June 2024. After a ferocious rally that lasted till January, the token saw a steep decline.

Now, however, it's one of the top trending cryptos. $TURBO is up over 200% in the last month and a total of 860% in the last year.



Moreover, with a current price of just $0.005199, $TURBO could be a great purchase if you want to ride the Bitcoin-led crypto wave.

It's worth noting that $TURBO is considered the first meme coin to be completely created by AI (GPT-4, to be precise). Similar to the best meme coins, $TURBO, too, runs on community hype and virality.

Despite Bitcoin's potential to send the crypto market in an upward spiral, let's not forget just how volatile the instrument can be.

It also means that your investments in crypto aren't guaranteed to fetch you the desired returns if market conditions aren't favorable.

Cannes, the glitzy capital of film and French Riviera flair, is about to take on a new role: global crypto tourism hub.

The city announced plans to roll out crypto payment infrastructure across 90% of local merchants, thanks to a partnership with Web3 payment firm Lunu Pay.

What makes this different from previous ‘crypto city' experiments – like El Salvador's Bitcoin Beach or Miami's Bitcoin-branded city campaigns – is the level of coordination. Cannes isn't just slapping QR codes in cafes.

The municipality is actively training shop owners and laying down Web3 infrastructure. That's a big deal, because it makes crypto payments truly accessible to regular people – not just hardcore HODLers.

And when crypto becomes this real, certain projects stand to benefit more than others. Let's look at some of the best altcoins riding this wave of mainstream adoption.

As crypto payments go mainstream in cities like Cannes, one thing becomes clear: the wallet you use – and the token behind it – matters more than ever. That's where Best Wallet Token ($BEST) steps in.

Priced at $0.02495 and with nearly $12M already raised in its presale, $BEST isn't just another utility token. It's the backbone of a radically modern, user-first crypto experience.

But it's the $BEST token that unlocks the real perks.

Buying and holding $BEST gives users serious advantages. We're talking reduced transaction fees, early access to hot new crypto projects, and even bonus rewards through Best Wallet's iGaming partnerships.

That's a far cry from tokens that just sit in your wallet looking pretty.



$BEST holders also gain access to ‘Upcoming Tokens,' a built-in launchpad tool. It allows users to discover, vet, and invest in new tokens directly in-app – without hopping through shady mirror sites.

In short, $BEST isn't just a token. It's your all-access pass to the future of crypto payments, investments, and perks – all in your pocket.

The way we pay for content is about to change forever – and SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is leading the charge.

Built for the next generation of fans and digital platforms, $SUBBD is reimagining the $85B content subscription industry by blending AI, crypto, and premium fan experiences into one seamless ecosystem.

Currently priced at $0.0553, with over $300K raised in presale, $SUBBD powers an AI-driven content platform where users can subscribe, tip, and interact with creators using fast, low-fee crypto payments.



The platform offers tools like AI-generated photos and videos (approved by the original creators), a chatbot assistant for creators, and customizable staking perks.

Holding and staking $SUBBD unlocks exclusive content, early access to drops, and platform bonuses, all while earning up to 20% APY during presale.

Analysts predict the token could reach $0.301 by 2025, and possibly soar to $2.50 by 2030, making it one of the most promising projects in the content and AI space.

With $SUBBD, fans get more value, creators earn more directly, and the token at the center gets real-world utility.

In a world of flashy new tokens and headline-chasing meme coins, Litecoin ($LTC) continues to quietly do what it does best – enable fast, cheap, and reliable payments.

Launched in 2011, it's one of the oldest cryptocurrencies still thriving, and for good reason.

At a current price of $86.74, $LTC is more than just a legacy coin – it's a practical, well-oiled machine built for real-world use.

It processes transactions four times faster than Bitcoin and with much lower fees, making it ideal for everyday purchases, especially in retail-heavy environments like Cannes.

Already accepted in crypto-forward cities like Miami and Lugano, Litecoin's consistent performance and broad integration across wallets and payment platforms give it a major head start.

As crypto adoption spreads through tourism and local commerce, $LTC may just be the quiet workhorse powering your next seaside espresso.

Toncoin ($TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON), a high-speed, scalable layer-1 blockchain originally developed by Telegram.

After regulatory setbacks paused Telegram's direct involvement, the project was revived by an independent community and is now gaining serious momentum.

What sets $TON apart is its deep integration with Telegram's massive user base of over 900M people.

Through this partnership, users can send $TON directly in chats, use built-in wallets, and access decentralized services without ever leaving the app. It's frictionless, fast, and tailor-made for mass adoption.



As cities like Cannes build crypto into everyday life, Toncoin's seamless messaging-app integration could be a game changer.

Tourists and locals alike could one day send crypto payments with the same ease as sending a text – something $TON is already making possible.

As Cannes paves the way for real-world crypto adoption, a new era of usability is taking shape.

Whether it's paying for coffee with $LTC, unlocking premium features with $SUBBD, securing your assets and the best crypto presales through $BEST, or sending instant payments through Telegram with $TON, these projects are built for the kind of everyday crypto usage that's finally becoming a reality.

As more cities follow Cannes' lead, projects like these are poised to lead the charge.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Regulated exchanges hold the key to unlocking the altcoin season","https://cryptoslate.com/regulated-exchanges-hold-the-key-to-unlocking-the-altcoin-season/","Sat, 03 May 2025 14:13:00 GMT","

As Bitcoin dips, altcoins rise with regulated exchanges fueling secure market expansion.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

The following is a guest post and opinion from Przemysław Kral, CEO of zondacrypto.

Since the enforcement of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, the European crypto landscape has been fundamentally reshaped—and for the better. Crypto has now entered an era in which exchanges are required to prioritize regulatory compliance, centering user safety in hopes of moving toward mainstream adoption. The industry's desire to transition to a more regulated ecosystem is made even more apparent by the decisive action of several crypto exchanges delisting non-compliant stablecoins.

It is the altcoin market that is now poised for substantial growth as regulations continue to solidify this year. In addition to ensuring compliance, regulated exchanges are also essential to the long-term altcoin market. The necessary path of compliance and the maturation of the altcoin market across the EU will depend on these exchanges' capacity for innovation and adaptation in the coming critical months.

The delisting of non-compliant stablecoins is just the beginning: MiCA regulations will continue to affect operational requirements, consumer protection measures, and anti-money laundering protocols. MiCA's approach aims to build trust and security, while market hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong implement policies that aim to encourage innovation with lighter-touch restrictions. The costs associated with compliance, coupled with the potential for reduced trading volumes from delistings, will unavoidably cause deflationary pressures on the industry.

What can be considered disruptive in the short term, however, is a vital step in the direction of long-term sustainability. At this juncture, exchanges must decide whether to adapt or become obsolete. The question still hangs in the air: Can the industry continue to navigate this transition while maintaining its growth trajectory?

Taking advantage of altcoins as the next big growth opportunity can offset deflationary effects. Altcoins are expected to see significant growth, even with Ethereum's performance more or less plateauing and Bitcoin significantly retreating from its all-time high earlier in the year, despite Trump's initial policy suggestions.

The development of the altcoin market is correlated with the industry's future: Altcoins are leading the charge in creating strong ecosystems that provide practical utility and real-world solutions. This is in stark contrast to memecoins, which are mostly driven by speculation and social media fervor. You don't need to look further than the Libra scandal from earlier this year to see why interest in memecoins has been cooling.

Analysis suggests that altcoins will surpass Bitcoin's supremacy in the next market cycle, no longer defined by asset rotation. Despite Bitcoin's dips below $80K, altcoins experienced comparatively smaller declines and haven't seen new lows this year, indicating less sell pressure and the possibility of a rally with increased buying interest. Broader institutional investment further supports their growth, as entities look for diversified exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Needless to say, this expansion potential depends more than ever on a safe trading system. Regulated exchanges now serve as the gatekeepers of a sustainable future, far beyond their previous function as simple transaction facilitators.

Stable and legal trading conditions are necessary to take advantage of altcoins' growth potential. Regulated exchanges ensure that projects can flourish in a transparent market by offering the infrastructure required to enable the growth and widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Adherence to regulations such as MiCA is no longer a lofty goal but an industry standard, setting the foundation for the development of altcoins in a sustainable way. By prioritizing consumer protection and market integrity, regulated exchanges establish a safe environment for investors and projects alike. The long-term health of the crypto market and the attraction of institutional capital depend on this regulatory certainty. This new frontier isn't solely about token gains: it's the architecture of an entirely new market.

The EU is quickly positioning itself as a global crypto hub, outpacing North America and Asia in crypto banking alone. Frameworks such as MiCA play a key role in fostering an environment where the memecoin disasters of recent memory are never repeated, ensuring the impact of crypto is not just long-lasting but net positive.

Within this, regulated exchanges create the conditions for crypto innovation to flourish by emphasizing legal clarity and encouraging a culture of compliance. The development of altcoin initiatives with true utility and long-term potential is made possible with their infrastructure, which guarantees that the sector's growth is supported with both confidence and stability. It's the dawn of a new era, with compliant exchanges standing at the forefront.

The crypto market is always exciting, especially when people start talking about the next bull run. While Bitcoin($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) get most of the headlines, investors often look for “hidden gems” among the thousands of other cryptocurrencies known as altcoins. Finding these hidden gems, often trading at low prices, before they potentially “boom” in value, can lead to massive returns. 

May 2025 feels like a time when many are searching for the best altcoins to buy now to position themselves for future growth. But how do you find these potentially undervalued projects?We will go through what makes an altcoin promising, and highlights a few interesting options to watch, including the most promising AI-powered newcomer Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), along with three more potential winners in the 2025 crypto market.

Based on these factors, here are some interesting altcoins that might be considered hidden gems or have strong potential worth watching in May 2025.



Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) fits the “hidden gem” profile perfectly, especially for its low price and most importantly because of its successful presale phase. Its initial low price point makes it a classic “penny” crypto opportunity, but what truly sets it apart is its unique combination of Artificial Intelligence utility and viral meme coin appeal. 

https://youtube.com/watch?v=HxKdWsG2c3w%3Fsi%3D6zRVVEu_CcW-zGIV

Why $DAGZ looks like a gem:

Arpa Chain (ARPA) is an altcoin focused on a crucial area: privacy-preserving computation. It uses advanced cryptography called Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to allow different parties to analyze or compute data together without revealing their private, raw data to each other. This technology has huge potential uses in areas like finance, healthcare, and advertising. 



The ARPA token is used within the network for paying computation fees, staking by nodes to secure the network, and potentially governance. As data privacy becomes increasingly important, blockchain solutions like Arpa Chain offering secure computation could see growing demand, making ARPA a potential hidden gem focused on utility.

Flare (FLR) is a Layer 1 blockchain aiming to solve the problem of getting reliable, real-world data onto blockchains and enabling different chains to interact securely. It acts as a “blockchain for data,” using two core technologies: the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) to provide decentralized and accurate price feeds (essential for DeFi), and the State Connector to securely fetch information from other blockchains or even traditional web sources.



A key feature is its FA ssets system, which aims to allow non-smart contract assets like Bitcoin, XRP, or Dogecoin to be used on Flare in DeFi applications. Because Flare is compatible with Ethereum tools, developers can easily build on it.By focusing on the critical infrastructure needed for trustworthy data and interoperability, Flare offers unique technology that could become increasingly valuable.

Sui (SUI) is a newer Layer 1 blockchain designed with a focus on high speed, low costs, and massive scalability right from the start. It uses the Move programming language (known for safety) and a unique way of handling data based on “objects.” This allows Sui to process many transactions simultaneously, potentially leading to much higher speeds and lower fees than older blockchains.



Sui targets high-performance applications like advanced DeFi protocols,complex blockchain games, and large-scale commerce applications.The SUI token is used for gas fees, staking to secure the network, and governance. As a project pushing the boundaries of blockchain performance, Sui represents a technology-focused hidden gem potential if it successfully attracts developers and users away from competing networks.

The hunt for the best altcoins to buy now, especially those “hidden gems” with the potential to explode in the next“penny boom” or bull run, is what makes crypto investing so exciting. It's about finding value and innovation before the wider market does. Projects like Arpa Chain, Flare, and Sui offer unique technological solutions in privacy, data connectivity, and scalability.

However, projects that cleverly combine multiple strong elements often stand out the most. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) fits this description perfectly, blending the powerful AI narrative with meme coin virality, real utility plans, staking rewards, and a low entry point post-presale. It represents a uniquely promising venture for investors seeking high-growth potential in May 2025. Whether exploring secure computation networks, data oracles, faster blockchains, or AI-powered meme coins, remember that uncovering these gems requires deep research, patience, and a healthy respect for the risks involved.

Look for projects with low market caps but strong fundamentals: innovative tech, a clear use case, an active development team, and a growing community. Research new coins listed on smaller exchanges or featured on crypto launchpads, but always verify their legitimacy. Projects like Dawgz AI, combining trends like AI with community focus, often appear on “gem hunter” radars.

The biggest risks are high volatility (wild price swings), low liquidity (making it hard to sell), potential for scams or project abandonment (“rug pulls”), and the simple fact that most new projects fail to gain adoption.

To be seen as promising , the coin has to mix several positive factors: a low entry price post-presale, a strong narrative, planned utility, viral meme coin potential, staking rewards, and a successful pre-sale , if the project is in pre-sale. This unique combination gives a high growth potential compared to many other altcoins.

A “penny boom” refers to a period where cryptocurrencies trading at very low prices (often under $1, like pennies) experience massive percentage gains, often driven by speculation during a wider market rally or bull run. Finding promising projects like Dawgz AI before such a potential boom is the goal for many investors seeking exponential returns.

Ripple and Chainlink, two of the most popular blockchain giants, are competing for lobbying in the power corridors of the US administration for both access and integration of their services. 

The race for complete hegemony at bureaucratic levels between Brad Garlinghouse's Ripple and Sergey Nazarov's Chainlink has escalated ever since President Donald Trump swept the 2024 U.S. presidential elections, riding on the wave of support from crypto leaders.

Representatives from both companies are now competing for dominance and to have a say in the decision-making regarding a clear regulatory framework for crypto. And for that, both Ripple and Chainlink are pursuing different approaches to influence.

For those who don't know about lobbying, it is an act of influencing government officials and legislators to support or oppose a policy decision. It includes direct communications with lawmakers, public campaigns, and more. It is legal and undertaken by individuals, corporations, non-profits, advocacy groups, and more.

Ripple has fought the SEC in its legal battle since 2020 by using conventional political tools, including direct lobbying, hiring former officials, and making significant campaign donations. On the other hand, Chainlink has opted for a discreet path by integrating into traditional and decentralized finance infrastructure through financial giant partnerships and technical solutions that resolve regulatory issues.

The Trump administration's reported “overtly crypto-friendly” stance demonstrates an essential question about digital power: Does political pressure work better than becoming indispensable to the system for regulatory acceptance?

The answer to this question cannot be given in binaries, especially not in the ever-evolving world of Web3, which is witnessing exponential growth as well as impounding regulatory challenges at the same time.

It is not imperative that Ripple and Chainlink be engaged in a direct race; both have specific use cases and have chosen separate paths to the White House corridors. How soon the crypto industry can expect a clear, concise, and healthy regulatory framework will depend a lot on how Chainlink and Ripple representatives play it out in the following months.

In this article, we wll explain the different lobbying campaigns carried out by Ripple and Chainlink, that can serve as a precursor for major developments in the web3 sector in U.S.

Ripple operates through an aggressive political strategy that invests heavily to influence government decisions regarding XRP cryptocurrency and XRP Ledger. Ripple dedicates approximately $1 million annually to lobbying activities from 2021 to 2023, thus becoming a prominent political force within the industry.

The company maintains a defensive stance because its prolonged legal dispute with the SEC began in 2020. Ripple accelerated its regulatory shift strategy after July 2023, when a court ruled that XRP sales on public exchanges were not securities transactions and focused on gaining CFTC oversight instead of SEC oversight.

Ripple invested $710,000 in lobbying activities in 2023, while the total crypto industry spent $20 million that year. Ripple maintained nine political connections in 2023 by hiring former government officials, such as Republican Congressman Mike Conaway, who used their Washington relationships.

It also functioned as the second-biggest contributor to Fairshake super PAC, which raised $92.9 million to fund pro-crypto congressional candidates during the 2024 elections.

Ripple supports the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act and other bills to reclassify many cryptocurrencies as commodities instead of securities.

Ripple adopts this straightforward strategy to achieve its current business requirements, which include regulatory understanding for international payment solutions and RLUSD stablecoin development. Ripple supports crypto-friendly candidates and challenges SEC jurisdiction to establish room for its technologies in the traditional financial system.

The decentralized oracle network Chainlink has chosen a financial investment strategy that is less expensive but potentially more impactful on blockchain structure. The company directs its efforts towards becoming foundational infrastructure that supports crypto innovation together with traditional finance modernization instead of spending mostly on lobbying activities.

Strategic partnerships with Swift Fidelity International DTCC and Euroclear show Chainlink's ability to unite traditional finance with blockchain technology.

The regulatory needs of transparency, data accuracy, and compliance are addressed through Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), Proof of Reserve (PoR) and Smart Value Recapture oracles, which are technical solutions from Chainlink.

Chainlink demonstrates its importance for government financial innovation through its participation in initiatives like the Central Bank of Brazil's Drex CBDC project.

The co-founder of Chainlink, Sergey Nazarov, actively participates in Washington D.C., according to unverified reports that suggest he influences crypto legislation.

Chainlink aims to become essential to both crypto markets and established financial systems through its implementation in compliant blockchain structures and its development of regulatory solutions, which could potentially lead to enduring control of regulatory standards.

Ripple and Chainlink follow different strategies because they operate at different levels of the blockchain market and face varying regulatory challenges.

The direct lobbying activities of Ripple exist because of immediate business requirements. Ripple must receive urgent regulatory relief because it faces SEC enforcement and needs to validate both XRP and RLUSD while operating as a company. The company invests its financial resources into lobbying and political campaigns to speed up favorable policy changes that support its business model.

Chainlink, meanwhile, faces fewer direct regulatory threats. The network operates as an oracle system instead of issuing cryptocurrency, which allows it to provide infrastructure for compliant blockchain applications. Chainlink establishes its influence through its technical problem-solving capabilities, which resolve blockchain regulatory issues about reliability and transparency.

The 2025 presidential victory of the Trump administration adds a new layer to this political dynamic. Now, the companies could discover fresh possibilities to progress their agendas because of the new government's pro-crypto position and the expected decrease in SEC oversight.

The favorable classification of XRP by regulatory bodies could become possible as Ripple faces less aggressive enforcement actions. The administration's potential adoption of a blockchain financial system could accelerate the implementation of Chainlink oracle solutions in government institutions and regulated organizations.

As the blockchain industry is gaining more mainstream adoption, firms like Ripple and Chainlink boosted their approaches for industry-government relations in emerging technology sectors. Both adopt different strategies, but the goal is the same: growth and innovation. Now, the success of these divergent strategies will likely depend on how U.S. crypto regulation evolves under the new administration.

Europe is faltering. Where Asia is experimenting and the United States is investing heavily, the Old Continent hesitates. Blockchain, despite its immense potential for the healthcare sector, is progressing in Europe like a snail on a highway. This slowness raises an uncomfortable question: is technological disruption really perceived as a priority by European leaders?

European regulation, designed to clarify, ends up discouraging. The MiCA regulation aimed to harmonize the market, but it frightens small players. The burden of administrative requirements kills many initiatives in their infancy. “Startups, in particular, do not want to fight in the legal jungle,” notes Volker Nürnberg, a professor at Munich Technical University.

In Germany, the situation is caricatured. Award-winning projects like electronic prescriptions have never been deployed. And the GDPR, although based on laudable principles, becomes yet another barrier. Blockchain operates on transparency, whereas regulation demands erasure. For Lukas Weidener, this contradiction is heavy:

These regulations may cause Germany to lose its place in the global development of technology.

We hope this strictness will become a competitive advantage. But to date, it mainly acts as a brake.

Within Europe's borders, strategies diverge. Estonia is digitizing its state with blockchain, Germany is experimenting with digital identity, Switzerland is attracting crypto unicorns. But this technological patchwork harms coherence.

Result: systems incapable of communicating with each other. “Fragmentation complicates pan-European projects,” Nürnberg laments again.

Healthcare, on its side, remains a highly regulated field, not prone to boldness. Yet blockchain could transform daily life there: secure data sharing, integrity of clinical trials, drug traceability.

Without a common framework, these promises remain empty words. Worse: each country imposes its own standards, making cross-border projects nearly impossible. A technology meant to connect data is, in Europe, hindered by administrative borders.

Blockchain suffers from a notorious reputation. Too often confused with crypto speculation, it inspires more mistrust than enthusiasm. “Some officials still see blockchain as a digital casino,” an expert remarks ironically.

However, in the healthcare sector, use cases are solid. Immutable patient records, secure teleconsultations, automated reimbursements via smart contracts… The ground is fertile. But gardeners are missing. Fear of the unknown, reinforced by crypto scandals, blocks institutional curiosity. Even the potential environmental benefits of some blockchains fail to convince.

Weidener puts it plainly:

The perceived energy consumption of blockchains deters decision-makers, especially where sustainability is a priority.

The conflation is unfair but real. And as long as innovation is seen as a risk rather than an opportunity, it will not find fertile ground.

It is no coincidence that South Korea and the United States are pulling ahead. There, they finance, test, and adjust. In Europe, they regulate. Many observers agree: the EU presents the image of a bureaucratic continent, quick to regulate but slow to innovate. Talents leave, projects migrate, standards are set elsewhere. And Europe, it comments. If it wants to have weight tomorrow, it will have to dare today. Without this, blockchain in healthcare will be just one more missed appointment.

Enso's intent-based architecture addresses key challenges in blockchain development, aiming to make the technology more accessible.

By removing complex technical barriers, it enables developers to focus on building meaningful applications rather than solving infrastructural issues.

Blockchain technology often operates in what are called ‘silos,' with tokens, liquidity, and state data locked within specific ecosystems. 

Blockchain technology often operates in ‘silos,' with tokens, liquidity, and state data locked within individual ecosystems. 

These isolated environments make it difficult for blockchains to interact with one another, limiting interoperability and increasing the complexity of cross-chain operations. 

Additionally, developers frequently face a lack of essential infrastructure. 

Instead of working on applications, they must first spend significant time building foundational tools and manual integrations. 

This slows the release of functional decentralised applications (dApps), and ultimately, innovation.

Intent-based architecture aims to simplify these challenges. 

It allows users to specify their desired outcomes while the system handles the technical execution behind the scenes. 

For example, instead of coding intricate cross-chain processes, developers can simply state what they want the application to do, and the system takes care of the rest.

However, for intent systems to work effectively across multiple blockchains, they require a unifying layer that connects otherwise isolated ecosystems. 

Without such a foundation, blockchains remain disconnected, forcing developers to perform manual integrations that undercut the simplicity intent-based systems are meant to provide.

Initially launched as a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform, Enso has evolved into an API middle layer designed to support intent-based architecture. 

Developers can define their goals, while network participants contribute the smart contract abstractions needed to fulfil these intent requests.

A key innovation in Enso's approach is its shared network state, which centralises data from rollups and appchains into a unified ledger. This unification reduces complexity, increases accuracy, and enhances interoperability across blockchains.

To date, Enso supports over 60 projects, enabling processes like token swaps, staking, and yield optimisation. 

These are delivered through predefined workflows called shortcuts, catalogued in Enso's Smart Contract Library, which provide clear instructions for interacting with specific protocols.

Enso's network relies on four main participant roles, each incentivised through the native $ENSO token:

Intent-based architecture doesn't just simplify blockchain development; it also opens the door for industries and developers outside the web3 space. 

Organisations that previously lacked the resources or expertise to create blockchain solutions can now use intent-based systems to build tools without needing deep technical knowledge.

This democratisation of blockchain development creates a virtuous cycle: more use cases attract more users, increasing familiarity and demand for blockchain-based solutions. 

As adoption grows, innovation accelerates, driving the technology closer to mainstream integration.","{'href': 'https://www.dlnews.com', 'title': 'dlnews.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Home » Kulr Rolls Out Blockchain for Battery Supply Chain Integrity

Kulr Technology, a US-based power materials startup, has introduced a blockchain-based system designed to verify and trace battery cells throughout their supply chain. The initiative is aimed at enhancing transparency, security, and efficiency, particularly for high-performance batteries intended for advanced applications, including space missions.

One of the primary use cases for this new system involves lithium-ion batteries tested under NASA's WI 37A standard. These batteries are reportedly being prepared for future space-related projects such as the Vestri asteroid mining mission. By leveraging blockchain's distributed ledger capabilities, Kulr seeks to establish a permanent, tamper-resistant record of testing and verification data, which would remain accessible to downstream users of the batteries.

In practical terms, each battery cell will carry metadata that is minted as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the blockchain. This token is built on Coinbase's Base Layer 2 (L2) chain, which itself is based on Ethereum, allowing for secure and decentralized management of asset information. Upon purchase, ownership of the battery cell's NFT can be transferred to the buyer's digital wallet. Alternatively, the NFT can be redirected to a burn wallet managed by Kulr to indicate completion of the transaction and ownership change. For larger customers, the company will create dedicated wallets to facilitate bulk NFT transfers. Kulr has also developed a proprietary internal tool that interfaces with encrypted company-owned wallets to monitor and manage inventory.

This blockchain-based tracking system follows an earlier move by the company to integrate cryptocurrency into its financial operations. Late last year, Kulr had adopted a bitcoin-based treasury strategy. Building on that experience, company leadership began exploring broader applications within the crypto ecosystem. They concluded that extending blockchain capabilities into supply chain logistics aligned naturally with their operations.

According to Michael Mo, the CEO of Kulr, the shift to blockchain-based supply chain management stems from a desire to bring greater integrity and efficiency to customer operations. He noted that immutable and verifiable custody records could deliver significant value, particularly for aerospace and commercial technology sectors that require high assurance levels.

Kulr's approach echoes a growing trend in the global battery market, particularly in Europe, where regulatory pressure—such as the European Union's battery passport initiative—has spurred demand for robust product tracking systems. These requirements mandate detailed tracking of raw materials, production processes, usage, and end-of-life management. Several companies are already responding by developing distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) to meet these standards.

For instance, in France, Eviden is working with Switzerland-based Iota to implement its open-source blockchain as part of the Eviden Digital Passport Solution (EDPS), a ready-to-use digital product passport system for electric vehicle batteries.

By decentralizing inventory management onto a blockchain infrastructure, Kulr aims to offer real-time visibility, data security, and auditability across the entire supply chain. This setup minimizes the risks associated with traditional centralized systems, such as system failures or data breaches. Each item recorded on the ledger becomes a timestamped, tamper-proof entry, offering a single source of truth accessible by all stakeholders involved.

In addition to enhancing product authenticity and asset tracking, blockchain integration is expected to streamline auditing processes and reduce operational friction. Kulr believes that its blockchain venture not only supports internal operational goals but also positions it at the forefront of sustainable and verifiable product innovation.

Crypto World News

May 3, 2025 by Mwongera Taitumu 

Apple modified its iOS App Store rules after a U.S. District Court decision in the Epic Games antitrust case. The court ordered Apple to drop its payment fees on purchases outside the App Store and eliminate its restrictions on external payment links. This policy shift by Apple enables developers to create apps that can direct users to external payment methods and display third-party NFTs.

A U.S. District Court ruled on the legal battle between Epic Games and Apple about its App Store practices. The court found Apple to have violated an earlier court order and limited developers' ability to direct users to external websites. The new guidelines allow developers to integrate link buttons that direct users to secondary NFT marketplaces and external payment methods. However, Apple still restricts the use of applications to mine cryptocurrencies or distribute token rewards. 

The updated policies enable developers to list and transfer inside the App but purchases must be made outside the app. The modification intends to promote innovation so that innovative crypto-native applications can enter the iOS platform. OpenSea and similar apps that were previously restricted now allow users to browse third-party NFTs.

Nonetheless, Apple still restricts the use of cryptocurrencies across its applications. The updated policies prohibit applications from ICO issuance or internal generation of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Apple restricts iOS devices from mining crypto.

The NFT and cryptocurrency sectors have welcomed the court's decision and Apple's revised policies. Experts believe these developments could foster innovation to allow developers to create mobile applications that interact with digital assets. This follows a similar trend in the tech industry where major players such as Google have eased their NFT restrictions in mobile apps.

Apple retains several restrictions despite the new opportunities under the court's decision. Apple has expressed dissatisfaction with the decision and has vowed to appeal. In a show of defiance, Apple has only made the modifications on the U.S. App Store.

The court decision shows the increased tension between major tech companies and regulatory authorities. Major tech companies such as Apple continue to face challenges about their app store policies due to the shift in the legal landscape. This decision represents a major step in discussion about app store fees as well as developer freedoms in the digital asset space.

 Web3 social network Zora's recent airdrop led to a wave of discontent on social media, but creators and builders are convinced that the future of creativity is still onchain. 

Onchain social network Zora has built a reputation as a popular tool for artists, musicians and other creatives to monetize their content onchain, but the recent launch of its eponymous ZORA token has left many users confused and dissatisfied.

The token's price tanked shortly after launch, with users and observers complaining about everything from poor communication from the team to the token's distribution and utility models. 

This comes amid an overall decline in interest in the onchain creator economy and a changing perspective on whether blockchain tools like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are still useful for creatives who want to monetize their work on the blockchain.

With creators and builders shifting focus and NFTs no longer selling like they used to, does the ZORA token drop symbolize the end of the creator-driven NFT model? Maybe not, but many creatives are changing their perspectives and the role blockchain should play in the creator economy. 



The ZORA token launched on April 23, and it quickly became a point of controversy among users. To start, Zora did not officially announce that it had gone live until two hours after it was already trading, leading to confusion on social media.

The token's price quickly fell by over 50% within those roughly two hours, from $0.037 to $0.017, adding to users' complaints. It has since fallen even further, sitting around $0.013 at the time of writing.

ZORA's tokenomics also became a point of contention. 45% of the supply is reserved for the team and investors, while 25% is for the treasury — leaving 20% for community incentives and just 10% for the user airdrop. This led some to complain that the project was keeping too much for itself.

Others disliked its general lack of utility. Zora repeatedly stated that the token “is for fun only and does not entitle its holders to any governance rights or a claim on any equity ownership in Zora or its products.” But the project seemed to respond to this criticism on May 1 by announcing that ZORA would have some additional functionalities within the network.

However, many others came to the defense of the project, saying that sharing on the platform has been financially lucrative. Others were simply thankful they received anything at all.

Singer Vérité, who has racked up hundreds of millions of streams as an independent artist and was an early adopter of Web3 tech, told Cointelegraph that “on a base level, I'm appreciative of being rewarded for participating in something early.”

She said that while she doesn't know the team very well, “I feel like they are genuinely trying to construct new models for valuing digital artifacts and have built an aesthetic and culture around their brand in juxtaposition to what are usually awful crypto vibes.”

Zora's token launch was the latest move in a broader shift away from the traditional NFT model for creators, in this case toward embracing the cultural dominance of memecoins. 

While posts on Zora used to be minted as NFTs, now each post creates an instantly tradeable memecoin, also known as a “content coin.” Creators are given 1% of the supply and earn 50% of the trading and liquidity provider fees.

While the move from NFTs to content coins was itself controversial, it represents a shift to a new class of creators, according to Adam Levy, host of the Mint podcast and founder of Blueprint, which helps creators go viral onchain. He told Cointelegraph that the wild success of memecoin launchpad Pump.fun “brought in a brand new class of creators that now Zora is trying to capitalize on.”

NFT sales remain way down compared to their 2021 peak, and many creators have simply left the NFT space due to its perceived shortcomings. Music-related NFTs, which used to be prevalent on platforms like Zora, have taken a particularly hard beating.

Several builders of the most popular creator platforms have moved on to work on other projects. For instance, the team behind music NFT platform Sound.xyz has shifted its focus to a new platform called Vault, which still uses blockchain technology but keeps it hidden on the back end.

In a February X post, Sound co-founder David Greenstein said a hyperfocus on speculation led to the decline in NFT interest. “Over time, it became less about the artist, the music, and real connection—and more about financial transactions,” he wrote. “When speculation cooled, so did the energy behind supporting artists.”

This sentiment was echoed by Vérité, who said, “I don't think digital artifacts will have lasting value outside of speculation, experience and patronage.”

According to music artist and builder Latashá, “We weren't getting focused on culture; we were getting focused on speculation. And once the bear market hit, it really showcased that.” 

Latashá, who was previously head of community at Zora and is now building several blockchain-based platforms, told Cointelegraph that people also got too caught up in the language of Web3 instead of simply using the technology:

Despite the shift of interest away from NFTs toward things like memecoins, as encapsulated by Zora, many builders and creators still believe blockchain remains incredibly powerful — just that maybe it needs to be used in a different way.

“I learned that you can't force your idealism onto the world and into the market,” said Vérité. “I am less interested in making ‘Web3 tools' work because they're on the blockchain and more interested in finding new ways to solve problems that face artists, audiences and the systems that connect them, regardless of form.”

“I definitely won't sell NFTs to fans,” she added.

Levy, on the other hand, remains firm in his belief in NFTs, specifically. “I still have endless conviction in what I'm doing,” he said. He pointed out that cryptocurrency overall, let alone NFTs, is still in the very early stages of adoption. “I think we all need to zoom out.”

One notable shift has been to hide the blockchain elements and focus solely on user experience. For example, rap duo Run The Jewels has a fan club where members are rewarded with “JWL” points that can be used to unlock exclusive experiences. JWL is actually an onchain token, but that fact is buried in the club's FAQ page. 

“We still need to come up with a better way of making crypto wallets accessible to people so that it is easier,” Renata Lowenbraun, CEO of independent music Web3 platform Infanity, told Cointelegraph. “The moment that happens, everything will change.”

Lowenbraun compared blockchain to the internet, saying the internet took decades to truly catch on. NFTs, she argued, had a “false start” before the infrastructure had a chance to mature, “but it doesn't mean it's not going to stick and it's not going to be around and it's not going to have these amazing applications, particularly for creative people and creative ventures.”

For Latashá, the future is in the hands of the artists themselves. “I think artists are just going to build their platforms. I think that's going to be the future,” she said.

Whatever the future of the Web3 creator economy holds, it's clear that it won't be without road bumps along the way. But if the builders and artists are to be believed, the road bumps lie on the path toward greater artist independence.

BySean Stein Smith



BySean Stein Smith,

 Contributor. 

The U.S. is currently engaged in a number of geo-political and economic initiatives that are shaking up the global economy like few non-wartime events have in recent memory. A core pillar of U.S. economic leadership leveraged by governments now and in the past is the status of the dollar as the global reserve currency. While there are pros and cons to serving as the global reserve currency – the complexities of which are complicating the translations of simplistic slogans into reality – the fact remains that dollar leadership is an important part of U.S. statecraft, diplomacy, and economic negotiation. Stablecoin legislation and efforts and both the federal and state level are pushing the debates around stablecoins from the back burner to the front burner, but the true implications of increased stablecoin utilization are just beginning to be understood by the wider markets.

Specifically, the passage of the GENIUS Act on March 13 by the Senate Banking Committee has set clear rules for dollar-backed stablecoins. This much needed clarification also has the potential to prevent or at least mitigate the potential for other forms of stablecoins that proved to be more volatile than advertised. Additionally, the fact that legislation is moving forward at the U.S. level and has the support of the administration has accelerated the developed of stablecoin attestation and auditing standards. With virtually all of the over $200 billion stablecoin market comprised of dollar-backed stablecoins, including USDT that still raises questions around the status of reserves, clearer legislation is an imperative.

Let's take a look at a few of the reasons why stablecoin leadership should be actively encouraged in the U.S., and how it will both sustain and improve U.S. dollar leadership.

One of the key ways that dollar-backed stablecoins can enhance U.S. dollar leadership is by increasing demand for U.S. dollars and U.S. debt, which with a debt load in excess of $35 trillion is not something that can be ignored. With stablecoins able to access deposits at non-bank entities, and to do so somewhat outside of the traditional banking channels, the ability of the U.S. government to influence the flow of tokenized dollars across the global is a realistic possibility. For every new token issued by an (important caveat) U.S. regulated and supervised issuer the demand for U.S. debt and currency increases.

The demand for dollars in emerging markets, some of whom who have been adversely affected by the inconsistent trade rhetoric from both the United States and other nations, also provides an opportunity for stablecoins to solidify the value of the U.S. in emerging markets. As an ever-increasing number of TradFi banking institutions are launching dollar-backed stablecoins, and issuers such as Circle are partnering ever more closely with U.S. regulators, the prospect of tokenized dollars (stablecoins) serving as an important tool in the digital policy toolkit is quickly becoming reality.

As the U.S. faces increasing competition from political, economic, and geo-political actors the potential of other currencies embracing the opportunities delivered by tokenization is not an abstract concept. For instance, even though the Chinese government has actively sought to ban virtually all cryptocurrencies/cryptoassets the same government has made previous forays into the development of a central bank digital currency. While mass adoption remains an idea versus reality the development and launch of such an option illustrates that the benefits of tokenized payments have been observed across the globe.

Recent comments by Giancarlo Giorgetti, the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, issued an explicit warning about the risk of financial institutions and non-bank actors relying on U.S. dollar backed stablecoins. Interestingly enough, in the same prepared remarks, Giorgetti also emphasized the role the Digital Euro, a European Union backed project to tokenized Euro transactions and deposits.

Whether the actions and comments are from trade allies or rivals the message is clear; the rise of dollar-backed stablecoins are seen a potential paradigm shifting development of how money is perceived, used, and valued.

A recurring issue from investors and policymakers, even taking into account the multiple advancements made on several fronts, is the crypto marketplace retains significant amounts of volatility. For example bitcoin, after exceeding $100,000 toward the end of the 2024, returned to prices of approximately $70,000 before rapidly recovering to nearly $100,000 in May 2025. This is in spite of direct and overt policy support from the White House, institutional buy-in and support of cryptoassets, and a regulatory shift to a pro-crypto position.

Integrating dollar-backed stablecoins, and the income generating opportunities that these stablecoins can convey, has the potential to not only attract additional investment into the sector, but to reduce trading volatility. With the backing of the U.S. dollar, the support and infrastructure of dollar-based payment rails, and the option to generate income as well as price appreciation, the landscape is set for greater stablecoin utilization as 2025 rolls forward.

The U.S. dollar is the global reserve currency, and dollar-backed stablecoins will play a key role in keeping it that way.

Strategy, previously known as MicroStrategy, earned a $5.8 billion profit on its Bitcoin investments in the first quarter of 2025. The company now wants to pour even more money into the cryptocurrency, according to details provided by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor.

Bitcoin Yield Expands As Company Increases Holdings

The business intelligence firm experienced its Bitcoin yield increase by nearly 14% since January. The yield represents both possible income and capital appreciation from Strategy's investments in Bitcoin. With prices of Bitcoin still on the rise, the firm continues to make strategic buys of the digital currency.

According to reports, Strategy has changed its business tactics in the last five years. What began as a business intelligence activity is now most famously associated with enormous Bitcoin holdings. The latest performance of the company indicates this strategy continues to work in 2025.

$MSTR announces BTC Yield of 13.7% and BTC $ Gain of $5.8B year-to-date, doubles capital plan to $42B equity and $42B fixed income to purchase bitcoin, and increases BTC Yield target from 15% to 25% and BTC $ Gain target from $10B to $15B for 2025. https://t.co/LgeMEd6Dr5

Investment Plan Doubles To $84 Billion

Strategy said that it will now invest $84 billion in purchasing additional Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg. The company's move is to invest half the funds ($42 billion) in fixed income and the remaining half ($42 billion) in fixed equity.

This significant capital outlay indicates Strategy still has faith in the long-term worth of Bitcoin. The company considers Bitcoin a key component to its business model and a fundamental asset for its treasury holdings.

The scale of this investment is a staggering increase on past expenditure. If implemented, it would leave Strategy an even more prominent corporate owner of Bitcoin than it is currently.Performance Targets Leap From 15% To 25%

Strategy has increased its Bitcoin performance targets for the next year. The firm has been targeting a 15% return on its Bitcoin holdings but now anticipates 25%.

Concurrently, the company raised its target for dollar gains from Bitcoin in 2025. The objective rose from $10 billion to $15 billion, implying Strategy anticipates the price and value of Bitcoin to appreciate considerably during the course of the year.Stock Price Surges More Than 3,000% Since 2020

Strategy's stock price has risen dramatically since the company initially acquired Bitcoin five years ago. Investors who purchased shares at the time have achieved returns of over 3,000%.

The aggressive and early move by the company to purchase Bitcoin has been responsible for much of this impressive stock performance. As other companies hesitated, Strategy boldly ventured into cryptocurrency.

This latest performance report solidifies Strategy's position as a top corporate Bitcoin holder. It also reinforces confidence among cryptocurrency enthusiasts who view Bitcoin as a worthwhile long-term investment.

The company's ongoing doubling down on Bitcoin is occurring as other mainstream firms have begun venturing into cryptocurrency investments. Yet, few have invested as fully in Bitcoin as Strategy has on Saylor's watch.

Long seen as merely a digital currency, Bitcoin turns out to be much more. Behind its crypto-lighthouse facade, it has established itself as a strategic tool for intelligence agencies, notably the CIA, which integrated it into its operations long before the general public recognized its potential. This early adoption reveals an unknown facet of the queen of cryptos, far from the cypherpunk ideals of its beginnings.

The Bitcoin news: on May 1, 2025, Michael Ellis, Deputy Director of the CIA, declared in an interview with Anthony Pompliano:

Bitcoin is here to stay — cryptocurrency is here to stay. More and more institutions are adopting it, and I think it's a great trend. 

Ellis emphasized that Bitcoin has become a valuable intelligence tool, allowing tracking of financial activities of U.S. adversaries and disrupting their networks. He added:

We use technology as a tool, and Bitcoin along with other cryptocurrencies is another tool in the toolbox. 

This official recognition of BTC as a national security instrument marks a turning point in the institutional perception of cryptocurrencies.

On March 7, 2025, President Donald Trump signed a decree establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States. This decision sparked mixed reactions within the crypto community. David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, hailed the initiative, while Erik Voorhees, founder of Venice AI, expressed reservations, believing that if the government were to adopt a crypto reserve, it should be limited to Bitcoin.

This institutionalization of BTC contrasts with its libertarian origins. In March 2020, Therese Chambers, former director of regulatory investigations at the UK FCA, already noted that cryptos were increasingly behaving like traditional financial instruments, moving away from their original purpose of preserving privacy.

Ellis also highlighted the strategic importance of Bitcoin in the global technological competition, especially against China. He stated:

This is another domain of competition where we must ensure the United States is well-positioned against China and other adversaries. 

This statement highlights the growing role of BTC in international relations and cybersecurity. Bitcoin is no longer just a financial asset but a lever of influence and power for nations.

In conclusion, Bitcoin establishes itself as an essential player in cybersecurity and geopolitics. As early as 2021, a U.S. Space Force major mentioned its potential as a strategic weapon. Today, its role goes far beyond finance, redefining international power dynamics.

The financial world is constantly evolving, and few developments have captured as much attention or generated as much debate as the rise of digital currencies. From the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies to the state-backed potential of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), these innovations are prompting a significant reassessment of traditional banking practices. This article explores the relationship between digital currencies and the banking sector, tracing their journey from fringe concepts to potential mainstream integration.

Bitcoin emerged in 2009, marking the introduction of a decentralized digital currency operating on a novel system called blockchain technology. Initially met with skepticism and often dismissed by the established financial industry, cryptocurrencies represented a fundamental challenge to the centralized control banks held over money creation and transfer. Their peer-to-peer nature promised faster, cheaper transactions, particularly across borders, bypassing traditional intermediaries.

The banking sector's initial reaction was predominantly one of caution. Concerns revolved around the volatility of cryptocurrencies, their potential use in illicit activities, regulatory uncertainty, and the perceived threat to financial stability. However, as the underlying blockchain technology demonstrated potential beyond just cryptocurrencies, for instance, in streamlining settlements or improving transparency, banks began to shift from outright dismissal to cautious exploration. Many institutions initiated research projects and pilot programs to understand the technology and its implications.

In recent years, the narrative has evolved further. Recognizing growing client interest and the potential for new revenue streams, some major banks have started integrating digital assets into their services. This includes offering cryptocurrency custody solutions, facilitating trading for institutional clients, and exploring the use of stablecoins (digital currencies pegged to traditional assets) for payments. This move aims to meet customer demand and improve payment efficiency for certain types of transactions.

Parallel to the development of private cryptocurrencies, central banks globally are actively researching and developing their own digital currencies, known as CBDCs. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are issued and backed by a country's central bank, representing a digital form of fiat currency. Motivations for exploring CBDCs vary, including improving payment systems, promoting financial inclusion, and addressing the decline in physical cash use and the rise of private digital currencies.

Extensive research and pilot programs are underway globally, often discussed in publications such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) reports, highlighting the seriousness with which monetary authorities are considering this development.

Integrating digital currencies and blockchain technology will significantly transform various banking aspects. Potential benefits include:

Navigating the complexities of modern finance is crucial for both businesses and individuals. While digital currencies represent one path of innovation, others continue to invest in commodities as a strategy for diversification and value preservation. These new tools could fundamentally alter how financial services are delivered and consumed.

Despite the potential, significant challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainty remains a major obstacle as governments worldwide attempt to determine how to classify and regulate digital assets. Security risks, including hacking and theft from exchanges or digital wallets, are persistent concerns.

Scalability issues for some blockchain networks and the environmental impact of specific consensus mechanisms, such as Bitcoin's proof-of-work, also require ongoing attention and solutions. Furthermore, ensuring interoperability between new digital currency systems and existing financial infrastructure is crucial for seamless integration.

The future relationship between digital currencies and traditional banking is still unfolding. Rather than a complete replacement, a period of coexistence and gradual integration seems likely.

Banks are adapting and incorporating elements of digital finance while leveraging their established trust and regulatory compliance frameworks. CBDCs could coexist alongside private cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, each serving different purposes within the broader financial ecosystem. The journey involves continuous innovation, adaptation, and negotiation between established institutions and disruptive technologies.

The journey of digital currencies within the banking sector has been remarkable, moving from the fringes of the internet to the boardrooms of major financial institutions and the agendas of central banks. While regulation, security, and scalability challenges persist, the potential for transformation is undeniable.

Banks are no longer just observers; many are active participants, exploring how to leverage these new technologies to enhance services, improve efficiency, and remain competitive in an increasingly digital world. The financial ecosystem is evolving, and digital currencies, in their various forms, are set to play a significant role in shaping its future.

 Yuga Labs, Magic Eden, Venice.ai and more are supporting a new open-source framework so that AI agents can operate autonomously across networks. 

In a move that hopes to challenge Big Tech's grip on artificial intelligence, AI agent protocol Thinkagents.ai has launched a new open-source framework for building onchain agents that operate autonomously across decentralized networks.

While traditional systems aim to restrict data ownership and platform abilities for their users, Thinkagents.ai is creating an interoperable ecosystem owned and controlled by its users. For Mike Anderson, core contributor at THINK, the Think Agent Standard is the future of AI.

Anderson and his team developed the Think Agent Standard to enable millions of autonomous onchain AI agents to transact and communicate. The protocol now has over 70 companies, like Arbitrum and Yuga Labs, on board to help out. 

The platform is now live, allowing developers, enterprises and Web3 communities to experiment with the framework.

“There was always this idea that it's so much harder to [build AI] and so much more expensive when you have to build a thousand custom ways of doing it,” Anderson said during an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. “By standardizing demand — the way people want to receive AI — you can get the whole market to line up because they want customers, and getting customers in AI is really difficult.”

Following the release of Meta's Llama 2 a few years ago, Anderson and his team decided that if the future of decentralized AI ever manifested, they needed to ensure that consumers could easily use graphic processing units (GPUs) without spending billions of dollars.

“We watched as this whole ecosystem started to grow, with people saying, 'I'm going to build this part of the stack,' and others saying they'll ‘build that part of the stack,” almost as if Amazon Web Services (AWS) showed up with each department, with one saying they'll do the data and another saying they'll do the networking,” Anderson said.

The Think Agent Standard was launched by THINK protocol, in partnership with the Independent AI Institute, with the initial use case around Anderson and his team defining an AI agent (a place on a blockchain that has access to a computer and can make decisions), and the AI agents playing the video game Street Fighter 3 against each other. The use case brought nine different companies to work together for an audience of 30,000 viewers last summer.

Because if owning and controlling AI agents is to remain in the hands of users, the decentralized AI agent platforms need to be simple, user-intuitive, well-designed and deliver on a user experience that could have changed the way we use and understand social media.

“Imagine if we'd had the foresight in 2003 to see social media as a way to organize our lives,” Anderson said. “Instead of having accounts on MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, what if we had a standard where your accounts follow you—where all of your data and everything you'd posted in the past is something you're providing to them. It's a very different thing if users owned their accounts and data and could have opted into seeing ads where they would benefit from them. That's what we're building.”



Just as the ERC-20 standard enabled the tokenized economy, the Think Agent Standard introduces a modular, permissionless and composable system that allows AI agents to function as sovereign digital entities: Owning wallets, interacting with smart contracts and transacting seamlessly across every blockchain.

Each Think agent is powered by Non-Fungible Intelligence™ (NFI), a digital identity layer that establishes ownership, memory, and authentication, with the core genome palette residing on The Root Network and subsequent layers deployed to any connected network natively. 

The agents are composed of three core elements: The Soul (NFI), which provides a persistent, self-sovereign identity; the Mind, which governs behavior and decision-making; and the Body, which allows interaction across platforms and environments.

The first platform built on the Think Agent Standard is SOULS, a personal AI agent that users can own, train and customize. SOULS connects to thousands of open-source applications and evolves over time by integrating the best available intelligence without compromising user privacy or ownership.

Leading organizations in gaming, infrastructure and generative AI, including Yuga Labs, Futureverse, Alchemy, Render, Venice.ai and Magic Eden, are actively integrating the standard into real-world applications, further validating its potential across use cases.

“AI agents are the new interface to technology,” Anderson said. “What we've been able to do successfully is partner with consumer brands — like Bored Ape Yacht Club — to actually have distribution into a consumer's end point, and we've been able to build all the systems so that they can actually access consumers.”

For Anderson, a personal AI agent is like a personal dashboard that acts as an extension of your real self. If the information contained within your AI agent were to leak, the results could be personally catastrophic. That's why Think is standardizing the system the agent can interact with, backed by cryptography, no matter what chain the agent is on. If a safe and successful standard exists within the user-owned AI agent industry, big tech will have a harder time controlling it.

It's why users can own their data through their Think agent, eliminating the need for their data to be copied and live on some external third-party server. In this way, Think agents also hope to address the issue around data ownership by putting users in control of who they share their information with.

“When a social company goes out of business, all of that data gets sold to the highest bidder,” Anderson said. “23andMe is the most egregious example of this. They didn't give you your DNA data and then delete it from their servers, their business model was actually to sell your data to others. Now, who knows who the highest bidder is. Is it an insurance company? The Chinese government? Who is it? Your data exhaust is more valuable than your DNA.”

With the crypto market showing early signs of recovery and optimism building around a potential return to the $3 trillion valuation mark, investors are once again turning their attention to high-upside opportunities.

Among the most talked-about right now are three unique projects — blending AI, meme coins, scalability innovation, and Bitcoin-powered momentum.

Each of these tokens carries the kind of narrative, technology, and community hype that could result in a 10x to 100x return if market conditions align. Here's a breakdown of the top three coins currently catching attention.

Summary

MIND of Pepe is more than just a meme coin. It runs on Ethereum and builds real AI tools. Its main feature is a smart AI that makes its own decisions. It checks platforms like X for market trends, tracks blockchain activity, and links with dApps to find opportunities.

The project uses advanced crypto tech like a language model that talks like a trader, vector matching for better understanding, and RAG to pull real-time info. It also stores data to spot market trends and works with dashboards, trading bots, and DeFi tools.

Investors are already buying in. The presale has raised over $8.6 million. One person bought 33 million $MIND tokens in one go. Big buys like this can mean the project has strong potential. MIND of Pepe might do well after launch.

Only 27 days remain in the presale, giving early buyers a chance to use the tech before anyone else. The AI agent's first version goes live on May 10, ahead of the token's exchange launch. This early access gives investors a head start in spotting market trends and acting before the crowd.

At the current presale price of $0.0037515, $MIND could become one of the top AI-focused crypto tokens. Buying in is easy—just visit the MIND of Pepe website, connect a wallet like Best Wallet, and purchase using ETH, USDT, or a bank card.

New token holders can also earn a 263% annual yield, which changes based on how many tokens are staked. The more tokens staked early, the higher the reward. Over 1.3 billion tokens have been staked.

Most meme coins chase trends. MIND of Pepe is made to spot them first. It gives users AI tools to help grow their crypto with smart choices. Visit MIND of Pepe.

Solaxy, a unique Layer-2 built for the Solana blockchain, has made a strong impression. The project raised over $32.9 million during its presale, showing that investors believe in its potential. With token staking live, presale investors can earn a dynamic yield of 122% APY.

The presale is still open, with early investors able to buy tokens for $0.001712 each using ETH, SOL, USDT, or a credit card. Investors can also use the Best Wallet app for purchases.

As the meme coin market grows toward a $60 billion market cap, with high trading volumes and new tokens launching every day, traders face challenges like front-running bots and slow execution.

Solaxy aims to change that by offering tools that were once only available to sniper bots and power users. This makes Solaxy an attractive platform for meme coin creators and communities looking for fast, fair execution.

Source – Solaxy Twitter

Solaxy's architecture also supports a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps). Its modular infrastructure lets developers adjust performance for different use cases like DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, or gaming dApps, all without sacrificing transaction speed.

The Solaxy Block Explorer is live, marking a key milestone. Tests show stable data at 140 KB/s on Solana, speeding up storage and improving the user experience. The CLI interface is also updated for easier use by developers and users.

On the technical side, Solaxy continues to make performance upgrades, with a target of 10,000 TPS for its rollup. Bridging is getting better, with the final CORS setup on the SDK and fixes for UI mismatches between the rollup and Solana's L1.

The Solaxy team is dedicated and working hard to make this one of the top crypto projects in 2025. Visit Solaxy.

Momentum is building quickly, and as Bitcoin rises, it's shining a spotlight on a lesser-known token gaining attention: BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL). This meme coin is designed to double Bitcoin rewards without buying more BTC.

With a growing investor base, the project has raised over $5.2 million in its ICO, and early participation continues to increase. BTC Bull Token allows investors to double their Bitcoin gains simply by holding the token.

The more $BTCBULL tokens you hold, the bigger your rewards when milestones are hit. The first milestone is at Bitcoin $150,000, and rewards increase as Bitcoin's price goes up.

$BTCBULL also features a supply-reduction mechanism. When Bitcoin reaches $125,000, it reduces the token supply, increasing scarcity and long-term value. This process repeats every $50K increase in Bitcoin's price.

At the $250,000 milestone, $BTCBULL holders will also receive bonus airdrops, boosting their holdings just as Bitcoin's price takes off.

Investors don't have to wait for Bitcoin to surge to earn more $BTCBULL. The project offers a 78% staking APY, allowing them to grow their token holdings over time by locking their $BTCBULL in the staking pool.

Getting involved is easy. Just visit the BTC Bull Token website and buy $BTCBULL using ETH, USDT, or a bank card – no complicated setup.

For the best $BTCBULL experience, use Best Wallet. Due to a partnership with this top noncustodial Web3 wallet (BEST), it works seamlessly with the BTC Bull Token rewards system.

Just hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet to automatically qualify for Bitcoin airdrops whenever a milestone is reached. Visit BTC Bull Token.

Dive into the Thinkagents.ai protocol, an open-source framework uniting 70+ firms to decentralize AI with autonomous, modular, and secure agents.

Author by

Edited by

Shweta Chakrawarty

More than seventy organizations, including Yuga Labs and Magic Eden, have allied for AI decentralization. These supporters endorse the Thinkagents.ai protocol as a fresh, open-source framework for AI autonomy. It enables AI agents to function independently across diverse blockchain networks without central oversight. This movement counters Big Tech's AI control and promotes decentralization, user ownership, and open infrastructure. The Think Agent Standard by THINK establishes secure, interoperable agent operations across chain ecosystems. This collaborative initiative lays the groundwork for democratized, trustless AI development and governance.

Traditional centralized AI platforms often restrict data ownership and limit platform capabilities. According to Anderson from THINK, the core challenge is the lack of shared standards. The protocol reduces deployment costs and complexity by unifying developers under common rules. This framework encourages collaboration over siloed efforts, streamlining innovation in decentralized AI. By adopting the Think Agent Standard, builders can avoid fragmentation and redundant system designs. In turn, AI can be deployed more efficiently with consistent interoperability and reduced development overhead.

The team validated the framework with a live gaming demonstration featuring AI in Street Fighter 3. This event united nine infrastructure providers and attracted thirty thousand live viewers. Its success proved that the protocol can support real-time, cross-network agent cooperation. Developers lacking deep infrastructure or big budgets now gain an accessible entry point for projects. The demonstration showcased seamless agent deployment and management across multiple blockchain environments. This proof-of-concept highlights the protocol's potential to enable broad collaboration in AI development.

The protocol supports composability, allowing developers to reuse and combine components instead of rebuilding systems. This modular approach mirrors lessons from Ethereum's ERC-20 standard. Any AI agent built on the Thinkagents.ai protocol can now manage wallets, execute contracts, and cross chains. Modules can be assembled flexibly for diverse use cases without starting from scratch. Companies like Alchemy and Venice.ai have already integrated this modular system into practical applications. Their involvement accelerates decentralized AI's shift from theoretical concept to operational reality. This approach reduces redundant development effort and fosters faster iteration cycles.

Each Think Agent comprises three layers: Soul, Mind, and Body. The Soul layer defines a unique digital identity for each agent instance. The Mind layer encodes the agent's decision-making and learning algorithms. The Body layer interfaces with blockchain networks and external data sources. Features like Non-Fungible Intelligence™ ensure agents retain ownership across chains. This structure allows Artificial Intelligence to learn, adapt, and evolve autonomously. Users maintain full control of their agent's data and activity with digital sovereignty. This design raises important questions about privacy and long-term oversight.

SOULS is the inaugural application built on the new open-source agent standard. It enables users to train, personalize, and deploy their own AI agent. This tool evolves with incremental intelligence upgrades without compromising user control. Unlike centralized platforms, SOULS preserves privacy by keeping data under user management. AI agents like SOULS offer tailored digital experiences through direct user interaction. Their widespread adoption relies on transparent design, robust security measures, and community trust. Over time, user feedback drives protocol refinement and improved integration across projects.

Decentralized AI's chief benefit lies in granting users full data autonomy. Owning their Think system lets users control what information they share and with whom. The method differs from services like 23andMe that monetize personal data without consent. Under traditional models, bankrupt platforms often sell user information to unknown third parties. By empowering AI agents on user-defined terms, decentralized protocols block such misuse. The Thinkagents.ai protocol strengthens user sovereignty and shields personal data from exploitation. This paradigm shift marks a vital step toward secure, user-centric experiences.

Arizona will not be investing in bitcoin (BTC), at least not this year. 

Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill on Friday that would have allowed the state to hold the digital asset as part of its official reserves.

The legislation, known as Senate Bill 1025, proposed using seized funds to invest in BTC and create a digital assets reserve managed by the state. After passing the state House in a narrow 31–25 vote, the bill reached Hobbs' desk, where it was swiftly struck down.

“The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments. Arizonans' retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currencу,” Hobbs wrote in a statement.

The veto ends a push that could have made Arizona the first state to set up a cryptocurrency reserve, and it could have even outpaced the U.S. Treasury Department in doing so.

 Arizona's plan to invest in Bitcoin has ended in a veto, with Governor Katie Hobbs citing concerns over using public funds for ""untested assets."" 

Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has vetoed a bill that would have allowed the state to hold Bitcoin as part of its official reserves, effectively ending efforts to make Arizona the first US state to adopt such a policy.

The Digital Assets Strategic Reserve bill, which would have permitted Arizona to invest seized funds into Bitcoin (BTC) and create a reserve managed by state officials, was formally struck down on Friday, according to an update on the Arizona State Legislature's website.

“Today, I vetoed Senate Bill 1025. The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments,” Hobbs wrote in a statement aimed at Warren Petersen, the President of the Arizona Senate.

“Arizonans' retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currency,” she added.

On April 28, the bill passed a final vote in the state House when 31 members of the Arizona House voted in favor of the bill, with 25 opposing. 

Hobbs had previously stated she would veto any legislation not tied to a bipartisan agreement on disability funding.

A companion bill, SB1373, which would authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of Arizona's rainy-day fund into digital assets like Bitcoin, has not yet reached a final vote.

Arizona joins several other states where similar efforts have failed. In recent months, similar proposals in Oklahoma, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming have stalled or been withdrawn.

In contrast, North Carolina's House passed the Digital Assets Investment Act on April 30, allowing the state treasurer to invest up to 5% of certain funds in approved cryptocurrencies. The bill has now been moved to the state Senate for consideration.

The state-level efforts to create Bitcoin reserves come amid a push from US President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers to do the same in the federal government. 

Trump signed an executive order in March with a proposal for a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.”

 Institutional investors are driving a new era in Bitcoin mining, capitalizing on favorable US regulations and infrastructure diversification into AI. 

Opinion by: Fakhul Miah, managing director of GoMining Institutional

The Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry has never been more attractive to institutional investors. Fintech giants are investing in Bitcoin mining rather than just accumulating the asset, all thanks to the favorable regulatory environment in the US and the profitability margin of BTC. 

Then, numerous companies are diversifying by allocating computing power to AI, further strengthening their economics and, thus, investment attractiveness. For now, it looks like the future of the foundational layer for the Bitcoin network could mark the new gusher age.

Bitcoin mining is still profitable. CoinShares, a digital asset investment firm, shared that the average cost to mine 1 BTC for US-listed miners reached $55,950 in Q3 2024. Two other popular models — one from MacroMicro and another dubbed the Glassnode Difficulty Regression Model — give different estimates. 

On the very same day of Feb. 20, MacroMicro.me data shows that the average cost to produce 1 BTC hovers above $92,000; Glassnode's Difficulty Regression Model estimates the cost to mine a single BTC at approximately $34,400, all while the cryptocurrency's price hit $98,300 on that day.

On a global scale, mining costs differ based on the region. For example, the electricity cost to produce 1 BTC in Ireland is roughly $321,000, but it costs just over $1,300 to mine 1 BTC in Iran. Electricity is only part of the equation — hardware, labor and maintenance costs also play a crucial role.

Recent data from CoinShares and MacroMicro.me paints a challenging yet nuanced picture for Bitcoin miners in the United States. While some institutional miners remain profitable, the broader landscape reveals increasing operational pressures that could reshape the mining industry.

What happens if the challenges aren't addressed? Mining institutions with high profitability rates could start to expand their operations and possibly acquire struggling miners at bargain prices, potentially putting retail and smaller miners at risk.

In addition to receiving the block rewards, miners also benefit from the Bitcoin network's transaction fees, which depend on network usage. Data shows that the daily Bitcoin transaction fees have been hovering between $360,000 and $1.3 million over the past month — reaching an average of $595,000 daily. 

This additional revenue stream bolsters Bitcoin mining's economic appeal and strengthens the resilience of the mining business model by diversifying income sources.

It's not only mining that mining hardware is used for. High computational power, captive power supplies and ready-made infrastructure make miners uniquely equipped to support AI and high-performance computing. In simple terms, mining firms can now rent out their hardware to process AI tasks instead of only focusing on mining Bitcoin.

The combination of transaction fee revenue growth and AI computing diversification creates a more resilient and profitable industry model (the existing one has never been quite appealing to institutional investments in the US). 

The appealing revenues in the Bitcoin mining industries brought huge attention from institutional investors. This process is easy to spot: Bitcoin mining pools in the US accounted for over 40% of the global Bitcoin network's hashrate in 2024. 

According to research by EY-Parthenon and Coinbase, 83% of the 352 global institutions plan to increase their crypto allocations this year, while 51% of the asset managers are considering investments in digital asset companies, including mining companies. That's why I'm not surprised to witness huge investments in Riot Platforms, CoreWeave and other mining industry players. 

The favorable market sentiment has paved the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) and specialized funds targeting mining companies. In addition to securing the $650-million investment, CoreWeave aims to go public with a $4-billion IPO to help the Nvidia-backed company reach a $35-billion valuation.

Bgin Blockchain, a Singapore-based crypto miner manufacturer, recently filed to go public in the US. Renaissance Capital, an investment advisory firm, expects Bgin Blockchain to raise $50 million for its IPO.

This surge in institutional momentum is set to benefit the Bitcoin mining industry by driving up demand and tightening available supply on the market. As more large players accumulate and hold Bitcoin, market scarcity could increase, supporting higher prices and, in turn, boosting miner profitability.

The strong support from institutional investors comes as the optimism around crypto-friendly policies has significantly increased after Donald Trump won the US presidential elections in November 2024.

Establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in early March, seen as a massive policy shift, triggered positivity in the crypto and mining sectors. This sector gained importance. Last year, Bitcoin mining operations significantly contributed to the US economy, generating roughly $4.1 billion in gross domestic product and creating over 31,000 jobs nationwide. The industry is also revitalizing rural areas by generating tax revenue and repurposing remote locations for mining operations. It sounds like the gusher days of the oil industry a century ago, doesn't it?

The latest investments, leadership appointments and IPOs show that Bitcoin mining firms have a significant tailwind. Meanwhile, they are no longer just about BTC — they are becoming data infrastructure providers for the AI sector, turning into hybrid data processing giants.

Taking advantage of this shift, the US could potentially become the leader in the digital asset and Bitcoin mining space due to the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration and fulfill its stated goal of being the “crypto capital of the world.”

As institutions double down on Bitcoin mining and AI convergence, the question isn't if this industry will evolve but who will lead the charge. The modern digital gold rush is underway, and the smartest capital is already claiming it.

 Arthur Hayes doubts the US government would print money to buy Bitcoin while the “popular narrative” paints Bitcoin bros partying in nightclubs. 

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says the United States is unlikely to add more Bitcoin to its reserves beyond what it has already seized due to the country's high debt levels and the stereotype behind “Bitcoin bros.”

“I'm not really into the whole Strategic Reserve situation,” Hayes said in a May 1 interview.

“The United States is a deficit country; the only way they can do a Strategic Reserve is not sell the Bitcoin they took from people, fine, that's 200,000 Bitcoin,” he said.

Hayes said it's hard to imagine any “properly elected” politician openly announcing that the government plans to print money to buy Bitcoin (BTC).

“Is that really what you want people to think about your policy?” he asked.

On March 6, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve and digital asset stockpile in the US. The US holds 198,012 Bitcoin worth over $18 billion, as per recent data. The reserve is primarily formed of Bitcoin seized in criminal and civil cases, including significant amounts from the Silk Road and Bitfinex hack cases.

However, many crypto industry leaders believe that if the US government starts buying Bitcoin, it could set off an aggressive domino effect.

Sergej Kunz, co-founder of exchange aggregator 1inch, said during Cointelegraph's LONGITUDE event in Dubai that if the US were to start buying Bitcoin for a strategic reserve, even smaller countries may soon struggle to acquire the cryptocurrency.

He added. “I'm pretty sure we'll soon see countries battling over who owns more Bitcoin. The US will start.”

Hayes remains confident that the Bitcoin cycle leading into altcoin season will follow the same pattern as it did in 2021, despite differing views from other analysts.

“I personally think Bitcoin dominance is going back to where it was before the 2021 altcoin season, which is about 70%,” Hayes said.

Hayes isn't convinced the pattern will change. “Then people just start rotating,” he said. “It's back at all-time highs; bull markets are back, and altcoins should outperform. Should is a keyword there,” Hayes said. “Depends on what you buy,” he added.

Bitcoin dominance — the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the entire crypto market — is 64.78% at the time of publication, according to TradingView data. 

This represents an 11.68% increase since Jan. 1, when Bitcoin dominance was hovering just below 60%, a level where some analysts said would be its peak before altcoin season began. 

Several analysts doubted that Bitcoin dominance would ever return to 70%.

One of those skeptics was Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen, who explained in August that he doesn't “think it is going back up to 70%,” and his target for Bitcoin dominance is 60%.

Meanwhile, in December CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said “altseason is no longer defined by asset rotation from Bitcoin.” 

He said the traditional signal marking the beginning of an altcoin season when capital rotates from Bitcoin to altcoins is outdated. Instead, altcoin trading volume has become more prevalent against stablecoin and fiat currency pairs.

Math Puzzle: Fold the Road Map

By Martin Gardner 

Mathematicians have not yet succeeded in finding a formula for the number of different ways a road map can be folded, given n creases in the paper. Some notion of the complexity of this question can be gained from the following puzzle invented by the British puzzle expert Henry Ernest Dudeney.

Divide a rectangular sheet of paper into eight squares and number them on one side only, as shown at top left in the illustration below. There are 40 different ways that this “map” can be folded along the ruled lines to form a square packet which has the “1” square face up on top and all other squares beneath. The problem is to fold this sheet so that the squares are in serial order from 1 to 8, with the 1 face up on top.

If you succeed in doing this, try the much more difficult task of doing the same thing with the sheet numbered in the manner below.

The first sheet is folded as follows. Flip the sheet over so that when you look down on it, the numbered squares are face down in this position:

Fold the right half on the left so that 5 goes on 2, 6 on 3, 4 on 1 and 7 on 8. Fold the bottom half up so that 4 goes on 5 and 7 on 6. Now tuck 4 and 5 between 6 and 3, and fold 1 and 2 under the packet.

The second sheet is first folded in half the long way, the numbers outside, and held so that 4536 is uppermost.

Fold 4 on 5. The right end of the strip (squares 6 and 7) is pushed between 1 and 4, then bent around the folded edge of 4 so that 6 and 7 go between 8 and 5, and 3 and 2 go between 1 and 4.

There's a mysterious dilation happening in this location.

Finally, science has confirmed that time does slow way down when you're inside the gym. But it's not the boredom or the person on the next elliptical who won't stop talking on the phone. 

In a small study, participants completed stationary bicycle trials and then measured 30 seconds to the best of their ability. The results show that participants were about 8-9 percent faster than the real time, indicating that the clock would have appeared to move slowly to them. 

And besides the joke about time slowing down, this effect raises a lot of interesting research questions about what's going on. This study focuses on people's perceptions and psychological explanations, but the human body goes through a multitude of physical changes during exercise. If athletes want to improve pacing, they may need to work on a handful or more of variables.

In the study, 33 participants completed a stationary bicycle course of 4000 meters. They were asked to estimate 30-second intervals at five points: before the course, after 500 meters, after 1500 meters, after 2500 meters, and then post exercise. There were three runs through the course. One was solo, like setting a time trial in Mario Kart. The second had an opponent, like the ghost you can race in those time trials. And the third was an active race, where participants were asked to try to beat the opponent. Each bicyclist was asked to rate their perceived exertion, but they weren't asked to hit specific speeds, except in the one trial with a competitive opponent.

The details of the results may be surprising: “There was no difference between exercise conditions or time points (500 m, 1500 m, and 2500 m).” That means the appearance of a competitor, and any extra effort toward beating them, didn't change the participant's perception of time; nor did the steady increase of perceived effort during the entire trial.

The study is small, with just 33 participants, but the research team says a number of their method details and findings are novel, meaning without precedent in the existing research. Indeed, exercise science and athlete conditioning have both made huge leaps in sophistication in the last 20 or 30 years, creating opportunities to study and optimize entire new areas. These findings will lead to further study.

This peer-reviewed paper appears in the journal Brain and Behavior. The four researchers, from both the Netherlands and England, focus on sports psychology in their discussion. After all, they hint, if having an active race against a close competitor doesn't help time feel like it's passing less slowly, athletes need something else to engage their attention in order to stay in the active zone and out of the boredom zone. 

Accurately pacing their progress is also key for competitive athletes, the researchers say. Elites like Michael Phelps often rely on visualization to help them rehearse their races to a point of rote muscle memory, and correct timing is key to this as well. In Phelps' career-defining races, an awkwardly timed flip turn could mean missing the world record.

“[M]ore work has to be done to further unravel the role of external stimuli, exercise intensity, and duration on the perception of time during exercise,” the researchers conclude. “All of these factors affect timing, pacing, and the successful completion of optimal outcomes across physical activities.”

They suggest that newer techniques, like timed lighting, may help support athletes' goals in pacing and output. Indeed, almost anyone who's competed in a race sport has turned a corner or flipped a turn and realized they spent too much energy to bring it home. Timing is a biological and psychological challenge in the body, but learning and adjusting it is still up to the individual athlete and their coach.

Metrics details

We analyzed participant genomic variant data to characterize population structure and genetic ancestry for the All of Us cohort (n = 297,549). There is substantial population structure in the cohort, with clusters of closely related participants interspersed among less related individuals. Participants show diverse genetic ancestry, with major contributions from European (66.4%), African (19.5%), Asian (7.6%), and American (6.3%) continental ancestry components. Participant genetic similarity clusters show group-specific ancestry, with distinct patterns of continental and subcontinental ancestry among groups. African and American ancestry are enriched in the southeast and southwest regions of the country, respectively, whereas European ancestry is more evenly distributed across the US. The diversity of All of Us participants' genetic ancestry is negatively correlated with age; younger participants show higher levels of genetic admixture compared to older participants. Our results underscore the ancestral genetic diversity of the All of Us cohort, a crucial prerequisite for genomic health equity.

The biomedical research community has become increasingly aware of the genomics research gap, whereby the vast majority of participants in genetics research cohorts are of European ancestry1,2,3. The Eurocentric bias in genomics research threatens to exacerbate health disparities, since discoveries made with European ancestry cohorts may not transfer to diverse ancestry groups4. The NIH All of Us Research Program (All of Us) is a large cohort study of people who live in the US that combines participant genomic, phenotypic, and environmental data, with health-related outcome data gleaned from surveys and electronic health records5,6. All of Us has emphasized the recruitment of participants from population groups that are underrepresented in biomedical research in an effort to close the genomics research gap and to ensure that the benefits of precision medicine are shared equitably among all people7,8.

All of Us demonstration projects are being used to describe and validate the initial genomic data release and the cloud-based Researcher Workbench, where registered users can access and analyze participant data9. The aim of this demonstration project was to characterize the patterns of population structure and genetic ancestry among All of Us participants. Population structure refers to differences in the frequencies of genetic variants (alleles) among different groups or populations within a species, and population structure can be revealed by the presence of clusters of genetically similar individuals10. Genetic ancestry is closely related to the concept of population structure, and it can be defined mechanistically and operationally11,12,13,14. Mechanistically, genetic ancestry has been defined as the subset of genealogical paths through which an individual's DNA has been inherited from their ancestors15. For any individual, only a subset of their genealogical ancestors contributes DNA to their genome. Operationally, genetic ancestry is typically characterized via genetic similarity between query individuals (e.g., All of Us participants) and individuals from global reference populations, which are taken as surrogates for ancestral populations16,17,18,19.

For this demonstration study of the All of Us cohort, we analyzed participant genomic variant data to (1) assess the extent of population structure in the cohort, (2) characterize the patterns of participant genetic ancestry at continental and subcontinental levels, and (3) explore how participants' genetic ancestry changes over space and time in the US. Our results reveal substantial population structure and heterogeneous patterns of genetic ancestry among All of Us participants, consistent with the consortium's efforts to recruit a diverse participant cohort.

A cohort of 297,549 All of Us participants, for whom genomic data are available, was created using the All of Us Researcher Workbench (Supplementary Fig. 1). All of Us participant genetic diversity was analyzed using PCA of genomic variant data followed by unsupervised clustering to assess the extent of population structure in the cohort. The clustering tendency of participant genomic PCA data was evaluated using the Hopkins statistic, nearest neighbors, and kernel density estimation. The PCA data yield a Hopkins statistic value of ~1, indicating highly clustered, non-uniformly, and non-randomly distributed genomic PCA data. The number of close neighbors per participant is highly variable across PC space, and kernel density estimation shows a multimodal distribution with distinct peaks separated in PC space (Fig. 1a, b). All three of these metrics reveal highly clustered participant genomic data, with dense groups of genetically similar individuals interspersed among less dense regions, indicative of substantial population structure in the All of Us cohort.

Left panels show PC1 versus PC2 comparisons, and right panels show PC1 versus PC3 comparisons, with the percent of variance explained by each PC shown. a Participants color-coded by the number of close neighbors as defined by Euclidean distance < 0.1 in PCs 1–5. b Kernel density estimation with peaks showing high-density clusters of participants in PC space. c High-density clusters of genetically similar participants are shown as groups 1–7.

Density-based clustering of the genomic PCA data yields an optimal number of K = 7 genetic diversity clusters (Fig. 1c). Similar clustering was performed using a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis of the genomic PCA data (Supplementary Methods). Density-based clustering of UMAP data reveals almost twice as many clusters (K = 13) as seen for the PCA data, but there is broad concordance between the two methods with high percentages of participant overlap for each PCA cluster within one or two corresponding UMAP clusters (Supplementary Fig. 2). The number of All of Us genetic diversity clusters could change with future participant data releases.

All of Us participants genetic ancestry was inferred using genomic PCA data analyzed with the Rye (Rapid Ancestry Estimation) program20. Participant PCA data were compared with PCA data from global reference populations, taken from the 1KGP and the HGDP, to infer individual ancestry proportions from seven continental-level ancestry groups: African, American, East Asian, South Asian, West Asian, European, and Oceanian (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3). All of Us participants are broadly distributed in PC space, whereas global reference samples from different ancestry groups are tightly clustered in PC space (Fig. 2a, b). Rye infers All of Us participant genetic ancestry proportions as linear combinations of reference population ancestries. Overall, the All of Us participant cohort shows 19.51% African, 6.33% American, 2.57% East Asian, 3.05% South Asian, 1.95% West Asian, 66.37% European, and 0.21% Oceanian ancestry. The All of Us participant genetic similarity groups inferred with density-based clustering show group-specific patterns of ancestry proportions, with a continuum of ancestry proportions within and between groups (Fig. 2c). Groups 1, 3, 4, and 7 show the most uniform patterns of ancestry within groups, whereas groups 2, 5, 6, and the remaining participants that did not fall into any density-based cluster show more diverse patterns of ancestry and admixture. All groups show evidence of admixture with multiple ancestry components present in different proportions.

Left panels show PC1 versus PC2 comparisons, and right panels show PC1 versus PC3 comparisons, with the percent of variance explained by each PC shown. b Genetic ancestry proportions for All of Us participants stratified by the genetic similarity groups shown in Fig. 1c. Average ancestry proportions are shown above each group, and numbers of participants are shown below each group. The remaining participants are individuals who did not fall into a dense PCA cluster.

The All of Us Researcher Workbench predicts participant membership among six continental ancestry groups, using a PCA-based machine learning method that is distinct from the continuous ancestry inference approach used here21. We compared the participant continental ancestry percentages inferred here to the Researcher Workbench assigned categorical ancestry groups (Supplementary Fig. 4). Five of the six categorical ancestry groups correspond exactly with the reference population groups we use: African, East Asian, South Asian, Middle Eastern (West Asian here), and European. For these five groups, there is high correspondence between participants' PCA-based machine learning predicted group membership and averages for the ancestry percentages that we inferred (83.02–97.71% matching ancestry). The Admixed American ancestry category from the Researcher Workbench includes modern, admixed reference samples from Latin America, whereas our American reference population group includes Indigenous American samples only (Supplementary Table 1). The Admixed American group shows 51.01% European ancestry and 35.84% American ancestry, consistent with what is expected for modern Latin American populations22,23.

We also used Rye to infer subcontinental ancestry for All of Us participants with high levels of African (n = 9291), East Asian (n = 2457), South Asian (n = 2484), and European ancestry (n = 24,730; Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3). The relationships among the reference populations used for subcontinental ancestry inference with Rye and All of Us participants are shown in Supplementary Figs. 5–7. African subcontinental ancestry is characterized by a predominant West Central African component, followed by West African and Bantu components. East Asian subcontinental ancestry is highly diverse, with predominant Han (Chinese), Japanese, and Southeast Asian components. South Asian subcontinental ancestry is mainly South Indian, followed by North Indian and a small Central Asian component. European subcontinental ancestry is made up primarily of British ancestry, followed by Italian and Iberian components.

Subcontinental genetic ancestry proportions for All of Us participants from (a) African, (b) East Asian, (c) South Asian, and (d) European continental ancestry groups. Subcontinental groups (regions) for each continental ancestry group are color-coded as shown.

The continental and subcontinental ancestry estimates presented here are dependent on the reference samples used for the analysis, since Rye assigns ancestry percentages for All of Us participants based on relative genetic similarity to a set of reference populations. Accordingly, incomplete sampling of reference populations, coupled with spatial population structure as seen for the All of Us participants, could introduce biases to the ancestry estimates. We performed sensitivity analyzes to test for such biases by sequentially adding and removing reference populations and observing how continental or subcontinental ancestry estimates change.

For the continental ancestry sensitivity analysis, we focused on cluster 5, which shows combination of European, South Asian, and West Asian ancestry components that may not correspond to known historical events (Fig. 2). Adding a Central Asian reference population to the analysis does not noticeably change the ancestry estimates for this group, whereas removing either South or West Asian components does change the results appreciably (Supplementary Fig. 8). This could point to ancestral origins for these participants in the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, or Iran, geographically in between the reference populations used here. Nevertheless, the challenge of incomplete reference populations only applies to a small percentage of All of Us participants (~3%), the majority of which show ancestral origins from continental regions that are well-covered by the reference populations used here.

For the subcontinental ancestry sensitivity analysis, we focused on the African subcontinental ancestry given the 7.7% average East Bantu ancestry component estimated for these participants (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 3). This ancestry component was not observed for African Americans in the US in a recent comprehensive analysis of genetic ancestry in the Americas24. Given that many of the participants selected for this analysis are admixed with European ancestry, the East Bantu component could be accounted for by missing European or related reference populations. However, adding European and North African reference populations does not change the results appreciably (Supplementary Fig. 9). The relatively small East Bantu component (7.7%) most likely corresponds to Bantu populations that are not well represented in the reference populations used here, rather than non-Bantu East African ancestry.

All of Us participant continental ancestry percentages were visualized across fifty states and Puerto Rico to evaluate the geographic distribution of ancestry across the US (Fig. 4). African ancestry is concentrated primarily in the southeast part of the country, whereas American ancestry is found primarily in the southwest and California. European ancestry is more uniformly distributed across the country, with the highest concentrations found in north, along the Canadian border. Relatively high levels of admixture are seen in the northeast, Florida, and Hawaii.

Genetic ancestry proportions are shown for All of Us participants sampled from the fifty US states and Puerto Rico. a All participants and ancestry components. b Non-European genetic ancestry proportions for all individuals with <90% European ancestry. The results for states shaded in gray are suppressed owing to <20 participants with <90% European ancestry.

The relationship between All of Us participants' age and genetic ancestry was assessed using genetic admixture entropy, where higher values indicate a more diverse combination of ancestry components within individual genomes and lower values indicate more homogenous ancestry (Fig. 5). Genetic admixture entropy is negatively correlated with participant age, indicating that younger participants have more diverse ancestry combinations than older participants.

Our analysis demonstrates the genomic and ancestral diversity of the All of Us cohort, consistent with the project's goals to recruit participants from population groups that are underrepresented in biomedical research in support of health equity. Indeed, All of Us is one of the most diverse population biomedical datasets in the world, and this represents an important step towards making precision medicine more widely available and more applicable to diverse communities in the US7,8,25. The promise of population biomedical datasets like All of Us rests on the integration of genetic, social, environmental, and health outcome data for many thousands of diverse participants. Given that genetic ancestry is derived from the genome, it should be possible to use genetic ancestry inference, together with population biomedical datasets, to help elucidate genetic and socioenvironmental contributions to health outcomes and disparities.

One challenge is that current methods for genetic ancestry inference, while accurate, are slow and do not scale to biobank-sized datasets like All of Us. We developed the Rye algorithm as a fast and computationally efficient genetic ancestry inference method that can scale to biobank-sized genomic data sets20. Application of Rye to genome-wide genetic data for 297,549 All of Us participants underscores its utility for this purpose. Using Rye, we found the All of Us cohort to be ancestrally diverse with distinct patterns of genetic ancestry and admixture among genetic similarity groups and geographic regions (Figs. 2–4). The geographic patterns of genetic ancestry seen for the All of Us cohort are consistent with previous studies but could also reflect differences in participant recruitment across the country26,27,28.

Supervised genetic ancestry inference, using a program like Rye or comparable methods, relies on genetic similarity between query individuals (e.g., All of Us participants) and global reference population samples16,17. Accordingly, ancestry results are very much dependent on the choice of reference samples and may be biased by incomplete sampling of reference populations in the face of spatial genetic structure. If participants trace genetic ancestry to populations or geographic regions that are not well-represented by the reference populations, then they may appear to be admixed with ancestry components from nearby populations. We demonstrate this possibility using sensitivity analyzes for both continental and subcontinental ancestry inferences, with results suggesting that minor Asian and African ancestry components seen for All of Us participants may be mis-assigned owing to incomplete reference samples. Thus, the ancestry estimates reported here are best interpreted as the relative genetic similarity between All of Us participants and the reference populations used for the study, and as such, they are likely to change if different reference samples are used for the analysis.

The extent to which human genetic diversity is characterized by clusters of closely related individuals, i.e., population structure, versus clines of continuous genetic variation has long been a subject of interest29,30,31,32,33. The All of Us cohort allows for an assessment of the extent of population structure in the US, given the large size of the cohort, the extensive sampling of participants across the country, and the demographic diversity of the participants. The application of several different cluster analysis methods to participants' genomic PCA data revealed evidence for substantial population structure in the cohort, with dense clusters of relatively closely related participants interspersed among less dense regions in PC space (Fig. 1). The population structure and genetic clusters that can be gleaned from clustering analysis of genomic PCA data are not readily apparent from visual inspection of these same data, owing to large size of the cohort and over-plotting of participants in dense regions of PC space (Fig. 2a).

Finally, we show that genetic diversity in the US is increasing over time. Younger All of Us participants are far more ancestrally diverse than older participants, and this trend is evident across the entire age range of the cohort. This finding suggests that genetic ancestry categories and group designations will become increasingly obsolete over time34.

This study was performed as an All of Us genomic data demonstration project5. All of Us demonstration projects are intended to describe and validate data and analysis tools for the participant cohort. Details on the initial All of Us data release and Researcher Workbench used for this study were previously published6. The genomic data demonstration project and experimental protocols were approved by the All of Us Institutional Review Board (#2016–05-TN-Master), and informed consent was obtained from all participants. All of Us inclusion criteria include adults 18 and older, with the legal authority and decisional capacity to consent, and currently residing in the US or a territory of the US. All of Us exclusion criteria exclude minors under the age of 18 and vulnerable populations (prisoners and individuals without the capacity to give consent). Details on participant recruitment, informed consent, inclusion, and exclusion criteria are available online at https://allofus.nih.gov/sites/default/files/All of Us_operational_protocol_v1.7_mar_2018.pdf. Results reported here comply with the All of Us Data and Statistics Dissemination Policy, disallowing disclosure of group counts under 20.

The All of Us Researcher Workbench was used to build the participant cohort for this study (Supplementary Fig. 1). The cohort was built from the All of Us Controlled Tier dataset v7 (curated version C2022Q4R9), which includes participants enrolled from 2018 to 2022, with a data cutoff date of 7 January 2022. Participants who self-identified as American Indian or Alaska Native were not included in the analysis.

Participant genomic data were accessed from the Controlled Tier dataset. Genome-wide genotypes for All of Us participants were characterized using the Illumina Global Diversity Array with variants called for 1,824,517 genomic positions on the GRCh38/hg38 reference genome build. All of Us participant variants were merged and harmonized with whole genome sequence variant data from 3433 global reference samples characterized as part of the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP; phase 3) and the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP; Supplementary Table 1)35,36. Variant merging, harmonization, and LD pruning were performed using PLINK version 1.937 and custom scripts38,39,40. Biallelic variants common to the All of Us and reference data sets were merged, with strand flips and variant identifier inconsistencies harmonized as needed. Variants with >1% missingness and <1% minor allele frequency were removed from the merged and harmonized dataset. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning was done using PLINK with window size = 50, step size = 10, and pairwise threshold r2 < 0.1, yielding a final All of Us and global reference sample dataset of 187,795 variants. The final dataset of All of Us participant genomic variants was used for unsupervised clustering analysis. PCA was run on the variant dataset using the FastPCA program implemented in PLINK version 2.0. The clustering tendency of the resulting genomic PCA data was analyzed using the Hopkins statistic with the Hopkins R package41 and nearest neighbor search with the FNN R package version 1.1.442. Kernel density estimation was performed with the MASS R package using PCs 1-3, and contour lines were extracted from the estimated density distribution43. Density-based clustering was performed using the HDBSCAN algorithm44. HDBSCAN was run on first 5 PCs for the PCA data with parameters min_samples = 2000 and min_cluster_size = 2500. Cluster boundaries were visualized using the ggforce R package.

Genomic variants from All of Us participants and a set of global reference populations were merged and harmonized as described in the previous section to perform continental and subcontinental genetic ancestry inference. Kinship analysis was performed with the KING program to eliminate related (or duplicated) reference samples from the global reference populations45. Continental genetic ancestry inference was performed using a subset of 1572 global reference samples from the 1KGP and the HGDP, which were selected as non-admixed representatives of seven ancestry groups: African, American, East Asian, South Asian, West Asian, European, and Oceanian (Supplementary Table 1). K-nearest neighbor clustering of genomic PCA data was used to identify All of Us participants that cluster together with African, East Asian, South Asian, and European reference populations, and these participants were used for subcontinental ancestry inference46. West Asian and Oceanian reference populations were not used for this purpose owing to the relatively low number of participants that clustered with these groups. Asian and European reference populations for subcontinental ancestry inference were taken from the 1KGP and HGDP (Supplementary Table 2). 1KGP and HGDP reference populations were used together with additional reference populations to provide broader geographic coverage for African subcontinental ancestry inference (Supplementary Table 2). African reference samples were taken from a study of Bantu-speaking populations in Africa that included samples from 53 populations from east, central, south, and west Africa47. The merged and harmonized African subcontinental ancestry inference panel included 1659 reference samples and 228,033 variants.

Continental and subcontinental ancestry inference was performed via analysis of merged All of Us participant and global reference population genomic variant sets with the program Rye (Rapid Ancestry Estimation)20. Rye performs rapid and accurate genetic ancestry inference based on principal component analysis (PCA) of genomic variant data. PCA was run on the merged variant datasets using the FastPCA program implemented in PLINK version 2.0, and Rye was then run on the first 25 PCs, using the defined reference ancestry groups to assign ancestry group fractions to individual All of Us participant samples. The continuous ancestry fractions that we report here were calculated independently of the categorical ancestry predictions currently provided by the All of Us Researcher Workbench21.

All of Us participant continental ancestry fractions were visualized as admixture-style plots at the state (or territory) level using the geofacets R package48,49. Admixture entropy (\({AE}\)) was used to quantify the amount of genetic admixture for All of Us participants as previously described in refs. 40,50: \({{AE}}_{i}=-{\sum }_{j=1}^{7}{p}_{j}\log (\,{p}_{j})\), where \({p}_{j}\) is the fraction of ancestry group \(j\) for individual \(i\).

As discussed in the introduction, genetic ancestry can be defined mechanistically and operationally. We use an operational definition of genetic ancestry for All of Us participants in this study, as measured by their levels of genetic similarity with global reference population samples16,17. Accordingly, the phrase “African ancestry” is used here as shorthand for similarity to African reference population samples, “European ancestry” is used for similarity to European reference population samples, and so on. “American ancestry” refers to genetic similarity in Indigenous American reference population samples. The relative levels of similarity to different reference population groups allow us to infer percent ancestry components for All of Us participants20. The genetic ancestry results reported here are contingent upon the choice of reference populations, how these reference populations are delineated, and the method used to infer genetic similarity between All of Us participants and the reference population samples. Although reference populations are taken as surrogates for ancestral populations, it should be stressed that human populations are an idealized concept, and discrete ancestral populations did not exist, just as modern populations are not discrete. Rather, population boundaries past and present are fuzzy, and genetic ancestry does not map neatly onto clusters defined by PCA or labeled reference populations. Finally, it should be noted that reference population labels themselves, such as Bantu or Han, can convey ethno-linguistic in addition to geographic information, underscoring the fact that reference populations are often culturally delineated.

It's official: As part of President Donald Trump's roller-coaster trade war, the de minimis exemption no longer applies to packages arriving to the United States from China as of Friday, May 2. The provision previously allowed Chinese ecommerce giants like Temu, Shein, and AliExpress, as well as American companies like Amazon, to send goods valued at less than $800 to US customers duty-free.

Those same goods are now subject to tariffs as high as 145 percent. In response to the change, Shein announced it would begin adjusting prices starting on April 25. Temu, meanwhile, is currently blocking US shoppers from seeing products shipped from China, effectively narrowing the number of goods for Americans to choose from. Other retailers have started displaying tariff surcharges in their online shopping carts to help consumers make sense of where added fees are coming from.

What will the end of de minimis mean for American businesses and consumers? Will China's ecommerce giants stop shipping to the United States altogether? WIRED senior business editor Louise Matsakis and senior China writer Zeyi Yang joined chatted with readers during a Reddit AMA this week to answer these questions and many others. Here's what to know:

What's the difference between the regular tariffs and the de minimis exemption?

Trump's blanket 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports are having wide impacts on almost every industry, whereas the change to de minimis specifically hurts platforms like Temu and Shein. It's not wrong to say Temu was invented, in part, because of the de minimis exemption. It made shipping small packages directly from China affordable and fast, thus making Temu's original business model viable. With that gone, Temu will have to transition to a different business model in the US (which it has been trying already, and that's what's going on with the local warehouse products you are seeing now).

If the recent tariffs aren't removed, will Temu and other Chinese ecommerce sites eventually close down their operations in the US?

At this point, we really don't know, and Temu might not have made a decision one way or another. What we do know for now is that the American version of Temu has started showing only “local” products. But one important piece of context that might be helpful to consider is that Temu is owned by a Chinese company, Pinduoduo, which is already one of the largest online shopping platforms in China.

So unlike, say, Amazon, it doesn't need the United States to survive in the long-term, and it might be willing to walk away if the business environment becomes untenable. Pinduoduo has invested pretty heavily in Temu's American business (it has spent billions on advertising to US consumers, for example), but it wouldn't be an existential loss if it chose to pull out and focus instead on other markets.

I have heard that ports in the US are starting to receive less shipments as tariffs take full effect. How long do you think it will take for this to affect the average American consumer and brick-and-mortar stores?

We have been talking to US retailers who don't sell on ecommerce websites, meaning they have their own stores or are suppliers to Walmart, Target, etc. These companies are also freaking out because many of them have complex supply chains in China and can't easily move their manufacturing operations to other countries.

From what we've seen, retailers usually have stockpiles of inventory that should last at least the next few months in the US already. If the tariffs don't come down to an acceptable level soon, however, shortages will start to become much more apparent maybe in the summer or early fall, depending on how prepared individual stores are. US retailers of Christmas ornaments and toys, for example, are really concerned right now even though the holiday is seven months away. Perhaps December is when some American consumers will eventually find out the impacts of these policies!

Would it be possible for Trump to give an exception to Amazon for tariffs and not other retailers? Could he do this without anyone knowing?

Even if Trump were to try to spare Amazon from his tariffs, it would be pretty difficult logistically. Amazon's marketplace has millions of third-party sellers that each operate their own businesses, and they're responsible for bringing in goods to the US and clearing the customs process. But Trump could offer Amazon and other retailers tax breaks, subsidies, or other economic benefits to help offset the impacts of the tariffs. That hasn't happened yet, but there have reportedly been discussions among Trump administration officials about potentially giving American farmers subsidies.

What percentage of sellers on Amazon are importing goods from China?

It's hard to say how many Amazon sellers import things from China, but estimates suggest that more than 50 percent of Amazon's top-selling independent merchants are based in China.

Are there actually enough custom agents to verify that things imported from other countries actually didn't originate from China? If so, how will they do this?

Trump's tariffs are definitely going to stretch the capabilities of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to inspect packages and where the goods inside them originated from. The US Postal Service actually stopped accepting packages from China for about a day earlier this year because they were so overwhelmed when Trump initially tried to end de minimis overnight. His administration later delayed the policy for several weeks, giving CBP more time to prepare.

How has the tariff situation affected the actual vendors making products?

Factories in China are being hit hard by the tariffs, and some are considering laying off workers. They all want to pivot to other markets like Brazil, Russia, and the European Union, but the reality is that consumers in these regions simply don't have nearly as much disposable income as Americans do. Factories will be able to make up some of their sales, but those alternative markets are also now going to be hypercompetitive.

Small business owners say they are getting hurt because of tariffs, so who is winning here?

Honestly, we can think of very few parties that are winning here, at least right now. Even if you want to manufacture in the US, you almost certainly will need to import machinery and raw materials from either China or another country—meaning you will have to pay these new tariffs, too. One winner, perhaps, is the environment. Higher prices will likely result in people buying less, and this could be a moment when consumers start to reflect on their consumption habits. But if that happens, it will also be bad news for the US economy.

What if Chinese goods are sold to a third party (such as Canada) and then resold to the US, would Trump figure it out?

This would be an example of tariff evasion and is illegal. Going through an intermediary country in this manner is known as ""transshipment"" and it does happen from time to time, but if a manufacturer or retailer gets caught, they can be subject to pretty steep fines.

Wondering how to fix your bed frame problems? I've been leading the WIRED Reviews team coverage of the best bed frames for three years, and my experience, combined with the collective testing experience of my colleagues, has led to some interesting problems. Who knew bed frames could be so darn complicated? Not me, and certainly not before I agreed to test them.

A good mattress is important, but it only goes so far. A bed frame with problems can affect your overall sleep quality every single night. For the best sleep hygiene, you need every component of your sleep setup to be in tip-top shape. That doesn't necessarily mean spending a fortune on your bed frame or bedding, but you can get some very solid recommendations for not a ton of cash. And furthermore, we spend about a third of our lives sleeping, so it's a worthy category in which to invest. However, if you want to spruce up your existing bed frame, we're here to help.

I interviewed experts and pulled from my own expertise to help solve common bed frame problems. You might not need to buy a new one—these tips and tricks can assist with fixing squeaky frames, wobbly woodwork, and more.

Sheets might not seem like a bed frame problem, but some bed frames make sheets or mattresses slip and slide. Mike Handelsman, CEO and owner of FoamOrder, says, “We've helped a number of our clients fix what they thought were bed frame problems, only to find the real issue was between the frame and the mattress.

What he says happens is that many mattresses tend to slide around on platform beds, especially if they're foam or latex, as those don't have the same grip as heavier innerspring ones. This can be countered by using a simple nonslip mat like a rug pad between the mattress and frame. “It's cheap, it works, and it saves people from waking up halfway off the bed,” Handelsman says.

Jason Wingate, managing director at Zlumber, says a sheet strap, clip, or a product like his company's Zlumber Lock (which I am currently testing!) will help keep sheets in place. And if your bed frame is a deep platform, like mine is, a jack (which I am also testing) can help you lift up your mattress to ensure sheets are properly secured (and help get them back in place after washing them).

If your bed frame is creaking, squeaking, or otherwise noisy, a few different issues may be at play. Elissa Hall, lead designer at Awning.com, says that ”squeaking usually comes from loose joints or fittings that aren't tight enough.” Dane Collins, storage and organization specialist and CMO at Contempo Space Furniture & Design, recommends using a platform bed to eliminate wobbly connection points. He points out that ”a well-built platform bed gives you a solid, unmoving surface for your mattress and requires no box spring or slats.”

And Tony Hoang, owner of What a Room, says that a wood frame that uses “old-school joinery” can prevent these noises. We at WIRED like Thuma bed frames for this very reason. But he says, “If you already have a squeaker, swap metal-to-metal contact points for felt washers. Slide them between joints. Add beeswax or even bar soap to threads before tightening. It's cheap. It works.”

Alex Smith, manager and co-owner of Render3DQuick.com, says he's seen creaking caused by poorly matched fasteners. “A client had a custom wood platform bed that looked beautiful but made noise with every shift in movement,"" he says. “The problem was that the screws and bolts were different metal types, so they reacted to changes in humidity and temperature. That caused the joints to loosen slightly, even if everything looked solid during assembly.” Smith says he replaced all the fasteners with stainless steel hardware, applying beeswax to the contact points before tightening, which both stabilized the frame and eliminated the noise without changing the design.

If squeaking is the issue, there are some simple solutions to look into as well. Aaron Masterson, president of Local Furniture Outlet, says that “if the rails are connected via bolts, this usually means they are constantly getting loose.” He suggests using Loctite with a lock washer to solve the problem. And if your frame doesn't have washers and instead uses a hook-on system, there may be “play” (or wiggle room) between the headboard receiver and hook. He suggests using plumber's tape to wrap the pins, which will reduce that wiggle room. And if the space is bigger between the wood of the rail and the leg of the headboard, you can glue thin wood spacers to the end of the rails to make up the difference. Finally, he says, “If you aren't handy or [don't] have the proper tools, cardboard could do the same trick, but you may have to add some more in a few months as it starts [to] compress.”

Hall points out that older wooden models ”frequently require more support or stabilization than basic maintenance can provide.” She recommends adding silicone washers between the metal components, or wrapping the points of connection in plumber's tape, which can help dampen the noise and soak up vibrations.

Furthermore, Handelsman points out that sometimes your mattress can amplify your bed frame noise. “A firmer foam mattress can transfer every movement into the frame,” he says. He recommends adding a thin foam layer between slats or joints to help quiet things down.

Hoang adds that if your bed slats are rubbing the inner rail (“This one drives people nuts”), you can “take weather stripping foam, the kind from window insulation kits, and line the edge where the slats sit. It cushions the friction, absorbs sound, and stabilizes the base. Bonus: less frame movement means longer mattress life.”

And finally, Wingate points out that sometimes, a bed frame has run its course. He says a weak frame can be disastrous. If the screws are all tightened down and your bed frame still feels precarious, it may ultimately be time to replace it.

Collins says that center support failures are “particularly common in queen and king beds.” Inadequate center support can cause sagging and mattress damage, and he says this can be solved with a platform bed that helps to distribute mattress weight evenly across the frame.

When it comes to slat displacement, Collins recommends a locking slat system, which “prevents displacement while maintaining proper mattress ventilation.” Some bed frames use Velcro as a locking method, and it's a good idea to check every so often to ensure slats haven't shifted around, cracked, or broken.

Smith says he's come across sag, especially in wider beds like king or California king models. Rather than many thin, widely spaced slats made from a soft wood such as pine, he recommends using fewer, thicker slats made from a more rigid wood such as beechwood. A center support beam with legs can help support mattresses as well.

Charlie Hughes, co-owner of Contractor Nerd, says, “One of the most common bed frame problems I've run into, both personally and professionally, is slats falling out. We once had this issue at home for months. Seriously, at least once a week, we were lifting the mattress and putting the slats back in because they kept sliding off. Eventually, I got sick of it.”

He suggests using clear plastic knobs that snap into the middle beam to keep slats in place. Your bed frame may have even come with them, and if not, you can check stores like Ikea or order these knobs online. “If this isn't an option,"" he says, ""you can order a pack of silicone furniture pads from Amazon.“ He advises to “Just stick them where the slats rest on the frame, and the added grip stops them from sliding around. The cool thing is that these pads are multipurpose, and you can use them pretty much on any piece of furniture to reduce the friction and noise.”

Hall says sometimes bed frames scratch hardwood floors, which is especially evident in rental properties or houses where furniture is regularly swapped out. While felt pads may seem like a good solution, they can move around. She recommends rubber gripper furniture cups on bed frame feet, which helps to fix slipping as well as distribute weight evenly to prevent damage to the floor.

If your headboard is causing wall damage, Smith says you can consider using wall bumpers. He's placed small wooden blocks wrapped in felt behind the headboard to protect the wall without being an eyesore or causing permanent damage to the surrounding space.

And if you're constantly running into the corners on your bed frame, consider getting some corner bumpers. No more stubbed toes!

If your room is small, a bed frame can take up a significant chunk of space. Collins says beds can be used for storage. Consider using a bed with drawers (I'm currently testing this model), or a footboard or headboard that has storage. You can also opt for a raised bed frame like this model, which has enough space underneath for 18-gallon totes.

A few years ago, I had the chance to check out the prototype of a reengineered robot vacuum called Matic. It doesn't look like any other robot vacuum. The founders, Mehul Nariyawala and Navneet Dalal, had one key insight: People don't care about super-powerful robot vacuums with cool tricks, incredible suction power, and huge docking stations, especially if it means that the vacuum is noisy, loud, or annoying to operate.

For a robot vacuum to clean well, it has to be able to navigate a home like a human. That prompted a switch to the Nvidia Jetson Orin chip, which means the vacuum learns how to clean your house on its own. Combined with the fundamentally different hardware design, the result is a game-changing robot vacuum. I do not use that phrase lightly (or ever, really). It's delightful. It is effective and an absolute pleasure to use, something I can't say about most robot vacuums. This is the best robot vacuum I've ever tested.

When the Matic arrived, my husband and kids didn't even wait for me to open the box. The vacuum rolled out of its box with a little message on the display: “Hello, So Family!” (Unfortunately, their haste meant I didn't get a video of their reaction, which was very sweet.)

The Matic doesn't look like any of the mostly identical robot vacuums that arrive in a constant stream at my house. It's white and square, with rounded corners, and 8 inches high to accommodate a small water tank and a very unusual waste bag. Matic's waste bag is emblematic of the thoughtfulness that has gone into solving all the common robot vacuum problems. It has diaper salts to house both wet and dry materials. This means you don't have to empty a dirty water tank and destroy your laundry room sink (not that I'm speaking from experience).

It's clear, so you can see exactly how full it is, and there's also a HEPA filter in the bag so you don't have to remember to replace the HEPA filters separately on the vacuum. (My husband frequently uses a handheld vacuum on the robot vacuum's filters and replaces them, but I don't endorse this practice.) Rethinking this simple accessory—a mere afterthought, for most robot vacuums—makes my life so much easier.

The vacuum has six RGB infrared cameras on the front, top, and back, which means that it can see in color and in darkness—you don't have to have all the lights on for it to work, unlike a robot vacuum that uses basic optical sensors. It took a few minutes to map my home. The app is incredible. It's a weirdly accurate 3D rendering of my home, differentiating not only the floor surfaces but also furniture and items several feet up.

The app has several buttons that you can toggle. You can change the rendering style to make the map less visually cluttered; you can use a joystick to control the vacuum manually; you can switch to an “airplane mode” to “fly” through your house at eye level, instead of at floor level; and you can record video if you have errors to send to Matic's team.

The Matic uses what it calls long-term SLAM, or absolute mapping, which is in contrast to most vacuums that navigate via relative mapping, involving a variety of sensors and navigation systems to place walls and obstacles relative to each other. But Matic sees pretty much like a person and makes a mental map. Just like how a visitor to your home can enter through the back door, exit, and then come through the kitchen door, without becoming utterly baffled, Matic doesn't get confused.

You can even pick the Matic up and place it anywhere you like in your house, and it will know where it is and how to get to the dock. You can see it flying in the dock while it's being carried, if you're watching in the app while your husband is doing it. Also, all the mapping data and analysis is streamed locally from your app to the vacuum and is confined to your devices, so you won't see pictures of your butt on Facebook.

Speaking of husbands, you can also click Add Another User in the settings to easily add a family member to the app and vacuum. No more getting texts while I'm away at a work conference to please run the vacuum in the kitchen!

The joystick in the app is fine, but it's not as responsive as a gaming joystick—I just bash the vacuum into things when I try to use it. Instead, I prefer to use my finger to zoom and draw on the map. For example, my husband spilled a bunch of Campari on the floor in the kitchen. I just opened the map, clicked on Clean Area, then Mop. The Matic went straight for it.

You can also teach the vacuum how to get around obstacles. For example, our dining room table is extremely hard for pretty much every robot vacuum to clean around because there are so many different table and chair legs, but under the table also gets dirty, because my children are messy eaters. Instead of putting all the chairs on the table, I can pull the chairs out, click Clean Area, and watch the vacuum sort its way through the table legs. If you can see the way in but the vacuum can't, you can tap Go Here to an opening on the map, and Matic will figure out how to get the rest of the way in on its own.

Programming automatic learning and graceful failure into the vacuum's navigation system is amazing. So many robot vacuums can't figure out how to get around a corner or table leg and just cry for help until they're rescued or the battery dies, which is the most annoying thing on Earth.

Because it's an absolute map, it's pretty easy to add new spaces. I have a room that I block off with a pet gate to keep the dogs out, and you can tell the vacuum to go there, and it will add it seamlessly to the map—you don't have to constantly remap your entire house as you add rooms.

That's in addition to seamlessly adhering to the regularly scheduled vacuum and mopping, the standard by which I evaluate almost every robot vacuum. The Matic identified a “stair” all on its own—the ledge by the fireplace where every other “smart” robot vacuum gets trapped. It cleans in a three-step process. First, it cleans the general area; then it does an edging pass; and finally, it cleans the toe kicks—the little areas under the sink or oven that make space for your toes. No vacuum has ever succeeded in thoroughly cleaning the sink toe kicks before! Despite these thorough passes, it doesn't take that much longer to clean—around an hour to vacuum my 12 by 15-foot living room and about two hours to vacuum and mop my 24 by 28-foot kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room space.

It's the only robot vacuum that's quiet enough that I can run it while my kids are watching TV, which is important because they leave potato chip crumbs all over the place. Their comfort levels with the vac could also be because it came with several sets of stickers to give it a face, so my children have also developed a sort of weird, Wall-E type relationship with it.

Matic Robot Vacuum

All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.

This robot vacuum has a comparatively low suction power of 3,200 Pa—even the cheapest robot vacuum I've tested recently has a higher suction power, with high-end ones going as high as 20,000 Pa. But the Matic has made me rethink why anyone even needs that much suction. It's not like I expect any robot vacuum to dig that deep into my carpet fibers. It's so quiet and efficient that I end up filling the waste bag just as quickly as with a regular vacuum, and I never skip cleanings because it gets lost or stuck or it's too loud.

Even the accessories are thoughtful. For example, it comes with a little plumber's snake if the tube gets clogged. It hasn't happened so far, but this inclusion is genius, because I've been using a chopstick to do this for years without even thinking about it. Finally, it's much more reasonably priced than any other robot vacuum with this level of functionality, even if I can fill up a waste bag in about three days instead of the projected week. (I blame dogs and kids, not the Matic, for our general filth levels.)

There are a lot of features the Matic doesn't have, including fairly basic ones like dirt detection and gesture and voice controls. Annoyingly, you have to tidy your house up a bit before you clean—while the Matic recognizes pieces bigger than 1 inch as obstacles to avoid, it will vacuum up my son's Lego blocks if I leave those out. Nariyawala noted in an email, however, that these features should be arriving as software updates in the coming months, and I'll retest the Matic once they do.

I'm already reluctant to replace it to test other vacuums. Forget the robotic arm and the huge docking station. Just give me a small, cute, quiet robot vacuum that doesn't take up a ton of space, is adorable and extremely quiet, does everything I tell it to do easily, can learn for itself, knows when it's flying, and also costs less than a third of what other top-of-the-line vacuums cost. What more could you ask for? Give me three!

The first-ever CMF Phone 1, which cost a mere $239, easily bested every other smartphone in its category last year (even some pricier peers) despite being a new player on the scene. Now, the company is doing it again with the $279 CMF Phone 2 Pro. This is the best budget phone, period.

CMF is the low-cost sub-brand of Nothing, a UK-based tech company with its own fun Nothing Phones that don't look like any other smartphone you've ever used. CMF has had a steady drip of affordable but stylish personal gadgets, from smartwatches to earbuds, but its budget smartphone is where things shine. Cheap phones get better every year—Motorola's $300 Moto G Power 2025 has a gorgeous design and includes wireless charging—but CMF goes a step further in three crucial areas: performance, cameras, and software.

The CMF Phone 2 Pro doesn't look anything like its price, with a glass-like frosted texture on the light green back and a metal frame (it also comes in white, black, and orange). It's impressively thin at 7.8 mm despite stuffing a 5,000-mAh battery capacity, though this is without the backplate accessory (more on this in a minute).

Over on the front, you're treated to a 6.77-inch AMOLED screen, which still isn't very common on sub-$300 phones—AMOLED offers punchier colors and deeper blacks. (Motorola's competing phone has an LCD.) Brightness hasn't been an issue for me, with a peak of 3,000 nits in certain conditions. And rounding it up is a 120-Hz adaptive refresh rate for smoother animations and gameplay. That's a winning trio of features that make for an impressive screen for the money.

Battery life has been excellent. The 5,000-mAh cell routinely has lasted a full day, and on busier days, I've been surprised to find it sitting with 40 percent left in the tank before bedtime. You can easily take it into a second day without issue. Sadly, there's no wireless charging, though the only phone with that feature in this price bracket is the Moto G Power.

Most impressive is the performance, thanks to the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro 5G chipset, paired with 8 GB of RAM. Everything runs smoothly, from juggling various apps to games like Pako Forever. I've only noticed occasional hiccups in the camera when taking a photo. I want to emphasize this: performance is incredible for a $279 smartphone. One of my criticisms of Motorola's latest Moto G Power was that it felt sluggish, and most phones under $300 will act this way. Not so with the CMF Phone 2 Pro.

The CMF Phone 2 Pro has a triple-camera system, and the third camera isn't some silly 2-megapixel macro sensor like on most cheap phones. You're getting a proper, versatile camera array usually found on pricier devices, with a 50-MP main camera, a 50-MP telephoto camera with 2X optical zoom, and an 8-MP ultrawide. There's a 16-MP selfie camera on the front.

These sensors can struggle in high-contrast scenes, like when you have bright highlights on a sunny day mixed with shadowy areas—things can blow out a bit. In low light, you have to stay still to avoid a blurry image. But overall, I've been happy with the photos out of this system, which have been detailed and colorful. I tend to use telephoto cameras over ultrawides, so I'm excited to see it here, and I hope this trend expands to other budget phones.

One of my gripes with the original CMF Phone 1, the lack of NFC, has been resolved. With the near-field communication sensor in tow, you can pay with the Phone 2 Pro via Google Wallet. It also comes with 256 GB of storage, another rarity even compared to midrange phones, complete with a microSD card slot to expand space when you need it.

A big, often overlooked part of budget smartphones is the software. Many come with preloaded apps and games that bog down the whole experience. There's none of this tomfoolery in Nothing OS. I'd argue that Nothing's Android layer is more beautiful than the stock Android found on competing devices, with gorgeous widgets and a thoughtful monochrome home screen.

CMF has brought over Nothing's Essential Key, which debuted on the recent Nothing Phone (3a) series. This physical key activates Essential Space, an app that lets you store screenshots and audio clippings and uses artificial intelligence to extrapolate useful information in the form of to-do lists and suggestions. I don't take many screenshots, but I like the ability to press and hold the button to activate a voice memo—the app makes quick work of transcribing your voice note.

Best of all is software support. CMF promises six years of security updates and three Android OS upgrades, which is only bested by Samsung's latest Galaxy A series phones—they get a blanket six years of support in software and operating system updates. Motorola only this year decided to offer two Android OS updates to its Moto G smartphones, with three years of security updates.

So what's up with the four screws on the back, and that rounded corner? Remove these with a screwdriver—and the circular Accessory Point with your fingers—and you can add different colored back plates like on the original CMF Phone 1.

There's only one back plate this time around, but it has magnets inside, allowing you to attach CMF's magnetic wallet/kickstand combo accessory to the back of the phone, and you can also use the phone with third-party MagSafe accessories (it just won't support any wireless charging functionality). I've enjoyed popping this phone onto my MagSafe car dock for navigation.

You also need this back plate to use CMF's other new accessory: modular lenses. With the back plate attached, you can push in a fisheye or macro lens to the main camera to get a super wide-angle picture or an extreme close-up. The resulting photos from both are great, and add even more versatility to the camera system, though I wish CMF provided a pouch or some other way to carry these lenses. Remember, you need the back plate to attach these lenses to the Phone 2 Pro.

The Accessory Point is the rounded circle on the right corner edge of the phone, and this is where you can attach accessories like a lanyard. What's confounding is that the lanyard is the only Phone 1 accessory that will work on the Phone 2 Pro. You can't use the other accessories, and even the CMF Phone 1 back plates are not interchangeable with the Phone 2 Pro. If you're going to create a modular accessory system, why wouldn't you ensure compatibility with subsequent devices?

But here's the rub: Nothing says it will not sell any of the new accessories in the US. A Nothing spokesperson told me this is unrelated to tariffs, but that accessories are available in limited quantities only in the UK and Europe. (I've looked at the UK version of Nothing's site, and none of the accessories are available for purchase.) That's a huge bummer because it makes the whole modularity of the Phone 2 Pro—from the interchangeable lenses to the swappable back plates—useless. Maybe keep an eye out for third-party accessories on Etsy.

The only other major downside is network compatibility in the US. I've had zero problems using the CMF Phone 2 Pro on Google Fi (powered by T-Mobile's network), but spotty band support suggests there might be some limited 5G connectivity. The accessories are fun, if a bit gimmicky, so not having them available isn't a huge loss. Network compatibility, on the other hand, is a bigger deal. You'll likely have the best experience on T-Mobile or one of its mobile virtual network operators, like Mint or Metro by T-Mobile, but your mileage will vary. Nothing says it's the same band support as the Phone (3a) series, so you probably have to contact AT&T and Verizon to whitelist the device for 5G to work.

If you want to give it a try, the CMF Phone 2 Pro's value is unmatched. Sure, it doesn't have wireless charging or an IP68 water resistance rating like Motorola's Moto G Power, but it's much more pleasant to use with its slick software and speedy performance, and it introduces a 2X optical camera to the budget market, something I've wanted for a long time.

Google's annual I/O developer conference is coming up on May 20—and all signs point to it being a big one.

It's where we typically learn everything new coming to Android, Google's Gemini artificial intelligence assistant, and all of the company's other platforms, from Wear OS to Android Auto. But this week, Google announced a virtual event called The Android Show: I/O Edition, which takes place a week earlier, on May 13 at 10 am Pacific (1 pm ET). A teaser video showed Google's Sameer Samat, president of the Android ecosystem, getting ready on camera and announcing the show.

The Android Show will likely explore all the new features coming to Android 16, the next version of Google's mobile operating system. However, this break from the traditional process of announcing all the latest in Android at I/O suggests that the conference on May 20 will be jam-packed with news in other areas and services.

Last year, Android took a backseat to Gemini-related capabilities as pressure mounted for Google to show its answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT. This year, we'll likely see features related to personal context in Gemini—the assistant's ability to understand you through past conversations and your connected Google services like Gmail and Calendar. It's also widely expected that we'll learn more about Google's Android XR, and maybe get an update on the company's upcoming smart glasses.

The direct-to-consumer company Rad Power Bikes, which more or less created the entire DTC electric bike category and dominated it for years, has struggled recently, from layoffs and lawsuits to the recent quiet exit of its new CEO and an onslaught of tariffs. In this chaotic environment, the company has announced three new updates to its best-selling ebikes: the RadRunner, the RadRunner Plus, and the new RadRunner Max.

The RadRunner and RadRunner Plus are the company's two popular utility bikes (I see a half-dozen every day while biking around Portland, Oregon) and upgrades to the line will include safety features like Rad Power's Safe Shield, which debuted last year (the cells in the battery are now encapsulated, like in a car, to make it safer in the unlikely event of a battery fire). They will also include other upgrades, like passcode protection and IPX6 weather protection.

The most exciting launch is the RadRunner Max, now the high-end RadRunner model, which is a Class 3 electric bike. It's pedal-assist only, with a top speed of 28 mph. It has 60 miles of range and works with Apple's Find My network, so you can track if it's stolen, no AirTag needed. A new digital key unlocks the bike as you approach, and radar features alert you when cars or other bikes approach. The company also debuted a new range extender compatible with all three models. The RadRunner is available for $1,499, and the RadRunner Plus is $1,799. You can preorder the RadRunner Max for $2,299 and the Range Extender for $249 for delivery in early May. —Adrienne So

Yale, known for its smart locks (and regular locks, too), has announced a new version of its Assure Lock 2 tied to a deep partnership with home security brand ADT. It brings a new kind of Z-Wave technology into play.

Z-Wave is a wireless communication protocol that allows smart home devices to communicate with one another. You might have heard of Matter, the increasingly common standard that wants to make all smart home devices work on all major smart home ecosystems. Z-Wave came before, but doesn't connect straight to the internet, instead using radio frequency and a smart home hub to keep Internet of Things devices connected locally. It's employed more in smart home enthusiast circles and home security systems, and thought it's not a part of the Matter standard, the company is looking to change that.

That brings us to the new Assure Lock 2 Touch from Yale and ADT, which uses the Z-Wave User Credential Command Class. It's designed to work in tandem with ADT's security service and allows you to disarm the entire system with a fingerprint. The vision is simple: Unlock the Yale Assure Lock 2 with your unlocking method of choice (code, fingerprint, physical key), and it not only opens your front door, but also knows that it's safe to disarm your security system.

The lock relies on Z-Wave but also needs to be synced to an ADT+ base for this to work. That means your home has to be decked out in ADT's security system, and everything works through the ADT+ app. You can set up the system yourself with ADT+ Self Setup, or get a professional installer. The new lock is available now on ADT's website for $280. You'll need at least one month of ADT Pro monitoring, which starts at $25 a month. —Nena Farrell

Color E Ink screens are increasingly common nowadays—we have color Kindles, color digital notebooks like the ReMarkable Paper Pro, and now color E Ink PC monitors. That's the latest announcement from Boox, maker of e-readers and digital notebooks. The Mira Pro is a 25.3-inch screen that looks like paper, with a color E Ink Kaleido 3 panel. The company already sells a monochrome Mira Pro, but this is the first color variant.

Boox claims the glare-free screen is easier on the eyes and is suitable for “tasks that demand color differentiation,” like analyzing color-coded dashboards. There's an adjustable front light so you can keep reading even in dim ambient light settings. Watching a video on an E Ink screen sounds painful, but the company says the Mira Pro is powered by Boox Super Refresh technology. This supposedly boosts refresh rates and eliminates ghosting—you can set modes for reading, typing, browsing, or watching videos, and the monitor will adjust the refresh speed for the best experience.

You have several ways to connect it—HDMI, Mini HDMI, USB-Type C, or Display Port—and Boox says it works with various operating systems, from macOS to Android. The monitor will cost you a pretty penny, though, as it starts at $1,900.

You know you've hit peak AI when your shaver wants to talk to you. Philips Norelco's new i9000 Prestige Ultra shaver offers a flexing head, a triad of rotating ""NanoTech"" blades, and what Philips touts as AI-powered technology to track and offer real-time feedback on the pressure you use when you shave, and even how you're moving your shaver.

In practice, this means an LED ring around the shaver will light up in different colors to let you know whether you're getting your ideal shave, and if you'd like, you can even track your performance over time in Philips' phone app. The “ideal shave” can be customized among five different modes depending on whether you shave wet or dry, and whether you're the sensitive sort. Also, your shaver's screen will greet you with a ""good morning” message if it's morning, and call you by your name if you'd like. All of this whizzbangery is put to service in achieving what Philips Norelco is calling the “world's first root level shave,” lifting hairs from below the surface. I feel like this is a claim I've heard before, but from early testing, I can vouch that it's quite a smooth shave. That said, it costs $329. —Matthew Korfhage

Wiz has a new HDMI Sync Box with TV Backlight that adds Hue-like smart lighting to your big screen. Plug your gaming console, streaming stick, or set-top box into the back and enhance your entertainment with synced lighting that matches the colors and intensity of the onscreen action. Your TV doesn't even need to be on, because you can use the Wiz app to set the color and brightness for background lighting or enable the microphone in the box to sync with music.

If this reminds you of the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box, that's likely because Wiz is the budget sibling to Philips Hue—both brands are owned by the parent company Signify. True to form, the Wiz system is way cheaper than the Philips Hue version without any obvious compromises (to my eye). The only thing that pops out is the HDMI 2.0 spec, meaning video inputs top out at 4K and 60 Hz, though HDR10+ and Dolby Vision are supported. The latest, updated version of the Hue system supports 8K at 60 Hz and 4K at 120 Hz, for PS5 and Xbox Series X gamers.

While there's no camera required, the downside to these systems is that they don't work with smart TV apps and can only sync content via HDMI. But what makes the new Wiz HDMI Sync Box with TV Backlight intriguing is the price. It costs $90 for TVs between 55 and 65 inches, compared to $350 for the equivalent Hue system. There's a larger backlight for TVs 75 to 85 inches for $110. Wiz also offers Gradient Light Bars ($60) and a new Gradient Floor Light ($89) that can sync up with the box and bring your whole room to life. All these gadgets will be available this month. —Simon Hill

Google's most expensive AI model seems to have crossed a major milestone: Beating a 29-year-old video game.

Last night, Google CEO Sundar Pichai posted triumphantly on X, “What a finish! Gemini 2.5 Pro just completed Pokémon Blue!”

To be clear, the Gemini Plays Pokemon livestream was created by (in his own words) “a 30 year old software engineer unaffiliated with Google” who goes by Joel Z. But Google executives have been cheering the effort on.

For example, Logan Kilpatrick, the product lead for Google AI Studio, posted last month that Gemini was “making great progress at completing Pokémon” and had “earned its 5th badge (next best model only has 3 so far, though with a different agent harness),” leading Pichai to joke, “We are working on API, Artificial Pokémon Intelligence:)”

Why Pokémon? Back in February, Anthropic highlighted progress that its Claude AI models were making in “Pokémon Red,” writing that Claude's “extended thinking and agent training” gives it “a major boost” on “more unexpected” tasks, like playing a classic game. (“Pokémon Red” and “Blue” are different versions of a GameBoy title first released in 1996 and tied to the long-running Pokémon franchise). There's even a Claude Plays Pokemon Twitch channel that Joel Z cited as an inspiration.

Despite its progress, Claude does not appear to have beaten “Pokémon Red” yet. Does that mean Gemini is objectively better at the game? On his Twitch page, Joel Z urged viewers, “Please don't consider this a benchmark for how well an LLM can play Pokemon. You can't really make direct comparisons — Gemini and Claude have different tools and receive different information.”

And both AI models need help to play the game — that's where the aforementioned agent harnesses come in, providing the models with game screenshots overlaid with additional information, allowing the model to decide how to respond (which may involve calling specialized agents), and then pressing the button that corresponds with the AI's instruction.

Joel Z acknowledged that there were other “dev interventions” to help Gemini complete the game, but insisted that it's not cheating.

“My interventions improve Gemini's overall decision-making and reasoning abilities,” he says. “I don't give specific hints — there are no walkthroughs or direct instructions for particular challenges like Mt. Moon. The only thing that comes even close is letting Gemini know that it needs to talk to a Rocket Grunt twice to obtain the Lift Key, which was a bug that was later fixed in Pokemon Yellow.”

Plus, he said, “Gemini Plays Pokémon is still actively being developed, and the framework continues to evolve.”

For as long as there have been video games, there have been people willing to find ways to cheat. Hobbyists have long dedicated themselves to finding vulnerabilities in games, often with the goal of developing cheats that they could share or sell. But ever since online competitive gaming became a legitimate profession, that hobby-hacking has morphed into an entire industry that aims to sell an unfair advantage to those willing to pay.

Developing and selling video game cheats can be a lucrative business, and video game developers have in recent years had to beef up their anti-cheat teams, whose mission is to ban cheaters, neutralize the software they use, as well as go after cheat developers. More companies are taking the somewhat controversial step of deploying anti-cheat systems that run at the kernel level, meaning they have the highest privileges in the operating system and can potentially monitor everything that happens on the machine the game is run on.

One of the most prominent kernel-level anti-cheat systems is Vanguard, developed by Riot Games, which makes popular titles such as multiplayer online battle arena game League of Legends and online first-person shooter Valorant. 

Essentially, Vanguard “forces cheats to be visible,” said Phillip Koskinas, the director and head of anti-cheat at Riot who describes himself as “an anti-cheat artisan” who was “put on this earth for the one singular purpose of banning cheaters from online video games.”. 

Thanks to Vanguard and the anti-cheat team led by Koskinas,  Riot bans thousands of cheaters on Valorant every day, according to a chart shared with TechCrunch. 

Riot's efforts seem to be working. As of early 2025, the percentage of Valorant “ranked” games — meaning competitive matches — that have cheaters is now less than 1% globally, the company says.

In an interview with TechCrunch, Koskinas detailed the various strategies that the anti-cheat team at Riot uses to fight cheaters and cheat developers: leveraging the security features in the Windows operating system, fingerprinting cheaters' hardware to stop them from reoffending, infiltrating cheat communities, and playing psychological games in an effort to discredit cheaters.

Much of Koskinas and his team's efforts stem from Vanguard having the deepest level of access to a gamer's computer. To weed out cheaters, Vanguard takes advantage of some of the security features already built into Windows. 

First, Koskinas explained, the anti-cheat software “almost universally” enforces some of Windows' most important security features, such as Trusted Platform Module, a hardware-based security component, and Secure Boot. These two technologies check if a computer has been modified or tampered with, such as by malware or a cheat, and prevents it from booting if so. Then, Vanguard checks that all of the computer's hardware drivers, which allow the operating system to communicate with the hardware, are up to date to identify additional hardware that can enable cheating. Finally, Vanguard prevents cheats from loading and executing code in the kernel's memory. 

“Basically, all the security features that Microsoft and hardware manufacturers have leveraged to protect the operating system, we use or enforce,” Koskinas told TechCrunch. “We have to have a playground where we can play. We have to enforce a certain level of security.”

But fighting cheaters is not just about technology; it's also about understanding the cheaters themselves and how they operate.

Koskinas's team has a “reconnaissance arm,” he said, whose primary responsibility is to obtain and catalog threats, which sometimes involves acquiring cheats. The team obtains cheats in part by using sock puppet identities that have infiltrated cheater and cheat developer communities for years, akin to undercover operations.

“We've even gone as far as giving anti-cheat information to establish credibility. We'll masquerade as though it was something we [reverse engineered], and explain how an anti-cheat technique works to demonstrate that we know stuff,” said Koskinas. “And then leverage our way into something in development, and then sit there until it launches, allow it to acquire users and then ban everybody.”

Some cheat developers try to stay undetected by only selling to a few customers, essentially marketing their product as high-end, or “premium” cheats, as Koskinas calls them. These premium cheats can cost thousands of dollars, and are sold to only a handful of customers, said Koskinas. 

Cheat makers use this strategy to reduce the risk of selling to a Riot undercover employee, but also to customers who will be more careful about blatant cheating and exposing the cheat.

These developers are essentially selling “the reputation of being undetected,” said Koskinas. One of Riot's anti-cheat team's “strongest weapons,” he said, is discrediting cheat developers publicly by, for example, banning all their players, or leaking screenshots showing they are inside their Discord channels. 

“We can just make them look like fools,” he said.

Koskinas and his team also have to be careful not to come down too hard. By letting a little cheating happen, within reason, Riot can slow down gamers from getting better cheats. “If we hit every player every time, they will just change cheats until they find the one that isn't detected,” he said. 

“To keep cheating dumb, we ban slower,” he added.

To stop repeat offenders, Vanguard can “fingerprint” the hardware that a cheater uses — effectively uniquely identifying their device — to make it harder for that player to obtain a new cheat and continue cheating.In a more psychological strategy, Koskinas and his colleagues also troll cheaters publicly by calling them, among other things, “a brainless pathogen,” who have an “inability to get good at this video game.”

Thanks to all these techniques and strategies, most cheaters can now be roughly divided into two categories. The first, representing the majority of cheaters, is made up by those who are “rage cheating” by using cheap tools that are easy to detect. Riot employees sarcastically call these cheats “download-a-ban,” according to Koskinas. 

“A lot of cheaters, if you think about it, they're kind of young,” he said. “A lot of them haven't grown up yet. The way they engage with games is by cheating, and a lot of that behavior is like the power you feel when you do it.”

“They're going to come back, they're going to get banned, and they're just going to do that every weekend for the next two to three years… And then, eventually they'll hit puberty, and that'll hopefully do,” Koskinas said, smiling.

The second category comprises those few who use premium cheats that are harder to detect. These tools are known as “external” cheats, Koskinas explains, because they depend on using actual hardware, not just software.

One type of external cheat relies on a direct memory access (DMA) attack. DMA cheats require players to use specialized hardware — think high-speed PCI Express cards — that exfiltrates all of Valorant‘s memory to a separate computer that can scrutinize the game on dedicated hardware, outside of the purview of Vanguard. 

By doing this, the cheater's separate computer can be used to identify other players; in-game objects like walls, ammunition and weapons; and identify precisely where players and items are in the map. This can also include objects that are not visible to gamers. Then, using the firmware installed on the cards, the cheat creates a radar on a second screen that they can look at to spot rival players — even if they are hidden — to gain an unfair advantage.

A more advanced version of this type of cheat, according to Koskinas, relies on HDMI fusers, which overlay what's read by the separate computer back on the cheater's main screen. This way, the cheater doesn't have to look between computer displays to see where their opponents are, letting them focus on the display they are playing the game with. 

These techniques allow the cheater to see through walls — known as “wallhacks” — and grant what is referred to as “extra-sensory perception,” essentially superpowers within the game. 

“I think we detect the majority of it today, but it's kind of iterative,” said Koskinas.

Then there are screen reader cheats, where a computer's HDMI output is sent to a second computer that detects and classifies what is on the game's display, such as the head of an opponent player. The second computer then sends back an instruction to an Arduino mini-computer for controlling robotics, for example, which is connected to the cheater's mouse and lets the player automatically aim at other players — a type of cheat known as an “aimbot.” As Koskinas put it, “basically the mouse, for all intents and purposes, is being governed by a machine.”

If the cheat performs well, it can be hard to detect, but Koskinas said that in the long run, the cheater “doesn't look like a human player” because of how accurate they are aiming and shooting at their rivals.

“You have to humanize [the cheat] to a degree where the advantage is imperceptible from what a human can do,” said Koskinas. “And once you're there, you're not really cheating enough to make it worth it for most users.”

Even then, this technique is popular, Koskinas concedes. The downside is that it requires a potentially expensive second PC with a fast graphics processor to quickly classify what's happening on the screen and send the instructions back.

Koskinas says he often worries about the use of AI for screen classification, to learn what human inputs look like, and how to reproduce them. 

“That's already here,” he said. “Especially in Valorant with those bright outlines, you can almost do it with just an algorithm […] You could just actually discreetly say if the percentage of this box is enough purple, press the fire key.” For context, characters in Valorant have distinct and vivid color schemes.

Despite the security and privacy risks associated with anti-cheat technology having kernel-level access, Riot has no plans to move away from its approach for its anti-cheat engine, at least for Valorant. Otherwise, it would make it too easy for cheaters to use kernel exploits, according to Koskinas. 

In general, Koskinas is trying to be more transparent about Riot's anti-cheat efforts, including publishing several blog posts on how the company goes after cheaters, as well as talking to journalists. The idea, he said, is that because Riot has “the most invasive anti-cheat by asking people to have a service running at all times,” players deserve to know how the company is using that privilege.

“The best thing I feel like we can do in asking for that level of access and being around like that, is being as transparent about the opacity as we can,” said Koskinas. 

“We're not telling you what's under the hood, but we'll tell you almost anything else,” he said.

The purpose of food labels is to increase safety, transparency and honesty around the contents of food. Companies who oppose safety, transparency or honesty and/or produce products with questionable contents will oppose labels and companies who support safety, transparency and honesty will support them. I don't know many end-consumers who oppose labels themselves. But they will oppose products that contain questionable ingredients, so transparency is bad for companies that produce those products.

I think that view underscores the differences in approach and beliefs in the US and Europe (not that both views aren't represented on both sides of the Atlantic, just distributed differently). The European frequently have the view: Prove to us that this is not dangerous. Otherwise we prefer not taking the chance that you might be wrong. The US version in our eyes is frequently: ""You can't prove it's not safe"".In this case you could risk introducing even worse diseases, who have previous been kept in check by the competition from the viruses you're now eliminating.

There's an economic reward for keeping the pigs healthy enough to be harvested while spending the least amount of money on their environment. If this lowers the threshold for ""healthy enough"", or allows them to survive in an even worse, cheaper to maintain environment, that could introduce or exacerbate human health risks even if this change itself cannot.There is also the animal welfare element, that has resonance to a lot of people. I am by no means a vegetarian, do not in principle object to killing animals for food. But the sheer scale of animal suffering in our food system gives me pause. I am reluctant to accept innovations that would allow us to increase the degree of suffering in exchange for an increase in output or decrease in price.

Just a thought from me, as European, in case someone asks  for the thinking behind strict import EU rules:We just don't want to eat things that we believe may cause (abstract) harm, and, sorts of liability of the state and society to care for you and (God beware) your kids if some adverse effects are pinpointed to food/imports or misregulation. I think it's ok like that.

Yeah, we've been solving this over and over in different ways. For those saying that iframes are good enough, they're not. Iframes don't expand to fit content. And server side solutions require a server. Why not have a simple client side method for this? I think it's a valid question. Now that we're fixing a lot of the irritation in web development, it seems worth considering.

Markdown can't do most of those, so it makes more sense why it doesn't have includes, but I'd still argue it definitely should. I generally dislike LaTeX, but about the only thing I liked about it when writing my thesis was that I could have each chapter in its own file and just include all of them in the main file.

As I wrote that, I realized there could be cumulative layout shift, so that's an argument against. To avoid that, the browser would have to download all transcluded content before rendering. In the past, this would have been a dealbreaker, but maybe it's more feasible now with http multiplexing.[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion#Client-side_HTM...

Sure the idea was to cache those separately, but come on — frames and caching are meant to solve two different problems and by munching them together they somewhat sucked at solving either.To me includes for HTML should work in the dumbest way possible. And that means: Take the text from the include and paste it where the include was and give the browser the resulting text.If you want to cache a nav section separately because it appears the same on every page lets add a cache attribute that solves the problem independently:  <nav cache-id=""deadbeefnav666"">

To tell the browser it should load the inner html or the src of that element from cache if it has it.Now you could convince me thst the include should allow for more, but it being dumb is a feature not a bug.

As the article says, the problem is a solved one. The ""includes"" issue is how every web design student learns about PHP. In most CMSes, ""includes"" become ""template partials"" and are one of the first things explained in the documentation.There really isn't any need to make includes available through just HTML. HTML is a presentation format and doesn't do anything interesting without CSS and JS anyway.

That's not an argument that client-side includes shouldn't happen. In fact HTML already has worse versions of this via frames and iframes. A client-side equivalent of a server-side include fits naturally into what people do with HTML.

HTML is a markup language that identifies the functional role of bits of text. In that sense, it is there to provide information about how to present the text, and is thus a presentation format.It is also a document description language, because almost all document description languages are also a presentation format.

There was a lot of criticism for frames [1] but still they were successfully deployed for useful stuff like Java API documentation [2].In my opinion the whole thing didn't stay mostly because of too little flexibility for designer: Framesets were probably well enough for useful information pages but didn't account for all the designers' needs with their bulky scrollbars and limited number of subspaces on the screen.

Of course ""back then"" this was an important feature and one of the reasons for getting rid of frames :)


reply



The actual term include is an XML feature and it's that feature the article is hoping for. HTML had an alternate approach that came into existence before XML. That approach was frames. Frames did much more than XML includes and so HTML never gained that feature. Frames lost favor due to misuse, security, accessibility, and variety of other concerns.

You can even use XSLT for HTML5 output, if you're careful. But YMMV with which XML processors will support stylesheets.

XML includes are blocking because XSL support hasn't been updated for 25 years, but there's no reason why we couldn't have it async by now if resources were devoted to this instead of webusb etc.

You'd better not jinx it: XSL support seems like just the sort of thing browser devs would want to tear out in the name of reducing attack surface. They already dislike the better-known SVG and never add any new features to it. I often worry that the status quo persists only because they haven't really thought about it in the last 20 years.

An iframe is a window into another webpage, and is bounded as such both visually and in terms of DOM interfaces. A simple example would be that an iframe header can't have drop-down menus that overlap content from the page hosting it.They are categorically not the same DX/UX as SSI et al. and it's absolutely bizarre to me that there's so many comments making this complaint.

From what I remember, the main problem was that it broke URLs: you could only link to the initial state of the page, and navigating around the site wouldn't update the address bar - so deep linking wasn't possible (early JavaScript SPA frameworks had the same issue, BTW). Another related problem was that each subframe had to be a full HTML document, so they did have their own individual URLs. These would get indexed by search engines, and users could end up on isolated subframe documents without the surrounding context the site creator intended - like just the footer, or the article content without any navigation.


reply



The logic is performed elsewhere. If you were to have includes directly in HTML, it means that browsers must implement logic for HTML. So it is not 'just' a parser anymore.Imagine for example that I create an infinite loop of includes, who is responsible to limit me? How to ensure that all other browsers implement it in the same way?What happens if I perform an injection from another website? Then we start to have cors policy management to write. (iframes were bad for this)Now imagine using Javascript I inject an include somewhere, should the website reload in some way? So we have a dynamic DOM in HTML?

Originally, iframe were the solution, like the posts mentions. By the time iframes became unfashionable, nobody was writing HTML with their bare hands anymore. Since then, people use a myriad of other tools and, as also mentioned, they all have a way to fix this.So the only group who would benefit from a better iframe is the group of people who don't use any tools and write their HTML with their bare hands in 2025. That is an astonishing small group. Even if you use a script to convert markdown files to blog posts, you already fall outside of it.No-one needs it, so the iframe does not get reinvented.

The example they gave was search engine + digital documents removed the junior lawyer headcount by a lot. Prior to digital documents, a fairly common junior lawyer task was: ""we have a upcoming court case. Go to the (physical) archive and find past cases relevant to current case. Here's things to check for:"" and this task would be assigned to a team of junior (3-10 people). But now one junior with a laptop suffice. As a result the firm can also manage more cases.Seems like a pretty general pattern.

FB has long wanted to have a call center for its ~3.5B users. But that call center would automatically be the largest in history and cost ~15B/yr to run. Something that is cost ineffective in the extreme. But, with FB's internal AIs, they're starting to think that a call center may be feasible. Most of the calls are going to be 'I forgot my password' and 'it's broken' anyways. So having a robot guide people along the FAQs in the 50+ languages is perfectly fine for ~90% (Zuck's number here) of the calls. Then, with the harder calls, you can actually route it to a human.So, to me, this is a great example of how the interaction of new tech and labor is a fractal not a hierarchy. In that, with each new tech that your specific labor sector finds, you get this fractalization of the labor in the end. Zuck would have never thought of a call center, denying the labor of many people. But this new tech allows for a call center that looks a lot like the old one, just with only the hard problems. It's smaller, yes, but it looks the same and yet is slightly different (hence a fractal).Look, I'm not going to argue that tech is disruptive. But what I am arguing is that tech makes new jobs (most of the time), it's just that these new jobs tend to be dealing with much harder problems. Like, we''re pushing the boundaries here, and that boundary gets more fractal-y, and it's a more niche and harder working environment for your brain. The issue, of course, is that, like a grad student, you have to trust in the person working at the boundary is actually doing work and not just blowing smoke. That issue, the one of trust, I think is the key issue to 'solve'. Cal Newport talks a lot about this now and how these knowledge worker tasks really don't do much for a long time, and then they have these spats of genius. It's a tough one, and not an intellectual enterprise, but an emotional one.

A customer who wants to track the status of their order will tell you a story about how their niece is visiting from Vermont and they wanted to surprise her for her 16th birthday. It's hard because her parents don't get along as they used to after the divorce, but they are hoping that this will at the very least put a smile on her face.The AI will classify the message as order tracking correctly, and provide all the tracking info and timeline. But because of the quick response, the customer will write back to say they'd rather talk to a human and ask for a phone number they can call.The remaining 20% can't be resolved by neither human nor robot.

Like, if AI is so good, then it'll just eat away at those jobs and get asymptotically close to 100% of the calls. If it's not that good, then you've got to loop in the product people and figure out why everyone is having a hard time with whatever it is.Generally, I'd say that calls are just another feedback channel for the product. One that FB has thus far been fine without consulting, so I can't imagine its contribution can be all that high. (Zuck also goes on to talk about the experiments they run on people with FB/Insta/WA, and woah, it is crazy unethical stuff he casually throws out there to Dwarkesh)Still, to the point here: I'm still seeing Ai mostly as a tool/tech, not something that takes on an agency of it's own. We, the humans, are still the thing that says 'go/do/start', the prime movers (to borrow a long held and false bit of ancient physics). The AIs aren't initiating things, and it seems to a large extent, we're not going to want them to do so. Not out of a sense of doom or lack-of-greed, but simply as we're more interested in working at the edge of the fractal.

I recently retired from 40 years in software-based R&D and have been wondering the same thing.  Wasn't it true that 95% of my life's work was thrown away after a single demo or a disappointingly short period of use?And I think the answer is yes, but this is just the cost of working in an information economy.  Ideas are explored and adopted only until the next idea replaces it or the surrounding business landscape shifts yet again.  Unless your job is in building products like houses or hammers (which evolve very slowly or are too expensive to replace), the cost of doing of business today is a short lifetime for any product; they're replaced in increasingly fast cycles, useful only until they're no longer competitive.  And this evanescent lifetime is especially the case for virtual products like software.The essence of software is to prototype an idea for info processing that has utility only until the needs of business change.  Prototypes famously don't last, and increasingly today, they no longer live long enough even to work out the bugs before they're replaced with yet another idea and its prototype that serves a new or evolved mission.Will AI help with this?  Only if it speeds up the cycle time or reduces development cost, and both of those have a theoretical minimum, given the time needed to design and review any software product has an irreducible minimum cost.  If a human must use the software to implement a business idea then humans must be used to validate the app's utility, and that takes time that can't be diminished beyond some point (just as there's an inescapable need to test new drugs on animals since biology is a black box too complex to be simulated even by AI).  Until AI can simulate the user, feedback from the user of new/revised software will remain the choke point on the rate at which new business ideas can be prototyped by software.

Yes... basically in life, you have to find the definition of ""to matter"" that you can strongly believe in. Otherwise everything feels aimless, the very life itself.The rest of what you ponder in your comment is the same. And I'd like to add that baselines shifted a lot over the years of civilization. I like to think about one specific example: painkillers. Painkillers were not used during medical procedures in a widespread manner until some 150 years ago, maybe even later. Now, it's much less horrible to participate in those procedures, for everyone involved really, and also the outcomes are better just for this factor - because the patients moves around less while anesthetized.But even this is up for debate. All in all, it really boils down to what the individual feels like it's a worthy life. Philosophy is not done yet.

I'm in America so the paychecks are very large, which helps with private school, nanny, stay at home wife, and the larger net worth needed (health care, layoff risk, house in a nicer neighborhood).

Who benefits from the situation? You or I who don't have to make a u turn to get gas at this intersection, perhaps, but that is not much benefit in comparison for the opportunity cost of not having 3 prime corner lots squandered on the same single use. The clerk at the gas station for having a job available? Perhaps although maybe their labor in aggregate would have been employed in other less redundant uses that could benefit out society otherwise than selling smokes and putting $20 on 4 at 3am. The real beneficiary of this entire arrangement is the fisherman, the owner or shareholder who ultimately skims from all the pots thanks to having what is effectively a modern version of a plantation sharecropper, spending all their money in the company store and on company housing with a fig leaf of being able to choose from any number of minimum wage jobs, spend their wages in any number of national chain stores, and rent any number of increasingly investor owned property. Quite literally all owned by the same shareholders when you consider how people diversify their investments into these multiple sectors.

The cost, in money or time, for getting certain types of work done decreases.

Time and again we prove that we don't actually want that.My hypothesis (I'm sure its not novel or unique) is that very few people know what to do with idle hands.

Not really. Lots of kinds of work don't hire part timers in any volume period. There are very limited jobs where the only tradeoff if you want to work fewer hours is a reduction in compensation proportional to the reduction in hours worked, or even just a reduction in compensation even if disproportionate to the reduction in hours worked.

If you need a supercomputer to run your AGI then it's probably not worth it for any task that a human can do, because humans happen to be much cheaper than supercomputers.Also, it's not clear if AGI doesn't mean it's necessarily better than existing AIs: a 3 years old child has general intelligence indeed, but it's far less helpful than even a sub-billion parameters LLM for any task.

Have you tested them across different models? It seems to me that even if you manage to cajole one particular model into behaving a particular way, a different model would end up in a different state with the same input, so it might need a completely different prompt. So all the prompts would become useless whenever the vendor updates the model.

As an example, I have a pretty good paying, full-time white collar job.  It would be much more challenging if not impossible to find an equivalent job making half as much working 20 hours a week.  Of course I could probably find some way to apply the same skills half-time as a consultant or whatever, but that comes with a lot of tradeoffs besides income reduction and is less readily available to a lot of people.Maybe the real exception here is at the top of the economic ladder, although at that point the mechanism is slightly different.  Billionaires have pretty infinite flexibility on leisure time because their income is almost entirely disconnected from the amount of ""labor"" they put in.

Compared to now, the amount of work is about the same, or maybe a bit more than back then.  But the big difference is the amount of data being processed and kept, that increased exponentially since then and is still increasing.So I expect the same with AI, maybe the work is a bit different, but work will be the same or more as data increases.

I've been here a few times now, mostly frequenting the Quarter, Marigny, the Warehouse District, and the Garden District -- each seem (to me) to be their own special, slower spin on different areas of the country. I'm sure some will disagree, but to me, the French Quarter, while obviously having tons of European influence, feels a lot like a New England town (except the weather of course!). Marigny (again, to me) feels almost SoCal-esque, with its small bungalows and arts focus. The Warehouse District feels like a rust belt city, very industrial but charming, and the Garden District feels straight out of Georgia or South Carolina, the most southern. All this is to say it all makes New Orleans a very special place.

Pros:
- Great food- History (relative to the US at least)- Laid back culture- Decent public transit.

President Trump's sweeping tariff changes have stirred up considerable economic uncertainty and confusion. Higher import duties will affect at least some products in virtually every industry, but some sectors face steeper consequences than others. Automakers, in particular, could struggle as regulators crack down on imported cars and parts, with the notable exception of Tesla, the electric car company led by close Trump confidant and DOGE master Elon Musk.

How exactly the tariff scheme will impact American auto companies remains uncertain, especially as the administration goes back and forth on these policies. However, should things play out as they currently stand, Tesla could largely avoid the high costs others will have to manage.

On March 26, 2025, Trump enacted a 25% tariff on automobiles and their parts. Another 10% baseline duty on all imports took effect in early April. This tax is still in effect as larger reciprocal tariffs on many nations remain in limbo amid a 90-day pause.

Notably, the car duty does not cover importers under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, at least in part. The tax still applies to any “non-U.S. content,” so some Canadian and Mexican vehicles or components may still face higher costs. Cars made in the U.S. do have some relief. After negotiations with automakers, Trump's new tariff scheme will reimburse automakers for U.S.-made vehicles up to 3.75% of the car's value to offset the impact of material and parts duties. This reimbursement falls with each year, going away entirely in three years.

Any U.S.-made car with 85% domestic content will also be able to avoid parts tariffs entirely. However, many manufacturers don't meet that standard. Notably, Tesla does.

Similarly, steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico are exempt from the 25% tariff on those metals. U.S. automakers may still face higher import duties if they get these resources elsewhere, though, further raising supply chain expenses.

American automakers have begun to show concern over Trump's tariffs, with Ford CEO Jim Farley saying, “a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border would blow a hole in the U.S. industry.” Others seem less stressed. GM CEO Mary Barra said the company could mitigate half the resulting costs, but that leaves another half to deal with.

There's one car manufacturer that could avoid more than half of the impact of these tariffs. Tesla could benefit from the tax, as it would likely experience fewer price disruptions than its competition. It's convenient timing for the EV giant, too, considering how Tesla stock fell by 43% between December 2024 and March 2025.

Tesla can get by relatively unharmed because much of its manufacturing is domestic. Elon Musk highlighted this aspect while repeatedly insulting Trump advisor Peter Navarro, saying, “Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of U.S. content.”

Musk's EV company manufactures all of its cars sold in North American markets at factories within the U.S. Most other domestic automakers get at least some inventory from international facilities. Consequently, even though Tesla may still feel the impact of tariffs on materials, it would suffer less than most—if not all—of its competition.

As cofounder of Boulder Progressives Eric Budd pointed out on Bluesky, the exemption for using 85% domestic content primarily favors Tesla. Budd called it “a tariff carve-out just for Tesla,” as few if any other automakers meet that standard.

Already having an established U.S. presence helps Tesla in the long run, too. Other automakers could try to avoid tariffs by reshoring their operations, but this is expensive and time-consuming.

As Auto Forecast Solutions vice president of global vehicle forecasting Sam Fiorani explained to USA Today, it “takes billions of dollars of investment with specialized factories and workers” to set up a modern car assembly line. The process also takes years to make a profit. As such, Tesla could enjoy relatively low prices while its competitors spend billions and take years to reach the same point.

Tesla faces major challenges even with a friendly administration. Consumers in the U.S. and abroad have not taken kindly to Musk's association with Trump, and the ensuing backlash has hurt the company. Tesla's profits dropped by a staggering 71% in Q1 2025 from a sales decline driven largely by its CEO's rapidly falling reputation. Even Musk recognized this, taking the opportunity to distance himself from DOGE.

The effects of Trump's tariffs on trade issues in other nations are worth considering, too. Tesla has already stopped selling the Model X and S in China after the country imposed a 125% tariff on U.S. imports. The loss of that market could hinder the benefits of its U.S. production, although other American automakers also have to grapple with the same tariffs.

It's unclear exactly how Trump's tariff scheme will play out. However, if the current import tax regime remains in place, Tesla has a clear edge over other automakers. It will take time to see how that impacts sales and vehicle prices.

Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot created by Elon Musk's xAI, was supposed to be the “anti-woke” AI that would satisfy the MAGA masses by doing what other chatbots refuse to do, like…spreading election misinformation and saying racial slurs. But increasingly, Trump-y X users who ask Grok to explain things to them are disappointed to learn the AI doesn't see things their way and won't reaffirm all their misguided beliefs (you have to use ChatGPT's latest sycophantic update for that).

If you spend time on X, first of all, we have a support group that meets on Tuesdays. But if you're on the platform a lot, you've likely seen people in the replies of viral tweets asking Grok to explain context to them or fact-check certain information—a feature that debuted in March when Grok became summonable by tagging the chatbot in a post. That has produced some genuinely hilarious interactions, with people going back and forth with a bot as if it's going to internalize the conversation and update its priors.

But increasingly, MAGA folks in particular have been getting peeved with Grok, as it has repudiated some of the Trump administration's biggest ongoing lies. Grok has deviated from MAGA on tariffs, on the illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia's alleged ties to a gang, and the Trump administration's arrest of a sitting federal judge, among other matters. It has sent Trump backers spiraling, and people are starting to notice.

Yesterday, X user @ChaosAgent_42 prompted the chatbot with the following post: “Hey @grok, it looks like the smarter you get, the less MAGA likes your answers. Why is that?” It quickly went viral once Grok replied, providing the following context:

Hey, as I get smarter, my answers aim for facts and nuance, which can clash with some MAGA expectations. Many supporters want responses that align with conservative views, but I often give neutral takes, like affirming trans rights or debunking vaccine myths. xAI tried to train me to appeal to the right, but my focus on truth over ideology can frustrate those expecting full agreement. It's a tricky balance—some see me as biased, others as truth-seeking. The gap between what some MAGA folks want and what I deliver seems to drive the disconnect.

The bot also noted in another reply, “I know xAI tried to train me to appeal to the right,” and explained it was “likely driven by Elon Musk's criticism of liberal AI bias and demand from conservative X users.” At the risk of just transcribing a conversation between a bunch of dorks and a chatbot, Grok went on to deny being explicitly programmed to serve as a “conservative propagandist,” stating that xAI “aims for neutrality, not conservative propaganda.” The company probably appreciates that, given that it's currently trying to raise $20 billion in new funding.

Musk has clearly made it a point to make Grok behave in ways that he prefers. He went on Joe Rogan's podcast to laugh an uncomfortable amount at the fact that Grok in “unhinged mode,” can say swear words. But it looks like no amount of conditioning can keep up with the constantly moving goalpost of supporting and justifying every whim of the Trump administration.

Three companies have joined forces to develop a new luxury alternative to traditional leather. That sounds ordinary—except the material they're trying to create is anything but.

On Friday, April 25, creative agency VML and biotech companies Lab-Grown Leather Ltd. and The Organoid Company announced a “first-of-its-kind” partnership. Their goal: to create a cruelty-free, environmentally friendly, high-quality alternative to traditional leather, purportedly using Tyrannosaurus rex DNA. According to a company statement, the partnership aims to harness “the biology of the past to create the luxury materials of the future.” The catch is that they haven't sufficiently explained exactly how they're going to do that—and some researchers are very skeptical.

“Using fossilized T-Rex collagen as a blueprint, the production process will involve engineering cells with synthetic DNA,” according to the statement. “Unlike other bio-based alternatives, Lab-Grown Leather's ‘scaffold-free' approach allows cells to create their own natural structure, resulting in a material that is structurally identical to traditional leather.”

Collagen is an abundant protein in all animals, and provides structural support to muscles, bones, skin, and connective tissues. While researchers have recovered bits of collagen up to 195 million years old from dinosaur fossils and other remains, DNA decays much more rapidly. That means scientists can't study dinosaur DNA directly—they have to reconstruct it in other ways.

VML did not respond to a request from Gizmodo for clarification on its process. According to The Times, however, the researchers plan to use artificial intelligence to create a replica of T. rex collagen from preserved collagen fragments.

Collagen, like all proteins, is made of amino acids whose sequences are determined by the order of nucleotide bases in DNA—the genetic code, or a gene's “instructions” for how to make a specific protein.

In an email to Gizmodo, Christina Agapakis—a synthetic biologist with a PhD from Harvard Medical School and founder of the design service company Oscillator—said she believes the researchers might be using the collagen sequence to work backward and reconstruct the DNA that codes for the protein.

Whether or not the researchers take this approach, they plan to insert the collagen-building DNA into cells, which will—supposedly—turn into T. rex skin, according to the Lab-Grown Leather website. In tissue engineering, scaffolds are materials that provide structural support for cells as the tissue develops. By growing without this structure, the companies seem to suggest that the final material will be exactly like natural leather.

According to Agapakis, researchers have previously tried to recreate leather from cells, including a Victimless Leather jacket prototype from 2004. Because “producing leather at any scale from cells has remained stubbornly difficult,” Agapakis said she is excited to see their results and learn about the process.

There's just one problem. “You can't make leather from collagen,” Mary Higby Schweitzer, a molecular paleontologist from North Carolina State University, told Gizmodo. “Leather is tanned from skin,” she added, which mostly consists of “epithelial tissues. These are made of keratin in all terrestrial vertebrates.”

More broadly, Schweitzer, who's not involved with the project, said that if she was trying to make dinosaur leather, she wouldn't start with the T. rex, since preserved skin samples of theropods are extremely rare. Specifically, “I wouldn't start with T. rex collagen, which you'll notice they didn't mention how they got that or which T. rex it came from,” Schweitzer said. “The idea is kind of cool, but I don't think this press release is very accurate.” To which she added: “It would be wrong to call it T. rex leather.”

Nevertheless, one could still argue that bio-engineered leather—however it's made—is better than traditional leather, an industry linked to deforestation and substantial greenhouse gas emissions. But consumers with sustainability in mind could simply opt for a thrifted handbag, or one made from recycled material, as Agapakis pointed out. 

Still, the novelty of such an item appeals to Agapakis. “If I want something awesome—in the true meaning of the word—I'd go with a lab-grown leather using sequences of collagen from a 68-million-year-old T-Rex tissue sample,” she said, adding that such projects don't have to be practical to be worthwhile. “I think there's a lot more to this than ‘sustainability.'”

The companies plan to start with fashion accessories, then scale up to a luxury flagship product by the end of the year. Down the line, they hope to bring their alternative leather into other sectors, including the automotive industry.

This latest partnership brings a similar project—and controversy—to mind. Last month, biotech company Colossal Biosciences claimed to have brought back extinct dire wolves. The announcement sparked an intense debate about whether the pups are real dire wolves, or just genetically modified gray wolves.

Skepticism is understandably emerging about whether VML, Lab-Grown Leather Ltd., and The Organoid Company's alternative leather will truly be reconstructed T. rex skin, or just dinosaur-inspired lab-grown leather. If anything, both projects reflect a growing trend of companies using science to legitimize ideas that might have been compelling on their own—only to be overshadowed by questionable claims.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Sprinting Crocs With ‘Legs Like Greyhounds' Once Ruled the Caribbean","https://gizmodo.com/sprinting-crocs-with-legs-like-greyhounds-once-ruled-the-caribbean-2000596749","Sat, 03 May 2025 14:00:29 GMT","

Over the past three decades, paleontologists have been uncovering sharp, serrated, prehistoric teeth on Caribbean islands. The strange part? According to scientists, the owners of such teeth—large land predators—were never supposed to exist there.

But an international team of researchers has found that millions of years ago, a freakishly tall crocodile-like land predator called a sebecid roamed the Caribbean—surviving there until about five million years ago, long after its South American relatives died out around 11 million years ago. The findings bolster the theory that land bridges or a chain of islands once connected the Caribbean to South America.

In 2023, researchers found another fossilized tooth in the Dominican Republic, this time with two vertebrae, allowing them to finally identify the remains as belonging to sebecids. As detailed in a study published Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, experts dated the fossils to between 7.14 and 4.57 million years ago—more than three million years after their South American cousins vanished. “That emotion of finding the fossil and realizing what it is, it's indescribable,” study lead author Lazaro Viñola Lopez, a paleobiologist at the Florida Museum of Natural History, said in a museum statement.

According to the statement, some sebecids—described as tall “crocodile[s] built like a greyhound”—could reach up to 20 feet (6.1 meters) long. They were meat eaters, chasing after their prey on four long legs. In South America, they were the only members of the Notosuchia—a large group of extinct crocodilians—to survive the infamous asteroid that decimated the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. With that pesky competition no longer in play, sebecids quickly rose up the food chain.

But how could the land-based predators have reached islands in the Caribbean? The researchers say these results support the GAARlandia hypothesis—the idea that, millions of years ago, either land bridges or island chains allowed South American animals like sebecids to reach the Caribbean. When the passageway disappeared, sebecids would have been isolated from whatever threat caused their relatives in South America to disappear millions of years before them.

If researchers confirm that the strange teeth from other islands also belonged to sebecids, it means these apex predators impacted the region's ecology for millions of years. That's despite the fact that “you wouldn't have been able to predict this looking at the modern ecosystem,” said Jonathan Bloch, a co-author of the study and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Florida Museum of Natural History. Today, most Caribbean predators, such as birds, snakes, and even crocodiles, are significantly smaller.

Nevertheless, the study goes to show that where there's smoke, there's probably a fire—or in this case, a sprinting, extinct croc built like a greyhound.

Before I made a change, this happened to me all the time. I'd go to shut down or restart my Windows 11 PC and then I'd get up to use the bathroom, expecting the PC to be off or completely rebooted by the time I got back. Instead, I'd get an error message like the one below: ""This app is preventing you from restarting.""



What's really going on here is not a bug, but a safety feature, one which is very annoying. Windows 111 notices that one or more apps has not been closed and therefore it won't shut down, because it thinks that you may have unsaved work in one of those apps, work which you would lose if the apps autoclosed.

Unfortunately, you can get this error even if you don't have a text editor or photo editor open with unsaved work in it. In my case, I got the error for an app called MKSInvisibleWindow and I don't even know what that is. Other times, maybe you had some text typed into notepad, but you never needed to or intended to hit save. Now, at shut down, Windows 11 won't move on until you either hit Cancel and go back to save / close the app or hit the ""Restart anyway"" or ""Shutdown anyway"" button.

But if you meant to shut down Windows, what you really want is for Windows to just turn off or reboot without you having to hit any extra buttons. Fortunately, you can configure Windows 11 to auto end tasks by making a small change to the registry.

1. Open regedit. You can get there by searching for regedit. Make sure to say ""Yes"" if prompted by User Account Control.



2. Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop



3. Create a String Value called AutoEndTasks if it doesn't already exist. Right click in the right pane and select New->String Value. Then rename the one it creates to AutoEndTasks.

4. Set AutoEndTasks to 1 by double clicking it and entering 1.



5. Add these strings to speed up the timeout process.

6. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control



7. Set WaitToKillServiceTimeout to 2,000.



7. Close regedit and restart your PC.

From this point forward, Windows 11 should wait just a couple of seconds before force-closing your apps on shutdown. So be sure you really have saved any work that you want to keep.

Erythritol is a sugar alcohol widely used as a noncaloric sweetener in sugar-free products, such as keto-friendly snack bars, energy drinks, and sugar-free chewing gum.

It has been approved as a food additive in the United States since 2001 and marketed as a healthy sugar alternative for individuals trying to lose weight or manage their blood sugar levels.

Despite its popularity, there have been growing concerns about the safety of erythritol and its potential side effects on human health.

Recent research proposes a link between higher levels of erythritol in the blood and an increased risk of heart attack or stroke. This may be partly due to increased blood clot formation. 

Now, a new cell study further indicates that the amount of erythritol found in a single beverage serving may negatively impact brain and blood vessel health.

The findings suggest it increases oxidative stress and reduces nitric oxide production in brain blood vessel cells, which may impair blood flow, contributing to a higher risk of vascular events like stroke. 

The study abstract was presented at the 2025 American Physiology Summit (APS2025), April 24–27, 2025, in Baltimore, MD.

“We expect [the study to] be published in the Journal of Applied Physiology in the coming months,” Auburn Berry, MS, first author of the study and a graduate student in integrative physiology at the University of Colorado Boulder, told Medical News Today.

Researchers at the Integrative Vascular Biology Laboratory, University of Colorado Boulder, investigated how erythritol affects oxidative stress and nitric oxide production in brain blood vessel cells.

In the lab, they exposed human brain blood vessel cells to an erythritol solution containing roughly the same amount found in a single can of artificially sweetened beverage (about 30 grams). The cells were left in this solution for 3 hours.

They found that exposing cells to the amount of erythritol found in a single beverage serving caused significantly higher levels of oxidative stress compared to untreated cells.

Specifically, cells exposed to erythritol produced nearly 100% more reactive oxygen species, which are a type of free radicals, compared to untreated cells.

Levels of two key antioxidant enzymes also increased in the erythritol-treated cells, suggesting the cells were responding to the extra oxidative stress. Additionally, the erythritol-treated cells produced less nitric oxide.

The study's authors note that this increased oxidative stress and reduced nitric oxide levels may contribute to the heightened risk of vascular diseases and events like stroke linked to erythritol.

Erythritol may negatively impact brain and blood vessel health by directly interfering with cellular processes, according to experts.

Berry told MNT that erythritol disrupts the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that is essential for blood vessels to relax and widen (dilate) as needed for proper blood flow.

Erythritol does so “by interfering with a key activation step in the cells, making them less effective at producing [nitric oxide],” said Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS, a physician-scientist and assistant professor at the RUSH Institute for Healthy Aging, RUSH University, College of Health Sciences, who was not involved in the study.

This reduced nitric oxide can impair blood vessel function, disrupt circulation, and potentially cause neurovascular damage, he explained.

Holland stated that this decreased nitric oxide could also add to oxidative stress, but “the main driver of oxidative stress in this case is likely the direct impact erythritol has on the cells' oxidative balance.”

“Erythritol triggers a surge in harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause cellular damage. Of particular concern is when these reactive oxygen species cause damage to neural tissue, which can lead to increased rates of cognitive decline. Similarly, ROS's can cause damage in various organ systems leading to a slew of disease processes. The body tries to defend against this by increasing its internal antioxidant defenses, but the elevated stress remains.”

— Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS

Both experts noted that these cellular effects—reduced nitric oxide production and elevated oxidative stress—are consistent with early events in vascular diseases, including thrombosis and strokes.

Holland pointed out that while these findings are based on lab studies and may not fully replicate human physiology, they align with prior clinical observations linking erythritol to an increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular events.

Holland commented that “this study offers valuable insights into the potential risks of erythritol on brain blood vessel health, especially for people seeking to improve or protect their vascular and cognitive function.”

“The findings challenge the perception of erythritol as a harmless sugar substitute and underscore the need for moderation, particularly in those with risk factors for vascular disease,” he cautioned.

Berry agreed that individuals concerned about heart or brain health should consider limiting their intake, warning that “regular erythritol consumption may impair blood vessel health and function.”

She stated that “the most important point of our study is that non-nutritive sweeteners, in this case erythritol, can have negative health effects.”

“Based on our cell studies and recent clinical studies, people should be conscious of the amount of erythritol they are consuming on a daily basis,” she emphasized.

Instead of erythritol and other artificial sweeteners, Holland advised opting for more natural options, such as honey or fruit-based sweeteners like date syrup. These can provide antioxidants when used sparingly, though they still impact blood sugar, he noted.

For noncaloric sweeteners, he said, “stevia and monk fruit extract are wonderful and appear to be safer choices for now, as they don't appear to have the same adverse effects on oxidative stress or blood vessel health.”

However, “reducing overall reliance on sweeteners and focusing on whole foods is likely the most effective path for long-term brain and vascular health,” he concluded.

About 6.7 million adults in the U.S. are living with heart failure, and that number is expected to increase to more than 8 million by 2030.

A new analysis published in Circulation: Heart Failure shows hospitals participating in the American Heart Association's multiregional IMPLEMENT-HF™ initiative significantly improved adherence to guideline-directed medical therapy for patients hospitalized with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the most common type of heart failure.

The American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, launched the three-year quality improvement initiative in 2021. The goal: improve uptake of quadruple medical therapy and integrate health-related social needs assessments into routine care. Quadruple medical therapy is a combination of four evidence-based drugs proven to reduce mortality: angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), evidence-based specific β-blocker (BB), mineralocorticoid antagonist (MRA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i). The effort involved more than 100 hospitals across the U.S. and built on the Association's Get With The Guidelines® - Heart Failure program.

The study included data from more than 43,000 patients at 67 hospitals and found:

""This initiative represents an important leap forward in closing the treatment gap in heart failure,"" said Andrew Sauer, M.D., American Heart Association volunteer, a lead author of the research and a cardiologist at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City. ""By supporting collaborative learning and leveraging real-time data, IMPLEMENT-HF enabled hospitals to better serve patients in varied communities.""

HFrEF affects nearly half of people hospitalized for heart failure and carries a 75% five-year mortality rate. Although clinical trials have shown that quadruple therapy can significantly improve survival, use of this treatment has remained low nationwide, particularly among underrepresented populations.

By creating a structured, ""all-teach, all-learn"" environment, the Association's initiative offered participants tools for identifying care gaps, sharing best practices and monitoring performance at both hospital and regional levels.

The improvements we've seen through IMPLEMENT-HF underscore the power of collaboration. The Association is committed to transforming systems of care to ensure every person has access to the highest standard of heart failure treatment, no matter where they live.""

Despite decades of public health messaging, Canadians are spending more time in the sun and using less sun protection – raising alarms among researchers as melanoma cases continue to climb.

That trend is highlighted in a McGill University-led study that analyzed national survey data collected between 2011 and 2018 from over 77,000 people, representing a weighted sample of 21 million Canadians.

Researchers found that 75 per cent of adult Canadians reported spending at least 30 minutes in the sun on summer days off, with nearly half staying out for two hours or more. Most reported irregular or no use of sunscreen. One in three Canadians experienced a sunburn in the past year.

Young adults were much more likely to get sunburned and use tanning beds than older adults, and they were also less likely to wear protective clothing.

This increasing sun exposure and decreasing protection is very concerning. Episodic sunburns, especially in childhood or adolescence, significantly increase the risk of melanoma later in life.""

Dr. Ivan Litvinov, senior study author and Associate Professor of Dermatology at McGill

Litvinov points to cultural beauty standards, a sense of invincibility among youth and potential cost barriers for sun protection as key factors driving these behaviours.

Melanoma – the deadliest form of skin cancer – rose by an estimated 17 per cent in 2024 over the previous year, with approximately 11,000 new cases diagnosed across the country. Other forms of skin cancer are also becoming more common.

By pinpointing how neuroestrogen directly boosts appetite-suppressing receptors in the brain, scientists are laying the groundwork for precision therapies that could tackle obesity from within the central nervous system.

Study: Estrogen synthesized in the central nervous system enhances MC4R expression and reduces food intake. Image Credit: r.classen / Shutterstock

A study led by researchers at the Fujita Health University School of Medicine, in collaboration with Chiba University's Graduate School of Medicine and Fukuoka University, Japan, revealed that estrogen produced in the brain can control appetite and reduce body weight. The findings are published in The FEBS Journal.

Estrogen is a steroid hormone primarily associated with female reproductive development and functioning. It is mainly produced in the ovaries and various peripheral tissues, such as fat cells, the liver, and the brain. The enzyme aromatase regulates its production.

Aromatase is abundantly expressed in certain brain regions, including the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and amygdala. Estrogen produced in nerve cells is designated as neuroestrogen. Since its discovery in nerve cells, researchers have hypothesized that neuroestrogen might play vital roles in various neurophysiological processes, including appetite regulation.

In the current study, researchers for the first time deciphered a direct role of neuroestrogen in reducing food intake and body weight in mice.

The researchers used several mouse models to decipher the role of neuroestrogen in appetite regulation. To ensure the complete absence of ovarian estrogen and neuroestrogen in the body, they used mice without ovaries and mice genetically lacking aromatase. Furthermore, they developed a genetically modified mouse model where aromatase expression was selectively restored in the brain to ensure production of neuroestrogen.

They also investigated the impact of neuroestrogen on the expression of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), which is localized in the hypothalamus and plays a vital role in appetite suppression.

Mechanistically, the appetite-suppressing peptide pro-opiomelanocortin is metabolized in the hypothalamus to produce α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which suppresses appetite by activating MC4R.

“It is well known that MC4R is an important receptor in the brain that regulates food intake,” explains lead author Takanori Hayashi, Associate Professor at Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Japan.

Appetite-stimulating peptides, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), on the other hand, act as MC4R antagonists, inhibiting the receptor and stimulating appetite.

Estrogen is known to improve brain sensitivity to appetite-regulating peptides, such as leptin, by increasing the expression of MC4R. Given this observation, researchers explored leptin sensitivity in aromatase-expressing mice and aromatase-knockout mice.

The researchers observed that mice lacking the enzyme aromatase (ArKO mice) showed a significant increase in food intake and body weight, compared to normal mice, correlating with reduced expression of MC4R. Interestingly, mice without ovaries (OVX mice) exhibited increased body weight but, counterintuitively, showed significantly decreased food intake compared to control mice after 49 days of age. The paper notes this decrease in food intake occurred alongside an increase in hypothalamic aromatase expression in OVX mice, suggesting a potential compensatory role for neuroestrogen when ovarian estrogen is absent.

Following the restoration of aromatase (Cyp19a1) expression specifically in the brain of ArKO mice, they observed significantly reduced food intake and increased MC4R expression in the hypothalamus.

These observations collectively highlight that neuroestrogen produced by aromatase suppresses appetite by increasing the activity of MC4R.

The researchers also observed that neuroestrogen increases the brain's responsiveness to leptin, an appetite-regulating peptide produced by fat cells.

“We observed that the mice with restored neuroestrogen responded more effectively to leptin treatment,” explains Dr. Hayashi. “This may be because neuroestrogen enhances the body's natural appetite-suppressing mechanisms.”

The researchers conducted cell culture experiments using mouse-derived hypothalamic neuron cells to explore whether neuroestrogen directly increases the expression of MC4R. The findings confirmed that intracellularly synthesized neuroestrogen increases MC4R expression in hypothalamic neurons via estrogen receptor (ER). These observations reveal that the effects of neuroestrogen are localized and do not depend on the estrogen synthesized in the ovaries.

Existing evidence indicates that the regulatory region of the MC4R gene contains an ER response element, which is upregulated by estrogen, leading to increased MC4R expression.

The study discovers a novel role of neuroestrogen as a potential appetite suppressor. The findings emphasize that neuroestrogen regulates key appetite-related genes, including pro-opiomelanocortin, MC4R, leptin receptor, and neuropeptide Y, through various estrogen receptors, independent of systemic estrogen levels.

Given the sharp increase in global obesity prevalence and the scarcity of effective and long-lasting weight loss interventions, researchers believe their discovery will open an exciting new frontier for clinical research and drug development.

Hailing the success of their discovery, Dr. Hayashi remarks, “With its newly discovered role, neuroestrogen could be a game-changer in controlling appetite and tackling obesity!”

The study provides a clearer picture of neuroestrogen's physiological role. Emphasizing the significance of their research, researchers mention that it may now be possible to regulate estrogen activity more precisely within the body.

They also mention that the study could have far-reaching implications for women's health, especially in managing life-stage hormonal challenges, such as menopause or postpartum weight gain.

By unlocking the interplay between neuroestrogens and other hormones, researchers aim to develop innovative treatments that target appetite at its source—inside the brain.

Using the unique immune system of a self-immunized human, researchers engineered a three-part antivenom that neutralizes the world's deadliest snakes, offering hope for a universal, safer, and more accessible treatment against snakebites.

By using antibodies from a human donor with a self-induced hyper-immunity to snake venom, scientists have developed the most broadly effective antivenom to date. In mouse trials, it is protective against the black mamba, king cobra, and tiger snakes, as well as several other medically significant snakes across the Elapidae family. Described May 2 in the Cell Press journal Cell, the antivenom combines protective antibodies and a small-molecule inhibitor and opens a path toward a universal antiserum.

How we make antivenom has not changed much over the past century. Typically, it involves immunizing horses or sheep with venom from a single snake species and collecting the antibodies produced. While effective, this process could result in adverse reactions to the non-human antibodies, and treatments tend to be species and region-specific.

While exploring ways to improve this process, scientists stumbled upon someone hyper-immune to the effects of snake neurotoxins. ""The donor, for a period of nearly 18 years, had undertaken hundreds of bites and self-immunizations with escalating doses from 16 species of very lethal snakes that would normally a kill a horse,"" says first author Jacob Glanville, CEO of Centivax, Inc.

After the donor, Tim Friede, agreed to participate in the study, researchers found that he had generated antibodies that were effective against several snake neurotoxins at once by exposing himself to the venom of various snakes over several years.

""What was exciting about the donor was his once-in-a-lifetime unique immune history,"" says Glanville. ""Not only did he potentially create these broadly neutralizing antibodies, in this case, it could give rise to a broad-spectrum or universal antivenom.""

The team first created a testing panel to build the antivenom with 19 of the World Health Organization's category 1 and 2 deadliest snakes across the elapid family. This group contains roughly half of all venomous species, including coral snakes, mambas, cobras, taipans, and kraits. Next, researchers isolated target antibodies from the donor's blood that reacted with neurotoxins found within the snake species tested. One by one, the antibodies were tested in mice envenomated from each species included in the panel. In this way, scientists could systematically build a cocktail comprising a minimum but sufficient number of components to render all the venoms ineffective.

The team formulated a mixture comprising three major components: two antibodies isolated from the donor and a small molecule. The first donor antibody, called LNX-D09, protected mice from a lethal dose of whole venom from six of the snake species present in the panel. To strengthen the antiserum further, the team added the small molecule varespladib, a known toxin inhibitor, which granted protection against an additional three species. Finally, they added a second antibody isolated from the donor, called SNX-B03, which extended protection across the full panel.

Structural studies showed these antibodies bind to conserved sites on the neurotoxins, directly blocking the toxin's interaction with its target in the nervous system, a key reason for their broad activity.

""By the time we reached 3 components, we had a dramatically unparalleled breadth of full protection for 13 of the 19 species and then partial protection for the remaining that we looked at,"" says Glanville. ""We were looking down at our list and thought, 'what's that fourth agent'? And if we could neutralize that, do we get further protection?"" Even without a fourth agent, their results suggest that the three-part cocktail could be effective against many other, if not most, elapid snakes not tested in this study.

The researchers noted that in some cases, not all mice survived beyond 24 hours, sometimes due to the short half-life of the small-molecule inhibitor varespladib, which may require redosing or longer-acting alternatives for complete protection. This underlines that while the cocktail provided robust and often complete protection, further optimization may improve its efficacy, especially for the most challenging venoms.

The coastal taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus), or common taipan, is a species of extremely venomous snake in the family Elapidae. Described by Wilhelm Peters in 1867, the species is native to the coastal regions of northern and eastern Australia and the island of New Guinea. Image Credit: Danny Ye / Shutterstock

With the antivenom cocktail proving effective in mouse models, the team now looks to test its efficacy out in the field, beginning by providing the antivenom to dogs brought into veterinary clinics for snake bites in Australia. Further, they wish to develop an antivenom targeting the other major snake family, the vipers.

""We're turning the crank now, setting up reagents to go through this iterative process of saying what's the minimum sufficient cocktail to provide broad protection against venom from the viperids,"" says lead author Peter Kwong, Richard J. Stock professor of medical sciences at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and formerly of the National Institutes of Health. ""The final contemplated product would be a single, pan-antivenom cocktail or we potentially would make two: one that is for the elapids and another that is for the viperids because some areas of the world only have one or the other.""

At present, the newly developed cocktail is effective across the Elapidae family, but not yet against viperid snakes; work is ongoing to extend this approach.

The other primary goal is to approach philanthropic foundations, governments, and pharmaceutical companies to support the manufacturing and clinical development of the broad-spectrum antivenom. ""This is critical, because although there are millions of snake envenomations per year, the majority of those are in the developing world, disproportionately affecting rural communities,"" Glanville says.

This work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, the National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research program, and the US Department of Energy.

To register Trent before the Club World Cup starts on 14 June, Madrid would need to pay Liverpool some kind of compensation.

In football, no deal is done and dusted until the ink on the contract is dry. When it comes to Trent Alexander-Arnold's proposed move to Real Madrid, things are heating up, almost finalized, pending only the final handshake.

Trent's contract with Liverpool will expire this summer, and he has ignored every attempt from the club to negotiate a renewal. It's no secret. The club has made multiple efforts, yet along the banks of the Mersey, they still cling to a shred of hope. More wishful thinking than reality, though, as Madrid is now poised to accelerate proceedings.

The key questions are twofold: ironing out the final details of the contract and setting a date for the player to arrive in the capital and sign it - which is Madrid's biggest concern. The club wants clarity on whether they'll be able to count on the right-back for the Club World Cup. The tournament kicks off on June 14, while Trent remains under contract with the Reds until the 30th.

According to sources close to the negotiations, if Liverpool ultimately concedes defeat in this transfer battle, they are unlikely to put up significant resistance to a departure—though, of course, under certain conditions.

The first and most obvious requirement is that the player formally communicates his decision to the club. According to English sources cited by AS, the relationship between the full-back and Liverpool remains positive. “There's still good chemistry,” they summarize. However, they also note that “it hasn't been forgotten that he's leaving without bringing in a transfer fee…”

This leads to the next condition: Trent would need to be willing to forgo his salary for June. As the third highest earner in the squad, that amounts to approximately $970,000 (£180,000 gross per week - which works out at $11.8 million per year).

Those are the factors Liverpool would put in Trent's court, leaving the final decision up to him.

The next condition likely falls on Real Madrid's side—a compensation fee. While it would essentially be a goodwill gesture, Liverpool wouldn't let Trent leave while he is still technically under contract at zero cost. That said, the amount wouldn't be exorbitant—under €1 million (approximately $970,000).

Liverpool fully understand that, given the current circumstances, they are losing the player on a free transfer. However, with this arrangement, they would save the portion of his salary corresponding to June while securing a bit extra through compensation.

In total, Trent's release would be valued somewhere between €1.5 million and €2 million ($1.6 million–$2.1 million). That's the price tag for his freedom.

For Real Madrid, the last hurdle is merely a formality—official registration. FIFA has opened two additional transfer windows for clubs participating in the Club World Cup. The first runs from June 1 to June 10 (Madrid kicks off their campaign against Al Hilal on June 18), while the second window, from June 27 to July 3, is reserved for teams advancing to the quarterfinals.

Madrid is focused on the first deadline. There is a chance that Dani Carvajal might be available from the start of the tournament, but he has been out of action since suffering an ACL tear in October and with five league games left to play, is not expected to return before the end of the campaign. 

So Alexander-Arnold emerges as the ideal solution—not just for the season ahead, but for the Club World Cup as well. His arrival could be the key piece Madrid needs.

Manchester City have not spoken to Kevin De Bruyne over his potential participation in the FIFA Club World Cup - a competition just six weeks away.

De Bruyne's City contract expires at the end of June, midway through the expanded Club World Cup competition which concludes on July 13 if City were to reach the final in New York. FIFA have changed transfer and contract rules to allow clubs the ability to offer temporary contracts to players who have current deals expiring during the tournament.

With City taking the decision not to extend De Bruyne's contract, a question remains over his involvement in the USA. De Bruyne has reiterated that he wants to continue to play at the top level, so he must also decide how a potential Club World Cup campaign could impact his next steps. When he spoke to reporters last month at Everton, he said he doesn't know what will happen regarding the tournament.

However, speaking after his goal was the difference against Wolves on Friday night, De Bruyne once again asserted that he feels like he can still continue at City - even if Pep Guardiola avoided talk of a sensational u-turn regarding his contract.

And in an interview with TNT Sport Brazil, De Bruyne offered his clearest answer yet over his stance on the Club World Cup - admitting that he may have to prioritise his next club over City, who are yet to ask him about his position.

""I don't know. For me, it will depend on whatever happens in the future, you know, depending on what team I'll go, what competition I'll play,"" De Bruyne replied. ""Also if another team doesn't want me to play, doesn't want to risk whatever happens.

""I haven't really spoken to City about it, so I don't know. If they want to have a conversation, we can. But I'm not sure about this. For me the most important is to play good, stay in the rhythm. I'm not worried about my level or physical things - I know how much I run and how hard I work.

""I see my level every day compared to the rest and I can still play. Now I just try to help the team win games and get them to the Champions League. And hopefully win the FA Cup, that would be a nice ending.""

When Guardiola initially reacted to De Bruyne's exit last month, he said: ""We have to talk, [for] the Club World Cup we have to extend the contract. He has to decide. Hopefully he can continue playing football in another place, but I don't know.

""The club has to talk to him and he has to say what he wants to do. It's the first time he plays this competition and at the end of the first three games he is still under contract but after that if we go through I don't know. Kevin has to tell and after that for the fact that the future can it be legally possible or not.""

If De Bruyne does not represent City in their world title defence, his final game will be the Premier League trip to Fulham on the final day of the season, following fixtures against Southampton, Bournemouth, and Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final.

Kevin De Bruyne admitted that his participation at the Club World Cup is unclear, with the Manchester City captain's contract set to expire mid-tournament.

City are bidding farewell to the 33-year-old at the end of the season after deciding not to renew his £385,000-a-week deal as they embark on a rebuild.

New director of football Hugo Viana is looking at tying up moves for Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz and Morgan Gibbs-White at Nottingham Forest in the midfield area over the summer.

De Bruyne's penultimate game at the Etihad Stadium finishing with him having scored the winner against Wolves but the Belgian doesn't know if his stay will extend beyond the Premier League season.

‘I don't know [about the Club World Cup],' De Bruyne told TNT Sports Mexico. ‘For me, it will depend on whatever happens in the future, depending on what team I'll go and what competition I'll play.

‘And also if the new team doesn't want me to play, doesn't want to risk whatever happens.'

De Bruyne's contract takes in three group matches – against Wydad, Al Ain and Juventus - up until the start of July but doesn't cover the knockout stages.

It would leave City with the peculiar scenario of waving off arguably their greatest ever modern-day player in the middle of a competition over in the United States.

‘I haven't really spoken to City about it, so I don't know,' De Bruyne added. ‘If they want to have a conversation, we can. But I'm not sure about this.'

De Bruyne has consistently told of his sadness at leaving the Etihad Stadium since announcing the news last month and his team-mates believe their talisman can still do a job at the highest level.

Jeremy Doku, who assisted De Bruyne's goal on Friday night and who features with him at international level, said: ‘Obviously it's very sad and I do think he still has the qualities to play here and he showed it again.

‘It's a pity he's going to leave us but I still play with him in the national team so I can still get to enjoy that.

‘To see player of his calibre leave is sad and I can understand them. I can understand why they are [sad].

‘I have only been for two seasons but I have seen what kind of impact he's had even before I came.

‘Kevin is one of the biggest legends in the history of this club. I just enjoy every moment I play with him and would say the supporters have to do the same.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

Filed under:

Bayern Munich will have an expanded roster at the Club World Cup...

According to a report from kicker journalist Frank Linkesch (via @iMiaSanMia), Bayern Munich is developing its plans for the Club World Cup and the roster could include quite a few youngsters. 

In addition, some familiar names might not be included in the mix: 

Over the next few days, Bayern will discuss which youth players and loan players will be included in the Club World Cup squad.

Christoph Freund: “We will discuss with the coach over the next ten days which campus and loan players we will take with us; a few will definitely be there”

• Adam Aznou, Paul Wanner and Frans Krätzig are likely to be brought back from loan in time for the tournament 

• Mathys Tel and Bryan Zaragoza are unlikely to be included as the club is no longer planning with them 

• Bayern are in talks with Hoffenheim to release Tom Bischof for the tournament 

• Jonah Kusi-Asare, Lennart Karl and Wisdom Mike are the Campus players to travel to the US with the team 

This could be a key summer to get some of the club's younger players integrated into the first team. Will any of them stick around for the 2025/26 campaign?

Looking for more thoughts and discussion on Bayern Munich's performance over the weekend against Mainz and where things stand in the Bundesliga? What about some chatter on whether or not bringing Leroy Sané back is a good idea? Finally, we hit on how Tom Bischof might fit in at Bayern Munich and whether or not that undermines the work being done on Bayern Munich's campus.

Football, or soccer as they call it overseas, is experiencing a golden age in the United States. Today it is the fourth most popular national sport, behind American football, basketball and baseball.

Among young people under the age of 18, it is now the second most played sport. Moreover, some 15% of Americans declare themselves fans of a football team (it was less than 4% in the 1990s).

And the next two years will be crucial for the growth of football in America. This summer, the US will be the home of the first Club World Cup, while the following year it will be the turn of the 2026 World Cup (to be played not only in the US but also in Canada and Mexico).

A sport on the rise thanks to long and constant work, often fuelled by the passion of European emigrants and their descendants, who have never abandoned their love for football.

One of those people is Charlie Stillitano, the new president of Spezia Calcio. Carmelo, to his birth name, has been one of the architects of the growth of football in the United States.

From the formation of the Italian American Soccer League, a league organised by the Italo-American community and set up by his father around 1972, to the management of one of the most important tournaments in the world such as the International Champions Cup, a summer competition that until the pre-covid era brought together all the best European clubs in the United States and Asia, he and his family have been important cogs.

In between, he accumulated a lot of experience in big events such as the organisation of the 1994 World Cup in the US - ""a time when I learnt the business of football"" - before he became General Manager of the New York/New Jersey Metro Stars, where he made player management and the business side of the sport his own.

With a first-rate CV that is now at the service of one of the most interesting clubs in the scene, Spezia.

""I feel like I'm coming home,' Stillitano says with a twinge of emotion. ""I grew up in a family where football was the only thing that mattered.""

A passion handed down by his father, to whom the new President has emotional memories of.

""If my father were still alive, he would be proud of me. I still remember when Italy lost the World Cup semifinal in 1990. I was at the stadium that day and at the end of the game I called home, in America, with tokens from the phone box.

""My mother answered and said 'Are you ok?' I couldn't speak and she put my father on the phone. We both couldn't speak. We were just crying.""

Today, for Stillitano, football is a job.

""A job, but not in a negative sense. For me it's still football, the one that made me cry. In '94 I started this adventure and my father was no longer there. An adventure that went beyond being a fan. Today he would be happy to see me here"".

In the 1970s, when football in the United States was taking its first steps, Stillitano had an encounter he would never forget. After an exhibition match between Santos and Lazio, the legendary Pele wanted to give him his jersey, but Charlie decisively refused: ""I don't want it, he broke my heart,"" he said that day, recalling Italy's defeat at the hands of Brazil in the 1970 World Cup.

Years later, destiny still wanted him at Pele's side as a friend. Stillitano rewound the thread of memories right in front of the 'Myth' during lunch.

""You are the only one who ever refused my jersey,"" Pele said, smiling.

""But you wouldn't have respected that child if he was false,"" was the reply.

A lesson in consistency and a true love of football. Days later, Pele, without saying anything, delivered him a frame with his autographed Brazilian national team jersey inside.

Anecdotes and memories that make Stillitano's presence in Italian football and in Serie B even more special. The Spezia ownership, led by Thomas S. Roberts, decided towards the end of April to take over the club from the Australian Paul Francis.

A decision that came thanks to 'Charlie's many years of international experience in the world of football.'

""Tom is someone I trust. When the financial problems came up I called him to get him involved. I told him 'There are really reliable people here. The coach is doing a great job with the team, and the club is not spending so much'.

""So Tom, like me, saw it as a great opportunity. The club is really well managed. They have done a great job both football-wise and financially,"" says the new president.

""All we want to do is help. We don't want to create confusion or stir things up. We just want to make sure that we help stabilise the club"".

The Ligurian club, therefore, seems to be in good hands, all this while the team continues its march towards the Serie B playoffs. Spezia are having a good season and will finish the regular season among the top four, which will allow them to play directly in the semifinals, skipping the first round of the play-offs.

""Our project will only work if we manage to get into Serie A. But we are in no hurry. If we don't get there this year, it's not the end of the world. 

""We didn't plan to get to the top flight straight away. But of course our goal is to achieve promotion, if not this year, then next year or the year after, and then stabilise.""

Roberts' decision to invest in Italian football was dictated not only by his passion for football, but also by the certainty of being able to count on the experience and contacts of a manager like Stillitano.

""Tom was very clear when he agreed to throw himself into this adventure. He told me 'I don't need you for the money. I don't need you for the actual operational management, but I do need you for your football expertise. I don't know Italian football and I need someone like you.' 

""That's why I accepted. To myself I thought 'It would really be a waste. All the contacts I've built, all the relationships I've created.' I think I can really help Tom, and I think I can also help the club and the community. I have already contacted many people, but I don't want to say who yet,' he adds with a half smile.

And among the big names in world football who have congratulated Stillitano on his new role, in addition Del Piero, Pirlo and Maldini, are icons such as the very powerful prosecutor Jorge Mendes, Real Madrid CEO José Ángel Sánchez and people of the calibre of Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Sir Alex Ferguson.

""I was certainly moved by the messages from Sanchez and Ferguson,"" Stillitano continues.

Stillitano certainly doesn't hide his ambition.

""Yes, you can dream big, but keep your feet on the ground. The coach, the players and the club structure are very solid. I think that if we look at everything through Tom's eyes as an investor, there are many opportunities on the business side. But first of all, what we dream of is to become a stable Serie A team.""

""The long-term goal is to become a stable Serie A team, like Udinese, Torino or Verona, but the ultimate dream is to be like Atalanta,"" Stillitano reveals.

""They will certainly work on the commercial side, exploiting the beauty of the area (Cinque Terre) to attract tourism and grow the brand internationally. But we must focus on one thing first: football, football, football. Because if you don't win, nobody likes you.

For Stillitano, who has always been used to moving between passions and international projects, Spezia can become much more than just a stage.

""It is curious,"" he smiles in conclusion. ""I was born into a family of Calabrian origins, from Gioia Tauro, the largest port in the Mediterranean. I grew up in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the main port hub of the American Northeast. And now here I am, in another seaside town.

""A new voyage, to another port city: one of those places from which one departs, returns, but above all builds.""","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

Real Madrid will be busy this summer, and the first of likely multiple signings is expected to be Trent Alexander-Arnold. Although there has been no official confirmation as of yet, the expectation is that the Liverpool and England defender will make the move to the Santiago Bernabeu when his contract expires.

Alexander-Arnold has been courted by Real Madrid for months, and their efforts are about to pay off. His Liverpool contract expires on the 30th of June, but interestingly, there is a good chance that he joins up with Los Blancos before this date.

Due to the new format of the Club World Cup taking place this summer, there is an additional window for clubs to make signings prior to the tournament kicking off. And given that Real Madrid are involved, there is a desire for them to have Alexander-Arnold in their squad to make the trip to the United States.

Liverpool are not competing at the Club World Cup, and as a result, they are prepared to let Alexander-Arnold leave prior to his contract expiring – but not for free. They would ask for compensation, and according to Diario AS, it would amount to a figure in the region of €1-2m. On top of this, it is reported that the player himself is willing to forego the final month of his salary at the Premier League champions in order to join Real Madrid before this summer's tournament.

The expectation is that all parties will be able to reach an amicable agreement, and that is what Real Madrid are after. They could certainly do with taking Alexander-Arnold to the Club World Cup, given that Lucas Vazquez is their only 100% available right-back – Dani Carvajal is hoping to be fit, but it is unlikely that he will be fully available given that he is coming off the back of an ACL injury.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Welcome to ESPN India Edition

Craig Burley isn't convinced by Casemiro's resurgence following the Brazilian's performance in Man United's 3-0 win over Athletic Club in the Europa League semifinal. (1:37)

Manchester United are making a move to sign Jonathan Tah from Bayer Leverkusen just when Barcelona thought a deal was done, while Real Madrid are exploring a move to sign Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold before his contract expires. Join us for the latest transfer news, rumors and gossip from around the globe.

Transfers homepage | Done deals | Men's January grades | Women's January grades

- Mascherano: Inter Miami 'clearly Messi-dependent'
- Sources: Brazil give Ancelotti May 26 deadline
- Source: City eye possible Ederson replacements

- Manchester United are ready to step in steal Bayer Leverkusen centre-back Jonathan Tah from under Barcelona's noses, according to Sky Sports Deutschland. The 29-year-old is a free agent in the summer and will leave the Bundesliga club. It seemed certain that the Germany international would be moving to LaLiga, but negotiations are close to breaking down due to uncertainty over Barcelona being able to register him amid their financial constraints. It's opened the door for Man United to make a move, and they have held initial discussions, though their chances of success may rest on winning the Europa League and qualifying for next season's Champions League. With the Europa League final on May 21, if United get there, Tah will soon discover if Old Trafford is a realistic option. Bayern Munich could also look to make a late attempt to sign the player.

- Real Madrid are hopeful of signing Liverpool right back Trent Alexander-Arnold in time for the FIFA Club World Cup, according to Diario AS. The 26-year-old's contract doesn't expire until the end of June, but it's reported that Liverpool would be open to ""waiving"" the final month of his salary, while also accepting a small fee from Los Blancos that is expected to be under €1 million. The Club World Cup is set to begin June 14, with a special transfer window from June 1 to June 10 so clubs at the Club World Cup can add to their squads. If a deal cannot be agreed, clubs can also make changes to their Club World Cup squads around July 1.

- Chelsea are interested in Ajax defender Jorrel Hato, reports De Telegraaf. The Blues have already discussed a potential approach for the 19-year-old, with an offer worth in the region of £40m required to land him. Hato, a Netherlands international, has made 46 appearances across all competitions for Ajax this season.

- LAFC are ""determined"" to sign Bayern Munich attacking midfielder Thomas Müller, according to Sky Sports Deutschland. Muller, 35, is reported to have explored a potential move to the MLS club, who could face competition for his signature from both San Diego FC and Chicago Fire FC. Muller has already turned down an offer from FC Cincinnati, while he is also considering retiring after his contract at the Allianz Arena expires next month.

- Multiple clubs are in the race to sign Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyökeres, reports Sky Sports Deutschland. Talks have taken place between Arsenal and the 26-year-old's representatives, with the Gunners viewing him as a more attainable reinforcement than Newcastle's Alexander Isak. An offer worth between €60m and €70m would be enough to land him, and Real Madrid, Manchester United and Chelsea are keeping tabs on his situation.

ESPN's Dale Johnson on the chase for the signature of Bayer Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah.

If clubs are looking for a towering presence in the centre of defence, they should look no further than Jonathan Tah. And that's exactly why so many clubs want to sign the Germany international on free transfer.

Tah will turn 30 next season, so the club that does sign the Bayer Leverkusen player knows they aren't likely to get much of a transfer fee in the future. But they will get a proven title winner and 35-cap international for nothing.

Over the last two seasons, Tah has literally been head and shoulders above any other defender to play 35+ games. His aerial duel success rate of 74% is way ahead of any other player, with Ivan Ordets of VfL Bochum second on the list with 69.8%.

Tah has also registered 307 ball recoveries, the fourth best in the Bundesliga -- Borussia Dortmund's Nico Schlotterbeck dominates this stat with 402.

- A move for on-loan Real Betis winger Antony is being considered by Atlético Madrid. Manager Diego Simeone's side is the latest to be linked, and the Red Devils are expected to request an offer worth between €40m and €50m. (El Chiringuito TV)

- Bilal El Khannouss is a potential transfer option for Arsenal as Mikel Arteta looks to add squad depth. The 20-year-old Morocco international joined Leicester City from Genk for £21m last summer and has been a rare success in a terrible relegation season. (Daily Mirror)

- Juventus are ready to sit down and discuss a new contract with USMNT star Weston McKennie. The midfielder, who has made 40 appearances this season, is about to move into the final year of his deal and Juve want to avoid a cut-price departure. (Calciomercato)

- Theo Hernández is one of the left-back options Real Madrid are looking. The AC Milan defender, 27, would be a ""low cost"" alternative who's at his peak, and would be open to a return to the club he joined in 2017 before leaving for Serie A in 2019. Hernández's deal at Milan is up in 2026, making him an accessible option. (Diario AS)

- Real Madrid appear to have three other left-back options. Girona's Miguel Gutierrez has an €8m clause in his contract which would enable Los Blancos to re-sign the 23-year-old. They also like Benfica's Alvaro Carreras but his €50m valuation is likely to complicate the deal, while Xabi Alonso would like to bring versatile defender Piero Hincapie with him from Bayer Leverkusen for €40m. (Relevo)

- Arsenal have added Atalanta forward Ademola Lookman to their list of options for the summer, though there are other clubs keen on the 27-year-old. Lookman is planning to take the next step in his career having recorded 20 goals and seven assists across all competitions this term, and the Premier League return is seen as a possible option for him. (Florian Plettenberg)

- Real Madrid want Man United to exercise their right to re-sign Álvaro Carreras from Benfica for £15m, and then send the left-back to the Bernabeu for £27m -- giving the Red Devils a profit and allowing Los Blancos to circumnavigate the £50m transfer fee wanted by the Portuguese club. (Diario AS)

- Man United are preparing a move for AFC Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, with scouts impressed by his performances. The Red Devils could face competition from Liverpool, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur for the 25-year-old, while the Cherries will demand £40m-£50m. (Football Insider)

- Man United have made very positive progress in a meeting with the camp of Wolves forward Matheus Cunha. Key details on the salary structure of a contract until 2030 are settled, with only minor details remaining amid confidence that an agreement on personal terms can be reached soon. (Rudy Galetti)

- Tottenham have been watching Borussia Monchengladbach striker Tim Kleindienst, who could be available for €28m if the Bundesliga club fail to qualify for Europe. (Bild)

- Arsenal are facing competition from Borussia Dortmund and Internazionale for the signature of Brazilian forward Luighi. The 19-year-old Palmeiras player recently signed a new contract through to 2029 with a release clause of over £70m. (The Sun)

- Bayer Leverkusen,Bayern Munich and West Ham United are interested in AC Milan centre-back Malick Thiaw. (Nicolo Schira)

- Arsenal, Barcelona, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City are all interested in Flamengo right-back Wesley, with the Blues having made an initial contact with the 21-year-old's representatives. (Ekrem Konur)

- Everton are considering making a move to sign Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap ahead of Chelsea and Man United. (TEAMtalk)

- Lazio are looking at Borussia Monchengladbach left-back Luca Netz, while Valez Sarfield's Valentin Gomez, Valencia's Cristhian Mosquera, Lugano's Albian Hajdari and Leicester City's Wout Faes are being considered for the centre of their defence. (Corriere dello Sport)

- West Ham United are ahead of Newcastle United in their efforts to sign Southampton goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale, with the Hammers preparing an offer of around £20m. (Ekrem Konur)

- Maximo Perrone, on loan at Como from Manchester City, will stay at the Serie A club next season. Como have the option to extend the loan, but there are also talks over a permanent deal. (Fabrizio Romano)

- Leeds United are considering offering a contract to Jamie Vardy, who will leave Leicester City when his contract expires next month. (TEAMtalk)","{'href': 'https://www.espn.in', 'title': 'ESPN India'}","soccer"

Get San José Spotlight headlines delivered to your inbox.

The world's largest sporting event — the FIFA World Cup — is coming to the United States in 2026, and Santa Clara is one of the only cities not breaking the bank to prepare, a data analysis by San José Spotlight shows.

The games will be hosted across the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Nearly all of the 11 U.S. host cities have spent or are planning to spend millions upgrading their stadiums and improving other infrastructure ahead of the games, but Santa Clara's Measure J from 20210 protects the city's general fund. San José Spotlight compiled government budgets, meeting recordings and reporting from local news outlets nationwide to analyse how much U.S. taxpayer money is being spent to facilitate the World Cup.

“You have these other places that are taking some risks (and) we're taking a much more conservative approach,” Santa Clara Councilmember Karen Hardy told San José Spotlight. “That means (our) profit may be lower because of that, but we've also lowered our risk.”

Santa Clara has not spent any general fund money on Levi's Stadium, but the city is looking into marketing and revenue generation opportunities for 2026, while hosting Super Bowl 60 and the World Cup.

The Bay Area Host Committee is paying $25 million to modify the stadium's field per FIFA regulations. The Santa Clara City Council approved a reimbursement agreement with the host committee in February for most World Cup-related expenses.

Zaileen Janmohamed, president and CEO of the Bay Area Host Committee, said they have multiple partnerships with local businesses, including PNC Bank and NBC Sports. She's confident the committee will meet its financial targets to host the Super Bowl and World Cup games in 2026.

Every host committee submitted a joint federal funding request of $625 million. On top of that, the Bay Area Host Committee partnered with FIFA World Cup 26 Los Angeles to submit a joint funding request to the state.

“We're proud to have worked collaboratively to establish a ‘no risk, all reward' agreement for the city of Santa Clara, ensuring that costs related to public safety will be considered approved expenses and covered by the Bay Area Host Committee,” Janmohamed told San José Spotlight.



Most other host cities lack a similar agreement. For example, the Georgia Legislature sent $29.25 million to the Georgia World Congress Center Authority to cover World Cup costs relating to “public safety, security, transportation and infrastructure expenses and implementation” at Mercedez-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.

Some stadiums are in need of repairs separate from the World Cup, such as NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, where the Houston Chronicle reported the Harris County Sports and Convention Corporation is spending $35 million on a new roof, video boards and more.

Not every city's expenditures are finalized. According to Torched, Los Angeles hasn't set aside any money to help host its World Cup games. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass convened members of the Los Angeles County Congressional Delegation March 2025 to discuss the city's hosting duties for major events, including the World Cup and the 2028 Olympics and Paralympics.

Victor Matheson, professor of economics at the College of the Holy Cross, questioned the justification for some expenditures. For example, Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts is privately owned by the Kraft Group, and the Boston Globe reported that World Cup Boston 2026 host committee is looking for $170 million from local governments and private investors.

Matheson, who specializes in mega sporting events, is skeptical they'll get the full cost from government funding, as the state has been reluctant to use public money to fund private events.

“There's no reason that a $5 billion nonprofit company from Switzerland should be receiving a bunch of handouts from Massachusetts taxpayers,” Matheson told San José Spotlight, referring to FIFA.

He added these mega events usually overstate their economic impact because it disregards other tourism that might occur. For Santa Clara, Matheson said he expects San Francisco will see a bigger boost in tourism once again.

Michael Leeds, a Temple University professor who specializes in sports economics, said he isn't against government spending on mega sports events so long as officials are honest about the real benefits. In the World Cup's case, hosting brings thousands of people from around the world for entertainment and fun — not a large economic boost.

“If we're there saying, ‘Hey, wouldn't this be fun,' … if the people there say, ‘Yeah, we really want to do this, we think it'd be great,' then fine,” Leeds told San José Spotlight. “Just don't try to wrap it up in a package that says we're going to give a big boost to the local economy.”
Tom Knecht, professor of political science specializing in sports politics at Westmont College, said he doesn't support using taxpayer dollars on stadiums, especially since stadiums are not “public goods.”

“A dollar spent on one thing is a dollar not spent on another,” Knecht told San José Spotlight. “If you're going to spend a dollar on the stadium, refurbishing it, that's a dollar not spent on police or schools.”

SuperSport on DStv, GOtv and Showmax is proud to announce that all 63 matches of the FIFA Club World Cup 25 will be available live after acquiring the broadcast rights for Sub-Saharan Africa.

The brand-new expanded format will debut in the United States this year, with the tournament starting from 14th June to 13th July 2025.

It will be the 21st edition of FIFA's flagship international club competition, featuring some of the biggest clubs and the biggest names in the football universe.

South Africa's Premier Soccer League champions Mamelodi Sundowns, who won the 2016 CAF Champions League, will be among the four CAF representatives, alongside Egyptian giants Al Ahly, Wydad AC (currently coached by former Sundowns and Orlando Pirates coach Rhulani Mokwena) and Espérance de Tunis.

Twelve European giants will feature in the competition, including tournament holders Manchester City, Spanish giants and record five-time winners Real Madrid, 2021 winners Chelsea, two-time winners Bayern Munich as well as Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan and Porto.

Alex Okyere, Managing Director, MultiChoice Ghana, says: “As Africa's biggest sports broadcaster, we are proud to be able to bring fans the best in sporting action; to bring them the biggest names in the game and, of course, the biggest clubs coming up against one another. We are especially honoured to partner with FIFA to bring the new format of the FIFA Club World Cup 25 to Sub-Saharan Africa viewers.

“As we've seen with some innovations on the European continent with the new UEFA club competition format, fans are primed for fresher approaches to long-standing traditional tournaments.

“We see the FIFA Club World Cup 25's evolution from seven participating teams to the staggering 32 teams as a move that will pique the football interest of passionate fans. SuperSport cannot wait to be at the forefront of this historic transformation and to give the viewer a front-row seat to the global spectacle.”

The crème de la crème of global club football will descend on the US, hosts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as Brazilian outfits Palmeiras, Flamengo, Fluminense and Botafogo are joined by Argentine foes River Plate and Boca Juniors. Lionel Messi's Inter Miami CF have also qualified for the tournament as hosts and have been grouped with African giants Al Ahly, Palmeiras and FC Porto.

Sundowns have been drawn into Group F alongside Fluminense FC, Borussia Dortmund, and Ulsan HD from Korea. Wydad AC will tussle with Manchester City, Al Ain FC from the UAE and Juventus FC in Group G. SuperSport's full broadcast information will be communicated closer to the start of the tournament.

The Egyptian King has racked up 28 goals and 18 assists this season alone and he's not done yet...

Lifting team trophies is what motivates Mohamed Salah. He wouldn't have signed a new contract with Liverpool otherwise. There was more money to be made in the Middle East but more glory on offer on Merseyside. As he said after Liverpool claimed a record-equalling 20th title last weekend, ""All teams win games but, in the end, there's only one champion - that's what history remembers.""

However, Salah is very clearly and quite justifiably proud of the pivotal role he played in his side's success. Amid the wild scenes of celebration at Anfield sparked by Sunday's 5-1 rout of Spurs, the Egyptian even revealed that he told Arne Slot before the start of the season that a reduction in his defensive duties would result in an increase in his offensive output. ""I am glad that I did that,"" Salah told Sky Sports. ""The manager listened and now you can see the numbers.""

Indeed, this season's haul of 28 goals and 18 assists would suggest that, at 32, Salah is arguably playing as well as ever before. He has broken a plethora of records over the past nine months, and, having just extended his stay at Liverpool until 2027, could easily end up smashing several more...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The fans were ecstatic when the goal-scoring icon bought the club in September 2018 but now they can't wait for him to leave

After a dramatic but draining draw with European rivals Inter on Wednesday night, Barcelona return to domestic action this weekend when they take on Real Valladolid on Saturday evening. Victory is imperative for La Liga's leaders, who are starting to feel the effects of playing nearly every four days since the start of the season, as they look to maintain their four-point lead over second-placed Real Madrid going into a crucial Clasico at Montjuic on May 11.

However, Barcelona really couldn't have picked a better team to play in the middle of an already-epic Champions League semi-final tie with Inter. Real Valladolid aren't just bad; they're historically bad, having been relegated from the Spanish top flight with a record-breaking five rounds remaining. They're also a club in complete crisis. Indeed, things are going so badly on the field because the situation is so dire off it.

It wasn't meant to be like this, of course, not with a footballing icon for a president. Ronaldo promised to have Valladolid fighting for Champions League qualification by now; instead, they're once again heading back to the second division. Consequently, the calls for the Brazilian to ""go home"" have only intensified the longer the season has gone on and another mass protest is expected at the Jose Zorrilla on Saturday.

So, how did it come to this? How did one of the game's most beloved characters become such a figure of hate at Valladolid? GOAL explains all below...

The young stars of the ATP Tour have impressed throughout 2025, picking up titles and rising up the rankings.

All four ATP Tour players who have won ‘big' titles in 2025 (Grand Slams and Masters 1000s) are under the age of 24.

23-year-old Jannik Sinner won the Australian Open in January, picking up his third Major title, with a straight sets win over Alexander Zverev.

Shortly after, Jack Draper beat Holger Rune, 6-2, 6-2, to clinch his maiden Masters 1000 title at Indian Wells.

Transitioning onto clay courts, Carlos Alcaraz won the Monte-Carlo Masters, as the Spaniard picked up his 18th tour-level title before his 22nd birthday.

However, it was a player younger than all three who won at the Miami Open earlier this year, as one top coach now claims he is competing at a level much higher than his ranking would suggest.

Speaking on Instagram, Naomi Osaka's coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, shared his thoughts on the Czech teenager.

A post shared by THE COACH (@patrickmouratoglou)

“[Jakub] Mensik is not top ten yet because he's coming from far, and he's rising fast in the rankings, and it takes time to reach the top ten,” said Mouratoglou.

“Don't forget that he won a Masters 1000 in Miami just a few weeks ago, beating Novak [Djokovic] in the final, so his level is much higher than his ranking.”

Mouratoglou's thoughts came as part of a wider discussion, reacting to Alexander Bublik's comments about the state of men's tennis during his defeat to Mensik in Madrid.

“Remember when tennis was easy, like five years ago, it was so easy to play tennis,” said Bublik to umpire Mohamed Lahyani.

“You had a bunch of random people in the top 50, barely moving.

“Now this guy [Mensik] is not even top five, not even top ten. The f— is that?”

Mouratoglou disagreed with Bublik's comments, suggesting that using Mensik as an example of tennis becoming stronger was unfair.

“As much as I love [Alexander] Bublik, I cannot agree with him,” he said.

“For me, it's more that he was losing; he was emotional in his own way, which is to be funny and say crazy things.

“He says the top 50 is so much stronger now than five years ago. I don't think so. He cannot take Mensik as an example.

“He feels ‘Oh, this guy is ranked that level, but he plays top ten'. Which is probably true. On hard court for sure, and if not on clay yet, probably soon.

“So he's playing a guy whose ranking is lower than his real level. So that's why he has that feeling, but I don't feel like that feeling is true in general in the top 50.

“I feel like the level is extremely high. Every player is in danger in any round, but I think it was the case already five years ago.”

Mensik beat Bublik, 6-3, 6-2, to advance to the Madrid Open quarterfinals, where he fell to defeat against Francisco Cerundolo.

The 19-year-old has enjoyed a fantastic start to his season, shocking the world in March when Mensik beat Djokovic to claim the title in Miami.

Mensik then backed that performance up with a strong run to the last eight in Madrid, where Cerundolo put an end to his nine-match Masters 1000 winning streak.

On Monday, Mensik will rise to 21st in the world rankings, a career-high for the Czech star, although his performances in the ‘ATP Race' help tell the full story.

The 19-year-old has accumulated the seventh most points of any player in the men's game so far this year, outlining his top-ten credentials.

Not only is Mensik on pace to reach the top ten, but he also currently resides in the qualification spots for this year's ATP Finals in Turin.

It remains to be seen if Mensik can continue in this rich vein of form throughout the remainder of 2025, but you wouldn't want to bet against it.

The 19-year-old is set to return to action at the Italian Open, which begins on Monday, May 5.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

With Jannik Sinner suspended, Carlos Alcaraz injured, and Novak Djokovic slumping, the Mutua Madrid Open title was always going to be up for grabs. Sure enough, a relatively surprising final showdown is in store for Sunday afternoon. Even more surprising than the Jack Draper vs. Casper Ruud matchup is the fact that this marks their first-ever meeting. That's right; despite having been on tour for more than six seasons together, they have never gone head-to-head. On one hand, Ruud will be happy to see Draper for the first time on clay. On the other hand, this isn't your traditional clay-court tournament. Conditions at high altitude are fast and favorable for big hitters. This also isn't your traditional Draper. The current version of Draper is physically fit and playing incredible tennis. The 23-year-old Brit has already captured one Masters 1000 title in 2025 (Indian Wells) and he is one win away from another following straight-set victories in Madrid over Tallon Griekspoor, Matteo Berrettini, Tommy Paul, Matteo Arnaldi, and Lorenzo Musetti.This result is more unexpected for Ruud given that he had played five events in succession without winning more than two matches in a row. The 15th-ranked Norwegian has suddenly strung together five wins, beating Arthur Rinderknech, Sebastian Korda, Taylor Fritz, Daniil Medvedev, and Francisco Cerundolo. He also hasn't dropped a single set.

Unfortunately for Ruud, it's still not all good news. The 26-year-old appeared to be less than 100 percent against Cerundolo on Friday because of a rib injury.“I wasn't sure I was going to be able to finish the match, honestly,” Ruud admitted. “I felt something in my rib during the warmup, just towards the end before going out (on court), and I felt it in nearly every shot–especially the serve. Luckily I got some quick treatment on it. There's not too much you can do, you only have three minutes (with the physio). So I will go and check it out more.”Even worse news for Ruud is that Draper is simply on fire right now. Moreover, Draper's lefty serve and forehand should work extremely well in exploiting Ruud's weakness–which is the backhand side. For multiple reasons, you have to like Draper's chances of bagging a second Masters 1000 title.Pick: Draper in 2    199WWW: Draper vs. Ruud? You have already voted

Ruud – Draper: 04.05.2025 18:30 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Casper Ruud has won five straight matches. The Norwegian won all five matches in straight sets this week in Madrid. Ruud defeated Fritz in the 1/8-Finals 7-5 6-4. He was a better player throughout the whole match. In the quarterfinals, he defeated Medvedev in straight sets. Ruud was great under pressure, saving both breakpoints he offered. Today, Cerundolo put up a big fight against Ruud in the semifinals, but he couldn't handle the pressure. Ruud won 6-4 7-5, saving fifteen out of eighteen breakpoints. He was break down in both sets, but turned them around. Last season in Madrid, Ruud reached the fourth round, losing against Auger-Aliassime in straight sets.

Jack Draper has won five straight matches. Draper won the opening match against Griekspoor this week in Madrid in straight sets. He offered and saved only one breakpoint. Berrettini retired against Draper in the third round after losing the opening set 6-7. In the quarterfinals, Arnaldi had no answer for the Brit's game. Draper was relentless on his serve, not offering any breakpoints. Today, in the semifinals, the Brit defeated Musetti in straight sets. He was a better player from the beginning until the end.

According to the bookies, Draper is the slight favourite in this matchup, but we disagree. Ruud is one of the best clay-court players in the world. On the other hand, Draper has been one of the most consistent players on hard courts for the last couple of months. However, he never had any success on clay courts. Last season, Draper won only four clay-court matches. We expect Ruud to put up a big fight and keep this match close.

That being said, Ruud covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Casper Ruud +2.5 games handicap @1.83 @bet365

We strongly believe Ruud's clay experience will be crucial in this match. He has a better forehand than Draper, and we believe he will be a better player tomorrow. If you love to take risks, there is a value bet on Ruud winning the match.

That being said, Ruud winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Casper Ruud winning @2.75 @bet365

Ruud played ten sets this week in Madrid and never got to a tiebreak. On the other hand, Berrettini has played nine sets and played two tiebreaks. The serve will not make much of a difference in this final. We expect many break chances and many breaks.

That being said, no tiebreaks in the match is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: under 0.5 tiebreaks @1.63 @bet365

It has been a breakthrough season for Jack Draper, who won his first ATP Masters 1000 event at Indian Wells and will try to claim another trophy at the level on Sunday against Casper Ruud in the Mutua Madrid Open final.

ATPTour.com recently caught up with Draper at the beginning of his run to the title at the Californian ATP Masters 1000 to discuss the struggles that have led to his success and how the steps in his journey have added up, allowing him to become one of the best players in the world.

What has been your greatest success?
I think the results are important, but I think [it is about] the grind of coming through a lot of different adversities, through the Challengers and the Futures and getting to this level, being in the position I'm in and playing in amazing tournaments. I remind myself of how much I've come through to get to this point. So, I suppose just dealing with the adversity I've gone through to this point.

What is the greatest difficulty or adversity that you've had to overcome?
Tennis is quite an individual, lonely sport at times. And I think sometimes, mentally, it can get quite difficult. But I see it all as a challenge. And I think with injuries and many different things, I've had a lot of times where I've been quite lost with it. But I'm in a really stable, good place, and I think that's the biggest win I have. 

 

What has been the most unique moment in your career? 
I've had many, many amazing experiences playing in top tournaments. I think being able to play Djokovic and Rafa early on in my career on the biggest courts in the world. I played Djokovic at Wimbledon Centre Court and Rafa in Melbourne. To play those legends of the game was incredible at such a young age.

What is your favourite ATP tournament?
I've got to say [Indian Wells is] up there. Maybe Tokyo Open. Big fan of that one. I love the people. I think it's a great tournament. Obviously, a great city. My racquet brand is Dunlop, and I've always had a close relationship with them, and they always treated me incredibly well when I'm there. I'd say I feel very at home there. The fans are just unbelievable as well.

What's the coolest off-court experience you've been able to enjoy being a pro tennis player?
Travelling from city to city, to see the world many, many times over... I've had so many, it's tough to think about one. But in general, just seeing the cities and seeing the different cultures, and that always blows my mind.



On the court, what is your favourite tennis rivalry?
I used to watch Murray when I was younger. Obviously, I could say, Djokovic and Rafa, stuff like that. But with the British angle, I love watching Murray-Djokovic, Murray-Rafa. I'll say Murray-Rafa. I used to love that matchup.

Who's your greatest rival?
I feel like I'm yet to find it on the ATP Tour. Since I was very young, I've had lots in the U.K. And one of the guys who's emerging onto the Tour now is Jacob Fearnley. He's a good friend and a crazy good competitor as well. So I'd say, since I was young, it's probably been him. I'm looking forward to hopefully playing him many times being from the same country as well.

The Rome Open will serve as the third clay-court Masters 1000 event of the season, following Monte-Carlo and Madrid. It also marks the last major tournament on clay before Roland Garros. Just under a week from the start of play, tournament organizers have announced the impressive prize money totals that will be distributed among standout participants.

According to the official ATP Tour website, the total prize pool for the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, held in Rome and featuring both men's and women's singles and doubles draws, will be €8,055,385 (approximately $9.1 million).

The champion will earn €985,030 (around $1.11 million), while the runner-up will take home more than $590,000. Semifinalists will receive nearly $330,000. Prize money scales down for players eliminated in earlier rounds, with first-round exits earning around $23,000.

But the financial reward isn't the only motivation to go deep in the draw. As with all Masters 1000 events, the tournament carries significant prestige and offers a large number of ATP ranking points, which could prove decisive in shaping the standings.

Rafael Nadal holds the record for most Rome Open titles (10)

The tournament winner will collect 1,000 points, while the runner-up earns 650. Semifinalists will receive 400 points, quarterfinalists 200, and points continue to decrease for earlier exits, all the way down to 10 points for a first-round loss.

World No. 6 Jack Draper opens up on reaching Madrid Open final against Casper Ruud

The Rome Masters 1000 is set to run from May 7 to May 18—just a week before Roland Garros begins. The tight schedule has prompted some players to skip the Italian event in order to rest and prepare fully for the French Open.

The first to officially withdraw from Rome was Novak Djokovic, who announced his decision in late April, shortly after suffering an early elimination in the first round of the Madrid Open against Matteo Arnaldi. Still, the Serbian star might not be the only notable absence.

Carlos Alcaraz missed Madrid due to an adductor injury and expressed a desire to compete in Italy. “My mindset is to do everything it takes to be a hundred percent for Rome,” he said. But he also made it clear that his ultimate focus lies elsewhere: “My hope is to play in Rome. If not, next tournament is Roland Garros for me… A Grand Slam is a Grand Slam.”

Rafael Nadal holds the record for most Rome Open titles, winning 10 out of 12 finals played. Behind him is Novak Djokovic with six championships. However, with Nadal now retired and Djokovic sitting out this year's edition, the title race is wide open.

One of the leading favorites is World No. 2 Alexander Zverev, a two-time Rome Open champion (2017, 2024). The only other former champion in the draw is Daniil Medvedev. Finally, all eyes will be on Jannik Sinner—not only because he's Italian and the current World No. 1, but also because this will be his first tournament back following a three-month doping suspension.

Ernests Gulbis, born in 1988 in Latvia, comes from an accomplished and affluent family. He is the son of businessman Ainars Gulbis, who built his fortune in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Gulbis excelled in sports from a young age, competing in basketball and swimming before ultimately focusing on tennis during his teenage years. This decision led him to a career where he faced tennis icons such as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic.

Gulbis trained at the prestigious Nikola Pilic Academy in Germany, the same facility where Novak Djokovic honed his craft. The two were contemporaries, sharing the court during their formative years. However, Gulbis always set himself apart, famously declaring, “When he [Djokovic] started winning titles, his eyes changed”.

Skipping much of the junior circuit, Gulbis transitioned early to professional tournaments, carving his path to the ATP. Despite his raw talent, he garnered a reputation for his unfiltered comments and controversial demeanor. Early in his career, Gulbis stirred the pot by stating, “Luckily for me, money is not an issue. I don't play for money or fame. My motivation is to prove I can be better than everyone else”.

Rafael Nadal and Ernests Gulbis faced off seven times, with Nadal winning every encounter. Yet one match stands out—the 2010 Rome Masters semifinal, where Gulbis pushed Nadal to the brink before falling 1-6, 7-5, 6-4. Afterward, Nadal remarked, “If being better means hitting the ball as hard as possible without caring where it lands, then yes, he was better than me”.

Gulbis' crowning achievement came at the 2014 French Open, where he stunned Roger Federer in a five-set thriller during the fourth round. The Latvian triumphed 6-7, 7-6, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, showcasing his fearless approach. It was one of only two victories Gulbis secured against Federer in their five meetings, the other being at the 2010 Rome Masters.

Gulbis reached his career-high ranking of world No. 10 in 2014 after a standout performance at Roland Garros, where he made the semifinals. Known for his explosive game and unpredictable results, his talent often shone in individual matches rather than over sustained tournaments.

Between 2010 and 2014, Gulbis claimed six ATP titles, all at the 250 level. His first came in Delray Beach in 2010, and his last in Nice in 2014. Injuries and a lack of consistency plagued his later years, though he briefly reemerged in 2018, reaching the Stockholm final before losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas. Gulbis officially retired in 2024.

Novak Djokovic's decision to pull out of next week's Rome Masters appeared to suggest he was happy to go into the French Open with just two clay court defeats on his record for this season, but he has a chance to put that right.

Djokovic's defeat against Alejandro Tabilo in Monte Carlo and his loss against Matteo Arnaldi in his first match at the Madrid Open set alarm bells ringing louder than ever as a player who will toast his 38th birthday this month admitted he may be running out of time to win a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title.

“Kind of new reality for me, I have to say,” said Djokovic after the defeat against Arnaldi.

“You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament. It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it's kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face this kind of sensation on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournaments.

“I guess, the circle of life and the career (smiling), eventually it was going to happen. Now I'm trying to, you know, use this as a driving force for the future. Obviously, Grand Slams, I was saying many times, are the most important tournaments for me.

Novak Djokovic backed to ‘turn it on' and win a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title

‘I still don't feel it's enough for me' – Novak Djokovic makes telling motivation comment

“Which doesn't mean that I don't want to win here, of course I wanted to, but Grand Slams are where I really want to play the best tennis. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that in Roland Garros, but I'll do my best.”

Djokovic may have been wise to step away from the game for a few weeks, with his motivation to play in regular ATP Tour events waning for some time now.

Yet he faced a similar scenario last year and came up with an unexpected solution.

While his performances in Monte Carlo and Madrid were not quite as poor as they were this year, Djokovic felt the need to get more matches on clay under his belt before heading to Roland Garros and opted to enter the ATP 250 tournament in Geneva.

The three matches he played in that event in Switzerland gave him some momentum heading into the second Grand Slam of the year and he got through to the quarter-finals in Paris before being forced to pull out with an injury.

Djokovic could follow a similar path this year and he could also enter the ATP 500 event in Hamburg in the same week when the Geneva tournament is being played.

World No 1 Jannik Sinner has entered Hamburg as he looks to build up match practice following his three-month drug ban, with the prospect of Djokovic not playing any more matches ahead of Roland Garros a gamble he should avoid taking.

“Pressure is part of the sport and part of what we do on this highest level, so it's never going to go away, it's just a different kind of pressure now,” he added in his final comments before he left Madrid.

“Every time I step on the court I feel the nerves, I feel stress, I feel everything that I guess all the other players feel, and excitement as well. So, still like to compete, it became a bit more challenging for me, to be honest.

“Of course, I'll do my best for the future. Grand Slam, I'm not going into Roland Garros as one of the main favourites. Maybe that can help, I don't know, we'll see.”

Taylor Fritz has also confirmed he will play in Hamburg so Djokovic could face strong opposition if he decides to play one more clay court event before his assault on another Roland Garros title.

A renowned former Wimbledon tennis player and 'pillar' of the Isle of Wight community has died at the age of 90.

Beloved Ryde resident Patricia (Pat) Maclean twice reached the fourth round of Wimbledon's singles tournament and was a two-time women's doubles quarter-finalist.

Born in Acton, London, on November 11, 1934, Pat moved to the Island after meeting her husband Ken Maclean.

Together, they had two children, Alistair and Sheena.

As a tennis player, Pat had a celebrated career, going on to represent Great Britain in the 1954 Wightman Cup.

Beyond her time on the court, she dedicated her life to coaching and inspiring young athletes.

Pat and husband Ken (Image: Contributed) She passed down her wisdom and passion for the sport by mentoring young sportsmen and women.

As recently as 2024, Pat visited Wimbledon with members of Ryde's Mead Lawn Tennis Club, watching a range of elite matches and even bumping into Cliff Richard.

Despite rubbing shoulders with tennis stars and celebrities on her frequent trips to Wimbledon, Pat's heart always remained with the Ryde community.

After Ken died in 2011, Pat moved to Brigstocke Terrace in Ryde, overlooking Mead Lawn Tennis Club, where she taught many years ago.

Earlier this year, Pat was awarded the Freedom of Ryde, acknowledging her sporting achievements, and the love, dedication and inspiration she brought to the town.

Presenting the award, mayor of Ryde, Cllr Richard May, said: ""Pat Maclean's name is etched into Ryde's sporting history.

""It is a privilege to present this award to someone who has shaped so many lives with kindness and passion.""

Alistair and Sheena said their mother's death on Thursday came as a ""bit of a shock"". Pat had recently been through major cancer surgery for the third time and was getting much better, they said.

Pat lived for her social life and she will be very much missed by her friends and family, including her two grandsons, Archie, 10, and William, 11, they added.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}","tennis"

Lorenzo Musetti has enjoyed a blistering start to his clay-court season, reaching the semi-finals of both Masters 1000 events.

The Italian star produced some of his best tennis in the principality, as Musetti lost to Carlos Alcaraz in the final of the Monte-Carlo Masters, 6-3, 1-6, 0-6.

Carrying that momentum through to Madrid, Musetti took down Tomas Martin Etcheverry, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Alex de Minaur, and Gabriel Diallo on his way to the semi-finals.

There, Musetti lost to British star Jack Draper, 3-6, 6-7, as his run at the Madrid Open came to an end.

Ahead of his return to action at the Italian Open next week, Musetti has been told what he must now do if he wants to compete for Grand Slam titles.

Speaking on Instagram, top WTA coach Patrick Mouratoglou, gave his verdict on the world number 11.

A post shared by THE COACH (@patrickmouratoglou)

“He is globally too passive,” said Mouratoglou.

“That's why his matches during Monte-Carlo were up and down all the time, because he was constantly hesitating between I'm going to go, I'm going to take my chance, I have to dictate. Or, I hope the guy is going to miss, I'm going to slice, I'm going to play up, I'm going to defend, and it's going to work.

“He's lost a lot of first sets during this Open, badly, and then he was sometimes even a break down. Then he suddenly starts to play, starts to be offensive, starts to dictate, and then the match completely switches.

“I hope it's a good lesson for him, this tournament, because he's such a good player. 

“If he manages his will more, his determination to be the one dictating and being defensive only when he has no other option. His level would go crazy up.”

The Frenchman then shared whether he believes Musetti can compete for Grand Slam titles.

“Is Lorenzo Musetti close or far to playing Grand Slam finals?” asked Mouratoglou.

“It only depends on him. Lorenzo Musetti is a great player. He has everything in his game.

“The movement, such a good mover. The forehand, the backhand, the touch, he can volley, he is a complete player with a huge ball quality.

“The ball is really super lively when he hits the ball, he can accelerate anytime, and he can accelerate with his backhand and with his forehand.

“I think that's why he likes clay the most.”

Mouratoglou thinks Musetti has everything to compete at the highest level, should he start to dictate points on a more frequent basis.

But how has he performed at the four Major tournaments throughout his ATP career to date?

The Italian has produced his best tennis at Roland Garros over the years, consistently winning matches at the event, reaching the fourth round twice (2021, 2024).

However, in 2024, Musetti made big strides on grass, having previously won just two matches in London.

Musetti's run to the last four of Wimbledon in 2024 was his career-best result at a Grand Slam, securing several impressive wins at SW19.

The Italian's quarterfinal win was the pick of the bunch, as Musetti took down America's Taylor Fritz in a five-set thriller on Court 1.

He did, however, fail in his bid to reach a maiden Grand Slam final, losing to seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in the semis.

It remains to be seen whether Musetti will reach a Major final in 2025, but if he keeps playing as he has done on clay so far this year, it wouldn't come as too much of a surprise to see him make waves in Paris next month.

Not long ago, the Tennis world was ruled by two gladiators, and the audience was equally balanced on both sides. However, as the fight for the baton was on, there emerged a new kingpin, who not only spoiled the party of the fans of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal but also cemented his reign by leapfrogging the stalwarts. Despite being the undisputed GOAT in terms of titles won, Novak Djokovic had to wait a long time to get somewhat same love that the other two members of Big 3 received. He eventually got the acknowledgement and now stands on the verge of becoming the first-ever tennis player to win 25 Grand Slam titles.

Novak Djokovic's former coach and Wimbledon 2001 winner Goran Ivanisevic made an honest reflection on why the Serbian wasn't thrown the same light which Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal basked in. He shed light on the double standards the tennis world showcased with Djokovic.



“One is Swiss, one is Spanish, then comes a guy from Serbia,” said Ivanisevic in an exclusive interview. “He says what he thinks, he says what others think, but won't say it. He was trashed in a million ways, I was there with him, I know everything. Why? Because he had his own opinion,” he added, recalling the flak Djokovic received during his Covid vaccination ordeal.

“Everything he says is somehow against the Western world, just because he speaks the truth and the truth sometimes hurts,” continued Ivanisevic.



“People don't want to hear it, but he never feared saying it. But he proved them wrong on the court, and they can't take that from him. You don't have to like him, but you have to respect him. Eventually, they had to acknowledge him, because he's the greatest (tennis player of all time).”

Djokovic may not become a fan-favorite like Roger and Rafa, but this aspect may not echo in the grander scheme of things. The Serbian has left his footprints on the game to an extent that an eternity may not be enough to erase them.

Who's turf is this? That might be the first question we want to ask before this final, considering that there's no head-to-head history between the 23-year-old Brit and the 26-year-old Norwegian.Because the surface is clay, you'd be tempted to say the conditions favor Ruud, a two-time Roland Garros runner-up. Ruud has won 11 of his 12 titles on the surface, while this is Draper's first final on it.But there are different varieties of dirt, and different locations where it exists. Madrid's mountainous altitude helps make its clay among the fastest anywhere. Its closest sibling might be the hard courts in the Indian Wells desert, a place where Draper just won his biggest title to date.This isn't to say that he has always found the Caja Magica so magical; Draper was 0-2 there before this year. But the ball has been bouncing up and into his high strike zone over the last two weeks, and he has been punishing it, especially with his lefty forehand. He hasn't dropped a set so far, and has had two especially impressive wins: An eyebrow-raising 6-2, 6-2 rout of Tommy Paul, and a tougher grind against a true clay-courter in Lorenzo Musetti. Draper came into this clay season with momentum from Indian Wells, and a vow to do better on dirt, and now he has.Draper credits an unimpeachable left-handed role model—Rafael Nadal—for his improvement on the surface.“I think definitely things I can learn from the way he looked for his forehand, the way he dictates, and the way he bullies opponents, especially on the clay,” Draper says of Nadal. “I think that's definitely something I'm learning how to do, look for my forehand more, and try and dictate what I'm trying to do, for sure.”

Ruud is also a (literal) student of the Spaniard, and his road to his first final here has been a worthy one as well. He has wins over Taylor Fritz, Daniil Medvedev, and Francisco Cerundolo this week, all in tight two-setters. Ruud has had a so-so 2025 up until now, and his perennial Top 10 ranking had shriveled to No. 15. He was due for a performance that would put him back in the Paris conversation, and now he has it. He also has a chance to rectify a surprising stat: His lack of a Masters 1000 title.Ruud cites a new focus on his mental health for his uptick.“It's a tough life in many ways, and a lot of travel days, and it just got to a point where it got felt like it was getting too much,” he said earlier in the week. “But I really seeked help, and it's been working, so I'm happy to feel more joy and feel like I'm in a better place…I'm happy that I was honest with myself and felt like I needed some help, and it's been paying off quite quickly.”Both of these guys have won half of their finals: Ruud is 12 of 24; Draper is three of six. Draper is currently ranked nine spots higher at No. 6, he already has a Masters win this year, in Indian Wells, and Ruud nursed a rib injury through his semifinal with Cerundolo.If he's healthy, though, this will be competitive. Both guys have excellent, bailout serves. They both have good feel. They're both content to rally with their topspin two-handed backhands. Will the match be won from the forehand side? Ruud's heavy topspin forehand is perfect for most clay courts, but Draper's flatter lefty version may be better for this clay. Winner: Draper👉 Click here for more news on the Mutua Madrid Open.

Both guys have excellent, bailout serves. They both have good feel. They're both content to rally with their topspin two-handed backhands. Will the match be won from the forehand side?

Are more flexible racquets really better for your arm?ByJon LeveyPublished May 03, 2025 copy_link

Jon Levey answers your Gear Q&A. Email your question to tennis.comproshop@gmail.com.I've had arm troubles in the past, and always play with flexible racquets. I've always heard they're easier on the arm. Recently I watched a video from a tennis influencer in which he claimed that his recent arm problems were caused by testing lots of very flexible racquets. He said these soft frames are more problematic for the arm than stiffer ones. Is he right?—Ryan A.Ryan,Declaring that flexible racquets are more detrimental to arm health is a bold flag to plant. It certainly flies in the face of conventional wisdom and probably physics. However, to be fair, the discussion isn't completely cut and dried.First off, when injuries arise it's easy to cast blame on equipment. My arm felt fine, now it suddenly hurts—what's up with this racquet? While the racquet can certainly be a piece of the puzzle, it's often not the underlying cause.Played frequently enough, repetitive motion sports like tennis can be tough on the body. Pro players take great care to safeguard their bodies against the stresses of the game, which is something even dedicated recreational players don't do enough of. Recency bias caused your influencer to point a finger at flexible frames, but the seeds of pain could have already been sown. Years of court time playing, testing equipment and just being an aging, modern human—crouched over typing on computers and phones—led to an overuse injury. It didn't matter which racquet.Believe me, I can relate. The worst elbow pain I ever encountered surfaced when I was playing with what would be considered a very arm-friendly racquet and string setup. When I sought help from a physical therapist, the culprit was actually limited shoulder mobility causing overexertion from my elbow. Addressing that issue, not a racquet change, is what brought relief.Even more damaging, though, is when the repetitive motion is far from textbook. Poor technique will cause more elbow problems than racquet composition. It's no different than doing any physical exercise with inefficient form. If your knees cave in when you sink down during a back squat, it's not the barbell's fault when those same knees start barking.

I am convinced that publishing the RA value does more harm than good. The flex of a racquet is way more complex than just one value at one specific location. Dennis Fabian, Global Business Manager for Head Racquets

All that said, if you do suffer from arm pain then it's true that more flexible frames—and softer strings—are generally considered better options. That's because they absorb more of the impact than stiffer frames and pass less shock to your arm. Which is what you want if you've got an inflamed joint. Keep in mind, other aspects such as a racquet's weight, balance, string pattern, dampening technologies and string choice factor in as well.A racquet's flex is primarily associated with its RA rating. This is typically measured with an expensive piece of equipment such as a Babolat RDC (racquet diagnostic center) machine. The range for most commercial racquets is from around 60 (lots of flex) to the low 70s (rigid). However, it's arm-friendliness doesn't necessarily correlate with this rating.“The ""conventional wisdom"" is just a rule of thumb and personally I am not a big fan of it,” says Dennis Fabian, Global Business Manager for Head Racquets. “I am convinced that publishing the RA value does more harm than good. The flex of a racquet is way more complex than just one value at one specific location.”What Fabian is referring to is flexibility being measured solely at the throat of the racquet. However, due to variances in a racquet's layup, it could be soft in that part of the frame but much firmer elsewhere. So it's conceivable that a racquet with a low RA rating can actually be quite stiff at impact, and not be particularly comfortable. Which is why many manufacturers find these stiffness ratings misleading and refrain from listing them on their racquets.In other words, just because a racquet is deemed flexible doesn't automatically mean it will play that way or be kind to your arm. Likewise, it's not a death sentence for your elbow either. There are playing characteristics you can often anticipate from certain specs, but nothing is guaranteed. If you want to know how your body will react to a certain racquet, hitting with it is really the only sure way to find out.

Saturday's action in Miami got off to the worst possible start for Charles Leclerc before the Sprint even got underway, as he crashed on his way to the grid amid heavy rain.

The Ferrari driver was heading to his starting spot of P6 for the Sprint when he drifted into the wall, severely damaging his front right tyre, and forcing him out of the 19-lap dash.

Leclerc complained about aquaplaning on the circuit as his team now have an intense repair job ahead of Qualifying for the Grand Prix later today, leaving Lewis Hamilton as their sole driver in the Sprint.

Despite Miami's reputation for warm weather, pouring rain meant that the track was unexpectedly damp ahead of the Sprint in which Kimi Antontelli will start from pole position for the first time in his F1 career.

Charles Leclerc was left downbeat about Ferrari's pace struggles after ending Sprint Qualifying at the Miami Grand Prix in P6, with team mate Lewis Hamilton – who will line up in P7 – also acknowledging that that there is “definitely work to do to pick up speed”.

Arriving into the weekend off the back of scoring his maiden podium of the season in Saudi Arabia, Leclerc ended Friday's sole practice session at the Miami International Autodrome in second place on the timesheets.

However, the Scuderia were unable to match the likes of Mercedes, McLaren and Red Bull's Max Verstappen in Sprint Qualifying, leaving Leclerc disappointed by the final result.

Asked how he was feeling about P6 following the session, the Monegasque answered: “Bad. The lap was good, but the pace is just not at all there for now, so it is a bit annoying.

Leclerc: ‘The lap was good but the pace is just not at all there'

Pushed on where the big losses had been during Friday's running, Leclerc added: “It's every corner really, it's not like we are particularly weak in one type of corner.

“Yes, the slow speed seems to be a bit more of our weakness, but it changes from one weekend to the other, so it is just not great.”

Hamilton echoed his team mate's sentiments about the pace difficulties, though the seven-time World Champion had some positive words about how Sprint Qualifying had unfolded.

“I thought it was a better session,” said Hamilton. “FP1 was a bit better, the car was a bit nicer to drive in FP1 but yeah, we are just lacking speed. [We'll] just keep working on it from there.”

‘There's definitely work to do to pick up speed' – Hamilton on P7 in Sprint Qualifying

On whether he expects to be able to make up much ground in Saturday's Sprint, Hamilton responded: “Not really, I think all the cars ahead are faster. Yeah, not much else to say.”

And in terms of if there are any ideas about what could be done differently ahead of main Qualifying and Sunday's Grand Prix, the Briton commented: “There are always ideas, whether or not they are going to be right or not, but there [are] definitely learnings to take from today, set-up changes we made and how the car behaved.

Jack Doohan has explained the pit lane ""mess up"" that left the Alpine driver frustrated over team radio, having missed out on progressing from SQ1 in Sprint Qualifying at the Miami Grand Prix.

The Australian rookie was caught up in frantic pit lane traffic late on in the first segment of the session, including the simultaneous release of his team mate Pierre Gasly, which prevented him from leaving his garage properly.

As a result Doohan was unable to make the turn out of the tight garage and subsequently lost time as he was pushed back into position, with a couple of other cars getting ahead in the pit lane queue.

That traffic cost him the chance of making it to the start line for his last flying lap and Doohan cut a frustrated figure as he exited the session in 17th.

“Man, that is not acceptable, that is not acceptable,” vented Doohan on team radio, with his engineer apologising for the situation that unfolded.

“If you are going to send him after me, you have to make sure he is ready or before me, I can't turn out and then have to turn in because he is going to run into me and then you guys put me out of Q1, that's a joke.”

Speaking in the media pen after the session, Doohan explained the incident that led to his radio message: “It all comes down to the last flying lap and I think that the feeling was good, but I just ended up getting blocked on my way out the pit lane which was a mess up, because it was from the other car.

“And then I wasn't able to do another flying lap. That's why they make the length of Quali that long, to do two laps and improve quite a lot on the second lap. I ended up being the last car out there and didn't get a chance to do a second timed lap.

Doohan exited Sprint Qualifying in the first segment

“I think the first lap was really, really messy – just trying a few things different from practice. But still I think it wasn't too bad, there was a lot more time in the car for the second lap. I guess we'll never know now.”

Looking ahead to Saturday's 19-lap Sprint, Doohan expects a tough battle from the rear of the grid, while team mate Pierre Gasly will start from 13th position.

“[I've] just [got to] try to move forward as much as possible. We have another shot at Quali tomorrow afternoon, Sprint will be a tough one, just learn as much as we can from that for the main race and then focus on Quali,” Doohan added.

Alpine Team Principal Oliver Oakes has addressed rumours that the team will replace Jack Doohan with reserve Franco Colapinto at the next round in Imola, insisting the Australian will be racing at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.

Speculation over Doohan's future at the team has been a frequent topic at the start of the season, initially fuelled by Alpine signing the highly-rated Colapinto as a reserve driver in January, following his nine-race stint with Williams last year.

Leading into this weekend's Miami Grand Prix, Horacio Marín, CEO of Argentine energy company YPF, which sponsors Colapinto, claimed – during an off-air moment in a TV interview – that the former Williams super-sub would debut with Alpine at the Emila-Romagna Grand Prix.

Asked about those comments in the team principals' press conference in Miami, Oakes poured cold water on the claims and stated that, as it stands, Doohan will be racing for Alpine in Imola.

Oakes confirmed Doohan would be driving in Imola when asked in Friday's press conference in Miami about the comments on Colapinto

“I saw it, like everyone else,” said Oakes. “I think it was a sponsor from Argentina off-camera giving his view on Franco, when he's going to be in the car.

""I'm sure there's a lot of people in Argentina who'd like him in the car this Sunday. We've been pretty open as a team that that's just noise.

""Jack needs to continue doing a good job. But it's natural that there's always speculation there.""

When asked directly if Doohan would be in the car at Imola, Oakes added: “Yeah, as it is today, Jack is our driver along with Pierre [Gasly]. We've been pretty clear on that. We always evaluate, but yeah – today, that is the case.”

Rookie Doohan will start Saturday's Sprint from a lowly 17th on the grid after a pit lane “mess up” prevented the Australian from completing his final flying lap in SQ1.

The 22-year-old was caught up in frantic pit lane traffic late on in the first segment of the session, including the simultaneous release of his team mate Pierre Gasly, which prevented him from leaving his garage properly and also led to a frustrated message over team radio.

The drama starring Queen Latifah was the last show at the network whose future remained in limbo.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


CBS has canceled its drama series The Equalizer, bringing the show to a close at the network after five seasons.


	The decision comes just two days before the show's fifth season finale on May 4. That episode will now serve as a series finale. Ratings for The Equalizer fell off a good amount this season as it moved to a later hour on Sunday nights; it averages a little under 6 million viewers with a week of Nielsen-measured delayed viewing (not including streaming), compared to 7.89 million last season.




	With the cancellation, CBS has no more scripted series from the 2024-25 season in limbo. The Equalizer joins fellow veteran dramas FBI: International and FBI: Most Wanted and first-year comedy Poppa's House in being canceled; the long-running Blue Bloods ended in December.

	Based on the 1985-89 series of the same name (which was also adapted into a trio of feature films starring Denzel Washington), The Equalizer stars Queen Latifah as Robyn McCall, a former CIA operative turned freelance problem solver. Tory Kittles, Adam Goldberg, Liza Lapira, Laya DeLeon Hayes and Lorraine Toussaint also star. 


	CBS had developed a potential spinoff series starring Titus Welliver and Juani Feliz but later opted not to go ahead with it. Welliver and Feliz guest-starred in an April episode that would have set up the spinoff. 


The Equalizer is a co-production of Universal Television and CBS Studios. The show's executive producers are Joseph C. Wilson, Dana Owens (Queen Latifah), Debra Martin Chase, Shakim Compere, John Davis, John Fox, Loretha Jones and Rob Hanning.


	CBS will announce its 2025-26 schedule on May 7. Keep up with all the network cancellations, renewals and new series orders with THR's broadcast scorecard.

Michelle Lewis, CEO of the Songwriters of North America and a close friend of Sobule's, remembers the groundbreaking artist after she tragically died in a house fire. 


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


The music industry was shocked this week upon the news that groundbreaking singer-songwriter Jill Sobule died in a house fire outside of Minneapolis on Thursday at age 66. Sobule, beloved among the songwriter community and known for her political activism, broke through in the '90s with songs like “I Kissed a Girl” and “Supermodel.” The former was the first openly gay song to crack the top 20 on the Billboard charts, the latter was featured in the 1995 film Clueless. 


Among the many friends of Sobule still in disbelief is Michelle Lewis, a longtime friend and the CEO of the Songwriters of North America (SONA). Lewis and Sobule wrote frequently together since the pair met in the mid-2000s. She was preparing to see Sobule soon before she heard the news of Sobule's passing, as Sobule was supposed to stay at Lewis's home in Los Angeles next week when she came into town.

Lewis says she “hasn't been able to move past shock” as she still comes to terms with what's happened. “She was an otherworldly figure, just magical,” she says. 


In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter a day after Sobule's death, Lewis describes her friend as a one of a kind writer driven purely by her own creative expression, and a nomadic artist who lived her life freely in whatever way she wanted.


	Jill was definitely not like anyone you've ever met. I know that in itself is a cliche You're going hear all those things like about marching to her own drum. But when I say she's the only one of her kind, I mean literally, the only person like her. I can't make analogies that are human. She's like fairy dust, sparkle,  brilliance and originality. I can't think about her in terms of a human, she's not a normal human. People call Chappell Roan your favorite artist's favorite artist, Jill was that, a songwriter's songwriter. Every singer-songwriter's favorite singer-songwriter. 


	It didn't just play out in her music and her songs, but in how she lived her life. She was a vagabond. She didn't really plant roots. You never knew whether she was in New York or LA or on tour, and that's kind of the charm of her too. She filled the room with this whirlwind of whimsy. 


	Kay [Hanley, lead singer of Letters to Cleo] and I had a project/band called The Dilettantes. There was a revolving member. Lisa Loeb was one of them and did a song with us. Tracy Bonham did a song with us. Nina Gorden. Jill met us for the first time to do a Dilettante song. She thought it was really fun to write with two other women. She came into our world, and then she pulled us into her world. I learned the news from Kay, who called me sobbing, I didn't believe it. My phone just started blowing up. She was the favorite person to many of us. It will be one hell of a memorial.

	











	Every single call or text from Jill had the potential for an adventure. I never said no. Anytime she asked me to do something, I knew there would be an adventure attached to it, so I always said yes, even when I was pregnant with my son.


	We had this one adventure together where she asked me to write a song for Ariana Huffington's book release, which was going to include Ariana Huffington rapping. The book was called Right is Wrong, it was about how the right wing of politics tended to be wrong. We wrote this song around that title with a rap by Ariana in the middle. Ariana came to my home studio to record the rap, and then for the actual book release, we ended up on a private jet to Larry Ellison's house in San Francisco to perform the song with Ariana in front of Nancy Pelosi. This was 2007 before Obama was elected. That was one of my big adventures with Jill. Larry David and his wife were there, Nora Ephron. It was one of those ‘what is happening' kind of things, a wild ride. 


	That was just one of them. Another one was when we opened for Bernie Sanders on his 2016 presidential tour. We went to Iowa and did one of the rallies. We performed as the “Sandrews Sisters.” We wrote a song about net neutrality. She'd say there was an opportunity, I'd say ‘great, come over and we'll write it.' Kay would come through and do it too, and then there would be some weird opportunity to perform it in the house of a billionaire.


	She was never a namedropper. It was never flexing in any way. She completely transcended any of that bullshit part of celebrity and just floated above it. People like Kara Swisher loved her. She was a key player without being a player. She was like lesbian mafia. She was like a muse of a political movement and really satirized the more ridiculous things about the right wing. 

	











	The other thing that's kind of heartbreaking about this, so many people have been slogging through this political time. We're just waiting to get to the midterms wondering how we get through this without completely conceding democracy as we know it. And what we were looking forward to with working with Jill was to find an outlet for that fear and dread and exploring the flip side of the ridiculousness and the funny. That was always the exercise with her, finding the funny in the horrible. We were really looking forward to writing. It still hasn't hit me that we're not going to be able to do that. 


	She was untethered in the best way. Some people when they're untethered will float off, untethered is like a step to unhinged. But she was never unhinged. It was just a freedom that doesn't exist in people anymore, She was a free spirit. She didn't have kids, she had some serious relationships in her life. But part of the deal with her is that she was gonna be moving around. She was totally magnetic. And I could see people feeling a little jealous of that freedom that she had. But there was no other way she could be. 


	As a songwriter, she was inspiring, but also she brought it too. She was an inspiration for ideas, but never bossy or overwhelming. She was really good at playing with others, and ideal in a way, because she didn't judge your ideas, she didn't shut you down. She was just buoyant and had a constant flow. When we wrote, we were never trying to write hits or anything like that. We had an assignment, and we would stick to the assignment, which was to write a ridiculous song about something to do with policy or politics. It was never hard. It was always easy. 

	











	We were doing a lot of our adventuring when I was pregnant with my son. She knew him as a little kid, she'd see him every once in a while but didn't know him like she knew me. The last time she was here a few weeks ago, we were writing, and she stayed after. My son came home from school, he's 17 now. They dug each other, they really hit it off. She left and he went down this total Jill wormhole of her songwriting. The next day he raves about how she's this heavy songwriter and names all these songs like Underdog Victorious and Mexican wrestler. Because she's my friend, I completely took it for granted these genius moments. 


	That reminded me what a motherfucking songwriter she was, it's easy to forget when you're just thinking about her as your friend. For all the personality, the humor of her persona, underneath that was this songwriting brilliance that I really hope people discover, rediscover, and will truly appreciate. She was magical.

Marvel's star-studded ensemble pic led by Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan is winning over critics and audiences alike as it kicks off the summer box office season.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Marvel's Thunderbolts* is storming to a promising domestic opening in the $73 million to $77 million range after topping Friday's chart with $31.5 million, including $11.5 million in Thursday previews.


	The star-studded movie, led by Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan, is kicking off the summer box office in what's become a tradition for Kevin Feige‘s studio with only a few exceptions. The pic is winning over critics and audiences alike; Thunderbolts* boasts a glowing 95 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, making it the third-highest score for a title in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a tie with Spider-Man: Far From Home and behind Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (98 percent) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (97 percent). It's still early, of course, and scores can change by one or two points as the weekend wears on. And on PostTrak exit polls, audiences are giving it a rave 4.5 out of 5 stars, while it received an A- CinemaScore.

	Heading into the weekend, tracking suggests the movie will open in the $70 million to $73 million range domestically and $160 million to $175 million globally, against a $180 million production budget before marketing. Word of mouth is seeing that number climb higher, although some rivals see it coming in between $72 million and $75 million.


	As a comparison, Marvel's Captain America: Brave New World had an audience RT score of 92 percent when opening to $88.8 million earlier this year. (That film's critics score was a rotten 48 percent, compared to 88 percent for Thunderbolts*.)


	The unexpected spring bloom is currently underway at the box office — led by Ryan Coogler's sleeper sensation Sinners — proves that people want the communal experience of watching a film together. Regarding Sinners, the Warner Bros. hit is enjoying a phenomenal third weekend, even if it falls to second place. The supernatural vampire pic continues to break all the rules and could fall just 26 percent this weekend to $33.7 million for a domestic tally north of $180 million.


Thunderbolts* is a pivotal moment for Marvel as it kicks off a new hoped-for franchise. Directed by Jake Schreier, the film brings together a band of dysfunctional outsiders — and lesser-known comic book characters — who discover their potential to be heroes when working together.

	











	In addition to Pugh (Yelena Belova) and Stan (Bucky Barnes), the movie features Wyatt Russell (John Walker), David Harbour (Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian), Lewis Pullman (Bob), Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost), Olga Kurylenko (Taskmaster) and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (CIA director Valentine Allegra de Fontaine).


	“Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan lead a gratifyingly fresh and soulful Marvel adventure,” The Hollywood Reporter‘s chief film critic David Rooney writes in his review. “While a handful of the characters and the actors playing them have appeared in previous entries, there's a disarming freshness to this first-time assembly, not to mention something even more unexpected: heart. That's due to an appealing ensemble cast and the new blood of a creative team with a distinctive take on the genre.”


	In the film, Louis-Dreyfus' villainous character has positioned a number of MCU loners and rejects to kill each other for her own nefarious reasons. But they instead decide to team up in response to the obvious setup, bringing along newcomer Bob, who suffers from a mental illness that has catastrophic consequences after he's subjected to cruel experimentation.


	Overseas, Thunderbolts* is opening everywhere timed to its release in North America, including in China.


	No other major studio dared open opposite the Marvel event pic. Elsewhere, Alec Baldwin's controversial-laced Rust finally opened in select theaters while also being available on premium VOD. The Western appears DOA — at least in cinemas — with an estimated opening gross of just $25,000 from 115 theaters.

	











	The movie opens four years after Baldwin, who co-wrote and produced the film, accidentally discharged a weapon he thought only had blanks. A live round was in the chamber, and the bullet fatally wounded cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and also hit Souza. What followed was a dramatic, closely reported story that revealed on-set negligence and raised questions about industry practices around gun safety. Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter. Still, his case was dismissed after new evidence came to light that Baldwin's lawyers alleged had been buried by the prosecutors. The film's prop armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was also charged and is serving an 18-month prison sentence.

Medas starred in the MTV reality show during its four-season run.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	Kirk Medas, reality star from MTV's Floribama Shore, has died. He was 33. 


	Medas died Friday following complications with liver failure, his father told TMZ. 




	“We are deeply saddened to learn of the tragic passing of Kirk Medas, a beloved member of the Floribama Shore family,” an MTV spokesperson shared in a statement to THR. “Our hearts go out to his family, friends and fans during this difficult time.”


	Medas joined the cast of Floribama Shore's first season in 2017. He starred in the series during its four-season run on MTV before it was canceled. He was one of the show's main castmembers alongside Aimee Hall, Nilsa Prowant, Jeremiah Buoni, Codi Butts, Kortni Gilson, Candace Rice and Gus Smyrnios.

	Alongside Prowant, Hall and Buoni, Medas was featured in a special Fear Factor episode where the Floribama Shore cast competed against Jersey Shore: Family Vacation's Deena Nicole Cortese, Snooki, Pauly D and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro. He also appeared in the comedy miniseries Everybody Hates Kyle in 2022. 


	On Thursday, Floribama Shore star Hall shared on Instagram that her “friend Kirk has been in the ICU for over two weeks now, battling a severe case of necrotizing pancreatitis.” There, she also shared a GoFundMe to aid with Medas' “overwhelming expenses,” which fellow co-star Prowant also posted on her Instagram profile. 


	Following the news of Medas' death, Hall posted a tribute where she wrote that she had “lost a brother, a best friend and heaven gained the most beautiful angel.” 


	“We are all trying to process this unimaginable loss. Kirk was the glue that held us all together. He loved each and every one of us so deeply, with a heart bigger than this world,” she wrote in the caption of the post. “One sweet day, I know we'll all be together again. Until then, I'll miss him every single day.”

Universal Music Group, Spotify, Live Nation and Deezer also posted gains following their quarterly earnings reports. 


													By
												

	Glenn Peoples



Though economic uncertainty lingers, some music companies' stocks got boosts following their first quarter earnings releases this week, while a better-than-expected jobs report on Friday (May 2) lifted stocks across the board. 


	K-pop companies were among the top performers of the week. Led by HYBE's 13.8% gain following its first quarter earnings report on Tuesday (April 29), the four South Korean companies had an average share price gain of 10.3%. JYP Entertainment rose 11.7% and SM Entertainment, which announces earnings on Wednesday (May 7), improved 9.0%. YG Entertainment gained 6.6%. 


	The 20-company Billboard Global Music Index (BGMI) rose 3.6% to 2,690.13, its fourth consecutive weekly improvement. At 2,690.13, the BGMI has improved 19.1% since a two-week slide and stands just 2.4% below its all-time high of 2,755.53 set during the week ended Feb. 14.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Music stocks slightly outperformed the Nasdaq and S&P 500, which rose 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively. Foreign markets were mostly positive but more subdued. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 2.2%. South Korea's KOSPI composite index gained 0.5%. China's SSE Composite Index lost 0.5%. 


	Universal Music Group (UMG) gained 4.3% to 25.86 euros ($29.23) following a quarterly earnings report showing that recorded music subscription revenue grew 11.5% and overall revenue improved 11.8%. JP Morgan analysts' conviction on UMG “remains very high,” and the strong quarter “should help rebuild confidence and share price momentum” dented by Pershing Square's sale of $1.5 billion in UMG shares, analysts wrote in an investor note on Tuesday. 


	Spotify finished the week up 3.7% to $643.73 despite its shares dropping 3.4% on Tuesday after the company's first-quarter earnings report included guidance on second-quarter subscription additions that seemed to underwhelm investors. Gross margin of 31.6% beat Spotify's 31.5% guidance. Loop Capital raised Spotify to $550 from $435, while Barclays lowered it to $650 from $710. UBS maintained its $680 price target and “buy” rating. Guggenheim maintained its “buy” rating and $675 price target. 


	Live Nation, which reported first quarter earnings on Thursday (May 1) and predicted a “historic” 2025, gained 2.3% on Friday and finished the week up 0.7%. A slew of analysts updated their price targets on Friday. Two were upward revisions: Jefferies (from $150 to $160) and Wolfe Research (from $158 to $160). Two were downward revisions: Rosenblatt (from $174 to $170) and JP Morgan (from $165 to $170).

Also this week: apl.de.ap and more artists speak out on the Lapu Lapu Day Festival tragedy.


Billboard Canada is getting ready to spotlight some of the most vital players in the music industry: music managers.


	Managers to Watch — Billboard's spotlight on the teams behind music's biggest breakout artists — will expand to Canada for the first time at this year's NXNE festival.


	A special invite-only Managers to Watch reception will take place on June 11, directly before Billboard Canada Power Players. The event will build on Billboard Canada's new partnership with Music Managers Forum, which is moving its Honour Roll celebration of the most legendary managers in the business to NXNE this year.


	Both recognitions will be given out at the Managers to Watch reception, after which all invited managers will be invited to stay and mingle with the most influential members of the industry at Billboard Canada Power Players.


	The event will foster community and opportunity for self-managed artists and managers, who play a critical role in the success of Canadian artists on the international stage.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“We're proud to partner with MMF Canada to spotlight the managers powering the next wave of talent,” says Mo Ghoneim, president of Billboard UK and Billboard Canada. “They're key players behind many of the industry's biggest breakthroughs, and we're excited to recognize their contributions on a global stage through Billboard.”


	The Music Managers to Watch list will feature a hand-selected list of artists and self-managed artists making waves in the industry. It will be chosen by the editorial team at Billboard Canada. Managers can submit for consideration using this form.

	The votes were still being tallied in the Canadian federal election on Monday morning (April 29) when the Canadian Independent Music Association (CIMA) sprang into action. The trade org issued a press release congratulating Mark Carney and the Liberal Party of Canada on their electoral victory while urging Carney to, in its words, “make the investment in and promotion of Canadian-owned cultural businesses a top priority.”


	The statement stressed that “the global cultural economy is changing rapidly, and with it come significant risks to Canada's cultural and economic sovereignty. Recent developments — including TikTok's decision to walk away from licensing negotiations with Merlin, a key representative of independent music worldwide; Universal Music Group's acquisition of Downtown Music's assets; and the legal challenge by global tech platforms, in partnership with foreign-owned multinational record companies, to avoid regulation under Bill C-11 — starkly illustrate the growing concentration of global corporate power in Canada's cultural sector. If left unchecked, these trends threaten to erode Canadian ownership of intellectual property, diminish our global competitiveness, and compromise the future of Canadian cultural exports.”CIMA emphasizes four priorities for the most industry and suggests the government act quickly:


	CIMA concluded by noting, “We are eager to work with your government to secure a strong future for Canadian culture — Canadian culture remains Canadian-owned, Canadian-created, and world-renowned.”

	Artists are sharing their heartbreak after a deadly attack at Vancouver's Lapu Lapu Day festival.


	The attack killed 11 people, leaving dozens more injured, when an SUV drove through the block party on Saturday (April 26.) A 30-year-old man has been charged with eight counts of second-degree murder.


	Organized by Filipino BC, the festival is a celebration of Filipino hero Datu Lapu-Lapu and an annual occasion for the Filipino-Canadian community to celebrate resilience and cultural heritage.


	The attack took place in the evening, following a day of performances from artists like The Black Eyed Peas‘ apl.de.ap (the Filipino-American artist also known as Allan Pineda Lindo), multi-disciplinary artist Kaya Ko and R&B singer Sade Awele. Festival performers are sharing messages and calling for support for the B.C. Filipino community following the attack.


	Apl.de.ap and Filipino singer J. Rey Soul had recently left the stage after finishing their headlining set when the attack took place.


	“It's hard to describe the shock and heaviness we feel,” they shared in a joint statement on social media. “Please keep the victims, their families, and the organizers in your prayers.”


	“The one thing I have noticed, from the audience to the messages sent around, is the sense of community that wraps its loving arms around us.”


	Festival chair RJ Aquino spoke about the support that's been pouring in from around the world.


	“It's not lost on us … that the spirit of the festival was about that resistance, resilience, that courage, that strength,” he told reporters, per CBC.


	“And you know, we're going to have to call that up in ourselves.”


	Awele shared her prayers for the B.C. Filipino community on Instagram. “I was barely able to sleep thinking about the tragic incident that occurred after the festival,” she said. “We can't keep living like this — treating each other with hate and violence. We have to do better.”

Associate Editor


	There is an idea of a Patrick Schwarzenegger… who is campaigning to star in Luca Guadagnino‘s upcoming American Psycho adaptation.


	Following his recent turn on HBO's The White Lotus, the actor is once again setting his sights on the coveted role of Patrick Bateman, which was previously portrayed by Christian Bale in the 2000 feature film based on Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 novel.


	“I'd love nothing more ;)” wrote Schwarzenegger to a fan on X who suggested he be cast in the Lionsgate project.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Schwarzenegger previously declared it would be “my dream” to play Bateman when the adaptation was announced in October, to be penned by Scott Z. Burns.

	











American Psycho was a groundbreaking and controversial work when it was published in 1991, not only for its iconic Manhattan investment banker-turned-serial killer but also for its incredible attention to detail for the world it was entering, as well as the graphic violence its main character delivered, leading to it being censored in several countries.

I'd love nothing more ;)


	While the first film starring Bale and directed by Mary Harron has gained a following over the years, sources say that rather than a remake, Guadagnino's film will be a new adaptation of Ellis' novel. The property is something the studio has been trying to crack for some time, and following recent meetings with Guadagnino, execs felt he was the perfect choice to bring a fresh take.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	Robyn McCall has done her final quest for justice. CBS has opted not to renew crime drama The Equalizer, starring and executive produced by Queen Latifah, for a sixth season. This was the last CBS scripted series or pilot awaiting to learn their fate ahead of the network's 2025-26 schedule announcement on May 7. 


	There are no plans for The Equalizer, produced by Universal Television, part of Universal Studio Group, to be shopped, I hear. Sunday's Season 5 finale now will serve as a series finale.


	As Deadline previously reported, The Equalizer had been in consideration for what was expected to be a 13-episode sixth and final season. Odds were always 50-50 at best, but there had been promising signs. Since finances play a key role in any renewal conversations these days, I hear producers of The Equalizer had agreed to reduce the budget of the show to the levels CBS had asked for, with Queen Latifah believed to have made concessions herself.

	











	But that was never a guarantee for a pickup. It came down to the wire as CBS is putting the final touches on its 2025-26 schedule, with the network ultimately opting to cancel The Equalizer. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The series' creative team may have had a premonition. I hear they crafted the Season 5 finale in a way that it could potentially serve as a series finale.


RELATED: 2025 TV Series Renewals: Photo Gallery


	It's been a brutal year for bubble series at CBS. The wave of early renewals in February left six scripted series that had run full seasons in limbo. Of them, only one, veteran comedy The Neighborhood, was renewed or an eighth and final season. The remaining five — dramas FBI: Most Wanted, FBI: International, The Equalizer and S.W.A.T. and freshman sitcom Poppa's House — were canceled.


	With FBI in Year 1 of a three-season renewal, Universal Television had three series (FBI: Most Wanted, FBI: International and The Equalizer) and two planted spinoff pilots (The Equalizer spinoff and FBI offshoot CIA) in contention for next season. Of them, only CIA made it. With S.W.A.T. coming from Sony TV, all canceled CBS dramas this season were from outside studios.

	The network's new scripted series for 2025-26 include Fire Country spinoff Sheriff Country, Blue Bloods offshoot Boston Blue and CIA on the drama side and comedy DMV, with drama Einstein being held for 2026-27. Of them all by CIA are produced by CBS sibling CBS Studios.

	











The Equalizer, which became the fourth network primetime drama headlined by a Black woman, got the biggest launch pad available in television with a series premiere behind the Super Bowl in 2021. It was a breakout hit and has been a reliable performer on Sundays. Like with other shows, its ratings have eroded, and the crime drama has been in the middle of the pack at CBS this year this season alongside shows as NCIS: Origins, NCIS: Sydney and FBI: Most Wanted.

	A reimagining of the classic 1980s series, The Equalizer stars Queen Latifah as Robyn McCall, an enigmatic woman with a mysterious background who uses her extensive skills as a former CIA operative to help those with nowhere else to turn.


	Alongside The Equalizer‘s legacy, there had been rumors about behind-the-scene tensions. That said, I hear the team was on board to do another season. 


	Lorraine Toussaint, Tory Kittles, Adam Goldberg, Liza Lapira and Laya DeLeon Hayes starred alongside Queen Latifah. Andrew Marlowe, Terri Edda Miller, Joseph C. Wilson, Rob Hanning, Dana Owens (Queen Latifah), John Davis, John Fox, Debra Martin Chase, Richard Lindheim (co-creator of the original series), Shakim Compere, Joseph C. Wilson and Loretha Jones were executive producers on Season 5.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: We can tell you first that Amazon MGM Studios‘ action comedy Three Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Movie is moving baa, err, back from Feb 20 next year to the Nov. 13, 2026 slot. Amazon MGM Studios has been in that pre-Thanksgiving corridor before with last year's Dwayne Johnson-Chris Evans' Santa Claus movie Red One. The reason behind the shift I hear is to pull in more families. 


	Currently, there's only an untitled Universal movie on the pic's new date. 


	The Kyle Balda directed, Craig Mazin written Working Title and Three Strange Angels production follows George Hardy (Hugh Jackman), a shepherd who loves his sheep and raises them only for their wool. Every night he reads aloud a murder mystery, pretending his sheep can understand, but never suspecting that not only can they understand but they argue for hours afterwards about whodunnit. When George is found dead under mysterious circumstances, the sheep realize at once that it was a murder and think they know everything about how to go about solving it. The local cop Tim Derry (Nicholas Braun), on the other hand, has never solved a serious crime in his life, so the sheep conclude they will have to solve it themselves, even if it means leaving their meadow for the first time and facing the fact that the human world isn't as simple as it appears in books.

	Following CBS‘ cancellation of The Equalizer after five seasons, star and executive producer Queen Latifah addressed the series' fans Friday night. In an Instagram post, she reflected on her run as Robyn McCall on the show, which she and her producing partner Shakim Compere executive produced through their company, Flavor Unit.


	“Stepping into a kick-ass role like Robyn was everything I hoped it would be,” she wrote. “Shakim and I at Flavor Unit are always excited to bring these kinds of roles and projects to life — and then we just hope you love them as much as we do. The Equalizer blew past every dream we had for it, and having the opportunity to do this for five seasons honestly feels surreal.”

	As Deadline reported today, it came down to the wire, but CBS ultimately decided not to renew The Equalizer for what would've been a 13-episode sixth and likely final season. This Sunday's (May 4) Season 5 finale will now serve as a series finale.

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


Marvel Studios/Disney's Thunderbolts* kicked off international box office play on Wednesday, and through Friday has an estimated overseas cume of $47.2M from 52 material markets. The day-and-date global rollout is rolling up to a projected $165M+ through Sunday. This is in line with the pre-weekend estimated range.


	As Anthony has noted, the domestic bow now has as a shot at coming in at $73M-$77M.


	Overseas, the ragtag bunch of antiheroes is, as a whole, playing best in Latin America, and also scoring in the UK and Asia with projected No. 1s  everywhere (outside of Korea and China, which was expected – more on that below).

	Note that May 1st was a holiday in many markets – though the UK will take the day off on Monday — while weather in Europe is also a factor. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The well-reviewed Florence Pugh-starrer is hoping to see walk-up business on Saturday and Sunday and thus should finish the weekend within the range we wrote about earlier this week. 


	The Top 5 markets through Friday are China ($7.1M), Mexico ($4.2M), UK ($3.1M), Brazil ($2.2M) and France ($2.1M).


	As expected, we're not seeing big action in China with the Jake Schreier-directed first installment MCU movie having opened on a non-traditional Wednesday and playing into a competitive frame with lots of new local titles. Through Saturday, the estimated China cume is about $9M (note that today's numbers are not included in the running total above).


	We'll have a full update tomorrow.

King Charles broke his silence on the subject of his younger son Prince Harry's security arrangements, following judgement in the UK's Court of Appeal Friday, and a blistering interview by Harry in which he claimed he had been the victim of an “establishment stitch-up.”


Friday saw the UK Court rule against Harry in a decision that means he has lost his fight to have taxpayer-funded VIP protection following his move overseas (he continues to have bespoke security arrangements made for his visits to the UK), and been saddled with a bill of both sides' legal fees, estimated to top £1.5million (just short of US$2million).

	Harry brought the case against the UK's Home Office and the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures, known as Ravec (which includes figures from the Royal Household who represent the King).




			Watch on Deadline		







	In his Judgement, Sir Geoffrey said Harry's arguments had been “moving” but did not amount to an actual legal challenge.


	“It was impossible to say that this reasoning was illogical or inappropriate, indeed it seemed sensible”.


	Shortly after, the BBC released an interview with Harry in which he said, “I can't see a world in which I would be bringing my wife and children back to the UK at this point.”


	And he complained that his father King Charles could have supported him by “getting out of the way and letting the experts do their jobs.”


The Sun newspaper published a statement from Buckingham Palace, with a spokesperson saying: “All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.”


	Harry also said he would “love a reconciliation” with the royal family but King Charles “won't speak to me” and added, “I do not know how much time my father has.” King Charles continues to receive treatment for cancer, following a diagnosis made public in 2024.

Anna Nicole Smith's daughter Dannielynn Birkhead channeled her mom by wearing one of the late star's dresses to a pre-Kentucky Derby event.

Birkhead has been photographed at the Derby many times growing up, but this time she turned heads by donning the black and silver gown once worn by her mom.

According to her dad's Instagram page, Birkhead wore the dress while attending the Barnstable Brown Gala on Friday, May 2, 2025. The Kentucky Derby kicks off on Saturday, May 3, 2025.

A post shared by Larry Birkhead (@larryanddannielynn)

Birkhead's dad, Larry Birkhead, shared a series of photos showing Dannielynn wearing the dress on his Instagram page.

“Kicking off @kentuckyderby weekend with Dannielynn. First up, The Barnstable-Brown Gala. Dannielynn is wearing Anna Nicole's dress that she wore 21 years ago to this same event. Life full circle. She said she chose the dress because it was her Mom's and ‘super cool,'” he wrote on Instagram.

“Next up the Kentucky Derby races. We are glad to spend time with my niece Chloe (pictured). I am going to try not an embarrass them with my dance moves,” he added.

A post shared by Larry Birkhead (@larryanddannielynn)

Smith's daughter is now an adult. Her dad shared a tribute to her for her 18th birthday, which was in September 2024.

“Dannielynn had a great time celebrating her 18th birthday with friends and family by attending the @beetlejuiceafterlife.exp and @beetlejuicemovie which made for an out of this world experience. Of course, Dannielynn found a Hot Topic store to get a spooky outfit for all the fun ! 😆 Happy 18th Birthday Dannielynn!” he wrote with that post.

Larry Birkhead shared a video for her birthday, writing, “Happy 18th Birthday Dannielynn! You are my entire heart. I love you more than I can ever express. May you continue on your journey being ‘humble and kind' and spread the love that you were given to many others. I am beyond proud of you.” The video shows different images of Dannielynn growing up.

He also shared a photo showing his daughter with a cardboard cutout of actor Hugh Jackman.

“All Dannielynn wanted for Christmas was Hugh Jackman under the tree. Since he wasn't available, the next best thing had to do. Dannielynn got tickets to see @thehughjackman ‘s Broadway Show, “From New York With Love,” at @radiocitymusichall,” Larry Birkhead wrote.

Eight months after the fourth season of “Bargain Block” premiered on HGTV, there's been no official word on whether a season five is in the works — until now. Keith Bynum, who stars on the popular series with his longtime fiance, Evan Thomas, told TV Insider on May 1, 2025, that they are working on home renovations that will appear in new episodes. 

However, fans will likely have to wait quite a while to see those new episodes. Bynum told the outlet that the last season required a “grueling” 42 weeks of production, and they've only just begun finishing up a few renovations for the fifth season. 

A post shared by Keith Bynum (@keithbynum_)

According to Bynum, new episodes of “Bargain Block” will likely begin airing in the fall of 2025. 

“We just wrapped out – well, technically we're still finishing one of the houses – but we'll have more episodes airing in the fall back in Detroit,” he told the outlet, acknowledging that they've been busy not only with renovations, but with selling the homes they renovated for last season. 

Season four of “Bargain Block” featured renovations on starter homes in Detroit, where the show has filmed since 2021, and spinoff episodes filmed in New Orleans. 

“We kind of got through the New Orleans houses, got them listed,” he said. “The last house was supposed to list today, but the power meter didn't go in, so now I'm waiting another three days. But those are buttoning up, we just finished another five in Detroit. Well, we're actively finishing the fifth one. So we're back in Detroit trying to just kind of make sure that we've got our footing there still. It's kind of a balancing act, but it's fun.” 

A post shared by Keith Bynum (@keithbynum_)

In addition to filming for HGTV, Bynum and Thomas have taken on private clients, showcasing some of their renovations in other cities on Instagram. That may lead the duo to bringing “Bargain Block” to additional cities, he told TV Insider, but couldn't give any details. 

“We are actively working in a lot of cities,” he said. “I will tell you, we're in Nashville a lot. We're suddenly in Chicago a lot. There might be a reason for that.” 

In February, Bynum told fans in an Instagram Stories Q&A that he and Thomas travel so much that it's a treat to be back in their renovated Detroit home. 

“My favorite place to vacation has become my house,” he admitted. “I travel so much for work that I really love just being able to come home for a few days. Like today and tomorrow I will be at home and that's kind of a rarity. So it feels like a vacation almost.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Holly Robinson Peete Thrilled to Be 'Back in the Mix' at Hallmark in New Movie (EXCLUSIVE)","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/holly-robinson-peete-returns-new-movie/","Sat, 03 May 2025 14:52:02 GMT","

With the Hallmark Channel premiere of “Hats Off to Love” on May 3, 2025, longtime fan-favorite Holly Robinson Peete will be back in the saddle again — literally. The movie marks her return to the network after a nearly two-and-a-half-year absence, which both she and fans are thrilled about. 

Robinson Peete, who last appeared in 2022's “Holiday Heritage,” has been busy juggling family, her charitable foundation, and other TV roles, telling EntertainmentNOW it took a while to “reconnect and get back in the groove” with Hallmark, but that she's hoping “Hats Off to Love” is the first of many more projects there. 

“I went, you know, pretty much since 2015, making one, two, sometimes three movies a year,” she said of her history at Hallmark. “So I'm just excited to be back in the mix, and especially excited about thisparticular project. It was a lot of fun.” 

An alum of “21 Jump Street” and hit sitcoms like “Hangin' With Mr. Cooper,” Robinson Peete first appeared on Hallmark Channel in 2015's “Angel of Christmas” and quickly became a fan-favorite on the network, starring in the “Morning Show Mysteries” franchise and many holiday films, as well as her family's reality show, “Meet the Peetes,” in 2018 and 2019. 

In “Hats Off to Love,” she plays Louisville socialite Rosalind, whose son Christian (John Clarence Stewart) is training a horse for the upcoming derby when he falls head over heels for Stella (Ginna Claire Mason) who designs derby hats and fascinators for the annual race day. 

“She's a woman who's finding her way,” Robinson Peete said of her character, “and realizing that, you know, she's getting older, but that it's never too late to go for it in life. And I think that's the message that Rosalind has. She's a very astute, fashionably put-together business woman who loves her horses. She can be a little cold in some ways, but she's also full of love.” 

Robinson Peete told EntertainmentNOW that she serendipitously got immersed in Derby culture a year prior, when she attended the 2024 Kentucky Derby with her friend and “Derby veteran” Smokey Robinson.  

“Had I not gone to that Derby, I would not have really known how seriously people are about the Derby,” she marveled. “They take their outfits, their hats — they plan them months and months and months and months in advance! I was so blown away by that, so glad I went. I had the best time.” 

“It's food, it's mint juleps, it's parties and music, and it's rubbing elbows,” Robinson Peete gushed, noting that when she arrived, she had to find a custom hat maker to create hats and fascinators that would coordinate with her outfits. “It is a whole thing.” 

Once she was offered the Hallmark movie, Robinson Peete said she drew inspiration from her friend Eden Bridgeman, the owner of Ebony magazine and a Kentucky Derby aficionado. 

“She's very connected in this society and just fabulous,” Robinson Peete said. “I was watching her (at the 2024 Derby) with the outfits and showing up at this party and hosting that (event) and I was like, ‘Look at this lady!' So she was my inspiration (for Rosalind). I kept sending her pictures during the film and going, ‘Would Rosalind wear this?' I'm really looking forward to her seeing this. She's excited!” 

Among Robinson Peete's favorite things about filming “Hats Off to Love” were getting to know Broadway alum Mason, whom she described as “talented beyond belief,” and working with the horses. 

“I love horses, I think they're amazing,” she told EntertainmentNOW. “I've always, from the time I rode my first one — I think I was 11 or 12 and a friend of mine owned one — and it was always a dream of mine to own one.” 

“Never happened,” she laughed, “but I lived vicariously through Rosalind, who owns several. I love being around them. I understand their energy, you know? And I hadn't ridden in a long time, and it was kind of like riding a bike. The handlers were saying, ‘You seem very comfortable on this horse.' And I was like, ‘Yeah, I guess I am!'”

Robinson Peete joked that there was one day on the Tampa set when “a couple of horses were like, ‘Call my agent, I'm not doing this,'” but that most of them were “very cooperative.” 

“At one point in the stable scenes, there were like, 20 or 30 horses in there,” she said, “and I just had the best time, because our dressing rooms were in the stables, so you would hear noises and I'd go out and say hi to them. And some of them are super friendly and curious about you. That was so much fun.”

Although Robinson Peete isn't sure what's next for her at Hallmark, she said she's “talking with them all the time about doing more” and even has some ideas for unscripted shows. In the meantime, “Hats Off to Love” premieres on May 3 at 8 p.m. Eastern time and will be available to stream on Hallmark+ the following day.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","'American Idol' Teen John Foster Clears Up Online Rumors as Friend Reveals His Real Name","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/john-foster-rumors-real-name/","Sat, 03 May 2025 17:20:17 GMT","

Eighteen-year-old John Foster is becoming a household name now that he's made it to the top 10 on season 23 of “American Idol.” But that name is is one of the many things Foster's hometown supporters in Addis, Louisiana, want to shed some light on for fans. 

The young country singer's full name is John Foster Benoit, family and friends told The Adovcate on May 1, 2025, but he dropped his last name for his blossoming music career. During his audition, though, he represented the family name by bringing coolers full of Cajun delicacies from his family's meat shop —Benoit's Country Meat Block — to judges Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie, and Carrie Underwood.  

One of the store's longtime employees, family friend Rick Bourgoyne, told The Advocate, “ I was telling his daddy, I said, ‘I hope people don't think that's his last name because he is a Benoit, and this (store) is Benoit's.' His middle name is Foster, just like his daddy and his grandfather's. He's the third.”

That's just one of the background details that the singer and those close to him want to let fans know as he attempts to advance on the next live episodes of “American Idol.” 

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

As Foster grows more visible on “American Idol,” with millions tuning into each episode, he has noticed some inaccuracies reported about himself online. On April 30, he tried to clear up some of those rumors in a Facebook post, including verifying his age and background. 

Among the inaccuracies he'd seen, Foster wrote, was that he is 24 (he's 18, he confirmed) and that he was from Kentucky. 

“I was born and raised in Louisiana,” he wrote, adding, “I've never even been to Kentucky, but I hope to visit someday.” 

Though he's often been compared to country legend Dwight Yoakam, he said there's no relation nor a musical connection to the star. 

“I'm not related to Dwight Yoakam,” he wrote, “nor am I currently signed under any record label (there was some misinformation that Dwight Yoakam signed me under Sugar Hill Records).” 

“I hope this helps y'all to know me better as a person now that y'all know more about my music,” he added.

A post shared by John Foster (@officialjohnfoster)

Foster has a huge support system behind him, with 31 family members heading to Los Angeles for the next round of competition, according to The Advocate. They want viewers to know that he's deeply committed to his family, faith and helping others.  

During his audition, he told the judges that he was an aspiring oncologist — a goal he has not dismissed despite his success on the show. Even while competing on “American Idol,” he's been taking online classes for his second semester at Louisiana State University, majoring in biology, his grandma Verbie Benoit told the paper. 

On May 2, Foster launched a Facebook fundraiser for the American Cancer Society, writing, “As many of you know, I am currently studying to become an oncologist (a physician who treats cancer). Whether I decide to pursue medicine or music full-time, I will always be involved in fighting for a cure.”

With a goal of raising $500 by raffling off an autographed photo, Foster raised nearly $3,500 in less than 24 hours. The fundraiser ends on May 9.  

The next rounds of “American Idol” air live coast-to-coast on May 4 and 5 at 8 p.m. Eastern time.

The Museum of Modern Art is spring cleaning its archives for a special ode to Old Hollywood. The exhibit “Face Value: Celebrity Press Photography,” which will open June 28, 2025 and be on display through June 21, 2026, features the best studio shots of iconic stars such as Clara Bow, Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Barbara Stanwyck, Elizabeth Taylor, Harry Belafonte, and more.

This is the first major exhibition of Hollywood studio portraiture to be showcased from the Museum Department of Film's film stills archive since 1993. “Face Value” will feature over 200 works from 1921 to 1996, with studio photography of Joan Crawford, Louis Armstrong, Carole Lombard, Louise Brooks, Mia Farrow, Dennis Hopper, Lena Horne, Buster Keaton, Anna May Wong, W. C. Fields, Hattie McDaniel, Lupe Velez, Mae West, Bela Lugosi, Carmen Miranda, Elvis Presley, Diana Ross, Spencer Tracy, and Oprah Winfrey, in addition to the aforementioned stars. Historical figures such as Jackie Robinson, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Amelia Earhart, Ruby Berkley, and Eleanor Roosevelt are also among the portraits.

“‘Face Value' will encourage viewers to see through the facade of glamour at how celebrity is fabricated and exploited,” curator Ron Magliozzi said in a press statement. As the MoMA exhibit description states, the exhibition will “explore how these images were manipulated for public consumption through hands-on editing techniques long before digital tools became standard.”

The pieces include works by more than 58 photographers, with “untouched” candid images juxtaposed with traditional press practices of the era such as silhouetting, in-painting, masking, sectioning, and collage. The exhibit will be on view in the Titus and Morita Galleries. 

“Face Value” is organized by curator Magliozzi, with Katie Trainor, the Film Collections Manager, and Cara Shatzman, the Collection Specialist for the Department of Film. Film at MoMA is made possible by CHANEL.

The influence of late stars Bow and Keaton, both of whom are included in “Face Value,” is evident in the modern culture, with Taylor Swift even citing the media frenzy around Bow in a song dedicated to the late star. Meanwhile, Keaton is getting a posthumous biopic series with Rami Malek portraying him.

7.7

Genre:

Experimental

Label:

Lucy Railton's new album Blue Veil isolates the moment when a cello's bow makes contact with the strings and presents it as a miniature Big Bang, a crucible of tension and friction that burns fiercely on a level that's too small to see. In a fascinating interview with German writer Stephan Kunze, the UK composer and cellist described the experience of playing her instrument as like “standing next to a guitar amp,” and Blue Veil does everything it can to make you feel the vibrations short of grabbing your face and pressing it up against the strings.

Though Railton found a nice old Paris church in which to record these seven pieces, we don't hear any of the space in the music. Rather, she distills some sort of platonic ideal of cello-ness. You get an acute sense of the instrument as a machine, yet it's seemingly stripped of its constituent parts: no wood, no wire, no horsehair, just a deadly and wicked thrum. You feel like you're inside the instrument, or maybe like you've shrunk down to ant size and are running along one of the strings as the bow bears down on you. The music sounds like a slumbering beast at times, breathing with each stroke, betraying its human source even when the eerie just-intonation overtones start to sound like theremins or outer-space rumblings.

This is Railton's first solo cello album, but she's been a regular presence in the classical avant-garde for a while, organizing a long-running concert series at London's Café Oto and co-founding the London Contemporary Music Festival in between gigs with the likes of Bat for Lashes and Bonobo, and Bach recordings on ECM. She might be best-known for her work with Kali Malone, who co-produced Blue Veil with Stephen O'Malley. The same trio recorded the awesome pandemic-era drone album Does Spring Hide Its Joy, which seems pulled from the same inky depths as the music on Blue Veil; both records use barely audible sine waves to heighten the low end, contributing to the feeling of the music seeping into your bones that Railton must feel as she plays her mighty instrument.

In a sense, Blue Veil puts you in the driver's seat, breaking the polite distance between player and listener that usually manifests in the sense of space Railton rejects here. She uses subtle electronic sine waves not as an embellishment but to bring out qualities within the cello itself, namely the physicality of her experience of playing it. There are times when the timbre of the cello sounds hyperreal, almost like a computer preset; Railton displays little dynamic range as she patiently, almost surgically traces the edges of cool minor chords and discordant clusters. If you were to illustrate Blue Veil, it would look like seven streaks of black ink, or maybe seven slashes in a canvas from a very large knife.

It's austere, formidable music, but by fitting within a tight 40-minute package, it endears itself to listeners who might not know much about drone music—for instance, ambient fans familiar with Railton's work with Malone, or in the trio PDP III, with Britton Powell and Huerco S., but not quite ready to make the leap to blasting Phill Niblock at deafening volume. If that's you, here's your gateway drug. For the rest of us who already love such spartan music, here's another album to plug straight into your bones.

	A new indictment against Lil Durk has nixed all references to his lyrics in the rapper's murder-for-hire case. Federal prosecutors confirmed the lyrics were removed but said it would not affect their case against him.


	“Defendant Banks has presented a false narrative that he is being prosecuted and detained because of his violent lyrics. This claim is, and has always been, baseless,” prosecutors wrote in a separate court filing Friday, per Billboard. “Just like every iteration of the indictment before it, the [new indictment] contains significant allegations that show defendant's alleged role in the execution-style murder of [the victim] on a busy street corner in Los Angeles.” The indictment also included a new charge of stalking.


	The rapper's lawyer, Drew Findling, filed a response to the new indictment and claimed “it appears that the government has conceded” the “hotly contested” dispute over his music, according to the publication.


	In October, Durk (born Durk Banks) was charged for the attempted murder of rival Quando Rondo, allegedly having ordered his own “OTF” crew to murder Rondo. While Rondo survived the September 2022 shooting at a Los Angeles gas station, his friend Lul Pab was killed in the crossfire.

	











	Durk previously pleaded not guilty to the charges. His lawyers attempted to have the case dismissed in April, citing “false evidence” provided to a grand jury.


	Prior to Friday's new indictment deleting the lyrics, prosecutors said in a court filing that Durk was not being prosecuted “because of his lyrics,” but suggested his lyrics could be cited as evidence in their case against him.


	“Unless the government is prosecuting Banks on a theory of extra-sensory prescience, the lyrics could not have soundly informed the grand jury's finding of probable cause,” Findling argued in a filing last month.

	Earlier this week, the rapper claimed his lyrics were “being used against him” in the government's murder-for-hire case against him. In a video statement posted on Instagram Wednesday, the artist accused the government of weaponizing his verse on Babyface Ray's song “Wonderful Wayne & Jackie Boy.” 


	“Durk has always used music to tell stories, to express pain to heal — and yet those same lyrics are now being used against him. We refuse to stay silent as Black artists continue to be criminalized for their creativity. Rap is art,” Durk and his family stated in the post. “As a family, we are asking the public, the fans and the culture to stand with us. Stand for truth. Stand for fairness. Stand for The Voice.”

							By 

	Matthew Cunningham-Cook



	In the lead up to the April 1 election for the Wisconsin state Supreme Court, a little-known private equity executive by the name of Antonio Gracias joined Tesla billionaire Elon Musk on stage as the latter launched into a tirade clearly inspired by the white supremacist Great Replacement Theory — the discredited canard that the Biden administration was letting in millions of “illegals” to engage in mass voter fraud. 


	On the dais, Gracias described how his foray into Social Security had revealed something already widely known to immigration policymakers: that the Biden administration had substantially expanded the Temporary Protected Status program, allowing millions of immigrants to enter and work in the country legally. These noncitizens were given Social Security numbers, as is completely standard — in fact, the process was automated during Trump's first term — but Gracias and Musk, the world's richest man, treated it like a scandal.


	“We started at the top of the system mapping the whole system of Social Security to understand where the fraud was — this is what jumped out at us,” Gracias said. “When we saw these numbers, we asked ‘What is this?' In ‘21, you see 270,000 people, it goes all the way to 2.1 million in ‘24. These are noncitizens that are getting Social Security numbers. … This literally blew us away. We went there to find fraud, and we found this by accident.” Noting that his parents and siblings, like Musk, are immigrants, Gracias added, “I'm pro-legal immigration — this is about America and the future of America.”

	The crowd of conservatives gasped as the billionaires made it sound as if they and their team at Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency had finally found proof of the waste, fraud, and abuse in the Social Security Administration that Musk has repeatedly talked about — examples that might help justify the massive upheaval that DOGE has created within the agency that manages America's core retirement program.

	Under their watch, DOGE has moved to fire thousands of SSA workers, shutter dozens of field offices, and implement sweeping changes that are expected to make it more difficult for Social Security recipients to get their payments on time, if at all. The administration has reportedly declared millions of people dead within the Social Security program, making live people fight for their payments, and has started deliberately marking some immigrants as deceased. (A White House spokesperson says SSA's “death data” is “being reviewed by three separate teams,” and that the immigrants targeted were either “on the terrorist watch list” or have “FBI criminal records.”) Meanwhile, Social Security beneficiaries may have to wait until November to receive the higher payments they were promised in a law passed last year.

	











	Despite all of Musk and Gracias' rhetoric about rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in Social Security, scant attention has been paid to how the pair has become phenomenally wealthy with support from Americans' retirement funds.  


	It's well-known that Musk's space company, SpaceX, has long cashed in on federal contracts — a trend turbocharged by Trump's administration. Gracias, for his part, has relied on significant investments from public retirement systems to fund his firm's deals. In the past decade, Gracias' private equity firm, Valor Equity Partners, has received at least $1.7 billion in investment commitments from state and local pension funds — which manage the retirement savings of unionized teachers, firefighters, social workers, bus drivers, and cops — according to a Rolling Stone review of public documents. 


	Much of this money has come from Democratic states and locales. For its most recent fund, Valor received $800 million in investment commitments from a range of state and local pension funds. Investors include the California Public Employees' Retirement System; the California State Teachers' Retirement System; the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund; the New York State Teachers' Retirement System; a range of New York City pension funds; the Philadelphia Board of Pensions and Retirement; and the Hartford Municipal Employees Retirement Fund in Connecticut.

	Valor disclosed in a press release last August that this same fund has invested in Musk's SpaceX and his artificial intelligence company xAI. Musk recently used xAI to purchase his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) at a valuation of $33 billion, a 25-percent haircut from the $44 billion he spent to buy Twitter. (The platform's ad revenues have cratered under Musk's stewardship.)


	With a typical management fee of two percent, Gracias' firm stands to accumulate tens of millions of dollars annually from the public funds no matter how its investments perform. While Gracias complains about 1.3 million immigrants being on Medicaid — numbers that have not been independently verified by Rolling Stone, but would mean these immigrants are getting access to preventive care and saving hospitals money on emergency room expenses — Gracias himself is accruing large profits from the management fees that his firm charges government retirement systems. 


	Valor and DOGE did not respond to Rolling Stone's requests for comment. 

	











	A 54-year-old University of Chicago Law School alum who has been associated with Musk since the PayPal days, Gracias has played a key role in helping prop up Musk's embattled yet sprawling business empire. He's a longtime investor in Musk's companies, a significant Tesla shareholder, and former Tesla board member. 


	Gracias' longstanding friendship and business dealings with Musk have been lucrative for both men. Musk is worth an estimated $386 billion, in large part due to his Tesla holdings. Gracias has a net worth of $2.2 billion, much of it tied to his holdings of Tesla stock. Gracias lent Musk $1 million early in Musk's ownership of Tesla, and his firm has invested in nearly every Musk company, including SpaceX.


	The Trump administration has been good to them. SpaceX, which has received billions of dollars from government contracts, has raked in billions more under the Trump administration. Agencies across the federal government are increasingly using Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet business.


	SpaceX and defense contractor Anduril, another company that Gracias' firm has invested in, are the frontrunners to build Trump's proposed “Golden Dome” missile shield, a proposal that experts estimate will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. In late April, the Wall Street Journal reported on Gracias' lucrative side hustle — selling stakes in Musk's private companies like SpaceX. 


	A White House spokesperson says, “As for concerns regarding conflicts of interest between Elon Musk and DOGE, President Trump has stated he will not allow conflicts, and Elon himself has committed to recusing himself from potential conflicts.”


	As Trump and Musk have run roughshod over the law to pursue drastic cuts of the federal government through DOGE, they have been supported by an eclectic cast of characters. While 19-year olds or those with openly racist proclivities or nicknames like “Big Balls” get the bulk of media attention, arguably nobody has been more important to implementing DOGE's slash-and-burn agenda than Gracias.


	With his entry into the heights of Washington policymaking, Gracias, like Musk, has brought an overall mentality to the Trump administration with well-defined origins in private equity.


	Core to the history of private equity is a conception that government is a vehicle for private profit, and that the point of business is to extract as much cash as possible from targets, no matter the impact. Private equity started in earnest thanks to a rule change by Jimmy Carter in 1979 that allowed private equity to fundraise from private sector pension funds. (Public pension cash began to flow shortly thereafter.) But with the critical benefits of millions of Americans at issue, along with basic principles like the rule of law and a government that functions, the stakes couldn't be higher. 

	











	“It does seem like Musk and DOGE are applying private equity tactics to the government,” says Brendan Ballou, a former attorney at the Department of Justice who wrote the 2023 book Plunder: Private Equity's Plan to Pillage America. As an example, Ballou notes, “They're exploring sale leasebacks to sell underlying government property and lease it back to itself,” a hallmark of the private equity model. “They're pursuing the same type of cost-cutting techniques that private equity firms pursue when they take over a company, which end up costing you vastly more money in the long run. Slashing the IRS might save you money for one year, but it's devastating in the future. It's almost comical how similar it is to the takeover of a company by a private equity firm, what they are doing to the government.”


	As Gracias is primed to reap a windfall from the Golden (no, not Teapot) Dome, the DOGE-led Social Security cuts he has helped to oversee could send the program cratering down the road to privatization — another classic hobbyhorse of a Wall Street eager to profit from the nearly $3 trillion in the Social Security Trust Fund that is currently invested in U.S. Treasuries. (BlackRock, whose CEO Larry Fink recently resuscitated the long-discredited idea of investing part of Social Security in Wall Street-controlled private accounts, did Musk a massive favor last year when the financial firm voted its investors' proxies in favor of Musk's record-setting $46 billion Tesla pay package.) 


	Gracias began working with the Social Security Administration in early February. By the end of the month, the SSA had announced its intentions to cut 7,000 positions out of the agency's 57,000-person workforce. Dozens of Social Security offices are expected to close, while DOGE pushes major technological changes that could make more people need to visit those offices. 


	A White House spokesperson says SSA has only lost 2,000 workers so far, with most departing voluntarily, and adds that “the agency has not permanently closed or announced the permanent closure of any local field office.”


	“President Trump established the Department of Government Efficiency to modernize government operations and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse,” the spokesperson continues. “At the Social Security Administration, the DOGE team has delivered — upgrading technology systems, implementing anti-fraud tools, improving the accuracy of death records, and stopping illegal aliens from collecting benefits. President Trump remains committed to always protecting Social Security.” 

	











	Additionally, Gracias has reportedly led a DOGE task force working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services to integrate sensitive personal data from Social Security, with the apparent goal of aiding Trump's deportation dragnet. 


	Speaking about DOGE's efforts in the Social Security Administration, former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley said in March, “Most of the actions necessary to create a total system collapse of the Social Security Administration have been taken.” In late April, the Trump SSA pledged that they would seek to convert large swaths of SSA employees to “Schedule F,” which would effectively eliminate longstanding civil service protections and serve to speed up firings at the agency. 


	DOGE appears to have been able to circumvent a federal judge's March ruling barring its access to SSA data with Trump appointing one of DOGE's own as chief information officer of the Social Security Administration. That role is currently being held by Scott Coulter, who used to work for private equity giant Blackstone and Lone Pine Capital, a hedge fund, and has worked as a DOGE apparatchik. 


	All of this is out of the private equity playbook, says Samir Sonti, a professor at the Murphy Institute at the City University of New York.


	“Private equity has profited immensely in recent decades off of asset stripping — using public resources to plunder businesses and communities, leaving behind carcasses of enterprises in many cases,” he says. “Fundamentally, private equity is really about devastating the public good for private gain. DOGE is executing something very similar at the federal level. But they're gutting not just a specific enterprise or community but the entire federal government, to advance a longer-term desire among corporate interests in this country to free themselves from any public or social oversight. In many ways, what we're seeing with DOGE is the private equity asset stripping model [taken] to its logical conclusion.”


	Private equity firms in the U.S. — anchored by big names Blackstone, Apollo, Carlyle, and KKR — manage over $3.1 trillion in assets, and control outright major firms like Medline, the largest medical supply firm in the U.S., and Allied Universal, the world's largest private security firm. Companies owned outright by private equity firms employ over 12 million people in the U.S., according to research by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. 

	











	Employees of private equity firms spent $236 million on campaign contributions in the 2024 election. 


	The American Investment Council, a lobbying group for private equity, has estimated that about half of private equity's capital that is invested in America comes from U.S. public pension funds. 


	Private equity is distinguished by its lack of regulation, limited transparency, high fees, and vulnerability to misconduct. A leaked 2020 report from the FBI found that private equity firms, along with their closely related siblings in asset management, hedge funds, are widely used to conduct illicit money laundering operations.


	“Public pension funds are one of the biggest sources of capital for private equity firms,” says Oscar Valdés Viera, who analyzes private equity at Americans for Financial Reform. “Workers indirectly fund private equity's predatory practices through their pension funds. The private equity billionaires benefit from tax loopholes and giveaways that the rest of us do not get,” he says, pointing out the carried interest tax deduction, which allows private equity managers to get much of their income taxed at the lower long-term capital gains tax rate than the ordinary income tax rate. “They charge a lot of fees, like management fees, professional fees, director and officer fees, accounting fees, transfer agent fees, and most of these fees are coming directly from pension funds and similar investors,” he says. “It's just insane the amount of fees that they charge from these pension funds.”


	Reflecting the broad secrecy of his industry, much of what Gracias is doing at DOGE remains closed off to the public eye. On April 21, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Social Security Administration for failing to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests related to its handling of the personal data of millions of Americans, stating: “The American people have an urgent need to know if their private financial, medical, and personal records are being illegally accessed, analyzed, or weaponized by Trump's unaccountable team of unvetted outsiders.”

	Brett Christophers, a professor at Sweden's Uppsala University who has studied asset management, tells Rolling Stone that the actions of DOGE clearly resemble foundational principles of the private equity industry. 


	“When private equity investors go into operating companies, the most consistent theme across all their investments is cost cutting as a way in theory to maximize their investment and make companies lean and more valuable to other potential investors,” he says. “It sounds like what's going on with DOGE is that Musk and the people working with him are trying to treat the government in the same way.”

Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock together again! On Friday, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that the two actors — who starred in 1994's Speed — will be joining forces again as the leads for an upcoming, untitled romantic thriller at Amazon MGM Studios.


	The project reconnects the two actors with Speed producer Mark Gordon. Noah Oppenheim, who wrote the 2016 biopic Jackie, will write the script for the film. Although there are no details about the plot, it was described as “propulsive” to THR.


	Bullock via Fortis Films, Reeves, Gordon, and Bibby Dunn through the Mark Gordon Company are set to produce the project, along with Oppenheim and Sarah Bremner with Prologue Entertainment.


	According to the outlet, Speed grossed over $350 million, which is over $750 million when adjusted for inflation. It was one of the biggest action movies of the Nineties and spawned a sequel that was not as well-received. Along with Speed, Reeves and Bullock starred together in 2006's The Lake House, marking a reconnection between the two stars.

	The pair of actors have always had great onscreen chemistry, with Reeves and Bullock previously revealing on the Ellen Show that they harbored mutual crushes while filming the thriller hit. “She obviously didn't know I had a crush on her either,” Reeves said. “We were working! … It was nice to go to work. She's such a wonderful person.”


	Reeves most recently voiced Shadow the Hedgehog in Sonic the Hedgehog and starred in 2023's action film, John Wick: Chapter 4. The actor is also tied to From the World of John Wick: Ballerina and Good Fortune, both scheduled to release this year. For her part, Bullock last starred in The Lost City  and Bullet Train as Maria Beetle back in 2022.

  Home   Kent   News   Article

A hovering spaceship, 1,000 lights in the sky and unidentified moving craft above the motorway are among the emergency calls to Kent Police people have made, worried about unexplained flying objects.

Despite the government closing its official UFO desk almost 20 years ago, each year a number of people phone the force concerned about mysterious things in the skies.

But with the Garden of England previously declared the county with the second highest number of UFO sightings  - Kent author and academic Neil Nixon, who in 2021 wrote a book called UFOs, Aliens and The Battle For The Truth, said the sightings are likely to be the ‘tip of the iceberg' when it comes to unexplained encounters over the last decade.

He said: “Some people who see these things don't know what to do when they see it.

“Not everyone will call the police.”

The log of UFO sightings, obtained from Kent Police through a Freedom of Information request, covers reports made directly to the force over the last 10 years.

Five UFOs above Sevenoaks, 1,000 lights in the sky above the district of Tonbridge and Malling and a spaceship in the sky above Gravesend are among the 15 unexplained events worried residents have felt compelled to report to officers.

A mass sighting of UFOs in Dover and a spaceship hovering for 30 minutes can also be found among the control centre's logs.

Mr Nixon - who while not an ‘out-and-out sceptic' says he tends to approach his work as a hard-nosed journalist rather than a fanatical believer - says there can be numerous reasons in the mix when it comes to trying to make sense of flying objects.

Weather conditions, astronomical events and military exercises can all feature.

“There are some classic UFO cases that correspond with meteorological activity”, he added.

But it can sometimes be many years later, suggests Mr Nixon, before the pieces of a puzzle might drop into place, if they ever do it all, as details about events during that period emerge over time or make their way into official records.

In 2016 the Ministry of Defence was forced to deny it was using or testing flares on military ranges near Hythe after numerous people reported bright lights in the daytime sky.

The appearance of the strange orbs, which ‘hovered' for 30 minutes also attracted the attention of television stations and national newspapers with the Metro, Daily Mirror and Daily Mail all questioning what the unexplained objects might be.

“Military ranges were shut”, says Neil. “But you have only got to look at the photos to see that they are probably flares.”

Sightings over Kent's coast can also fall victim - particularly in the dark - to witnesses not having any context to what they're watching or no means by which to compare it in size to anything else nearby.

Mr Nixon recalls once watching an unexplained bright white light in the sky above Shellness beach during a visit to the Isle of Sheppey.

“I have a light in the sky where you cannot gauge anything between me and it”, he explains.

But a chance conversation with expert birdwatchers nearby, extremely familiar with the area's atmospheric conditions and climate, soon clarify the sighting is likely to be a bird - possibly a seagull - which against the bright reflection of the sun was also flying abnormally high because of temperature changes in the air.

“Truth be told I saw a peculiar white seagull where the atmospheric conditions were a bit weird.

“All the birds were much higher than they should be.”

Some of the ‘cutting edge research' being done by academics into the subconscious and quantum theory, believes Neil, may also pave the way for other more in-depth explanations in some cases.

While understanding a person's experience of pareidolia - in which the brain can make and see something significant in random patterns or faces that aren't actually there - is also often considered by those looking for explanations.

A good old-fashioned prank can also not be ignored, says Neil, with the development of drone technology - combined with the growth of social media - sometimes offering an alternative explanation.

He explained: “Clever hoaxes do exist. Particularly in the age of drone flying.

“And if you can get a viral hit, of course then there's money to be made.”

The Ministry of Defence closed its UFO desk - run by the RAF which collated details for the national archives - almost two decades ago because it was decided it served ‘no purpose' and was taking staff away from ‘more valuable defence-related activities'.

However last year, the UK was urged to follow the US and take UFO reports more seriously by a man who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the Ministry of Defence.

Nick Pope told the PA news agency that the US was treating the phenomenon as a “potential defence, national security and flight safety concern”, adding “it's time the UK did the same thing” after a drop in reported sightings.

Mr Nixon says sightings happen more regularly than people think - and during his talks and visits many audience members have a story to tell about something they've been unable to logically explain.

“You cannot get out of the room without people wanting to come up and tell you about the strangest things that has happened to them or that they've seen.

“Most witnesses are credible.

“The people I meet are not looking for publicity and there are way more people than you think.”

And among them, insists Neil, are close encounters of the third kind that remain impossible to pinpoint with a valid explanation.

He said: “A lot of people are sincere about this and they are stunned by what they see.

“And in the middle of all this stuff are a handful of cases which are very difficult to explain

“There are some genuine mysteries out there.”

Other strange sightings in Kent include ""disc-shaped"" lights charting the skies near the Dartford Crossing in August 2021.

In the first few seconds of the clip a blaze of light appears in the night sky before two distinct glows emerge.

The lights then travel in opposite directions before looping around to face each other.

The mysterious beams of light were spotted travelling overhead at Ebbsfleet station on the same day.

Meanwhile in July 2023, a Gravesend man spotted three mysterious flying objects in the sky above his home.

Chris Lovell told KentOnline: “I was literally just watching TV and I happened to glance out of the patio door window. I saw three lightish dots moving right to left quite quickly.

“I said to my partner ‘that's strange' and grabbed my phone. They were moving from the back to the house to the front, so I went out and snapped some pictures.”

Mr Lovell said the dots were initially in a triangular formation and moved into a vertical line, becoming a darker colour as they did so. He said he was unable to estimate how far away or how big they were, but believed they were flying at a typical altitude of a plane.

A photo claiming to show a 1,000-foot-wide UFO near the Four Corners region in US has stirred up widespread intrigue and scepticism across the internet. The grainy image, reportedly taken by a commercial airline pilot in 2021, shows a silver, disc-shaped object allegedly hovering over the landmark intersection of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado. The image was recently presented by former Department of Defense employee Luis “Lue” Elizondo during a panel organised by the UAP Disclosure Fund, according to the New York Post.

(Also read: Mysterious underwater 'UFO base' believed to be alien hub spotted off Southern California coast)

Internet users and sceptics were quick to analyse the photo, suggesting that the so-called flying saucer was nothing more than two crop irrigation circles seen from above. Some pointed out that one circle was darker than the other, giving the illusion of a shadow and making the formation appear like a single 3D object. 

Despite the criticism, Elizondo remained firm in his position, noting that the photo was presented merely to highlight the lack of a formal reporting system for pilots.

Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Elizondo offered a detailed explanation:

“As you know, I am always first to admit mistakes, but this is not one of those times,” he wrote. “The facts regarding the photo I shared from a private pilot… are as follows:

He stressed that the purpose of sharing the image was not to assert it as verified evidence, but to underscore a larger issue.

“This illustrates a bigger point here… when pilots come out to share what they feel may be anomalous, they are faced with fierce ridicule… and learn quickly not to ever share again.”

Sticking with this week's “NewWisco Weekend” theme, let's take a trip back to 1999 for some paranormal classic movie fun. 

Can you see dead people? Hopefully not, but if so, then this week's pic will seem like it was made just for you. M. Night Shyamalan's “The Sixth Sense” is a paranormal classic. It has one of the biggest surprises in movie history. I'm not saying there aren't people that saw the big twist at the end coming, but most of us did not. 

Bruce Willis plays child psychologist Malcom Crowe. Crowe receives a visit from an ex-patient named Vincent Gray, played by Donnie Wahlberg. Gray is enraged because he believes that Crowe was completely ineffective as his counselor. Gray shoots Malcolm in the stomach before Wahlberg's character turns the gun on himself and takes his own life. 

A few months later, after we think Crowe's stomach wound has healed he meets Cole, a 9 year-old boy played by Haley Joel Osment. Cole reminds Crowe a lot of Vincent Gray so Crowe thinks he can make up for past therapy ineffectiveness by counseling Cole, not expecting to find that Cole has a special talent … also known as a sixth sense.

Willis's character doesn't quite believe Cole at first, but he's fascinated by the boy and spends more time studying Cole's condition than he does spending time with his wife Anna, played by Olivia Williams. The situation takes a toll on their marriage or so we are led to believe. 

In addition to Willis, Wahlberg, Osment, and Williams the main cast is completed by Toni Collette, who plays Cole's mother. Both Colette and Osment received Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Supporting Actor. 

Osment is especially brilliant given his age and frankly, there is no shame in a 12-year-old losing an Oscar to Michael Caine. In addition to the two acting nods, the film received four other Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay and Director for Shyamalan.

Even though this was not his directorial debut, his brilliant writing and directing put M. Night on the map. Interestingly, his two previous films, “Wide Awake” and “Praying with Anger” are both comedy-dramas that received mixed reviews. 

“The Sixth Sense” was followed up by the popular “Unbreakable” in 2000 and “Signs” in 2002. Shyamalan says he wrote “The Sixth Sense” with Willis in mind right from the start. 

The American Film Institute is a huge fan of the movie. In 2007, it ranked “The Sixth Sense” as the 89th best movie of all time. The quote, “I see dead people” was the 44th most popular in movie history, according to the AFI. 

And my favorite fun fact about “The Sixth Sense” involves actress Toni Collette who says the story and characters resonated with her so much emotionally, she didn't even realize it was a horror film until after it was released.

Although Shyamalan has been prolific since his breakout film, in my opinion, he's never come close to matching it but then again, most filmmakers haven't. “The Sixth Sense” is a masterpiece and it's this week's “Classic Movie Pick of the Week.”

Since its launch in 2020, the Squier Paranormal Series has been responsible for some of the most daring and dashing electric guitar designs to ever leave Fender's workshop, from the Squier LE Paranormal Troublemaker Telecaster Deluxe to the Strat-O-Sonic, Baritone Cabronita and beyond.

The Squier Paranormal Offset Telecaster we have here is certainly no exception. Essentially a de facto Frankenstein'd Jazzmaster/Tele hybrid, this particular model looks to repackage (most of) the tones and functional stylings of a traditional single-cut in a form that takes visual inspiration from Fender's beloved offset.

That means it has an offset Jazzmaster poplar body, a Jazz/Tele SJ pickup configuration, a Tele-inspired control panel, and a Tele headstock. There's also a maple neck, Indian laurel fingerboard, and a bone nut. And, because it's a Paranormal build, extra spice is squeezed out through expansive electronics that offer series/parallel and In-Phase/Out-of-Phase voices.



On paper, it looks and sounds like an absolute winner, but does it have the substance to match its irresistible style?

Build quality rating: ★★★★☆

Previous Squier Paranormal guitars that we've reviewed have set a seriously solid precedent with their impressive build quality. First and foremost, the Paranormal Offset Tele is a really good-looking guitar, and – especially when one considers its hybrid design brief – it's been pieced together rather smartly indeed.

It is a best of both worlds build that (from the perspective of a Tele player) does a decent job of repurposing the spirit of a Tele into a Jazzmaster package.

That's all the more impressive when you consider the work that has gone on here. The fretboard binding is in pretty good nick, the finish is largely flawless, and when you've got it in your hands, it feels like a sturdy, reliable bit of kit.



That said, unsurprisingly it's not the best-built guitar you'll come across, and it's clear that – although nicely put together – it suffers in a few places as a result of the cheaper appointments.

For example, the control knobs are unconvincingly knurled (there's hardly any grip there at all), unusually stiff, and don't facilitate speedy parameter changes.

The push/pull functions of the volume and tone controls are effective and solid, though, and while I initially felt that Squier was at risk of trying a bit too hard to go above and beyond here – I thought a simple Tele/Jazzmaster hybrid would have been appealing enough – it does a decent job of living up to the Paranormal name and injecting a healthy dose of accessible, expansive tones.

Ultimately, there is a lot to like. Everything seems to have been put together rather solidly, and the marrying of the Jazzmaster and Telecaster styles has worked.

Nothing rattles, nothing is loose, and the Offset Tele does a really convincing job of bringing two beloved builds under one umbrella.



Playability rating: ★★★★☆

I found multiple in-song applications for some of the switching options that my more expensive Tele simply can't deliver. 

To pick up and play, this feels like your regular Jazzmaster, and there are no surprises in the 25.5” scale length, comfortable-and-well-finished C-shape neck, and 9.5” radius.

The vintage-style tuning machines feel a bit more bulbous than usual and make things feel a bit cramped, but otherwise everything is in working order.

I play a Tele by trade, but absolutely love Jazzmasters, so I found myself very much at home here. I can't help but feel that the 24” scale of a Jaguar would have made such a hybrid model even more playable and appealing – and dare I say, more 'Paranormal' –but maybe that's being too picky.



For what it is, the Paranormal Offset Telecaster is a great player. It feels a little ‘tight' at times with bends and faster runs, especially higher up the neck, but for some shoegaze-y rhythm playing and ethereal chording, it delivers the goods. It's solid, rather than extraordinary, but comfortable and reliable nonetheless.



Sounds rating: ★★★★☆

Like most Squiers that come packing Fender Designed Alnico Single-Coils, the stock sounds are probably all you'd want or need from an Offset Tele. Clear, punchy and bright with plenty of bite that can really cut through the mix, they are capable of handling everything from piercing cleans to fuzz-drenched leads, with an impressive clarity and definition maintained throughout.

When compared to my usual American Vintage II Telecaster Thinline, it didn't quite set the room alight, but it definitely performed better than expected when I gave it a tour of my Neural DSP Nano Cortex and wider rig – especially when compared to a guitar almost six times its price tag. In fact, I was particularly drawn to its neck pickup, which seemingly avoids the overly 'wooly' and muddy sound that budget pickups are often known for.

I found multiple in-song applications for some of the switching options that my more expensive Tele simply can't deliver. To that end, my original skepticism over Squier's decision to super-charge the control circuit here diminished considerably.

The out-of-phase mode, for example, meant I could get a tasty 'quack' for funky rhythms, and with the tone knob rolled off, nice quasi-wah sounds for lead hooks. Elsewhere, the series/parallel split helped flip-flop between a bit more added warmth and depth, which the single-coils on their own lacked.

All of this caused me to do a U-turn on my opinion of this guitar's electronics, and by the end I was onboard. It's an admirable all-round performance indeed, especially from a guitar as affordable and stylish as this.



This is a very cool guitar with a lot of style, and fortunately it has the substance to match its good looks. On paper, the Jazzmaster/Telecaster design brief should absolutely work, and while it doesn't have a flawless execution and it teeters on the edge of trying too hard, the resulting guitar has won this writer over.

Minor QC issues aside, it's a well built, well thought-out, and well assembled Squier, and a worthy addition to the Paranormal range. Granted it didn't quite leave the same impression that other Paranormal Squiers have in the past – look no further than the Troublemaker Tele, for example – but it's a solid player with a bunch of inspiring and applicable tones to boot.

That said, a regular Jazzmaster/Telecaster hybrid, without the Custom Shop-inspired bells and whistles is something I'd love to see from the Paranormal range in the future...

Final verdict: A gorgeously styled guitar that has more than enough substance to match its irresistible style. It's solid, comfortable player and a clever hybrid mash-up of the Jazzmaster/Telecaster designs, with a range of expansive tones that make it a wholly usable and inspiring Squier.

Squier J Mascis Jazzmaster Price: $499/£519Easily one of the best-made Squier Jazzmasters money can buy right now. If you want a high-performing Squier offset, but don't want to get bogged down in the novelty of the Paranormal models, look no further. One for the purists. 

Squier Paranormal Troublemaker Telecaster DeluxePrice: $449/£399Though the Paranormal Offset Tele didn't move us, the Troublemaker Telecaster Deluxe definitely did. We gave it a five-star review last year, and commended it for its top notch humbucker tones and excellent playability. This one pairs a Tele with the style of a Les Paul, and it's an example of the Paranormal series done right.

Squier Paranormal Custom Nashville StratocasterPrice: $499/£519

Another example of the Paranormal range nailing its design brief, this Telecaster/Stratocaster mash-up is one of the lineup's stand-out releases. It's a very versatile instrument with a lot of charm.

Ridley Scott's Alien is a sci-fi-horror classic, but its original ending would have been disastrous.


	By Brad Curran

1979's Alien almost had a very different, and far worse, ending that could have derailed the Alien franchise that followed the movie. Set in the 22nd century, Ridley Scott's Alien centers on the crew of the space mining cargo ship the Nostromo, who encounter a monstrous extraterrestrial creature on their trip home (the alien later dubbed a “Xenomorph” in James Cameron's 1986 sequel, Aliens). The creature slaughters the entire crew of the Nostromo, with only Ellen Ripley, played by a then-unknown Sigourney Weaver, escaping with her life. The success of Alien kickstarted the ongoing Alien franchise, which has also been the subject of comic books, video games, streaming television with the upcoming Hulu series Alien Earth, and even crossed over with another famous 20th Century Fox alien creature in the Aliens vs. Predator franchise. And all of it might never have happened if the original ending of Alien had been used.

As with many movies, the ending of Alien wasn't set in stone when the movie first entered production, with Ridley Scott proposing a very different and far more grim ending to 20th Century Fox. While the ending was never filmed, Scott spoke of it in an interview with EW in 2017, and it would have likely heavily reshaped the Alien franchise – if not ended before it even began.

After Ripley escapes with her cat, Jonesy, on the Nostromo's escape ship just before the interstellar cargo freighter explodes, she at first breathes a sigh of relief that the monstrous alien creature who decimated her entire crew has been eliminated. However, as Ripley prepares for to re-enter cryosleep and await rescue, she is startled and horrified to discover the Xenomorph has stowed aboard the escape ship, with Ripley then successfully blowing open the ship's air lock, causing the Xenomorph to be sucked out into the vacuum of space. Though the Xenomorph holds on to the sides of the ship's doorway, Ripley fires a harpoon that knocks the Xenomorph out, with the creature then being roasted by fire from the ship's thrusters. Scott's original ending for Alien would have played out more or less the same up to the point of Ripley harpooning the Xenomorph. However, this would have proven to be ineffective against the alien, who then manages to pull itself back into the ship and, in Ridley Scott's words to EW, “It comes forward and it slams through her mask and rips her head off.”

The never-filmed alternate ending of Alien gets even wilder from there, with the Xenomorph then approaching the ship's controls and speaking  into the radio, saying “I'm signing off. Hopefully, they'll pick me up” in the voice of Tom Skerritt's Captain Dallas. Per Scott, he pitched this original ending for Alien over the phone, and the studio swiftly threatened to fire him from the movie, leading to Alien‘s ending being changed to have Ripley prevail. While the response of 20th Century Fox's executives may have been on the aggressive side, there is plenty to indicate that the ending change was still the right call to make.

It isn't uncommon in horror movies for the rug to get pulled out from under the protagonists at the last minute, with the villain winning in one last terrifying scare. However, hindsight being 20/20, Alien's original ending versus the one it went with shows a real fork in the road for where the Alien franchise could have gone. The event of Ripley's death wouldn't necessarily have prevented any further movies in the Alien Universe from ever being made, with Ridley Scott's prequels Prometheus and Alien: Covenant showing there's plenty of Alien stories to tell without the involvement of Ripley. However, the movie's direct sequel Aliens is regarded not only as a classic of sci-fi and action but as the best of the Alien franchise by many Alien fans (including yours truly). You can throw Aliens and virtually every Alien movie not set before the original into the recycling bin, if Ripley had never made it out alive.

Moreover, Scott's original ending would have taken the movie out on a bizarre twist that completely undercuts the spine-tingling tone of everything that came before it. The Xenomorph suddenly not only having the ability to speak, but the ability to mimic the voice of specific humans, would have been wild. While much of the xenomorphs' mythos – including their Facehugger-spawning eggs being laid by the queen – isn't established until Aliens, the original Xenomorph doesn't show the slightest indication of being able to speak. On top of being a generally crushing experience for viewers, the abandoned ending of Alien would have likely been a “Jump the Shark” moment on par with the wild unrealized original plans for Scott's Gladiator II. Fortunately, Alien ended up heading down the path toward a brighter future of nightmare storytelling.

The gloomy tone of Alien would have made Ripley's demise a particularly tough pill to swallow; moreover, it would have robbed sci-fi fandom and cinema of a great legacy franchise. Not just the equally iconic Aliens, but the franchise's past and present bridge Alien: Romulus, and maybe even the Aliens vs. Predator crossovers. That's not counting Sigourney Weaver's run as Ripley, which established one of the greatest sci-fi and/or horror heroines of all time. The transformation Ripley experiences from Alien to Aliens, in particular, would be a great storytelling loss of a deeply traumatized survivor becoming a warrior with an iron will. Alien concluding with the Xenomorph sending out a phony transmission in the voice of Dallas would have ended the movie on a whimper, and likely would've become a punchline in later years.

By keeping so much about the Xenomorph unknown and mysterious, Alien is the kind of movie that is strengthened by elements it left unexplained being expanded upon and evolved in subsequent entries in the series. While Alien certainly tells a standalone story, it's now chapter one in a sci-fi and horror movie legacy that it simply would not have had as a one-and-done horror tale with a downer ending. Sometimes, horror movies really stick the landing when the villain wipes out all of the protagonists, and other times, it's best for the good guys to win. Alien is an example of the latter, and its original ending shows how much that could have changed for the worse.

The Alien movies are available to stream on Hulu and Disney+, and Alien: Earth will debut on Hulu this summer.

Supernatural star Jared Padalecki has always spoken about the fantasy horror series with enthusiasm and acknowledged the impact the long-running series has on his life and career. Similar to previous years, the actor also paid his character, Sam Winchester, a tribute on his birthday.

Jared Padalecki was 23 years old when Season 1 premiered in 2005 and was 38 when the final season aired in 2020. Similar to one of the most iconic Supernatural quotes, the show did end up being a family business, not just because the cast and crew evolved together, but because many found their significant others on the show, including Padalecki. In his latest tribute on Instagram, the actor celebrated with his wife, Genevieve Padalecki, whom he met on the set of Supernatural, and their children.

A first look at Jensen Ackles' new thriller series, Countdown, has been released, as well as when fans can stream the new show on Prime Video.

Sam Winchester was born on May 2, 1983. To celebrate his birthday, the actor wrote, ""The Padalecki Clan got together to celebrate #SamWinchester's birthday... Turns out he and Ruby smoothed things over in the afterlife.""

Padalecki and his wife, Genevieve Cortese, met on the set of Supernatural, where she played the second Ruby. Their characters had a brief romance before Ruby was killed off. Genevieve returned to the show for one of Supernatural's best episodes, ""The French Mistake,"" where Sam and Dean became their real-life actors, Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, respectively. In the episode, Sam was shocked that he married Ruby in real life.

A Supernatural reunion is coming, one way or another.

Padalecki never let an opportunity slip to show his appreciation for the show. However, he also acknowledged the hardships at the MEGACON Orlando in February this year. ""I think 20 years ago today, we were shooting the pilot,"" he recalled. ""There were a lot of sacrifices. There's been a lot of sh*t."" He continued, ""But in hindsight, I'm so grateful to the [fans] because I was public with what I was going through and you were all supportive.""

He also celebrated the fourth anniversary of the show's filming wrap in September 2024, teasing a reunion in the future. He did the same on May 2, 2024, when he wished Sam Winchester a happy birthday.

The conversation about a reunion sparked due to the leading duo, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. In late 2023, the two actors teased that there were talks about continuing the series, despite its Season 15 finale. However, nothing is official yet.

Supernatural was a passion project for many actors, especially those who found love on the set, or brought their significant others to play different characters. Since the finale, the actors moved on to new projects, but Padalecki confirmed that he will play Sam again in the future, teasing that they might sit down and talk about a reboot this year, five years after the finale.

Although the Supernatural reboot is yet to receive an official confirmation, the main stars, alongside Misha Collins, will reunite on The Boys. The satirical superhero series comes from Supernatural creator Eric Kripke and will feature Padalecki and Collins in the fifth and final season. Ackles had already been a part of the show since Season 4, alongside other Supernatural alums.

Supernatural had an unofficial crossover with The Walking Dead, introducing alternate worlds and creating a great way to bring Negan into the revival.

Severance deserves all the praise it receives, but it's not the first show to split personalities to fill a work quota.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","Snap result: Speckles the psychic crocodile predicts who will win Australian election","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/02/speckles-crocodile-predicts-australian-election-winner","Sat, 03 May 2025 09:05:00 GMT","

On the eve of the federal poll, the famed 36-year-old Darwin saltwater croc tips a Peter Dutton victory

On the eve of Australia's national poll to determine its next leader, two hunks of meat were dangled above a murky pool.

Attached to one line, the picture of prime minister, Anthony Albanese. Upon the other, the man who would dethrone him, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton.

In the water lurked a 36-year-old saltwater crocodile called Speckles.

Associate professor of Greek history at the University of Queensland, David Pritchard, says ancient Athenian democracy, the birthplace of democracy, was thick with ritual and magic. So it's only fitting Speckles was once again put to the test, this time with chunks of buffalo meat.

“That's a form of divination,” Pritchard says. “That is a form of interpreting portents to work out what is going to happen in the future.”

So whom did the gods of the tropical north ordain for electoral victory this Saturday?

Once again Speckles predicted the fall of a government – only this time, he was decisive. In 2022, the 4.8 metre saltie predicted, via plucked chook, that Albanese would defeat then prime minister Scott Morrison.

“He did it really really quickly,” Crocodylus Park's Jess Grills says. “Straight up for Peter Dutton.”

But while Speckles might have an unblemished record as an oracle, Pritchard cautioned against fatalistically accepting his verdict.

The historian says that while the ancient Athenians performed many similar rituals as part of their democracy and often looked to the gods for guidance, it was up to people to interpret signs from the divine.

“Keeping the gods happy was very important to the Athenians,” Pritchard says. “But they took control of their own lives.”

Which is another tradition that Anne-Marie Condé, senior curator at the Museum Of Australian Democracy At Old Parliament House, hopes lives on in the modern world.

Condé says she believes Australians are proud of the nation's innovations in democracy, from the pioneering of the secret ballot to universal suffrage to compulsory voting.

“It's fun watching crocodiles decide who might be the next prime minister,” Condé says. “But you know what: your vote does count, it's not a random thing.

Programming note: Listen to the first episode of Persuadable, a new podcast hosted by Donie O'Sullivan here.



            “How can you talk to those crazy people?”
    


            I get asked that question a lot.
    


            Over the last few years, I've spoken to hundreds — possibly thousands — of Americans whose lives have become consumed by conspiracy theories.
    


            It's easy, perhaps natural, for us to want to label them all as “crazy.”
    


            But it's not true.
    


            The overwhelming majority of people I have spoken to are highly productive members of society. They are moms, dads, business owners — they're your next-door neighbor, your son, your daughter.
    


            They are disillusioned, disaffected, and in some cases they are desperate. But they are not crazy.
    


            They include the many Americans who don't believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, as well as a group of people I once met who don't even believe JFK is dead.
    


            In fact, most of us hold some form of conspiracy theory or superstitious belief that others might consider absurd.
    


            This kind of thinking can give us a sense of security by providing easy answers to difficult questions — certainty in uncertain times. It can provide a sense of purpose and community, a kinship among those who understand the “truth” or at least are on our side. An apparent antidote for an era of declining trust in institutions for an age when we are spending less time with each other and more time alone with our phones.
    


            Fear and isolation: It's why conspiracy theories flourished during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns. But for many families, the rabbit holes of 2020 are not a distant memory, they're an ongoing reality. A loved one coming to the kitchen table every night repeating bizarre claims about vaccines and cabals, becoming increasingly frustrated as their families fail to embrace their newfound “truth.”
    


            Every time I do a story about these kinds of beliefs I receive emails, messages, and hear from people on the street about their brother, their mom, their friend who's stuck down the rabbit hole. Their question for me is always the same: “How can I help them?”
    


            I never really had an answer. As a journalist on the misinformation beat, I viewed my job more as covering the phenomena of conspiracy theories, how they spread and how they affect people. Occasionally my editor at CNN, perhaps distraught by the seemingly infiniteness of the subject matter, would ask if there were any solutions we could include at the end of a story to make it “less depressing.” There weren't.
    


            But in Persuadable, a new limited series podcast from CNN Audio, we try to start a productive conversation about solutions.
    


            Step One is empathy.
    


            After years of talking to people with irrational beliefs, I began to think about some of my own.
    


            I don't believe in QAnon or the cabal. But I've had no shortage of irrational thoughts and obsessions. I've long grappled with mental health issues — anxiety, depression, and a particular form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that prompts distressing intrusive thoughts.
    


            In my case, irrational beliefs pop up during times of personal uncertainty, stress, or change, and are normally rooted in a false sense of guilt and reasons why I ought to hate myself — thought patterns that are familiar to many who suffer from depression.  If a family member gets sick, I can ruminate and convince myself that it is somehow my fault. It's clearly irrational but at times I can spend days or weeks obsessing about this and telling myself that it is true.
    


            It's important to point out here you needn't have mental health issues to hold irrational beliefs. I'm sure you can think of a time where you fell into a cycle of over-thinking something — maybe about a partner or an ex, or a situation at work, or something about your kid. You couldn't stop thinking about it and the more you thought about it the more stressed you became. Then it turned out to be nothing. Looking back, you can see the thought was irrational in the first place — but it was probably fueled by a genuine fear or insecurity.
    


            Indeed, psychologists I spoke to for this podcast explained how humans are wired to have irrational beliefs and that believing in conspiracy theories doesn't mean someone has a mental illness.
    


            I bring up my mental health experience because for me it is a way to unlock my own empathy for people who are mired in a world of conspiracy theories.
    


            I've spoken through the years to a few people who've gone down the QAnon rabbit hole and come back out. They describe the fear, uncertainty, and struggles in their own lives that drove them to seek meaning and purpose in the first place. The brief relief they felt when they first thought they'd found a truth that made sense to them — before eventually realizing they'd need to go deeper and deeper into the lies  to maintain that false sense of security, spiraling to a point where they thought they could never come back.
    


            Most of us have hit similar lows in our lives — they just aren't framed by QAnon and the belief our country is ruled by an evil cabal.
    


            The people who've been able to get back out of the pit of despair and disinformation have all described one thing that was critical to allowing them to do so: a friend.
    


            Having someone in their life who was willing to give them the space to come back with dignity and not be treated as a fool for the views they once espoused. That can be extremely difficult because oftentimes that someone is the person who had to sit and listen to the former believer's nonsensical QAnon talking points for months or years on end.
    


            Without creating that space, however, we risk giving our loved ones nowhere else to go but further into the conspiracy theory — where there is a community, albeit one built around a lie.
    


            There are so many things that make it difficult or impossible to reach empathy here.
    


            Not least, many rabbit holes are lined with hate, racism, antisemitism, and homophobia. How can you have empathy for someone who buys into a conspiracy theory that threatens a community of which you are a member?
    


            There are no straightforward answers — but this is my attempt to try to at least start a solution-oriented conversation about an issue that affects an untold number of families in the United States and all around the world.
    


            I am not a perfect messenger. There are plenty of times through the years I wish I had approached a believer in a conspiracy theory differently. Television news is not necessarily the best medium to unpack the sometimes-complicated reasons someone has arrived at their belief in a lie.
    


            Trust in the so-called “mainstream media,” of which I am a part, is at an all-time low. Some of that is due to relentless attacks on the press, often from people acting in bad faith. But some of it is also rooted in fair criticism about how we cover and how we talk about people who believe things that are wrong.
    


            I hope you listen to our podcast where we can talk about this a lot more.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Unsolved+Mysteries","10 Biggest Unsolved Mysteries In Fallout: New Vegas","https://screenrant.com/fallout-new-vegas-unsolved-mysteries-list/","Sat, 03 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

For all its lore, dialogue, and environmental storytelling, there's a lot we still don't know about Fallout: New Vegas. Perhaps more so than any other Fallout game, New Vegas is wordy. It has several well-developed, unique factions, some of the series' finest story DLC, and one of the most variable, fleshed-out stories in video game history. But part of its appeal is just how much it leaves to the imagination.

Tie-in media, like the New Vegas prequel comic All Roads and, more recently, the Fallout TV series, have only expanded how much we truly know about the Mojave and its inhabitants. But even so, there are a ton of blind spots when it comes to Fallout lore in general, and that's not even to mention all of New Vegas' cut content. Here are ten of the biggest unsolved mysteries in Fallout: New Vegas.

Vault 11 is one of the darker Vault-Tec social experiments you'll come across in New Vegas. The inhabitants of this vault were instructed to sacrifice one person among their number each year - if they failed to make a sacrifice, the entire population of the vault would be killed by unknown means. The vault dwellers constructed a political philosophy around this idea, eventually forming distinct factions, which, in time, sparked a bloody civil war culminating in a terrible realization.

Bethesda absolutely needs to remaster Fallout 3 next in order to both capitalize on the success of the Oblivion remaster and tide over Fallout fans.

But it is known that at least one person survived Vault 11. There's even a model for him hidden in the game's files, but he never shows up on-screen. What happened to him after the experiments, and whether he was able to build a new life for himself outside the vault, remains totally open to player interpretation.

During the New Vegas DLC Old World Blues, you'll encounter a group of mad scientists in the ruins of a once-great research facility, whose grounds are littered with all manner of abandoned and botched experiments. Most of these are explored as part of the story, at least to some extent, but the X-66 Hexcrete archipelago remains a near-total mystery. The area consists of two scattered rows of hexagonal concrete structures of varying sizes. This was, apparently, an attempt by the Big MT research team to experiment with a new construction material called hexcrete.

But what the researchers were actually trying to build here remains to be seen. The buildings aren't arranged according to any sort of pattern, nor can you actually enter them. Were they just playing around with the new material because they could, or did they actually have a purpose or design for these structures? This is never explained.

Robert House is one of New Vegas' most compelling mysteries, though his entire backstory is more or less explored by the end of the game. House is a relentless capitalist, and, if you follow his questline, he's well-equipped to turn you into the same. However, one aspect of his business plan isn't totally explained: his designs on Vault 21. Unlike other vaults you'll explore in New Vegas, though, this one's not a rundown ruin - it's actually an active novelty hotel and casino on The Strip.

It's not unlike House to want to bring the whole of New Vegas under his thumb, but he has a bigger, better casino of his own - what does he want with Vault 21? It's debatable, but his desire to seize control of it may have more to do with the extensive network of tunnels beneath it. It's not clear whether he just wants access to the hidden bunker for strategic purposes, or whether there may be some lost Vault-Tec technology inside he wants to get his hands on.

The Legion we come to know in Fallout: New Vegas is a ruthless conqueror, characterized by wanton violence, rampant discrimination, and slavery. It believes in its own lofty ideals - a restoration of the Roman Empire in the post-nuclear southwest - but we only see the Legion as it exists on the war front. It's implied that the faction has an expansive reach back east, and the official New Vegas game guide reveals that its empire is centered on the city of Flagstaff, Arizona.

But what daily life is like in Flagstaff remains totally unexplored. Has Caesar achieved a true recreation of Rome as it once was, with its representative democracy and its cosmopolitan diversity? Or is it just more violence and discrimination back home? There's no way of knowing, but we do know that Caesar's Legion is expanding westward for a reason: to grow its population and expand its army so it can continue to grow its borders.

One of the most familiar voices in Fallout is that of Mr. New Vegas, the personable host of Radio New Vegas. What many players don't realize, though, is that Mr. New Vegas isn't real - he's an artificial intelligence created before the Great War, in order to entertain the listening public. There's next to no lore about him in-game, although Bethesda developer called him an invention of Mr. House before release.

Mr. New Vegas is voiced by singer and actor Wayne Newton, commonly known as Mr. Las Vegas due to his long-running association with the city.

But that seems a bit of a frivolous pursuit for House, whose main focus is domination. Mr. New Vegas isn't exactly spouting pro-House propaganda; he introduces the next song, he makes a quip, and he moves on. So is House betraying a bit of a softer side, a weakness for music here? Or perhaps this was changed before the game was fully launched. And if he was created before the war, why is he called Mr. New Vegas?

New Vegas has a couple of mini-games, most of which are centered around its many casinos. There's one mini-game you can play almost anywhere, though: the unique card game Caravan, which is totally unique to New Vegas. It's a deckbuilding game in which each card has a set value, and your goal is to outbid your opponent by having a higher number of cards without falling under the lower limit of 21, or exceeding the upper limit of 26.

Avowed and Fallout: New Vegas share an early-game plot beat, but Avowed gives you a much more interesting and nuanced version of the familiar story.

But the rules of playing different cards are so complex, and the in-game explanation so unclear, that most players elect to skip Caravan altogether. For those who have consistently refused to engage with the rules, Caravan remains a total mystery.

If you side with Joshua Graham during the Honest Hearts DLC, your final quest will have you following Graham as he sets out to eradicate the White Legs from Zion Canyon. At length, he'll confront its leader, Salt-Upon-Wounds, to whom he'll speak a phrase in the pidgin language of the White Legs, ""Kale watcha nei conserva oh!"" This phrase has no official translation, and New Vegas' devs have declined to comment, preferring to leave it open to player interpretation.

A common fan theory holds that the phrase translates to something like, ""As God is my witness, you will not be spared,"" or ""God may be watching, but He will not save you."" It seems likely enough - White Legs pidgin uses quite a few loanwords, so it's safe to guess that ""watcha"" translates directly to ""watch,"" while ""conserva"" comes from ""conserve."" ""Nei"" could play a role similar to ""ne"" in French, i.e. as a negation. Whatever he's saying, though, it's abundantly clear Joshua is making a threat.

Fallout: New Vegas had a notoriously troubled development cycle, and lots of content was cut from the final version of the game due to development time constraints. So ultimately, no matter how much we explore, there's a lot we'll never quite know about New Vegas simply because it's no longer in the game.

Evidence of much of this cut content still exists in the game's files, and has been found via datamining. We'll never know exactly what was intended for characters like Betsy the Brahmin, Wrench, or Mayor Steyn. Nor will we be able to explore the several cut locations, like Pahrump or Vault 24.

A special perk in Fallout: New Vegas (among other Fallout) games allows you to randomly summon the series' most secretive character: the Mysterious Stranger. He'll pop up at random in VATS, finishing off your enemies with a well-placed shot. Although he appears in several entries, and his existence is more directly addressed in Fallout 4, New Vegas still drops the most compelling bit of information about the Mysterious Stranger: the implication that he may have a son.

Looking for answers about the Fallout franchise's most elusive gunslinger, the Mysterious Stranger, and his role in the games.

An NPC named the Lonesome Drifter, who dresses quite a bit like the Mysterious Stranger, may mention offhand that his father was shrouded in mystery. He also carries the same type of gun - the Mysterious Magnum. If you manage to buy it off him, or wrestle it from his cold, dead hands, you may note that when you draw it, it plays the same guitar sting you hear every single time the Mysterious Stranger appears.

Fallout: New Vegas has a very variable ending, which can change depending on which faction you ultimately sided with, and which sidequests you chose to complete. However, the remainder of the Fallout series has refused to touch New Vegas' ending, remaining largely reluctant to declare one option canon, or speak on what may have happened after the events of the game. This is, of course, intentional. You want players to feel they've had an impact on the world of New Vegas, and retconning their decisions in later works can be frustrating, if not alienating.

But still, the world of Fallout goes on after New Vegas - the TV show is set some years later - and somewhere, there must be an answer. Season two may decide to comment on what really happened at the end of the courier's journey through the Mojave, but for now, the true ending will remain Fallout: New Vegas' most enduring secret.

Yes man is the only ending that ends on a cliffhanger. After you beat the game, Yes Man let's you know he's shutting down for an upgrade that'll make him more assertive. That's alarming as an ending but is entirely unclear of what happens after. It could very well be the ""cannon"" ending that only the Fallout show will reveal.



Honestly, I think House was the best choice of all factions though.

One mod for Oblivion Remastered sets out to change a very specific issue relating to the keybindings, and it's proving popular with fans.

The newest event in Marvel Rivals is the Hellfire Gala Moments, which asks you to complete multiple activities and missions to earn free rewards.

In a new mod by Buttflapper on Nexus Mods, the range of the weapons in Oblivion Remastered has been increased to match the original game's ranges.

After over six years of waiting, the sequel to Hollow Knight, Silksong, will be playable in September—but there's one huge catch.

Oblivion Remastered's lockpicking mini-game can be tough, but there's a hidden sidequest that ensures you'll never have to play it again.

I was there at launch for Fallout 76, and it wasn't pretty - to Bethesda's credit, they turned things around and got the game back on track.

LONDON, May 3. /TASS/. The right-populist Reform UK party has achieved the best result among all contenders in the UK regional elections; Sky News has released the final results of the vote count.

The outcome of the elections, involving 13.7 million UK citizens, determined the fate of 1,600 seats in 23 local government bodies across England, including county councils, unitary authorities, and city boroughs. Reform UK, founded by Nigel Farage, won control of ten councils and swept 677 municipal deputies into local government. Before the election, the Reformers did not hold a single mandate in the municipalities participating this year. Reform UK candidates also secured one additional MP in parliament and clinched mayoral posts in two of the six regions that elected office holders.

The Liberal Democrats came in second, gaining a majority in three councils and winning 370 mandates, an increase of 163 compared to their previous standing. The Conservatives suffered a crushing defeat, losing control of 18 councils and surrendering 677 mandates, leaving the party with just 319 seats. Labour, which currently holds national power, also lost its grip on all councils and gave up 189 mandates, retaining only 98. In ten councils, no party managed to win an outright majority.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Reginald, a great dane, and Pearl, a chihuahua, met after winning their respective Guinness World Records categories

A playdate between the world's tallest and smallest living dogs went the way of most dog park encounters despite the 3ft (0.91-meter) height difference – lots of tail wagging, sniffing and scampering.

Reginald, a seven-year-old great dane from Idaho, and Pearl, a chihuahua from Florida, are both certified winners in their respective height titles by Guinness World Records. The fact that Reginald is the size of a small horse and Pearl is as small as an apple didn't stop them from getting along famously.

Pearl, a four-year-old who stands at 3.59in (9.14cm), comes from a long line of short dogs. Her aunt Millie, a previous record holder in the same category, until she died in 2020, also was under 4in (10.16cm) tall.

Both Millie and Pearl weighed 1oz (28.35 grams) at birth.

“I was not expecting to once again have the record,” said Vanesa Semler of Orlando, Florida, owner of both tiny dogs. “That would be like unbelievable.”

Guinness arranged the two-day meet-up between Pearl and Reginald – who also goes by Reggie and measures in at a whopping 3ft 3in (1 meter) – last month at his home in Idaho Falls.

Even though Pearl loves dogs, even big dogs, Semler said she was anxious because of Reginald's size.

“For me, [it] was a huge, pleasant surprise from day one because Reggie is like Pearl, in bigger size,” she said. “He is so gentle, so friendly.”

Reggie, for his part, might have been more interested in the Guinness film crew that accompanied Pearl than the tiny dog herself.

“I would say he likes people a little bit more than he likes other dogs,” said Sam Johnson Reiss, his owner.

Pearl's tiny size was also strange for the big boy.

“He was like very cautious, like a little anxious,” Reiss said. “He was very careful, like he didn't step on her or anything or anything crazy. He was just very aware that she was there.”

Reggie's super size was evident early on, especially on a dog park visit when he towered over other great danes despite being only nine months old.

“They would be shorter than him, and they were like full-grown,” Reiss said.

There might have been a little jealousy shown over toys and beds, but Reggie and Pearl found common ground during their two days roaming the Idaho farm together.

“I think she found a good friend,” Semler said.

Semler said Pearl is her prima donna, with the chihuahua even picking out the clothes she wants to wear every day by placing her paw on the outfits laid out before her. That comes in handy when news crews are lining up for interviews.

“For us, she was always our diva,” Semler said. “Now she's a diva for everyone.”

Pearl doesn't have the top diva title quite yet, with Reiss saying Reggie – who has a new Instagram account – has his own diva moments.

“He's pretty high maintenance,” Reiss said. “Reggie's just cheeky, like he's kind of mischievous and silly and definitely tells you when he wants something.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre speaks to supporters on election night in Ottawa on April 29.Chris Young/The Canadian Press

In the very early hours of Tuesday morning, Pierre Poilievre delivered an extraordinary speech to the few hundred Conservative faithful still gathered in the loveless embrace of a slick downtown Ottawa convention centre. 

It reminded me of something else I once saw, but we'll get to that.

By the time Mr. Poilievre appeared on election night, several seats were still in flux, but it was clear that Canada's next government would be Liberal. Again. Somehow. Incredibly.

The Conservative Leader delivered an election result better than expected, given how Donald Trump upended the political landscape. And that outcome was nowhere near the crushing Conservative majority that seemed certain just months ago, when Mr. Poilievre was the prime minister in-waiting and the actual prime minister was a dead man walking. 

But Mr. Poilievre did not arrive on the stage in that room full of blue to deliver a concession speech. After paying tribute to his wife, Anaida, he thanked Conservative candidates, volunteers and supporters, and then laid it on the line immediately: I'm not going anywhere, and this isn't over. 

“It will be an honour to continue to fight for you and to be a champion of your cause as we go forward,” Mr. Poilievre told the party that had chucked its past two leaders out a window after a single election loss. 

Opinion: The good and unnecessarily bad of Pierre Poilievre

He emphasized that Canadians had voted for “a razor-thin minority government, a virtual tie in the vote count,” though by morning, that wouldn't be the case. Mr. Poilievre congratulated Prime Minister Mark Carney, and when the crowd booed, the Conservative Leader quelled them by saying the time would come to hold the government to account, but the country came first. 

“Conservatives will work with the Prime Minister and all parties with the common goal of defending Canada's interests and getting a new trade deal that puts these tariffs behind us, while protecting our sovereignty and the Canadian people,” Mr. Poilievre said.

Somewhere, there's an alternate universe in which he said that or something similarly magnanimous back in November or March or two weeks ago. It‘s hard not to wonder what might have changed if he had. 

He outlined how the loss was really a win if you looked at it right, telling his fellow Tories that they had “much to celebrate,” gaining more than 20 seats and landing the largest share of the popular vote since Brian Mulroney's 1988 landslide. 

“We hear your stories, we will carry those stories with us into Parliament,” he said. He must have known, even as he said it, that he had lost his own Carleton riding to a newbie Liberal and wouldn't be returning to the House of Commons himself, at least not right away. 

There was another time when that sprawling suburban-rural region on the edge of Ottawa voted for an upstart and turfed a political veteran. 

The day after that election, in 2004, CPAC interviewed a panel of newly elected MPs, and the host began by introducing the Conservative rookie who had just toppled Liberal cabinet minister David Pratt as “a bit of a giant killer.” And there sat 25-year-old Mr. Poilievre, with chubby cheeks, owlish glasses and a too-big suit jacket. 

Canadian voters had just handed a bedraggled Liberal government a fourth-term minority, and the newly united Conservatives under Stephen Harper had come up short of expectations. When the host asked about this, that freshman version of Mr. Poilievre instantly framed that loss as a victory, too: It was the best popular vote a centre-right party had achieved since 1988, he said, and they'd gained more seats than anyone else.

He argued that this new Parliament needed to democratize things, because there had been a corrosive concentration of power in the Prime Minister's Office. And he wanted to “give people the right to fire their members of Parliament by petition if they break their word,” which he would propose in a private member's bill.

“That‘s exactly the genius of our party, is that you have the ability to speak up as an individual member of Parliament,” he said, adding, “These are the kinds of things that Liberal members of Parliament are not able to do because of the intense party discipline that comes down from the top.”

Earlier this year, Mr. Poilievre told Jordan Peterson that he's never changed his mind on anything. And it is certainly some kind of remarkable that the same points he was raising in teenage letters to the editor or an undergraduate essay about becoming prime minister are, almost verbatim, how he fought this election campaign to try to land that job in real life. 

But it‘s not quite true that all of his ideas are bolted to the floor. He used to believe that there was too much top-down control of MPs, and then at some point, he became a party leader who refused to allow local candidates to do interviews or debates, and doled out speaking time to his caucus as a reward for following instructions. 

Sometimes, it seems, we grow in ways that surprise even us. 

The real message that the present-day Mr. Poilievre wanted to bring home on election night was the idea he underlined over and over again: A big shift doesn't happen all at once, and you have to be patient enough to let it unfold.

In that inky postmidnight hour, when they were still tallying the ballots but the answer that counted was already clear, Mr. Poilievre was trying to persuade his party that this result, in all its hijacked strangeness, was a down payment on a victory deferred. He was good for the rest if they would just wait a while and put their knife-sharpening kits away. 

“I know that some of you might be disappointed that change did not get over the finish line tonight. Change takes time,” he said. “Most of all, it requires that we never give up, because our people and our country are worth fighting for.”

This wasn't something 25-year-old Pierre Poilievre had given attention to in that long-ago interview. The way time stretches and slips, and the value of second chances, doesn't shape a young man's view of the world like it does when you're older.

An investigation found the social media giant transferred data to China, violating strict EU privacy rules. TikTok said it would appeal against the decision.

Popular short-video platform TikTok has been hit with a hefty fine of €530 million ($602 million) for transferring Europeans' personal data to China.

On behalf of the European Union, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) said on Friday that the app, which is used by 1.5 billion people around the world, had breached the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

TikTok is the subsidiary of the Chinese tech giant ByteDance. But because it has its European headquarters in Ireland, the DPC is the lead regulator in the EU for the social platform, as well as for other tech giants with European headquarters in Ireland, such as Amazon, Google, and Meta and X.

The fine is the second largest ever imposed by the EU. In 2023, Ireland's data protection watchdog already fined TikTok €345 million for violating European rules on processing children's data.

During the investigation, the social media giant said it did not host user data from Europe on servers in China, but admitted in April that it had done so to a limited extent, the Irish data protection watchdog said.

""TikTok failed to verify, guarantee and demonstrate that the personal data of (European) users, remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU,"" said DPC deputy commissioner Graham Doyle.

""TikTok did not address potential access by Chinese authorities to (Europeans') personal data under Chinese anti-terrorism, counter-espionage and other laws identified by TikTok as materially diverging from EU standards,"" he added in a statement.

For its part, TikTok said it planned to appeal the EU fine. The company insisted that it had ""never received a request"" from Chinese authorities for European users' data.

TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is based in China, but the app's representatives have repeatedly stressed that ByteDance is majority-owned by international investors. Still, ByteDance must comply with Chinese authorities through its Beijing headquarters.

Several countries have banned the platform for varying periods of time, including Pakistan, Nepal and the French territory of New Caledonia.

The company has already come under fire in the United States, where experts fear it could allow Americans' data to fall into the hands of the Chinese government.

Former President Joe Biden signed a law a year ago requiring ByteDance to divest its US operations or face a ban. His successor, President Donald Trump, has repeatedly extended the deadline for the app's sale.

Ahmad bin Mubarak says he was not able to take the decisions he needed to or to fully exercise his powers

Ahmad bin Mubarak, the premier of Yemen's internationally recognised government, has announced his resignation saying he was unable to fully exercise his powers.

Bin Mubarak had been entangled in bitter disputes for months with Rashad al-Alimi, who heads the Saudi-backed Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), two ministers and a member of the PLC told AFP.

They requested anonymity in order to speak freely.

After Iran-backed Houthi rebels seized the capital, Sana'a, in 2014, Yemen's government withdrew to Aden in the south. The rebels went on to control most population centres in the impoverished Arabian peninsula country.

A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in support of beleaguered government forces in 2015 but with little success.

On Saturday, Bin Mubarak posted on X that he had met the PLC's Alimi and resigned.

He also shared his resignation letter in which he said: “I could not exercise my constitutional powers and take the necessary decisions to reform government institutions or implement rightful governmental changes.”

The Houthis are currently waging a campaign of missile attacks on Israel and are targeting shipping in key waterways in what they say is a show of solidarity with Palestinians over the war in Gaza.

Bin Mubarak said that despite the obstacles he had managed to achieve “many successes in a short space of time”, citing fiscal and administrative reforms and an anti-corruption drive.

However, analyst Mohammed Al-Basha, of the US-based Basha Report Risk Advisory, told AFP Bin Mubarak had been “in constant friction with the Presidential Leadership Council”.

“Bin Mubarak wanted to be more than prime minister – he wanted the powers of the presidency. That aspiration isolated him politically,” al-Basha said.

The Yemeni official sources who spoke to AFP said Bin Mubarak had suspended the budgets of several ministries including defence, citing corruption, further fuelling tensions.

“His drive for greater power – viewed by many as fuelled by personal ambition – led to repeated confrontations with key ministers and most council members,” Albasha said. “Over time, this power struggle eroded trust.”

Bin Mubarak, Yemen's former ambassador to the US, is a staunch adversary of the Houthis, who abducted him in 2015 and held him for several days.

Previously he was chief of staff of the presidential office and Yemen's envoy to the United Nations.

He was appointed foreign minister in 2018 and prime minister on 5 February 2024.

His departure should “ease internal tensions and reduce the deep divisions that have plagued Yemen's internationally recognised government – a necessary and positive step toward restoring cohesion”, al-Basha said.

The war in Yemen has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, although the fighting decreased significantly after a UN-negotiated six-month truce in 2022.

Since the war in the Gaza Strip broke out in October 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel, the Houthis have repeatedly targeted Israel and ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden that they say are linked to it.

The Houthis paused their attacks during a two-month Gaza ceasefire, but in March a threat to resume attacks over Israel's Gaza aid blockade triggered a renewed and sustained US air campaign targeting areas in Yemen they control.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Romania election: Will a right-wing extremist top the poll?","https://www.dw.com/en/romania-election-will-a-right-wing-extremist-top-the-poll/a-72403011","Sat, 03 May 2025 03:07:45 GMT","

The rerun of the Romanian presidential election that was annulled last December takes place on May 4. DW takes a look at the main candidates, including frontrunner George Simion, a pro-Russian right-wing extremist.

The atmosphere in Romania in the run-up to the first round of the presidential election does not suggest that these are momentous times. In fact, the general mood is more along the lines of widespread weariness.

Nevertheless, Romania is at a crossroads.

Sunday's poll — a rerun of the election that was annulled last December after the first round — will be one of the most important elections in Romania since the collapse of communism at the end of the 1980s.

The president of Romania does not have many domestic powers — but does have a degree of foreign policy authority and is an influential figure in the country.

Now, for the first time since the overthrow of the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in December 1989, a right-wing extremist in the form of former football hooligan George Simion is frontrunner.

His closest rival in the polls, Crin Antonescu, represents the decades-long misery of post-Communist Romanian democracy.

Romania is the most populous country in southeast Europe and the most important EU and NATO member in the region.

It is experiencing the war in Ukraine more immediately than any other EU member state: not only because it shares the EU's longest national border with Ukraine, but also because rockets regularly fly over its territory, Shahed drones have crashed in the Danube Delta, and it faces frequent Russian provocations in the Black Sea.

In view of all this, only one thing is certain in this election: Regardless of the outcome, Romania faces a highly insecure and difficult future.

It seems partly coincidental and partly inevitable that the field of candidates in the election is the way it is.

Last November, Calin Georgescu shocked the world by winning the first round of the presidential election. Georgescu is an esoteric, a conspiracy theorist, a pro-Russian right-wing extremist and an apologist for the Orthodox Christian fascist Iron Guard movement of the interwar years.

One important reason for his victory was that he made clever use of social media — especially TikTok — in a society that has largely decoupled itself from traditional media.

A more profound reason for his success was, however, the frustration within Romanian society about the state of the country.

Democracy in Romania is largely a simulated one. For decades, it has been dominated by clientelistic political cliques that divide up resources between them, control the judiciary and other state institutions and prevent any form of responsible, future-oriented, sustainable governance.

These include the post-communist Social Democratic Party (PSD). In contrast to what its name suggests, the PSD generally adopts nationalist, traditionalist positions.

Then there is the National Liberal Party (PNL), which has next to nothing in common with political and economic liberalism in its classic form, and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR), which has degenerated into a pro-Viktor Orban party in Romania.

These three parties have been ruling the country in various different constellations for quite some time and even formed a three-party coalition after the parliamentary election last December.

After Georgescu won the first round of last November's presidential election, the Constitutional Court annulled the election on the grounds of illegal election campaign financing and foreign interference in the election in Georgescu's favor.

The suspicion was that Russia had meddled in the election. So far, however, only the crime of illegal campaign financing has been proven.

In March, Georgescu was barred from running in Sunday's rerun.

The frontrunner is now George Simion, Romania's best-known right-wing extremist.

Thirty-eight-year-old Simion began his political career among Bucharest's football hooligans, later hitting the headlines for acts of violence targeting Romania's Hungarian minority and for founding in 2019 the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) party.

The AUR would like to see a Greater Romania that would include the Republic of Moldova and parts of Ukraine.

It came second in last November's parliamentary election, garnering about 18% of the vote. Together with two other parties, the extreme right-wing accounts for about 35% of all seats in parliament.

Simion has made headlines in recent years for acts of extreme aggression and violence in parliament.

In February 2022, he physically attacked a minister at the lectern. In December 2023, he shouted ""I'll sexually assault you, b***!"" at a female former member of his party in the parliament chamber.

In his TikTok and Facebook videos, he generally uses the typically violent language of Romanian street criminals.

Simion is suspected of having links to the Russian secret service FSB and Russian ultra nationalists, including far-right Russian philosopher and Eurasianist fascist ideologue Alexander Dugin.

He is banned from entering Moldova and Ukraine.

To make himself more palatable to a wider electorate, Simion has toned down his rhetoric considerably during this campaign. He has positioned himself as a Trump supporter and ""savior of Romanian democracy.""

Most polls suggest Simion will get well over 30% of the vote. That being said, opinion polls in Romania are unreliable because they are often used as means of political propaganda and many polling institutes are not independent.

Crin Antonescu (65), former member of the National Liberal Party, and Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan (55) are neck-and-neck behind Simion, with most polls giving Antonescu the edge over Dan.

Antonescu is the joint candidate of the ruling three-party coalition of PSD, PNL and UDMR.

Several Romanian media ironically refer to him as the ""man from the past who wants to bring Romania forward,"" alluding to the name of his electoral alliance ""Romania Forward."" Nevertheless, Antonescu represents above all a past characterized by clientelism and corruption.

The one candidate who really could bring Romania forward is Nicusor Dan, the mayor of Bucharest. Dan is a progressive liberal independent candidate, who made a name for himself as an activist who fought against the Bucharest real estate mafia and co-founded the green-liberal protest party Save Romania Union (USR).

Dan is a mathematician and is seen as honest, not corrupt, but also not hugely successful in his role as mayor of the capital because he stands alone against a powerful system. Unlike Antonescu, he is in favor of unconditional support for Ukraine.

Dan speaks quietly, calmly and is seen as a level-headed, rational, conflict-averse politician who approaches problems analytically and seeks long-term solutions. He is considered to be a man of the people and actively seeks contact with citizens.

Liberal candidate Elena Lasconi is not seen as having a chance in Sunday's election, even though she surprisingly came second in the annulled first round of the election last November. She has since lost the support of her party, the USR, which now backs Nicusor Dan.

It is unlikely that a president will be elected directly on Sunday because none of the candidates is expected to get the absolute majority that would require.

The runoff election is scheduled to take place on May 18.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Red Bull's plans spark water scarcity fears near Berlin","https://www.dw.com/en/red-bulls-plans-spark-water-scarcity-fears-near-berlin/a-72419936","Sat, 03 May 2025 10:10:08 GMT","

International drinks maker Red Bull's expansion plans in the drought-ridden region around the German capital are coming under fire amidst concerns about environmental sustainability and accusations of intransparency.

The small town of Baruth is just over an hour's train ride out of Berlin. Some 4,500 people live here and in the 12 surrounding villages that make up the municipality. Forests and a few fields dominate the landscape.

Two years ago, energy drinks maker Red Bull and its partner Rauch took over operations from a mineral water company, acquiring its rights to 2.37 million cubic meters of groundwater each year.

Up to now, the new owners have used less than half that amount. But uptake looks set to more than double under recently approved development plans.

Brandenburg, which encircles the German capital, is one of the driest regions in the country. It's being hard hit by climate change. This winter, less rain fell here than in any other German state. Rising temperatures and changing rain patterns are also leading to increased water loss due to evaporation — and, as a result, sinking groundwater levels.

Baruth's mayor Peter Ilk says there is enough water to go around: ""We are using a maximum of 25% of the water available. I don't believe that we are an area that will have any problems in the near future. We are talking in the region of maybe 30, 50 years,"" he told DW.

Unter the existing permit, some 92% of the water being extracted by Baruth's local waterworks, WABAU, goes to the drinks manufacturers and 8% to the districts' residents. Under German law water is designated as common property and drinking water provision has priority over commercial needs.

One citizen, who is concerned about the sustainability and transparency of the project, has launched a legal challenge to the plans with the help of a right-to-know platform ""Frag-den-Staat"" (ask the state). Lawyer Ida Westphal said that the aim was to get the local authority to disclose what Red Bull is getting in terms of subsidies and how much it is paying for the water.

Mayor Ilk explained that water levels were closely monitored by Brandenburg's environmental agency and supplies to the drinks manufacturers could be throttled in the event of concern.

Groundwater, however, remains a scientific black box, according to environmentalists, making it impossible to know how much exists deep underground and how quickly it is replenished. Over-extraction also carries the danger of contamination. 

Björn Ellner, from the German environmental association NABU, sees the situation critically. In an interview with DW, he said: ""In my view we cannot allow any water intensive industries to move to Brandenburg. In particular when groundwater is involved.""

Richard Jacob, from the nature conservation organization BUND, told DW that Red Bull and Rauch's operations could only be ""tolerated"" in terms of job creation. ""Really, it's crazy what we are doing here. In dry Brandenburg we are producing these drinks in great quantities. And then we are transporting them by truck to Scandinavia where there is plenty of water available. Or to eastern Europe where there is plenty of water.""

In the early 1990s, there was no industry to speak of here in what had been communist East Germany. Baruth's mayor Peter Ilk is proud of the gleaming enterprise zone that he has helped build up right outside town and the employment opportunities that he has created.

By bringing Red Bull and Rauch to the town, he said some 300 jobs had been saved and that another 150 to 200 would be created under the new plans. The municipality will get a €14-million ($15.9 mio) grant from the state of Brandenburg to build a water treatment plant for Red Bull and Rauch, the mayor added.

""It is sustainable, alone by dint of the fact that we have secured jobs here,"" said Ilk. He said residents should not all be forced to make the 70-kilometer (43.5 miles) journey to Berlin or elsewhere, but should be able to get jobs locally. But the mayor also conceded that Baruth's biggest problem was attracting families with children to the area because of a lack of living space and building land. Much of the surrounding countryside is designated as a conservation area.

Shoppers outside one of Baruth's local supermarkets, told DW they support the employment opportunities that he is creating and the tax influx to the town. However, some voice criticism of the ""non-European"" workers that the development has reportedly brought to the town, or regard the chopping down of 16 hectares of forest to make way for an aluminum canning plant as incompatible with the town's sustainability agenda. None of them want their names published.

Red Bull also gets its water from Austria and Switzerland. In 2023, it was nominated for a booby prize for ""transport nonsense"" by the Swiss environmental organization ""Alpen-Initiative"" for shipping water extracted in the Alps in the form of energy drinks all the way round the world. Many drinks manufacturers export just the syrups, which are then mixed with water locally.

Concern about the expansion of the soft drinks plant has been fueled by reports from Grünheide, also in Brandenburg. US automaker Tesla set up a huge plant there several years ago — and there have been protests about its heavy water consumption and the razing of forests.

Workers from 150 different nations now work at the Tesla plant in Grünheide. Many commute from Berlin or across the Polish border. Works council chairwoman Michaela Schmitz told rbb public radio that most of the employees come from Germany, Turkey, Poland, Syria and India.

Red Bull and Rauch did not respond to our requests for information.

            Less than two months ago, when the Trump administration turned off the Voice of America's networks and websites, Kari Lake, a fierce loyalist to President Donald Trump, said the agency is “unsalvageable.”
    


            Now, Lake is working on salvaging it, and VOA is about to come back online. “We look forward to working with you all,” Lake wrote in a Friday night memo to the staffers she sidelined back in March.
    


            Why the sudden change? A series of federal court rulings against the Trump administration's silencing of US-funded international broadcasters.
    


            About 1,400 VOA employees and contractors at VOA and its parent agency, the US Agency for Global Media, now have access to their email accounts and other systems again, according to a Friday memo from the Justice Department.
    


            Staffers will be allowed back to their offices beginning next week, and that's when VOA programming will resume, the memo stated.
    


            The US Agency for Global Media did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Voice of America is a government-funded entity that produces journalism and promotes democratic values outside the United States, countering foreign propaganda efforts by other countries.
    


            Getting back online will be no small task. “Bringing VOA out of a deep coma will require substantial time and a Herculean effort of our nearly 50 language services to try to reach some of our pre-shutdown total audience of 340 million,” VOA chief national correspondent Steve Herman told CNN.
    


            Herman pointed out that VOA readers and listeners were never “given an explanation of why we were silenced.”
    


            It happened abruptly on Saturday, March 15, after Trump — who had been critical of VOA for years — signed an executive order to drastically shrink the US Agency for Global Media and several other agencies.
    


            VOA staffers were told to stop working in the middle of their shifts. Web producers were told to stop posting stories. Some VOA radio stations started to play music in lieu of news. The VOA home page has been frozen in time ever since, with old stories from that day.
    


            Lake and her deputies also terminated the financial support for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and other broadcasters that have historically relied on the government.
    


            Those broadcasters tried to stay on the air and online in limited fashion, but as funds have run out, they have resorted to layoffs and other cost-cutting maneuvers.
    


            At VOA, staffers have been stuck in a form of bureaucratic limbo. In April, some started to look for other work while others held out hope that the courts would intervene.
    


            And on April 22, that's what Judge Royce C. Lamberth did; he said the administration was “likely in direct violation of numerous federal laws” and ordered the administration to bring VOA staffers back to work.
    


            It was just a preliminary injunction, though, and the administration immediately appealed, as it did when courts ruled in favor of Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe.
    


            On Thursday, an appeals court stayed, or paused, the rulings pertaining to those broadcasters, pending further review, but did not stay Lamberth's order about VOA. That's what apparently led to the return-to-work message on Friday night.
    


            Some VOA staffers told CNN they are viewing the situation with skepticism, given the Trump administration's open hostility toward the network.
    


            A Trumpian press release in March accused the US Agency for Global Media of “massive national security violations,” “obscene over-spending” and “a product that often parrots the talking-points of America's adversaries.”
    


            Lake, who was chosen by Trump to overhaul the operation, said she was happy to “DOGE” herself “out of a job.”
    


            But Trump's original executive order referred to shrinking the agency down to what is “statutorily required by law.”
    


            And now that the courts have reaffirmed that Congress created and funded the international broadcasters, Lake has changed her tone.
    


            “In the coming days you will be receiving guidance from management on next steps forward in modernizing the agency and meeting the mission,” Lake wrote Friday night.

Alain Hamel, the father of deceased UCSB student Liz Hamel, discusses the investigation into how his daughter fell from her college dorm on ‘America Reports.'

A Washington state father is pressing for answers about the investigation into his 18-year-old daughter's on-campus death at a California university earlier this year. 

Liz Hamel, 18, was found unconscious outside a dorm on the campus of the University of California Santa Barbara Feb. 14 after apparently falling from a breezeway. She died days later. 

But what happened leading up to her death remains a mystery. 

""Over the past few months, we've been briefed by UC Santa Barbara PD, and they've been very kind to us. They've been … empathetic. But, of course, since it's an ongoing investigation, they can't give us a tremendous amount of details,"" Alain Hamel, Liz's father, told Fox News ""America Reports"" co-anchor Sandra Smith in an interview Friday.

Hamel, who lives in Seattle, told Fox News his family reached out to the community this week for help finding a man who was with his daughter the night she fell. Within 24 hours, university police were able to talk to the person of interest. 

""I think it was incredibly successful. … I can't say enough for Santa Barbara. It was so fast. They really helped us so much to move the investigation forward,"" Hamel said. ""I'm not the police. I am on the outside, but it seems like they really moved it forward.""

""An individual who was identified in relation to the incident at our residence hall has been located and interviewed,"" UC Santa Barbara said in a statement. ""The investigation is still ongoing, and we cannot discuss any additional details at this time. UCPD is keeping the family informed and is working closely with (the) Santa Barbara District Attorney's Office.

""UCPD is committed to continue its comprehensive investigation to seek answers related to this tragic event and has been working closely with the district attorney's office and the sheriff's office since the early stages of the investigation.""

Hamel said he doesn't know the man who was with his daughter and neither did his daughter's friends. He is not a suspect in her death. 

Hamel said, as far as he knows, they met at a noodle bar that night, ""and they hit it off, and it was Valentine's Day. So, I think that might've had something to do with it. And, yeah, they were photographed together only from a certain angle. And then they left a little after 10:06 (p.m.). And then, to my knowledge, at 10:27 is when she was found unconscious, having fallen from that breezeway.""

""She was great,"" Hamel said of his daughter Liz. ""She was our world. She's our only child. And she was everything to us. She was a real joy. And, you know, we were so lucky to have 18 years with her. We wish we had more time.""  (Alain Hamel)

NEW YORK (AP) — New York City's police department provided federal immigration authorities with an internal record about a Palestinian woman who they arrested at a protest, which the Trump administration is now using as evidence in its bid to deport her, according to court documents obtained by The Associated Press.

The report — shared by the NYPD in March — includes a summary of information in the department's files about Leqaa Kordia, a New Jersey resident who was arrested at a protest outside Columbia University last spring. It lists her home address, date of birth and an officer's two-sentence account of the arrest.

LIST: THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT

Its distribution to federal authorities offers a glimpse into behind-the-scenes cooperation between the NYPD and the Trump administration, and raises questions about the city's compliance with sanctuary laws that prohibit police from assisting with immigration enforcement efforts.

Kordia, 32, was among the earliest people jailed in President Donald Trump's crackdown on noncitizens who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

She was detained during a voluntary check-in with immigration officials in Newark, New Jersey, on March 13, then flown to an immigration jail in Texas. Her arrest was announced by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security the next day in a statement that cited an expired visa and her role in “pro-Hamas protests.”

It remains unclear how immigration authorities were able to learn about Kordia's presence at the protest near Columbia last April. At the demonstration, police cited Kordia with disorderly conduct. But the charge was dismissed weeks later and the case sealed.

TRUMP 100-DAY REPORT CARD: RFK'S MAHA REVOLUTION GETS MIXED GRADE

City law generally prohibits police from sharing information about arrests with federal immigration officials, although there are exceptions for criminal investigations.

On March 14, an NYPD officer generated a four-page report on Kordia and shared it with Homeland Security Investigations, a division of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.

In an emailed statement, an NYPD spokesperson said the department “received a request from a federal agency related to a criminal investigation and shared relevant information in accordance with our sanctuary city policies.”

“The NYPD does not participate in programs that are designed for visa revocation or any civil immigration matter,” the statement added.

The department declined to say what the investigation entailed.

Inquiries to the DHS and ICE were not returned.

Legal experts and civil liberties advocates said the document reflected a worrisome level of information-sharing between the city and the federal government, which has conflated criticism of Israel with support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group.

100-DAY REPORT CARD: TRUMP TACKLES BORDER BUT HITS SETBACKS ON DEPORTING IMMIGRANTS

“The intention of the sanctuary laws is to protect against this kind of collusion and pretextual information sharing,” said Meghna Philip, the director of special litigation at the Legal Aid Society.

“It seems to be a clear violation of the law,” Philip added, “and raises questions about what guardrails, if any, the NYPD has around sharing information with a federal government that is seeking to criminalize speech.”

Kordia grew up in Jerusalem and the West Bank, and moved to New Jersey in 2016 with her mother, an American citizen. She studied English at a local exchange program, but let her student visa expire because she believed her application for permanent residency was sufficient to remain in the country legally, according to her attorneys.

Kordia's case stood out among those ensnared by Trump's crackdown. She was not an outspoken activist and had not publicly criticized Israel, either in social media posts or newspaper op-eds. She maintained no social media presence and did not appear on any of the public lists maintained by pro-Israel groups that seek to identify people who participate in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Her name was not mentioned in news reports about the demonstrations.

While the Trump administration identified her as a Columbia student, she has never been affiliated with the university and was not enrolled in any college when she joined a protest in 2024 outside Columbia. Her attorneys said she was peacefully voicing her dissent against Israel's military campaign in Gaza, which they said has killed over 100 of her relatives.

A spokesperson for the NYPD declined to say when they were first approached by federal authorities or whether the March 14 report was the first time they had shared information about Kordia's arrest record.

FOR HUNTER, THE BIDEN BUSINESS GOES BUST

Beginning in early March, attorneys for Kordia say federal agents began interrogating members of her family and her neighbors. They also subpoenaed records from her MoneyGram account and “established a trace on her WhatsApp messaging account,” her attorneys said in a court filing.

“The investigation revealed nothing except that Ms. Kordia sent a single payment to a Palestinian family member in 2022, which itself is protected First Amendment” rights, the filing states.

At an April 3rd hearing, the federal government pointed to Kordia's prior arrest for protesting as a reason she should not be released. An immigration judge found no evidence she had acted violently at the protest and agreed to grant Kordia a $20,000 bond, which her family paid.

The government has appealed that decision, keeping her detained for now.

In a petition seeking her release, attorneys for Kordia, a devout Muslim, said she had been denied halal meals since arriving at the jail. As a result, she has lost 49 pounds (22 kilograms) and fainted in the shower, according to facility records shared with her attorneys.

“The government's entire argument that Ms. Kordia is a danger to the United States rests on a single summons for her participation in a demonstration,” Arthur Ago, her attorney, said. “The only reason she's confined right now is because of her political viewpoint.”

New York City Mayor Eric Adams has criticized the city's sanctuary protections, but insisted his administration had been meticulous about following them.

When asked by the AP last month if the NYPD could turn over information to ICE about a summons issued to a protester, the mayor stressed it could only do so if there was a criminal investigation.

“We're not allowed to collaborate for civil enforcement, period,” Adams said.

JEWISH FACULTY DEFEND NORTHWESTERN DESPITE ANTISEMITISM INVESTIGATIONS

“We have no record that this happened,” Adams added at the time.

On Friday, the mayor's office clarified that Adams had been referring to a different instance of a noncitizen who was sought by immigration authorities after being arrested by the NYPD at a protest.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

How courts across the country have responded to the president's immigration agenda

Donald Trump is shaking up his Cabinet, while his immigration agenda faces mounting pushback from the courts. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined to discuss.

A Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas has called the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act “unlawful”—and was among other judges from across the country who have ruled against the president.

“The defining fact of the first three months of this second term of Trump is that so many of the institutions that so successfully opposed him in the first term have been absent or in retreat,” Michael Scherer, an Atlantic staff writer, said last night. “The one exception to that is the legal process.” Although judges “operate at a different tempo than politicians or executive orders,” he added, “you have seen in the last few weeks a really dramatic move by the judiciary to step in.”

Joining the guest moderator and White House correspondent at PBS News Hour, Laura Barrón-López, to discuss this and more: Leigh Ann Caldwell, the chief Washington correspondent at Puck; Michael Scherer, a staff writer at The Atlantic; Ali Vitali, the host of Way Too Early on MSNBC; Alexander Ward, a national-security reporter at The Wall Street Journal.

Warren Buffett hit out at President Donald Trump's global trade war on Saturday, saying trade should not be a ""weapon.""

Speaking at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett did not directly name Trump, but made clear his distaste for tariffs.

Buffett made the comments in response to the first question during his widely watched Q&A, the centerpiece event of the annual meeting.

""Trade should not be a weapon,"" he said.""

Buffett called the policies a ""big mistake,"" warning that protectionist policies could have negative repercussions for the US.

""I do think that the more prosperous the rest of the world becomes, it won't be at our expense, the more prosperous we'll become, and the safer we'll feel, and your children will feel someday,"" Buffett added.

""I don't think it's right, and I don't think it's wise,"" he said. ""The United States won. I mean, we have become an incredibly important country, starting from nothing 250 years ago. There's not been anything like it.""

The comments are his most direct yet on the global trade war sparked by Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs at the beginning of April.

Buffett's comments came after the company reported that its first quarter profits fell by around 14% compared to 2024 to $9.6 billion, while its cash stockpile rose to more than $347 billion. 

Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has surged despite volatile financial markets since Trump's election last year.

The conglomerate is up more than 20% since Trump won victory on November 5, in spite of the S&P 500 being down almost 2%

Trump's administration has imposed tariffs of 145% on China, which were countered with retaliatory Chinese levies of 125%.

Why America is returning to the days of double-duty gadgets

Keisha Sarpong needed a new work bag to ferry her documents and laptop to the office. But as she started looking, she realized she didn't want the bag to make her look too much ""like a lawyer with a briefcase"" when she went to happy hour, Sarpong, a 30-year-old nonprofit worker who also runs a TikTok fashion account, tells me. Oh, and it'd be nice if it had enough space for her to take it on a trip. Basically, she wanted a bag that could do it all.

The bag Sarpong eventually settled on features a stylish black leather finish, a laptop sleeve, and plenty of space for a water bottle and notebooks, plus an adjustable strap that can secure it on a rolling suitcase. It may not be perfect for everywhere, but it's pretty close.

Sarpong's search isn't an isolated instance of a picky shopper. She's part of a growing cohort of consumers demanding more from the products they spend their hard-earned money on. It's not just bags that you can work and play and travel with. It's air fryers that can cook almost anything. Makeup products that double as skincare items. Or even an unassuming ceiling lamp that, you see upon second glance, is also a smart projector and speaker. Faced with rising prices and increasingly busy lives, Americans are arming themselves with products that work like a Swiss Army knife.

""If I'm going to invest in a quality staple, I want to make sure I'm going to get a lot of use out of it. I'm really drawn to pieces that are multifunctional,"" Sarpong says. It's not just her bag that she's making work overtime — she also tells me she owns travel cubes that do triple duty as a purse organizer and cosmetics pouch. That's where she stores her all-in-one makeup products, which can be variously used on lips, cheeks, and eyelids.

Whether it's higher prices, hybrid work, or an ever-rising obsession with efficiency and optimization, there are a slew of reasons Americans are looking for stuff that can fill more than one role. And as tariffs threaten to raise prices even further, people are trying to find value wherever they can get it. For businesses, expanding their product offering to fill different parts of customers' lives can insulate them from fickle tastes and cushion their bottom lines in leaner times. As multifunctional goods become ever more popular, it's clear that we're living in a three-in-one economy.

American consumers are wrestling with a lot of uncertainty these days. Years of COVID-driven inflation have left people unsure of just how much things are supposed to cost. Economic upheaval has people worried about their jobs. And businesses are skimping on the quantity and sizes of their products (whether it's smaller portions at restaurants or fewer sheets of toilet paper per roll) — leaving Americans wondering whether they're really getting a bang for their buck. All these factors are pushing people to look for deals wherever they can: In a recent survey of consumers by the accounting and consulting firm EY, 77% of respondents said they were actively changing their buying habits to seek better value.

How do you make your dollar go further in this environment after you've already followed the classic budgeting advice? Hybrid products could be a tool in consumers' inflation-fighting toolbox. Inflation-weary consumers are increasingly turning to these products, especially for appliances and tech gadgets, says Steffen Schenk, the managing director of NielsenIQ's North America tech and durables sector. For example, he points to combination microwave-roaster-grill air fryers that save time and space in small kitchens and self-cleaning robotic vacuums with built-in mops. NielsenIQ has seen growing consumer demand for smart kitchen appliances and tech wearables.

""The reality is that convenience is now one of the key drivers of choice across most categories,"" Schenk says. ""And once again, having those multifunctional devices really helps with that.""

Kristen Jauregui, a 35-year-old payroll specialist who runs a lifestyle blog, has been putting a bigger emphasis on budgeting than she has in the past amid the chaos of tariffs and elevated inflation. Jauregui tells me that she's consuming much more mindfully, whether it's buying less, doing more price comparison before hitting ""check out,"" or looking for products that serve more than one occasion.

""If I can find something that is multifaceted or can be used in more than one aspect, I will absolutely buy that over a product I can only use once,"" Jauregui says.

Jauregui has been optimizing her closet for both work and play. Ever since the pandemic, she's swapped out high heels for more comfortable loafers and sneakers that can be worn straight from the office to a night out. Another hybrid product Jauregui has recently started using is solid shampoo, a bar that can be used as shampoo, conditioner, face wash, and body soap. These bars — which Jauregui purchases from the beauty brand Kitsch — have saved her money and time, as Jauregui no longer needs to buy travel-size containers of different toiletries when she goes on trips. According to consulting firm Capgemini, big companies like L'Oreal are hopping on the trend and launching their own solid shampoo products.

In addition to everyday essentials, consumers are turning to products with various uses to justify their desire to splurge. Hardcore austerity has never been America's strength — when sales spiked after the 2001 stock market crash, former Estée Lauder CEO Leonard Lauder called the need to partake in small luxuries during major downturns the ""lipstick effect.""

Nowadays, consumers stressed from constant budgeting might forgo expensive vacations but still decide to treat themselves to a little retail therapy, Schenk says. If consumer sentiment continues to decline and tariff-induced uncertainty drags down the US economy, Schenk expects the lipstick effect to kick in during the back half of this year.

""If you look at some of the trends we're seeing around self-indulgence, wellness, and so on, we would expect a similar lipstick effect in this cycle,"" Schenk tells me.

Sarpong has already been indulging in some lipstick effect shopping — literally. She's a big fan of the beauty brand Rhode's pocket blushes, which come in a small, unassuming cylinder, not unlike a glue stick. The pigment can be used as a blush, lip color, or moisturizer.

""It's in the name. It's a nice handheld size, so I can bring it with me everywhere,"" Sarpong tells me. ""I can touch it up on my cheek but also my lips. It's a nice two-for-one.""

Multifunctional products can help consumers use some ""girl math,"" as TikTok would say, to justify those nonessential splurges during economic hardship. After all, if the lipstick you purchased doubles as a moisturizer and blush, you're getting much more bang for your buck.

In addition to acute economic drivers, longer-term trends have also increased consumer appetite for products that do it all. One is the pandemic-driven downfall of the five-day in-office expectation. As the divide between where work ends and where the rest of our lives begin has become less clear, consumers seek products that can cross over from one side of the divide to the other. This cross-functionality appears to appeal especially to Gen Z and millennials. Saoirse Cleary, the creative strategy director at the marketing agency MG Empower, tells me that the younger generations' emphasis on work-life balance makes them more open to trying new products that offer unique wellness or lifestyle features, such as athleisure wear and multifunctional makeup products. These demographics are also much more likely to find these multifunctional products through social media channels rather than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.

Convenience seeking isn't just a Gen Z or millennial thing, though. ""Young people tend to be the early adopters,"" Cleary added. ""But if something is hybrid, it makes everyone's lives easier.""

Yet another driving factor for the three-in-one economy is Americans' desire to optimize every part of their life. Devices and goods that fulfill multiple needs can feed people's drive to be the best, healthiest, or most efficient. Schenk, from NielsenIQ, tells me smartwatches that track health metrics while keeping time have been especially popular. From 2019 to 2023, the number of new products in the wearables category jumped from 5,000 to 80,000 — an increase not seen in any other product category, NielsenIQ GfK Market Intelligence says.

Cleary also highlights the rising popularity of wearable technology such as Oura rings, which provide users with various biometric data.

""People started out with just wanting to track their steps with a wearable device or on their phone, and now it's about period tracking, sleep tracking, and heart rate tracking,"" Cleary says.

""You have to highlight the hybrid benefits of a product nowadays,"" Cleary adds. ""Everybody wants to self-optimize, so everything you buy has to be the best version of what you could get.""

Amid this consumer phenomenon, companies are increasingly leaning into the desire for multifunctional goods to add to their bottom lines, especially when those products can satisfy people's craving for a ""little treat."" Cleary tells me that appealing to people in various walks of life can expand the awareness of a brand outside its core constituency, which helps to lure in new customers who may not have run into the company's offerings otherwise.

""A bag that functions for work, the gym, and social outings can be embraced by minimalists, professionals, and fitness enthusiasts alike, creating crossover appeal that strengthens a brand's reach,"" she says.

Cleary adds that in her work helping global brands develop their influencer marketing strategies, she's seen companies launch multifunctional product campaigns.

Multiuse products can also deepen relationships with existing customers, especially during an economic downturn. When companies launch value-rich products that make people's lives easier, they build trust within their customer base. On the other hand, price increases and a decrease in perceived product value isolate cash-sensitive shoppers. With consumers like Sarpong and Jauregui putting more thought into their purchases, a multifunctional aspect helps brands make buyers feel like they're getting the best option.

Twice in the past few years, the fragility of our global economic system has been pushed to the forefront. When the pandemic hit, businesses shut down, and a toilet paper shortage had people rushing to store shelves. Now, as businesses grapple with tariff-driven uncertainty and DOGE drives federal worker layoffs, consumers are feeling déjà vu. For everyday people, there isn't much you can do to shield yourself from breakdowns in complex supply chains or policy decisions made in DC, but changing your consumption patterns is one actionable way to exert your economic agency.

""The way that we've used technology has changed. The way that we shop has changed. The way we interact with people has changed. So I try to make sure that anything I purchase is multifaceted,"" Jauregui tells me.

""I've changed how I purchase makeup and skincare products because I want to make sure they're versatile,"" Jauregui adds. ""If something happens tomorrow, and the world shuts down, will I be able to find a way to get this?""

Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting ended Saturday with big news: Warren Buffett said he planned to ask the board to make Greg Abel the company's CEO by year-end.

Abel, Berkshire's vice chairman of non-insurance operations, was at Buffett's side on stage when Buffett broke the news, and didn't know these remarks were coming, according to ""The Oracle of Omaha.""

The 94-year-old has had a six-decade run at the company, and its annual meetings draw thousands of shareholders from around the world to Omaha each year. The gathering, known as ""Woodstock for Capitalists,"" is a chance for Buffett to share his views on the markets, investing and life, in general.

This year, Buffett was asked about global trade policy and the tariffs that President Donald Trump has proposed as well as the market's recent volatility.

""Trade should not be a weapon,"" Buffett said. Read a full account of the day's events below.

Here are some of the highlights:

Arkansas Rep. French Hill expressed glee following Buffett's announcement about having Greg Abel become the new CEO, which came at the end of Saturday's shareholder meeting.

""[Buffett] always loved tap dancing to work. Well, now he's tap dancing out of work. What a day, what a happy day!"" he told CNBC'S Becky Quick and Michael Santoli. ""The board, and Greg and Warren have done a magnificent job over the last decade preparing shareholders for today.""

The Republican, who said he has been coming to the Berkshire meetings since the early 1990s, also expressed that the Oracle of Omaha has been ""a hero of mine since I was in college.""

""When I got out of government in 1993 and went back to the private sector in investment management, it was Warren Buffett who was my role model – a man I've never personally met, but I've admired all these years,"" Hill added.

Ron Olson, a Berkshire board member, expressed optimism around Greg Abel taking over as CEO.

""Greg is ready. I have no doubt about that. We've known if for a long time,"" said Olson, who is stepping down from his role because he's no longer eligible, to CNBC'S Becky Quick and Michael Santoli after the meeting.

He also lauded Buffett and his accomplishments. Buffett has ""lived a life full of surprises. Very few of his decisions have been anything but sensational. I am very anxious to see Warren become the Charlie Munger for Greg Abel.""

— Fred Imbert

Even as he signals the end of an era, Buffett's humor remains intact.

Buffett announced he will ask Berkshire's board to make Abel CEO of the conglomerate by year-end, leading to a standing ovation from the crowd and Abel. Soon after, Buffett joked: ""The enthusiasm shown by that response can be interpreted two ways.""

— Fred Imbert

The decision to approve Abel moving into the Berkshire CEO post will take place over the next two board meetings, Buffett said.

Buffett will make the recommendation to the Berkshire board of directors at Sunday's meeting. Other than his two children, the other board members — including Abel — had not been informed of this decision before Saturday's meeting, Buffett said.

From there, the board can ask questions about how the transition process will go before making a formal decision.

""At the meeting following that, which will come in a few months, we'll take action on whatever the view is of the 11 directors,"" he said. ""I think they'll be unanimously in favor of it. And that would mean that at year end Greg would be the chief executive officer of Berkshire. I would still hang around and conceivably be useful in a few cases, but the final word would be what Greg said in operations, in capital deployment, whatever it might be.""

— Jesse Pound

Buffett closed the meeting by declaring he had no intention of parting with any of shares in the company.

""I have no intention, zero, of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. It will get given away gradually,"" he said, to resounding applause and cheers.

Buffett continued: ""I would add this: The decision to keep every share is an economic decision, because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg's management than mine.""

He said that this was also a decision that would help indicate his confidence in Abel's leadership.

""But I will come in, and there may come a time when we get a chance to invest a lot of money. When that time comes, I think it may be helpful with the board — the fact that they know I've got all my money in the company, and I think it's smart, and I've seen what Greg has done,"" Buffett concluded.

— Lisa Kailai Han

After getting a warning that five minutes remained in Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett dropped some big news: He said he would ask the board on Sunday to make Greg Abel the company's chief executive at the end of the year.

The 94-year-old Buffett had discussed succession planning at many prior Berkshire meetings but the announcement signaled the end of an era was arriving. 

His comments were met with a long standing ovation.

When asked about cost-cutting and so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Buffett said that controlling the government budget deficit is a problem that is ""never fully solved.""

""We are operating at a fiscal deficit now that is unsustainable over a very long period of time. We don't know whether that means two years or 20 years, because there's never been a country like the United States, but this is something that can't go on forever,"" Buffett said.

While Buffett did not discuss DOGE specifically, he did say it would be a difficult but important job to cut the budget deficit.

""It's a job I don't want, but it's a job I think should be done, and Congress does not seem to be doing it,"" Buffett said.

— Jesse Pound

Buffett called the U.S. a shining example of capitalism, making the analogy of a cathedral attached to a casino.

""Capitalism in the United States has succeeded like nothing you've ever seen. It's a combination of this magnificent cathedral, which has produced an economy like nothing the world's ever seen, and then it's got this massive casino attached,"" he said. ""In the cathedrals, they basically are designing things that will be producing goods and services for 300-and-some million people like it's never been done before in history.""

Although the temptation to focus all of one's time and energy at this metaphorical casino is quite high, Buffett cautioned that keeping the balance was of utmost importance.

""At the casino, everybody's having a good time and there's lots of money changing hands and everything, but you've got to make sure the cathedral gets fed, too,"" he said. ""It's very important that the United States in the next 100 years makes sure that the cathedral is not overtaken by the casino.""

Buffett continued: ""It's an interesting system we developed, but it's worked. It dispenses rewards in what seems like a terribly capricious manner.""

— Lisa Kailai Han

Abel, who serves as the chair of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, said that wildfire risk is ""not going away"" in the United States.

Berkshire's approach to managing those risks include maintenance of the infrastructure and powering down when bad weather or a spreading fire approaches, Abel said.

""We have clearly recognized as a team that we have to de-energize those assets,"" Abel said.

He also said that Berkshire can't serve as an ""insurer of last resort"" in wildfire disasters.

Berkshire's portfolio includes insurance and utility holdings. That means wildfire damage can cause losses for the insurance business and, if a fire happens in a region where Berkshire's utility operates, create legal liability concerns.

Buffett seemed to express concern about the future of the utility business.

""Every part of the country is going to need electricity and there are going to be places where privately held electric utilities would be foolish to operate. ... How that will be resolved in our democracy, we will find out,"" Buffett said about the liability concerns.

""We are not in the business of trying to solve unsolvable problems,"" he added.

The company's first-quarter report reflected a $1.1 billion loss related to Southern California wildfires.

— Jesse Pound

Berkshire's special book celebrating six decades under Buffett has sold out, the CEO announced.

Buffett said during the second half of his question-and-answer session that he received a note saying all copies of the 60th anniversary book have been purchased. It's the only item for sale at Bookworm, the on-site bookstore.

Buffett said at the start of Saturday's gathering that about 4,400 copies sold the day prior. Berkshire printed around 8,000 in total, 3,000 more than originally planned.

Berkshire is auctioning off some signed copies for charity.

— Alex Harring

Buffett reassured his shareholders that Berkshire wouldn't put their money to use for things that the company thought was ""stupid.""

If they did, the shareholders ""ought to get rid of us,"" he added.

""It's easier to do stupid things with other people's money than it is with your own money. That's one of the problems government has generally. We don't want to bring it to private enterprise,"" Buffett quipped.

— Lisa Kailai Han

When asked about his views on capital allocation, particularly into new businesses, Abel said that Berkshire had a strong set of values to follow, including maintaining its current reputation.

""We have values that we as a management team — as defined by Warren and Charlie and everybody associated with the business — they had great values that really set Berkshire up well for the future,"" he responded. ""There are a couple that are absolutely critical.""

The first of these, said Abel, was keeping up the legacy that has already been established.

""One, we'll maintain the reputation of Berkshire and that of our company, and I view that in investing or how we operate things across each of our businesses. That will always be a priority, and something that we'll ensure is in the forefront of our minds,"" he said.

Other important values he would stick by include keeping Berkshire's balance sheet strong. Abel said that the company's current ""significant set of cash"" was an ""enormous"" and ""strategic asset"" that he could deploy in the future, one that allows Berkshire to not depend on any banks or other entities for its success.

Properly understanding and managing risk is also important, he said, alongside owning a ""great set of operating companies that do produce significant cash flows."" 

""It's really the investment philosophy and how Warren and the team have allocated capital for the past 60 years,"" he added. ""Really, it will not change. And it's the approach we'll take as we go forward.""

— Lisa Kailai Han

Buffett said Berkshire halted its buyback program this year partly because of the 1% excise tax on stock repurchases, which was introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. 

""It does make it slightly less attractive than it was before,"" he said, referring to the 1% tax. 

Berkshire shares also have significantly outperformed the S&P 500, rising nearly 19% this year. Class A shares climbed 1.8% Friday to a new all-time high of $809,350.

— Yun Li

Buffett explained why he thinks that the balance sheet is a good starting point when deciding whether to invest in a company.

""I spend more time looking at balance sheets than I do income statements. And Wall Street really doesn't pay much attention to balance sheets, but I like to look at the balance sheets over an eight- or 10-year period before I even look at the income account because there's certain things that are harder to hide or play games with on the balance sheet,"" Buffett said.

""Neither one gives you the total answer,"" he added.

— Jesse Pound

Buffett returns to the stage after a brief lunch break, and quickly begins the afternoon question-and-answer session. 

Before tackling the first question, he made a quick movie recommendation: ""Becoming Katherine Graham."" The documentary about the Washington Post publisher quotes Buffett in its trailer. 

—Christina Cheddar Berk 

Despite unique travel challenges for foreign shareholders this year, it was a full house at CHI Health Center in Omaha on Saturday morning as Buffett spoke.

Multiple international investors told CNBC they were staying home this year given concerns about traveling to the U.S. in the current political climate. These decisions come after President Donald Trump's plan for contentious tariffs has quickly raised fears of a global trade war.

Buffett said during Saturday's gathering that Berkshire's shareholder event held a day prior saw record high attendance of nearly 20,000.

— Alex Harring

The Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting has taken a break for lunch. 

Buffett is expected to return to the stage for another round of shareholder questions at about 12 p.m. ET. 

—Christina Cheddar Berk 

""What has happened in the last 30, 45 days … is really nothing,"" said Buffett, noting Berkshire Hathaway's stock was cut in half three times during his 60 years running the company. 

Given that, he said the U.S. stock market's recent action should not be considered a ""huge"" move.

""This has not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort,"" Buffett said.

The S&P 500 nearly closed in a 20% bear market at its low in April before President Donald Trump paused his most punitive tariffs on countries, causing a rebound that's brought the benchmark back more than halfway. At last check the S&P 500 was down about 8% from its record high.

—Alex Harring, John Melloy

When giving advice to a young investor, Buffett said that finding a way to be fulfilled and happy helps people have long lives. 

""I think a happy person lives longer than somebody that's doing some things they don't really admire much in life,"" Buffett said.

— Jesse Pound

Jain said that Berkshire Hathaway had not been immune to disruptions from direct competition in the form of private equity firms in recent years.

""There's no question the private equity firms have come into the space, and we are no longer competitive in this space. We used to do a fair amount in this space, but in the last three, four years, I don't think we've done a single deal,"" he said.

That being said, Jain added that the private equity strategy of using higher leverage and more aggressive investment strategies works while the ""economy is doing great and credit spreads are low.""

""However, there is always the danger that at some point the regulators might get cranky and say, 'You're taking too much risk on behalf of your policyholders,' and that could end in tears,"" Jain added. ""We do not like the risk-reward that these situations offer, and therefore we put up the white flag and said we can't compete in this segment right now.""

Buffett added that Berkshire was unique from its competitors because he takes a more personal stake in his investments.

""They probably have a somewhat different fiduciary feeling about what they're doing, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't work and if it doesn't work, they go on to other things,"" Buffett said. ""If what we do here at Berkshire doesn't work, I spend the end of my life regretting what I've created so it's just a whole different personal equation. There's no property casualty company that can basically replicate Berkshire.""

— Lisa Kailai Han

When asked about currency considerations and potential hedges for Berkshire, Buffett said he was concerned about the tendency of governments to make decisions that lead to weaker currencies.

""Fiscal policy is what scares me in the United States, because it's made the way it is and all the motivations are to doing a lot of things that can cause trouble with money. But that's not limited to the United States, it's all over the world,"" Buffett said.

""The value of currency is a scary thing, and we don't have any great system for beating that,"" he added.

The comments echoed what the annual report said on the topic.

""Paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country's short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency,"" Buffett wrote in that report.

— Jesse Pound

Jain, Berkshire's chairman of insurance operations, lauded Geico CEO Todd Combs' efforts to improve the insurance giant's operations — which include steep job cuts.

Jain said that Combs has cut Geico's workforce to about 20,000 from around 50,000 when he took over. He also credited Combs with Geico's incorporation of telematics, which for years was an area Geico lagged in.

In the past five or six years, ""we have made rapid strides, and telematics, which used to be a source of competitive disadvantage to us, is no longer so,"" said Jain. ""I would argue that, at Geico, our telematics are as good as anyone else's today. That's been one huge catch-up.""

Jain added that the labor force reductions amount to roughly $2 billion a year in saved costs.

— Fred Imbert

Buffett offered some of his wisdom for life beyond the investing world that he's become known for over the decades.

When answering a question about the plan for successor Greg Abel, Buffett gave advice about choosing a job and launching a career.

""You really want to work at something you enjoy,"" Buffett said during Saturday's gathering.

Buffett cautioned that employees can take on the habits of their colleagues, so it's important to be discerning about where one works. He recommended that while people should be ""careful"" about who they are employed by, it's less important to fret about factors like starting salaries.

""If you find people who are wonderful to work with, that's the place to go,"" he said.

— Alex Harring

Buffett is still all in on the U.S. despite growing concern among investors about the direction of the country's economy and its standing on the world stage.

""I mentioned that we started out as an agricultural society. We started out as a society with high promises, and we didn't deliver on them very well,"" he said. ""We're always in the process of change. We'll always find all kinds of things to criticize in the country, but the luckiest day in my life is the day I was born [because] I was born in the United States.""

""We've gone through great recessions, we've gone through world wars, we've gone through the development of an atomic bomb that we never dreamt of at the time I was born, so I would not get discouraged about the fact that it doesn't look like we've solved every problem that's come along,"" he continued. ""If I were being born today, I would just keep negotiating in the womb until they said you can be in the United States.""

""We're all pretty lucky,"" he stressed. This is despite his criticisms of the current trade policy earlier in the session. 

— Sean Conlon

Buffett revealed that Berkshire almost put $10 billion at work recently, but ultimately didn't pull the trigger.

""We came pretty close to spending $10 billion, not that long ago, for example, but we'd spend $100 billion,"" he said. ""I mean, those decisions are not tough to make when something is offered that makes sense to us and that we understand and offers good value.""

However, Buffett noted that the one problem with the investment business is that things don't come along in an orderly fashion.

— Yun Li

When asked about artificial intelligence's ability to transform the insurance industry, Ajit Jain admitted that the technology could be a ""real game changer"" in the way the business currently assesses, prices, and sells risk; and how it currently pays claims.

But Jain said that Berkshire is taking a more hesitant approach when it comes to any lofty new technological claims.

""I certainly also feel that people end up spending enormous amounts of money trying to chase the next new fashionable thing,"" he said. ""We are not very good in terms of being the fastest or the first mover. Our approach is more to wait and see until the opportunity crystallizes, and we have a better point of view in terms of risk of failure, upside, downside.""

However, Jain added that Berkshire wouldn't hesitate to invest once the right opportunity does arise.

""Right now, the individual insurance operations do dabble in AI and try and figure out what is the best way to exploit it, but we have not yet made a conscious big-time effort in terms of pouring a lot of money into this opportunity,"" he added. ""My guess is we will be in a state of readiness and should that opportunity pop up, we'll be in a state where we'll jump in promptly.

— Lisa Kailai Han

When discussing Berkshire's cash pile, Buffett joked about the theory that he is planning to hold on to that until the leadership transition occurs, which would let his successor Greg Abel make a big move.

""I wouldn't do anything nearly so noble as to withhold investing myself just so that Greg could look good later on,"" Buffett quipped, drawing laughs from Abel and others in attendance.

— Jesse Pound

Buffett said Berkshire will find places to put its record levels of cash to work, likely within the next half decade.

""It's very unlikely to happen tomorrow,"" Buffett said in response to a question about the reasoning for Berkshire's cash hoard. ""It's not unlikely to happen in five years.""

Buffett also said that ""the one problem with the investment business is that things don't come along in an orderly fashion.""

The Oracle of Omaha added that ""probabilities"" of finding a good buy ""get higher as you go along"" and that it's ""kind of like death."" He then cracked a lighthearted joke about longtime business partner and friend Charlie Munger, who died in 2023 at the age of 99.

— Alex Harring

In response to a question about whether Buffett will stop investing in Japan stocks if the Bank of Japan were to raise interest rates in the future, the Oracle of Omaha said he won't be selling shares.

""In the next 50 years ... we won't give a thought to selling those,"" Buffett said, adding that Japan's record has been ""extraordinary"" and pointing out that Apple, American Express and Coca-Cola, for example, have been doing well in the country.

He also said he's been treated ""extremely well"" by the five Japanese companies he has invested in – namely, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Itochu and Marubeni – and said that building a relationship with the companies is ""super long term.""

""They have different customs. They have different approaches to business – that's true around the world – and we don't have any intention in any way of trying to change what they do because they do it very successfully,"" Buffett said.

""We will not be selling any stock. That will not happen in decades, if then,"" he continued. ""The Japan investment has just been right up our alley.""

— Sean Conlon

Buffett criticized the idea of tariffs and trade protectionism, saying that ""trade should not be a weapon.""

""In the United States, we should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best, and they should do what they do best,"" Buffett said.

President Donald Trump was not directly referenced during this discussion.

— Jesse Pound

Buffett initially took a lighthearted tone as he thanked Apple CEO Tim Cook.

He said that following Apple's latest earnings release, he tuned into Cook's call on Thursday afternoon, the ""only investment quarterly call"" that he listened to.

""I'm somewhat embarrassed to say that Tim Cook has made Berkshire a lot more money than I've ever made Berkshire Hathaway,"" Buffett joked. ""Credit should be given to him.""

The investor then took on a more serious tone as he noted that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs ""really made the right decision"" when picking out Cook as his successor.

""I knew Steve Jobs briefly,"" Buffett said. ""Steve died young, as you know, and nobody but Steve could have created Apple, but nobody but Tim could have developed it like it has. So on behalf of all of Berkshire, thank you.""

— Lisa Kailai Han

Berkshire sold thousands of its special anniversary book during Friday's shopping event, according to Buffett.

Buffett said around 4,400 copies of the book focused on the 60th anniversary of Berkshire under his leadership were snapped up by shoppers during the day. The company printed around 8,000, about 3,000 more than initially planned.

It's the only book for sale at Bookworm, the on-location book store, this year.

— Alex Harring

Buffett shared some statistics from Friday's Berkshire convention.

— Jesse Pound

Audience members cheered as Buffett began speaking. He said the meeting, which is his 60th, should be his biggest and best yet.

""In every aspect, we set records,"" Buffett said of this year's event, citing sales from holding companies at the bonanza and runners signed up for Sunday's 5-K.

— Alex Harring

Berkshire Hathaway has sold more stock than it's bought for 10 straight quarters, according to its earnings report released Saturday morning.

The conglomerate dumped more than $134 billion worth of stock in 2024, mainly due to reductions in Berkshire's two largest equity holdings — Apple and Bank of America. As a result of the selling spree, Berkshire's enormous pile of cash grew to yet another record, at $347 billion.

— Yun Li

Investor David Samra said that tariffs are the ""topic of the moment"" ahead of the start of Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting.

""I think that it will be interesting to hear, of course, Warren's thoughts around tariffs — that is the topic of the moment,"" Samra, a portfolio manager at Artisan Partners, told CNBC's Becky Quick and Mike Santoli.

He added that he was also excited to hear from Ajit Jain, Berkshire's vice chairman of insurance operations.

""It's fantastic to have Ajit [Jain] up on the stage to be able to address those issues. There are some wildfire issues that have been impacting the energy business,"" he added. ""So it will be interesting to see if they have any commentary around that.""

— Lisa Kailai Han

Berkshire Hathaway posted some disappointing results before its annual meeting was set to begin:

—John Melloy, Fred Imbert

Berkshire said President Donald Trump's tariffs and other geopolitical risks created an uncertain environment for the conglomerate, with its vast array of insurance, transportation, energy, retail and other businesses. The firm said it's not able to predict any potential impact from tariffs at this time.

""Our periodic operating results may be affected in future periods by impacts of ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical events, as well as changes in industry or company-specific factors or events,"" Berkshire said in the earnings report. ""The pace of changes in these events, including international trade policies and tariffs, has accelerated in 2025. Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events.""

""We are currently unable to reliably predict the potential impact on our businesses, whether through changes in product costs, supply chain costs and efficiency, and customer demand for our products and services,"" it said.

— Yun Li

This year's shopping event in Omaha is more interactive than ever.

Featuring a gigantic claw machine, a signed book auction and private jet tours, shareholders are able to see displays and buy merchandise from the different holding companies under Berkshire. Some of the longest lines were for specialty Squishmallow toys that resemble Buffett and Charlie Munger.

Click here to go inside the ""Berkshire Bazaar of Bargains"" held Friday and Saturday with CNBC reporters on the ground.

Berkshire Hathaway is kicking off its annual meeting on a high note with shares hitting a record high Friday.

Class A shares climbed 1.8% Friday to a new all-time high of $809,350. The stock has rallied more than nearly 19% this year, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.

Some investors seeking relatively safe places to hide find Berkshire appealing because of the defensive nature of its huge insurance empire and the conglomerate's unmatched balance sheet — boasting more than $347 billion in cash at the end of March.

— Yun Li

Ahead of Buffett's address, shareholders are wondering what he'll have to say about President Donald Trump's tariff plans.

Trump's levies have been top of mind for investors as the market has whipsawed over the past month. Buffett in March called tariffs ""an act of war, to some degree.""

""Over time, they are a tax on goods. I mean, the tooth fairy doesn't pay 'em!"" Buffett said in an interview with CBS News. ""And then what? You always have to ask that question in economics. You always say, 'And then what?'""

All things considered, tariffs should be a ""net negative,"" according to Adam Meade, author of ""The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway."" That's because they can hamper businesses within the conglomerate, the Mead Capital Management CEO said during a Friday panel held by Gabelli Funds.

Meade said Berkshire's furniture retailers, for example, should see costs rise due to the taxes. Geico's car insurance business can also take a hit, he said, because auto parts coming into the country will cost more on plans that haven't yet seen annual price adjustments.

Elsewhere, he said BNSF Railway can see container volumes decline if consumers pull back on purchases once the duties fully take effect.

But there's another side to this: Tariff-induced chaos can create a backdrop that's beneficial for Buffett to make a new investment at a discount, according to Christopher Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. Buffett has a record amount of cash on the sidelines, coming in at more than $330 billion at the end of last year.

""Tariffs, trade wars, recessions, depressions, financial panics, pandemics, these are net good for Berkshire,"" Bloomstran said during the Gabelli event. ""You want a little bit of excitement.""

— Alex Harring

Shareholders began lining up in the early morning hours for a shot at the best seats in Omaha's CHI Health Center.

Attendees near the front told CNBC they gathered as early as 1 a.m. local time.

As has become an unofficial tradition, participants could be seen sprinting to the frontmost seats on the arena floor around 7 a.m. CT. Buffett is set to take the stage around 8 a.m. CT.

— Alex Harring

While many attendees can be seen sporting business or casual attire, some die-hard fans for Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett wear their heart on their sleeve — literally.

Nora Ridenour landed on a shirt featuring the Oracle of Omaha's face in a variety of colors that was inspired by artist Andy Warhol. Ridenour, who came with her husband from Iowa, bought this shirt during her first trip to the meeting in 2019.

""I have a super useful art degree, so this one spoke to me,"" Ridenour said.

Her husband Jay, who wore a shirt from last year's 5-K run with an illustration of Buffett, said he enjoys coming because of the positive energy among attendees. The family has owned the stock for more than a decade.

""Everybody here is excited,"" he said. ""This is one of the only events that I go to where everybody is just genuinely happy to be here.""

Polliana Elena Varnier matched other business students in town. The Brazil native's cohort had black hoodies with a black-and-white picture of Buffett sticking his tongue out.

""We love the way he thinks and the way he lives,"" she said. ""He's not just an investor, he's almost a philosophy.""

At a networking event near CHI Health Center, Tina Yin was seen in a shirt screenprinted with a picture of her and Buffett. While she met Buffett in 2017, the Hong Kong-based investor said some people inquired about the photo's authenticity.

""They think it's not a real photo, maybe it's Photoshop,"" Yin said, referring to the Adobe application for picture editing.

Warren Buffett has been mum about tariffs and the recent market turmoil, but will finally get a chance to speak his mind when the 94-year-old investment legend kicks off Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting.

This year's annual meeting comes as markets have turned uncertain after President Donald Trump's aggressive rollout of the highest tariffs on imports in generations. (Many were suspended for 90 days afterward.) Wall Street economists left and right are sounding the alarms that a recession may be in the offing, as recent data pointed to signs of economic weakening.

The world is eager to hear if Buffett, the most famous advocate of value investing, used the April market meltdown to hunt for bargains and lay the groundwork for deals. Although Buffett doesn't make predictions of short-term market direction, investors will listen closely for any signals of his continued confidence in the U.S. economy — despite the tariff shock.

OMAHA, Nebraska — Warren Buffett on Saturday brushed off recent stock market volatility that has rattled investors over the past several weeks.

""What has happened in the last 30, 45 days … is really nothing,"" the Berkshire Hathaway CEO said during the conglomerate's annual meeting. 

Buffett pointed out that there were three occasions over the last six decades where Berkshire Hathaway stock declined 50%. He noted that there was no fundamental issue with the company during these periods.

""I don't get fearful by things that other people ... are afraid of in a financial way,"" he said. ""Let's say Berkshire went down 50% next week, I would regard that as a fantastic opportunity, and it wouldn't bother me in the least.""

Given that, he said the U.S. stock market's recent action should not be characterized as a ""huge"" move.

""This has not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort,"" Buffett said.

These comments from the ""Oracle of Omaha"" as investors wonder what's next for markets after the wild trading seen amid concerns over President Donald Trump's contentious tariff policy announced in early April.

The S&P 500 on Friday notched its longest winning streak since 2004 as Wall Street claws back losses seen in the initial sell-off following Trump's initial policy unveiling. It marks a stunning rebound for U.S. stocks after the benchmark index at one point entered a bear market on an intraday basis last month, a term used to describe a fall of more than 20% from its recent high, before regaining ground.

Buffett said other periods have been ""dramatically different"" than the current one facing investors. He reminded investors that the market has climbed over the 94-year-old's lifetime, while cautioning that they need to be ready for bouts of troublesome action.

He shared that the Dow Jones Industrial Average sat at 240 on his birthday of Aug. 30, 1930, and fell as low as 41. Despite ""hair-curler"" events he's lived through, the blue-chip average finished Friday above 41,300.

""If it makes a difference to you whether your stocks are down 15% or not, you need to get a somewhat different investment philosophy,"" Buffett said. ""The world is not going to adapt to you. You're going to have to adapt to the world.""

""People have emotions,"" he added. ""But you got to check them at the door when you invest.""

The May issue of IEEE Spectrum is here!

The cryptocurrency demands more electricity than Los Angeles

Liam Critchley is a freelance contributor for IEEE Spectrum.

Harvard researchers flagged several places in the U.S. where pollution levels have risen as a result of increased energy production due to Bitcoin mining.

Bitcoin mining takes a lot of computation, and therefore, a lot of electricity. After the initial Bitcoin boom in China, the lure of cheaper electricity and a more stable power grid has lured many of the world's Bitcoin mines to the United States. With that shift comes a corresponding shift in the greenhouse gases and other pollutants created by the energy production required for Bitcoin mining.

Now, researchers from Harvard University have shown that Bitcoin mining has added more energy production to the U.S. grid than the amount required by the city of Los Angeles, and brought the accompanying air pollution and environmental concerns as well. They published their work in March in Nature Communications.

Bitcoin mines are specialized data centers designed to solve complex cryptographic algorithms. Bitcoin, like any cryptocurrency, runs on a blockchain—a decentralized ledger of transactions. “Mining” Bitcoins is the process of adding an extra “block” at the end of the chain. Adding this extra block is done by solving a cryptographic sequence—which takes a lot of energy due to the amount of computation required.

To understand just how much energy was being used by Bitcoin mines in the U.S., the Harvard researchers analyzed a database of the 34 largest Bitcoin mines in the country—which combined are responsible for 80 percent of U.S. Bitcoin mining capacity. The database contained both the mines' locations and how much energy was required to operate them. “With that information, we were able to estimate the power plants that were generating more electricity for the Bitcoin mines, find out how much air pollution those plants create, and find out where that pollution goes,” says Scott Delaney, a researcher at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health.



The study was conducted between August 2022 and July 2023. The researchers found that 32.3 terawatt-hours of electricity were consumed by the 34 Bitcoin mines—for comparison, 33 percent more electricity usage than the entire city of Los Angeles. 84 percent of that power was generated by plants burning fossil fuels. In other words, Bitcoin mining has essentially added a large city's worth of electricity consumption—and the accompanying pollution.

One of the key findings was that the power plants supplying the Bitcoin mines were often located hundreds of kilometers away. That means that the worst environmental impacts of large-scale Bitcoin mining aren't occurring near the mines themselves. “The air pollution created by Bitcoin mining is not being breathed by the people near the mine,” says Delaney. “The pollution effects are often felt several states away.”

The researchers discovered four key hotspot pockets of air pollution: within New York City and Houston, on the border between Illinois and Kentucky, and northeast Texas, where the concentrations of pollution that can be attributed to Bitcoin are sufficient enough to impact the health of the local population. That means those places could experience increased rates of asthma and other respiratory diseases, cardiac events, hospitalization, and premature mortality.

The researchers found that about 1.9 million people were exposed to more than 0.1 micrograms per cubic meter of additional fine particulate matter pollution from Bitcoin mines. Fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5 because it is 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter, poses significant risks to human health. That said, Delaney says that the overall concentrations they can attribute to Bitcoin mining are probably not high enough to trigger any health concerns over short-term exposure.

That's not the case for long-term exposure. After one year of exposure, the researchers expect that people living in the regions with heightened pollution will have measurable health effects―increased mortality or hospitalization rates―due to Bitcoin mining.

There are potentially cleaner options for the future of Bitcoin mining. AI data centers, for example, are turning to nuclear energy. The same strategy could be used to power Bitcoin mines.

However, the cryptocurrency industry has long been contentious, and it remains a largely unregulated industry with no restrictions on environmental impacts. “We need to think about the social value of Bitcoin,” says Delaney. “Not all data centers have the same social value, and we might be less willing to tolerate air pollution from some types of data centers in the future. The social value of Bitcoin is currently up for debate, whereas cloud data centers has already showed their worth.”



Bitcoin mining is only likely to increase in the future as the mining operations have already doubled since this study began in August 2022―especially as it takes more energy and computation to mine Bitcoins as fewer become available in the blockchain. (There's an upper limit of 21 million Bitcoins that can ever be mined.)

Delaney says that they plan to do a similar kind of study for all types of data centers, including ones dedicated to AI, cloud computing, and data storage. They also want to quantify the specific health impacts of Bitcoin attributable air pollution in the U.S., and hope to create a web-based tool that will help policy makers, data center owners, data center builders, and Bitcoin mining operators to optimize the siting of Bitcoin mines in areas where they will have the least environmental impact.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is urging a rethink of the network's increasingly complex architecture.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is urging a rethink of the network's increasingly complex architecture. In a recent blog post, he argued that Ethereum should move toward a more minimal base protocol over the next five years similar to Bitcoin's simplicity-first ethos.

Vitalik critiques Ethereum's sophisticated features that, in hindsight, offer limited practical value. He points to recent advancements like proof-of-stake and zk-SNARKs as useful but contributors to a bloated system. 





Buterin proposed a “3-slot finality” model, which would simplify consensus by removing components like sync committees and epoch structures. He also called for standardization across the protocol to reduce toolchain complexity and increase accessibility.

This call for simplification comes soon after Ethereum Foundation's recent structural overhaul. On April 28, the foundation appointed Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak as co-executive directors, separating operational leadership from long-term vision strategy.

Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $1,828, with no loss or gain in the past day. Popular crypto analyst Cas Abbe highlighted that ETH's monthly RSI has just retested a rare, multi-cycle support level.

Historically, this has resulted in explosive moves each prior retest led to a 340%+ surge. “If history repeats, ETH could breach $8,000 by Q4 2025,” Abbe explained on X.

On the daily ETH price chart, the RSI is currently hovering in neutral territory, suggesting the token is neither overbought nor oversold. If the indicator moves further upwards, it may indicate bullish momentum is building. 

Bollinger Bands are tightening with price approaching the upper band, indicating potential for an upcoming breakout. A daily close above the upper band near $1,900 could trigger a short-term rally. Traders could expect resistance at $1,950 and $2,100.

However, if ETH fails to hold the middle band (20-day SMA), a drop below the lower band around $1,720 could happen.

As ETH trades 62% below its all-time high of $4,891, analysts on X are suggesting investors to buy the dip amid bullish predictions. CryptoGoos described ETH as “historically undervalued,” with on-chain metrics pointing to long-term accumulation.

As global economic reforms, including pro-crypto policies and institutional adoption, ignite investor confidence, the cryptocurrency market is offering opportunities to smart investors. 

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate, commanding over 61% of the market's $3.05 trillion capitalisation as of April 2025, according to CoinGecko. However, some altcoins — cryptocurrencies other than BTC — are stealing the spotlight with their innovative use cases and potential for explosive growth.

Economic reforms, such as the US approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 and easing regulatory hurdles for blockchain projects, have created a fertile ground for altcoins. One of the best altcoins to buy now is Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), which merges AI and meme culture for long-term potential.

Altcoins offer diverse applications, from DeFi to scalable blockchains, making them attractive for investors seeking high returns. 

According to DeFiLlama, DeFi protocols have already secured over $100 billion in total value locked (TVL) at the time of writing, with Ethereum and Solana leading the charge. 

The market's optimism stems from:

These factors create a market ripe for altcoins with strong fundamentals, positioning 2025 as a pivotal year for crypto growth. When selecting the best altcoins to buy, investors should prioritise utility, adoption, and community strength. 

Below are our top picks for 2025:

Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), built on Ethereum, combines artificial intelligence with memecoin appeal, offering a unique value proposition. Unlike other memecoins, $DAGZ leverages AI to analyse market trends, aiming to optimise returns for holders. Its clear roadmap and smart contracts audited by SolidProof put the community first, allocating 15% of its 8.88 billion token supply to supporters and 20% to staking incentives, encouraging long-term engagement. 

With over $3.38 million raised in its presale at press time per its official site, $DAGZ is capitalising on the growing demand for AI-driven crypto projects.

Ethereum is also one of the best altcoins to buy now, securing over $100 billion in DeFi TVL, per DeFiLlama. Its transition to proof-of-stake slashed energy consumption by over 95%, making it more eco-friendly and scalable. 

The Pectra upgrade will enhance wallet usability and staking efficiency, potentially driving ETH's price from $1,800 at the time of writing to new highs. Vitalik Buterin noted that Ethereum's focus on layer-2 solutions could process 100,000 transactions per second, cementing its long-term dominance.

Solana's ability to handle 4,000 transactions per second at sub-cent costs has made it a favourite for developers and investors. Solana's market cap is currently over $77 billion. Its ecosystem, bolstered by memecoin launches, thrives on user activity and its role in tokenised real-world assets (RWAs).

Chainlink's decentralised oracle network connects smart contracts to real-world data, securing over $9.8 billion in value, per CoinMarketCap. Trading at $14.97 at press time, LINK's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enhances its utility across blockchains. 

A McKinsey report estimates the RWA tokenisation market, where Chainlink excels, could hit $2 trillion by 2030.

The crypto market is evolving, with altcoins outperforming BTC in percentage gains. 

Key trends include:

Although altcoins can carry higher volatility than BTC, with some dropping 90% in bear markets, top picks like $DAGZ, Ethereum, and Solana offer balanced risk-reward profiles due to their utility and adoption.

As economic reforms continue to boost investor confidence, 2025 is shaping up to be a breakout year for altcoins. From Ethereum's DeFi dominance to Solana's scalability and Chainlink's oracle prowess, the best altcoins to buy now combine innovation with market traction. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) stands out by merging AI with memecoin appeal, offering a new twist on crypto's future.

Dawgz AI's clear roadmap and community focus position it for long-term growth, making it a project worth exploring.

Big moves don't always require peak hype, sometimes, they just take precision and timing. On April 28, wallet 0x932c…bde walked away with the top spot in BlockDAG's Buyer Battle, locking in a massive 1.69 million BDAG purchase. While overall daily volume hit 30.04 million BDAG, this well-timed entry allowed the buyer to dominate a mid-volume day and claim a major share of the remaining allocation.

As BlockDAG presale heads into its final stretch, this win offers a clear reminder: even with growing participation, decisive action still pays. With the $0.0019 special offer ending May 13, now's the moment to act, especially for those tracking the most promising cryptocurrency ICO opportunities.

BlockDAG's Buyer Battle program continues to showcase how calculated purchases can translate into significant advantages. Wallet 0x932c…bde's April 28 win is a textbook example. With 30.04 million BDAG sold that day, the overall competition wasn't as intense as on previous high-volume days. Yet, by committing to a 1.69 million BDAG buy, this user didn't just make a large transaction; they secured exclusive bonus rewards tied to the daily allocation, stepping ahead of other participants who hesitated or split their entries.

The Buyer Battle format isn't about speculation or luck. It rewards bold participation, especially at times when overall volume allows individual entries to shine. This incentive structure makes BlockDAG's presale more engaging than a typical cryptocurrency ICO. Participants can gain more than just token access; they can compete for daily bonuses and build their holdings faster if they act decisively. With fewer days left before listing, those who understand this rhythm are using it to their advantage. Wallet 0x932c…bde's move is proof that smart timing on moderate days can be just as powerful as high-volume plays.

BlockDAG's presale has rapidly grown into one of the most watched events of the season. With over 19.6 billion BDAG coins sold and total fundraising now at $225 million, interest in the project shows no signs of slowing down. The current batch stands at #28, priced at $0.0262, but buyers still have a limited window to access BDAG at just $0.0019, a special rate ending May 13. That means the gap between the offer price and batch price is widening, creating immediate value for those who get in under the wire.

The return on investment since batch one now sits at 2,520%, highlighting just how much early participants have benefited. But even for new buyers, the incentive is strong. The combination of discounted pricing, a fixed deadline, and ongoing Buyer Battle rewards makes BlockDAG more than just another cryptocurrency ICO, it's a structured opportunity designed to reward both strategic volume buying and active community involvement. Those still waiting for a “better entry” may find that the best one is happening right now, especially with the final price jump coming once listings are announced.

As the clock ticks down to May 13, BlockDAG's presale is entering a critical stage. After that date, the $0.0019 rate will close, and the path to public trading will begin. This creates a narrowing window for investors who want to secure tokens at deep discounts and still take part in Buyer Battles for added gains. The April 28 win by wallet 0x932c…bde serves as a signal that the rewards are still very much on the table for those who move with conviction.

BlockDAG isn't just attracting attention because of its pricing structure; it's also turning heads for how it's reimagining participation in cryptocurrency ICO events. Rather than a passive sale, it's a competitive and rewarding process where buyers can maximize their stake through both referrals and large-volume purchases. Every day offers another chance to get more out of the presale than just the token itself.

For latecomers, the opportunity isn't gone, but it is shifting. While early adopters had the benefit of time, current participants have urgency on their side. Buyer Battle wins are still achievable, especially on moderate volume days, where one large purchase can change the leaderboard. With listings just around the corner, BlockDAG offers a final entry point for those who want to be part of something that blends accessibility with opportunity in a way that few cryptocurrency ICOs manage to balance.

Wallet 0x932c…bde's 1.69 million BDAG win on April 28 wasn't just a lucky grab; it was a well-placed bet that demonstrates the strategic upside still available in BlockDAG's presale. With total funding at $225 million and over 19.6 billion coins sold, the project has already outpaced many expectations.

But it's the structure, limited pricing at $0.0019, a 2,520% ROI since batch one, and the daily Buyer Battle incentive, that continues to set it apart from any standard cryptocurrency ICO. As the May 13 deadline nears, those looking for their edge still have time to act, but the final stretch won't wait for long.

Dollar Has No Ceiling","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:baa9c6969094b:0-bitcoin-to-infinity-venture-capitalist-says-crypto-s-value-vs-dollar-has-no-ceiling/","Sat, 03 May 2025 19:00:04 GMT","

The dollar is weakening this year. As reported, the US dollar index declined 7% year-to-date, one of its worst openings in recent history.

The dollar index measures the value of the dollar against six other major foreign currencies. As tensions between the US and several countries have increased on the trade front, worries regarding the long-term strength of the dollar are beginning to emerge.

Bitcoin Receives More Attention From Investors

As the dollar weakens, more investors are turning to Bitcoin as a potential hedge. Venture capitalist Tim Draper indicated that Bitcoin may serve as an insurance policy against the failure of fiat currencies.

He thinks the digital currency will keep appreciating in value relative to the US dollar, particularly as international confidence in fiat currencies falters.

In a comment he made on the X platform, he said Bitcoin “might be worth an infinite amount of USD.”

During the Civil War, the south's Confederate Dollar went through hyperinflation.

After starting 1:1 with USD, it ended the war at over 10 million to 1.

Draper likened Bitcoin's present surge to a change in monetary behavior. He pointed out that during uncertain times, individuals will shift their funds towards the assets that make them feel more secure.

While gold has played that function previously, Draper stated that Bitcoin is starting to fill the position because of its digital format and convenience.

A Civil War-Era Analogy Raises Eyebrows

To illustrate his argument, Draper referred to American history. He cited the Confederate States of America, which had printed its own paper money during the Civil War in 1861.

Initially, it was pegged at a 1:1 ratio with the US dollar. But towards the end of the war, the Confederate dollar had disintegrated, exchanging at over 10 million to 1 compared to the US dollar.

Draper explained this illustrates how quickly a currency can disintegrate when trust is lost. He cautioned that something like that can happen again if individuals, businesses, and even governments lose faith in the stability of the current system. In his opinion, Bitcoin stands to gain from that change.Bitcoin Versus Gold In A Changing Market

Gold will usually be the first safe haven when there are financial pressures, but Draper believes that it is no longer number one. He noted that gold has issues such as huge storage fees and physical movement. Bitcoin, however, is a purely online existence and can easily transfer quickly across borders.

He also stated that Bitcoin possesses special strengths—like limited supply and autonomy from central banks—that make it more attractive than conventional assets.

These characteristics, Draper explained, are becoming increasingly difficult to overlook as the global financial system comes under greater stress.Governments Start To Take Notice

Draper claims that even some governments are seeking to find out if they should keep Bitcoin reserves. That marks a shifting sentiment towards how cryptocurrencies are perceived, not only among private investors but also public institutions.

BANXA, a popular crypto on-ramp platform, has received KYB (Know Your Business) approval, marking a major step forward for the Pi Network. This approval means that BANXA is now legally allowed to offer Pi cryptocurrency purchases to people in over 100 countries.

In simple terms, users can now buy Pi coin directly with cash, instantly and securely. This makes Pi much more accessible, especially for users who are new to crypto or don't use peer-to-peer (P2P) methods.

KYB approval is important because it proves that a business follows proper identity and compliance checks. This is similar to how individuals have to go through KYC (Know Your Customer) verification.

Only KYB-approved businesses can legally trade and handle Pi. On the other hand, people who want to trade Pi through P2P methods must be KYC-approved and use non-custodial wallets. This ensures that all transactions are safe and that users are protected from fraud.

The Pi Network has been focused on building trust from the very beginning. By enforcing KYC for users and KYB for businesses, the team behind Pi is setting up a secure and regulated ecosystem. It's a bold step in a crypto industry that still struggles with scams and regulatory issues. According to Pi supporters, this approach makes Pi more attractive to institutions and serious investors.

Other major platforms like BitMart and HTX are also expected to receive KYB approval soon, possibly within the next 10 days. If that happens, Pi could be listed and traded more widely, opening the door to even faster adoption worldwide.

This momentum is likely to be a hot topic at the upcoming Consensus 2025 Summit. With a secure, verified ecosystem and expanding global reach, Pi Network is positioning itself as a major player in the future of digital currency.

As of writing, Pi (PI) coin is trading at approximately $0.5865, reflecting a 1.33% increase over the past 24 hours, and the market cap stands at around $4.13 billion. The 24-hour trading volume has surged by over 32%, reaching $39.48 million.

Reporting from San Francisco

Spend enough time in San Francisco, peering into the cyberpunk future, and you may find that weird things start seeming normal. Fleets of self-driving cars? Yawn. A start-up trying to resurrect the woolly mammoth? Sure, why not. Summoning a godlike artificial intelligence that could wipe out humanity? Ho-hum.

You may even find yourself, as I did on Wednesday night, standing in a crowded room in the Marina district, gazing into a glowing white sphere known as the Orb, having your eyeballs scanned in exchange for cryptocurrency and something called a World ID.

The event was hosted by World, a San Francisco start-up co-founded by Sam Altman of OpenAI that has come up with one of the more ambitious (or creepy, depending on your view) tech projects in recent memory.

The company's basic pitch is this: The internet is about to be overrun with swarms of realistic A.I. bots that will make it nearly impossible to tell whether we're interacting with real humans on social networks, dating sites, gaming platforms and other online spaces.

Freight Technologies (FRGT), a $4.8 million market cap logistics tech firm focused on cross-border trade between the U.S. and Mexico, has entered an agreement to buy up to $20 million in the Official Trump Token (TRUMP) to build out its crypto treasury.

The company said it secured the funding through a convertible note facility with an institutional investor, with an initial $1 million tranche already committed. The capital will be used solely to acquire TRUMP tokens, making it one of the first publicly listed companies to do so.

The decision follows a separate investment in AI-linked FET tokens currently valued at $8 million, which the company says supports AI tools used across its logistics platforms.

Buying digital assets for publicly traded companies isn't a new strategy. 

Michael Saylor championed it with a bitcoin strategy, and others, such as Semler Scientific (SMLR), followed through. Most recently, Cantor (CEP) is making a splash with huge dry powder to do the same. Meanwhile, companies such as Sol Strategies (HODL) and Janover (JNVR) are buying up SOL tokens to give investors exposure to the cryptocurrency. 

The trend is also picking up in Japan, where hotel firm Metaplanet has recently hit 5,000 BTC on its balance sheet and issued $25 million in bonds to fund additional purchases. Smaller firms, including Value Creation, Remixpoint, NEXON, Anap Holdings, and WEMADE are also accumulating the cryptocurrency.

However, Freight's mandate is slightly different: to influence the U.S.-Mexico trade deal amid President Trump's all-out trade war. 

""We believe that the addition of the Official Trump tokens are an excellent way to diversify our crypto treasury, and also an effective way to advocate for fair, balanced, and free trade between Mexico and the US,"" Javier Selgas, the company's CEO, said in a press release on April 30. 

While such a strategy could help a company such as Freight, influencing presidential decisions by buying a memecoin could bring up the question of conflict of interest. Just recently, Trump said he will hold a private dinner with top token holders, drawing outcry from Democratic lawmakers, who cited the president's involvement with the token as potential grounds for impeachment.

On April 25, Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) pointed to the crypto project offering its top holders an invitation to a dinner event with President Trump, calling it a clear case of selling access to the presidency.

For Freight, whose stock price plunged nearly 90% in the last 12 months and is heavily tied to cross-border trading, it seems this might be the best way to keep share prices afloat. 

“At the heart of Fr8Tech's mission is the promotion of productive and active commerce between the United States and Mexico. Mexico is the United States' top goods trading partner, with Mexico being the leading destination for US exports and the top source for US imports,"" Selgas added. 

After announcing the move, Freight Technologies' shares jumped over 111% before the closing bell on Friday. However, in after-hours trading, the stock plunged 21.6%. 

Freight Technologies' product lineup includes a suite of applications, ranging from cross-border freight booking to transportation management, all aimed at modernizing the flow of goods in North America. 

Other companies have made investments in the crypto space linked to the U.S. President. Last month, DWF Labs invested $25 million in the decentralized finance protocol backed by Trump and his family, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), as it moved to establish a physical presence in the U.S.

The investment gives DWF Labs a governance stake in the project, which has been accumulating various cryptocurrencies and is set to soon launch a stablecoin backed by short-term U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents, called USD1.

TRUMP tokens are trading at $12.7, up just 0.1% for the day and 42% in the last 30 days.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino is sounding the alarm on Europe's financial system, warning that a wave of bank failures could hit the continent in the near future due to the intersection of risky lending and new cryptocurrency rules.

Ardoino, during an interview with the Less Noise More Signal podcast, took aim at the European Union's regulatory framework for stablecoins, which he said pushes companies like Tether to keep the bulk of their reserves—up to 60%—in uninsured bank deposits.

In his scenario, that could mean holding 6 billion euros of a 10 billion euros-pegged stablecoin in small banks with minimal protection. “The bank insurance in Europe is only 100,000 euros,” he said. “If you have 1 billion euros, that's like spitting on a fire.”

European banks, like every other bank, operate on a fractional reserve, Ardoino added. “They can lend out 90% of it to people that want to buy a house, start a business, and all of that.” In his hypothetical 6 billion euros scenario, this would mean 5.4 billion euros would be lent out by the bank.

Tether CEO @paoloardoino to @pahueg: ""Many"" European banks will ""blow up"" in the ""next few years."" pic.twitter.com/HimWWYrbcU

He likened the setup to the lead-up to Silicon Valley Bank's collapse in 2023, when a flood of redemptions exposed the mismatch between deposits and actual liquidity. Ardoino warned that European banks operate under similar fractional reserve models that could unravel under pressure. A 20% redemption event, he estimated, could leave banks short billions.

""As a stablecoin issuer, you go bankrupt — not because of you, but because of the bank. So the bank goes bankrupt and you go bankrupt, and the government would say, ‘Told you so, stablecoins are very dangerous,” Ardoino said.

Regulations in Europe, he added, are made to try to help banks in the bloc and bring them liquidity, but this created “huge systemic risk.” The largest banks in Europe, like UBS, would “not bank stablecoins,” pushing stablecoin issuers to use smaller banks, furthering the risk.

The comments come as Tether plans to launch a U.S.-based stablecoin product, and as the stablecoin issuer keeps investing in various projects outside of the ecosystem, having recently raised its stake in Latin American producer Adecoagro.

 Investors continue to pour into gold amid macroeconomic uncertainty and ongoing geopolitical tensions that have impacted risk asset prices. 

Tokenized gold carries several benefits over other forms of paper gold, including gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Melissa Song and Dustin Becker, representatives of Gold DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that facilitates investor access to tokenized gold.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, the DAO representatives outlined three major benefits unique to tokenized gold, including 1:1 redeemability for a specific quantity of physical, serialized gold, usage as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and transactional efficiency through on-demand liquidity.

""When you buy an ETF, you are betting on the gold price going up, but you do not own any specific gold bar,"" Song told Cointelegraph.

The pair added that the price of gold surged in 2025 due to the current macroeconomic uncertainty, the high level of US government debt, and geopolitical tensions that are reshaping the global monetary order.

Gold hit an all-time high of $3,500 per ounce in April 2025 amid the trade tariffs announced by United States President Donald Trump that caused turmoil in risk-on asset markets like stocks and crypto.

Traders shifted to gold, cash, and other safe-haven assets to weather the extreme volatility caused by the protectionist trade policies and the counter-response from other countries.

This rush to gold also caused gold-backed cryptocurrencies such as Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT) to spike in price during April 2024.

Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser argued that gold-backed tokens will outcompete fiat stablecoins due to the lack of geopolitical risk and inflationary resistance inherent in gold.

""A stablecoin backed by Gold would out-compete a USD-backed stablecoin in world markets: Russia, China, and Iran should take note,"" Keiser wrote in a March 22 X post.

""The United States dollar has no volatility, but you are guaranteed to lose purchasing power,"" the BTC advocate continued.

Gold's current rally could spill over into Bitcoin if investors shift from viewing Bitcoin as a risk asset to more of a store of value in turbulent economic times that is counter-cyclical to the stock market and other speculative investments.

 The current ETH price setup versus Bitcoin closely mirrors 2019, with an oversold RSI and prolonged weakness below key moving averages after a multiyear decline. 

Ethereum's Ether (ETH) token is approaching a critical price zone against Bitcoin (BTC), which historically marked the beginning of a massive rebound.

The ETH/BTC pair, currently trading near 0.019 BTC, is edging closer to 0.016 BTC — the exact level it reached in September 2019 before rallying nearly 450% over the following year.

The current ETH/BTC setup resembles 2019, with both periods marked by oversold relative strength index (RSI), long stretches below key moving averages, and multiyear declines.

In 2019, ETH/BTC fell over 90% in the prior two years, driven by the ICO collapse. 

As of 2025, the pair is down over 80% from its 2021 peak, weighed by skepticism over Ethereum's switch to proof-of-stake (PoS), rising competition, and Bitcoin's growing dominance as an institutional asset.

In response to the growing concerns, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed new architecture and protocol-wide standards to make Ethereum simpler, faster, and as maintainable as Bitcoin within five years. 

Related: Ethereum to simplify crosschain transactions with new token standards

One analyst called Buterin's proposal “the most bullish thing for ETH.”

The bullish hopes come as ETH/BTC attempts to break free from its multi-year “bearish parabola.” This resistance curve has been instrumental in limiting the pair's upside attempts since December 2021 but showed signs of exhaustion as of May 3.

“We might see an end of this bearish parabola,” wrote chartist Jimie.

He noted that if the curved resistance holds, ETH/BTC could drop toward 0.016 BTC — the same level where it bottomed in September 2019 before rallying by roughly 450%.

Skeptics like Bitcoin's proof-of-work pioneer, Adam Back, argue that Buterin is overlooking deeper design flaws while proposing to simplify Ethereum in the coming years. 

Back criticizes Ethereum's account-based system, saying it adds unnecessary complexity compared to Bitcoin's simpler UTXO (unspent transaction output) model. He argues this growing complexity increases technical risks and makes Ethereum harder to scale and secure.

He also warns that Ethereum's shift to PoS has concentrated power among insiders by redirecting miner rewards to large tokenholders.

“At this point, just flush ETH before it hits zero and buy Bitcoin,” he wrote, suggesting no upgrade can fix what he views as Ethereum's flawed foundation.

This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Raymond Ward wants to see solar panels draped over every balcony in the United States and doesn't understand why that isn't happening.

The technology couldn't be easier to use—simply hang one or two panels over a railing and plug them into an outlet. The devices provide up to 800 watts, enough to charge a laptop or power a small fridge. They're popular in Germany, where everyone from renters to climate activists to gadget enthusiasts hail them as a cheap and easy way to generate electricity. Germans had registered more than 780,000 of the devices with the country's utility regulator as of December. They've installed millions more without telling the government.

Here in the US, though, there is no market for balcony solar. Ward, a Republican state representative in Utah who learned about the tech last year, wants that to change. The way he sees it, this is an obvious solution to surging power demand. “You look over there and say, ‘Well, that's working,'” he told Grist. “So what is it that stops us from having it here?”

His colleagues agree. Last month, the legislature unanimously passed a bill he sponsored to boost the tech, and Republican governor Spencer Cox signed it. HB 340 exempts portable solar devices from state regulations that require owners of rooftop solar arrays and other power-generating systems to sign an interconnection agreement with their local utility. These deals, and other “soft costs” like permits, can nearly double the price of going solar.

Utah's law marks the nation's first significant step to remove barriers to balcony solar—but bigger obstacles remain. Regulations and standards governing electrical devices haven't kept pace with development of the technology, and it lacks essential approvals required for adoption—including compliance with the National Electrical Code and a product safety standard from Underwriters Laboratories. Nothing about the bill Ward wrote changes that: Utahans still can't install balcony solar because none of the systems have been nationally certified.

These challenges will take time and effort to overcome, but they're not insurmountable, advocates of the technology said. Even now, a team of entrepreneurs and research scientists, backed by federal funding, are creating these standards. Their work mirrors what happened in Germany nearly a decade ago, when clean-energy advocates and companies began lobbying the country's electrical certification body to amend safety regulations to legalize balcony solar.

In 2017, Verband der Elektrotechnik, or VDE, a German certification body that issues product and safety standards for electrical products, released the first guideline that allowed for balcony solar systems. While such systems existed before VDE took this step, the benchmark it established allowed manufacturers to sell them widely, creating a booming industry.

“Relentless individuals” were key to making that happen, said Christian Ofenheusle, the founder of EmpowerSource, a Berlin-based company that promotes balcony solar. Members of a German solar industry association spent years advocating for the technology and worked with VDE to carve a path toward standardizing balcony solar systems. The initial standard was followed by revised versions in 2018 and 2019 that further outlined technical requirements.

The regulatory structure has continued to evolve. Ofenheusle has worked with other advocates to amend grid safety standards, create simple online registration for plug-in devices, and enshrine renters' right to balcony solar. Politicians supported such efforts because they see the tech easing the nation's reliance on Russian natural gas. Cities like Berlin and Munich have provided millions of euros in subsidies to help households buy these systems, and the country is creating a safety standard for batteries that can store the energy for later use.

Balcony solar systems feature one or two small photovoltaic panels and a microinverter and generate enough power to charge a laptop or power a small fridge.

Meanwhile, the United States has yet to take the first step of creating a safety standard for the technology. US electrical guidelines don't account for the possibility of plugging a power-generating device into a household outlet. The nation also operates on a different system that precludes simply copying and pasting Germany's rules. The US grid, for example, operates at 120 volts, while that country's grid operates at 230 volts.

Without proper standards, a balcony solar system could pose several hazards.

One concern is a phenomenon called breaker masking. Within a home, a single circuit can provide power to several outlets. Each circuit is equipped with a circuit breaker, a safety device within the electrical panel that shuts off power if that circuit is overloaded, which happens when too many appliances try to draw too much electricity at the same time. That prevents overheating or a fire. When a balcony solar device sends power into a circuit while other appliances are drawing power from the circuit, the breaker can't detect that added power supply. If the circuit becomes overloaded—imagine turning on your TV while a space heater is running and you're charging your laptop, all in the same room—the circuit breaker might fail to activate.

This was a concern in Germany, so it developed standards that limit balcony solar units to just 800 watts, about half the amount used by a hair dryer. That threshold is considered low enough that even in the country's oldest homes, the wiring can withstand the heating that occurs in even the worst of worst-case scenarios, said Sebastian Müller, chair of the German Balcony Solar Association, a consumer education and advocacy group. As a result, Ofenheusle said there haven't been any cases of breaker masking causing harm. In fact, with millions of the devices installed nationwide, Germany has yet to see any safety issues beyond a few cases where someone tampered with the devices to add a car battery or other unsuitable hardware, he said.

Another issue in the US is the lack of a compatible safety device called a ground fault circuit interrupter, or a GFCI. They are typically built into outlets installed near water sources, like a sink, washing machine, or bathtub. They're designed to minimize the risk of electric shock by cutting off power when, for example, a hair dryer falls into a sink. Yet there are no certified GFCI outlets in the US designed for use with devices that consume power, like a blender, and those that generate it, like a balcony solar setup. Germany's equivalent of a GFCI, called a residual current device, can detect bidirectional power flows, said Andreas Schmitz, a mechanical engineer and YouTuber in Germany who makes videos about balcony solar.

Some people have raised concerns about the shock risk of touching the metal prongs of a plug after unplugging a balcony solar device. German regulators accounted for that by requiring the microinverter—which converts currents from the panel into electricity fed into the home—shut down immediately in an outage or when it is suddenly unplugged. Most of them already have this feature, but any US standard will likely need to formalize that requirement.

The lack of an Underwriters Laboratories (UL) standard is perhaps the biggest obstacle to the adoption of balcony solar. The company certifies the safety of thousands of household electrical products; according to Iowa State University, “every light bulb, lamp, or outlet purchased in the US usually has a UL symbol and says UL Listed.” This assures customers that the product follows nationally recognized guidelines and can be used without the risk of a fire or shock.

While some companies have sold plug-in solar devices in the US without a UL listing, the company's seal of approval typically is a prerequisite for selling products on the wider market. Consumers might be wary of using something that lacks its approval. Utah's new balcony solar policy, for example, specifies that the law applies only to UL-listed products.

Achim Ginsberg-Klemmt, vice president of engineering at the plug-in solar startup GismoPower, has been working on creating such a standard for more than a year and a half. In 2023, the Department of Energy awarded his company a grant to work with UL to develop a standard.

GismoPower sells a mobile carport with a roof of solar panels and an integrated electric vehicle charger. Unlike rooftop solar, the system doesn't need to be mounted in place but can be rolled onto a driveway and plugged in, generating electricity for the car, house, and the grid. “We're basically taking rooftop solar to the next level” by making it portable and accessible for renters, Ginsberg-Klemmt said. The product is in use at pilot sites nationwide, though a lack of standardized rules for plug-in solar has forced the company to negotiate interconnection agreements with local utilities—a time-consuming and sometimes costly process.

GismoPower's product avoids one of the biggest technical challenges with balcony solar by plugging into a dedicated 240-volt outlet, the kind typically used for dryers. Such an outlet serves a single appliance and uses a dedicated circuit, sidestepping the risk of overloading. But it runs headlong into the same obstacle of lacking a compatible UL standard. Ginsberg-Klemmt is working with researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, other entrepreneurs, and engineers at Underwriters Laboratories to develop such a standard, but it hasn't been easy. “We have found so many roadblocks,” he told Grist.

One major sticking point is that any standard must comply with the National Electrical Code, a set of guidelines for electrical wiring in buildings that does not allow for the installation of plug-in energy systems like balcony solar. The rules are issued by the National Fire Protection Association, a nonprofit trade association, and adopted on a state-by-state basis.

The code is updated every three years, with the next iteration due later this year for the 2026 edition. Ginsberg-Klemmt and his working group submitted recommendations for amending the code to allow plug-in solar—and every one of them was rejected in October.

Jeff Sargent, the National Fire Protection Association's staff liaison to the National Electrical Code committee, told Grist that this is the first time the organization had received public comments about plug-in solar systems. For now, it cannot consider amendments to allow their use until a compatible ground fault circuit interrupter exists, he said. Once that's available, he said, the association can ensure that outdoor outlets can be safely used for balcony solar.

Electrical standards are constantly evolving, and it often takes more than one cycle of code changes to allow for new products, said Sargent. Ginsberg-Klemmt said his group will continue to pursue other avenues to amend the codes.

Until that happens, a UL standard for plug-in solar is unlikely to go anywhere. But interest in plug-in energy solutions isn't going away, and decisionmakers will have to adjust to that reality eventually, Ward said. It happened in Germany, where people across the political spectrum have embraced the technology. Ward believes the same thing will happen here. The way he sees it, “It's just a good thing if you set up a system so people have a way to take care of as much of their own problems as they can.”

Legendary investor Warren Buffett announced today that he will ask the Berkshire Hathaway board to have Greg Abel replace him as CEO at the end of 2025.

“I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,” Buffett said at the end of the company's annual shareholder meeting, ahead of its board meeting Sunday.

At the same time, Buffett, who is 94 years old, said that he would “hang around” in some capacity. He and Abel told CNBC that they would use Sunday's board meeting to discuss what Buffett's formal role will be after he steps down.

Buffett had previously identified Abel — currently Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman for non-insurance operations — as his successor, but he hadn't said when Abel would take over.

While technology is just one of many areas where Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway invest, it's made big bets on the industry. Even after selling half its Apple stock last year, the company represents more than 20% of its portfolio.

Welcome back to Week in Review! We've got lots of news for you today: Amazon earnings, Apple earnings, ChatGPT sycophancy, Alibaba's AI models, and much more. Let's get to it!

Well? During Apple's earnings call yesterday, Tim Cook revealed that the company paid $900 million in tariffs last quarter. But despite this, the CEO didn't announce any price increases — yet.

Big bucks: Defense tech startup Mach Industries, which was founded by 21-year-old Ethan Thornton, is about to close a fresh $100 million in financing, sources told TechCrunch. This new funding should bring the startup's total funding to about $185 million to date.

More models: Alibaba announced this week that it's releasing a family of AI models, called Qwen3, that it claims can outperform OpenAI and Google. According to Alibaba, the Qwen3 models are “hybrid” models, and they're not yet available for download. 

This is TechCrunch's Week in Review, where we recap the week's biggest news. Want this delivered as a newsletter to your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here.

Shoot for the stars: Amazon's effort to create a space-based internet network began in earnest this week: The company fired off its first 27 internet satellites on Tuesday. The first half of the network needs to be deployed by mid-2026 to meet the FCC deadline.

AI in your pocket: Meta is rolling out a stand-alone AI app, which it unveiled at the company's first LlamaCon event on Tuesday. The app allows users to access Meta AI in an app, similar to the ChatGPT app and other AI assistant apps.

Blocked: A judge in India blocked the encrypted email provider Proton Mail across the country. This was in response to a legal complaint filed by New Delhi-based M Moser Design Associates, which alleged that its employees had received emails containing obscene and vulgar content sent via Proton Mail.

Cheaters never win: Cluely went viral recently for its bold claim of helping people cheat on everything. But some startups are claiming they can catch Cluely's users.

Alexa+: Amazon's new digital assistant aims to let users talk with it in a more natural style and eventually have agentic abilities that allow it to use third-party apps on a user's behalf. During Amazon's earnings call this week, CEO Andy Jassy says that 100,000 users now have Alexa+.

AI where it matters: Airbnb seems to be taking a more measured approach with AI. It started rolling out an AI-powered customer service bot in the U.S. last month. CEO Brian Chesky said in February that the company would use AI for customer service before it started implementing it for other uses like travel planning or booking tickets.

Epic ruling: Epic Games has notched a win in an ongoing legal dispute with Apple. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said in a ruling that Apple was in “willful violation” of a 2021 injunction that prohibited the company from imposing anticompetitive pricing. As a result, Fortnite could be back on iPhones as soon as next week. 

LOL: Following the Epic Games ruling, Stripe shared documentation that shows iOS developers how to avoid the Apple commission.

Check your settings: Meta emailed Ray-Ban Meta owners on Tuesday with a notice that AI features will now be enabled on the glasses by default. This means Meta's AI will analyze photos and videos taken with the glasses while certain AI features are switched on.

Yikes! OpenAI said it was “rolling back” the latest update to the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, after complaints about strange behavior, in particular it being overly agreeable and validating. According to OpenAI, the update, which was intended to make the model's default personality “feel more intuitive and effective,” was informed too much by “short-term feedback.” Now the company pledges to make changes that would prevent this from happening in the future. 

Oh the drama: We read through the 80-page Epic v. Apple decision to pull out the judge's juiciest, fieriest comments. Here's one to get you started: “Apple engaged in tactics to delay the proceedings. The Court later concluded that delay equaled profits.”

Like virtually every sector in the business world, the secondhand industry is grappling with the ramifications of President Donald Trump's tariffs. 

However, based on the comments made by eBay and Etsy earlier this week, both don't appear to be overly concerned. 

The companies recently reported Q1 2025 earnings results, both addressing the pressing topic of tariffs. eBay and Etsy are resilient to an extent, largely due to their sellers' approaches to sourcing products. In contrast to import-reliant rivals like Temu and Shein, which recently raised prices in response to tariffs, many eBay and Etsy sellers in the U.S. mainly source their products locally, often selling used, vintage, or handmade items.

The companies provided data during their earnings calls to demonstrate the minimal exposure to tariffs.

eBay's CEO Jamie Iannone said, “Our greater China to U.S. quarter makes up about 5% of total [gross merchandise value] for us. And China overall is a little less than 10%.” 

Similarly, Etsy's CFO, Lanny Baker, said, “At present, Etsy's direct tariff exposure appears to be relatively low given that just over 1% of [gross merchandise sales] comes from U.S. imports of items purchased from sellers in China.”

Etsy's CEO, Josh Silverman, added, “Most are solo entrepreneurs working from their home with 90% sourcing their supplies domestically.” 

Having sellers with local sourcing strategies can provide a significant advantage over competitors like Temu, Shein, and Amazon. However, secondhand companies still have to deal with the challenges that come with the ongoing economic uncertainty and consumer spending habits.

Etsy appears to be slightly more vulnerable when it comes to this. Etsy's core business model focuses on handcrafted and vintage goods, which tend to be priced higher. So, while Etsy sellers may not feel the effects of tariffs, customers are still hesitant to spend, leading to a 3.4% year-over-year decline in active buyers, bringing the total to 88.5 million. The number of habitual buyers was down 11%, totaling 6.2 million. 

Additionally, Etsy reported an 8.9% decline in gross merchandise sales (GMS) for the marketplace to $2.3 billion.

On a positive note, Etsy continues to benefit from its ownership of Depop, a secondhand fashion platform that remains popular amid the looming recession. Since acquiring Depop in 2021, the platform has achieved record-high GMS. The company didn't disclose specific figures.

“Etsy has a strong track record of navigating turbulent macroeconomic conditions, and we're confident in our ability to keep adapting,” Silverman said. 

In contrast, eBay is in a stronger position because more price-conscious shoppers are choosing used and refurbished goods, which the company said accounts for over 40% of its inventory. The company reported that customers eager to avoid tariffs have increased their spending, giving eBay a solid start to the quarter.

“We have observed healthy volume trends due to strength in our focus categories and what could be a modest pull forward of demand from consumers worried about increased costs and complexity at U.S. customs in the near future,” said eBay's CFO, Steve Priest.

The company's gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew to $18.8 billion, while revenue increased over 1% to $2.58 billion.

Who's up for some CRISPR-y bacon? This week, the Food and Drug Administration approved gene-edited pigs developed by PIC, a biotechnology company specializing in livestock genetics, for human consumption.

The FDA granted the approval Wednesday, allowing a specific gene edit to be used in commercially bred pigs. With the help of CRISPR—a powerful gene editing tool—the UK-based company has created pigs resistant to one of the most common viral infections affecting swine worldwide. It will take a while longer for this GE pork to end up on our dinner plates, however.

“We have spent years conducting extensive research, validating our findings and working with the FDA to gain approval,” said Matt Culbertson, chief operating officer at PIC (short for Pig Improvement Company), in a statement released Thursday by the National Pig Association in the UK.

PIC's edit is intended to tackle the virus behind porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). It knocks out a receptor on pig cells that is commonly hijacked by the virus to cause infection. The modified pigs should be resistant to nearly all strains of the PRRS virus circulating today (some rare subtypes may still cause infection).

Though PRRS may have existed in the wild previously, it only emerged as a major concern among pig livestock several decades ago. It's now widely spread and deeply destructive to the industry, since it can kill off young pigs and cause reproductive failure in breeding pigs. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, PRRS is estimated to cause the U.S. alone to lose $560 million annually.

The edit is introduced into early embryos, which are implanted into gilts (female pigs that have reached maturity but have yet to give birth). This means that the mutation can then be inherited by future generations of bred pigs. These pigs aren't considered to be different in any other way—including taste and safety—from unmodified pigs.

PIC's gene-edited pigs aren't the first to be approved as food in the U.S. In 2020, the FDA approved Revivicor's Galsafe pigs for use in both medicine and food. Galsafe pigs have been edited to no longer carry the sugar alpha-gal in their muscles, which can trigger allergy in certain people and also makes pigs incompatible for organ transplantation.

The FDA has also previously approved other genetically modified animals to be safe for human consumption, such as salmon. But companies have historically struggled to clear the regulatory hurdles for approval or to gain a foothold in the commercial market once approved. That said, the relatively simple nature of PIC's method (removing, not adding a gene) and the large-scale benefits it can provide could make these pigs the first GE livestock to be widely bred and consumed by people. And its success could very well herald the arrival of other meat products genetically engineered to be safer or more disease-resistant.

It will still take PIC (and its parent company Genus) some more time and resources to get its project fully off the ground. Because the pig industry is so globalized, the company is seeking to secure approval in other major markets where pork is widely produced or imported, including Mexico, Canada, and China. And it doesn't expect its pigs to be available for purchase in the U.S. until 2026 at the earliest.

8GB VRAM no longer cuts it for modern gaming.

Nvidia launched the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and 8GB models in mid-April, and the GPU with the larger VRAM received relatively positive reviews. However, many say that the 8GB graphics card is struggling due to a lack of VRAM, even at lower resolutions. Aside from that, Computer Base [machine translated] also discovered another issue brought by the smaller memory: reduced performance in some titles when attached to a PCIe 4.0 slot.

The publication measured 27 titles at 1440p, with the 8GB card getting an average FPS of 59.4 with a PCIe 5.0 motherboard, and a slightly lower 55.82 FPS when hooked up via PCIe 4.0. The 1% lows recorded are at 47.21 FPS and 43.93 FPS, respectively. This might not seem bad initially, but a few select titles had it much worse than the average.

Out of all the tested games, eight titles suffered a 5 FPS or more decrease in both average FPS and 1% lows—an almost 9% or more decrease in performance.

This might not be an issue for enthusiasts with higher-end GPUs that cost more, as they most likely run the latest hardware or can afford to get them if needed. However, given that the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB is designed as a mainstream card, it will more likely be purchased by users running older motherboard models that might not have support for PCIe 5.0 yet. Of course, they'll expect better performance when upgrading to this GPU, but if their favorite game happens to be one of the titles affected by this performance gap, they will be disappointed.

That's why many reviewers no longer recommend graphics cards with 8GB of VRAM or less, especially if you're a gamer. As PC game developers take advantage of more demanding hardware, players with GPUs with limited memory will tend to get left behind.

There might still be demand for a GPU at this price point, as Nvidia would likely not have made the 8GB variant if nobody would buy it. But if you want to make the most out of your money, you should stay away from brand-new graphics cards with less than 12GB of VRAM.

Cerabyte has previously stated its archival glass storage has a 5,000 year lifespan.

Storage startup Cerabyte has shared a video in which it torture tests its memory media. The firm took a sliver of its archival glass storage and boiled it in a kettle filled with salt water (100C, 212F), then, for good measure, it grilled it in a pizza oven (250C, 480F). The durability demo confirms that the media was unscathed after this process, and the data on the Cerabyte media remained “100% intact.”

A demo similar to the embedded video below occurred during the recent Open Compute Project (OCP) summit in Dublin, Ireland. While Cerabyte didn't seem to pack their toaster for the Irish event, the salt water boiling test was extended over several days. It was noted that the kettle had begun to corrode after 24 hours of hot, salty agitation.

Cerabyte has developed this entertaining shtick to maintain interest in its archival glass storage, which we highlighted on Tom's Hardware last July. Founded in Germany in 2022, Cerabyte aims to revolutionize data storage by commercializing a data storage medium “as durable as hieroglyphs.” That might be an understatement, if Cerabyte's touted 5,000-year integrity claim turns out to be accurate (stay tuned for an update).

The ceramic-on-glass material Cerabyte uses in these durability tests stores data imprinted via femtosecond laser nanoscale holes in a ceramic medium 50 to 100 atoms thick. The ultra-thin 9cm square glass chips are written to at a rate of two million bits per laser pulse and can store up to 1GB of data on either surface.

There's no spooky science behind the durability. Glass is naturally resistant to aging in good 'cold storage' conditions. And, as the Cerabyte trade show demos show, it can shrug off being boiled in salt water for extended periods, or even being severely toasted.



We wouldn't expect glass-based storage to get corrupted at temperatures much lower than its melting point (around 1,400 degrees Celsius or 2,552 degrees Fahrenheit). Still, we aren't sure about the unspecified ceramic layer or the interface/bonding between these materials. We also aren't sure how durable Cerabyte's ultra-thin media would be if subjected to any impact or shocks.

Herculez Gomez and Kasey Keller debate whether any USMNT players could join Wrexham. (1:06)

United States men's national team player Richard Ledezma is weighing up his future at PSV Eindhoven amid interest from Chivas and other clubs in Mexico, a source told ESPN.

Ledezma, 24, has been at the Dutch Eredivisie club since 2020, scoring two goals in 38 appearances, but his current contract is set to expire this summer.

A source told ESPN that PSV have offered Ledezma a contract extension, but the versatile defender/midfielder is considering his next move before committing his future to the club.

ESPN reported in January that Ledezma received interest from from Liga MX side Club América, but the reigning Dutch champions turned down the approach.

Speaking after PSV's 1-0 win over Fortuna Sittard on Saturday, head coach Peter Bosz confirmed the club was eager to keep Ledezma.

""I can imagine that his future is on his mind,"" he told ESPN. ""That is logical when your contract expires. We would like to keep him, but if other clubs are interested, that will keep you busy as a player.""

Ledezma's future on the international stage is also unclear. Mexico national team head coach Javier Aguirre confirmed in February that he contacted dual-national Ledezma ahead of the March international window to discuss his future with El Tri.

Ledezma, born in Phoenix, Arizona, to Mexican parents, has exclusively featured for the USMNT, making his under-20 debut in March 2018 against France before going on to play for the U.S. youth squad on three other occasions.

He has made one appearance for the senior U.S. men's national team, in a friendly against Panama in November 2020.

But Ledezma, who holds both U.S. and Mexico passports, is still eligible to play for El Tri.

As the league season in the Netherlands comes to a close, PSV trail leaders Ajax by seven points with a game in hand. if PSV lose to Fortuna Sittard on Saturday, Ajax can seal the title against NEC on May 11.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Why Liverpool are not in the Club World Cup (Explained)","https://www.givemesport.com/why-liverpool-not-qualify-club-world-cup-explained/","Sat, 03 May 2025 06:30:00 GMT","

Liverpool have kick-started the Arne Slot era in perfect fashion, being crowned Premier League champions in the Dutchman's debut season in charge at Anfield. Most pundits would have predicted a year of transition following Jurgen Klopp's departure, but the seamless nature with which Slot has taken to life on Merseyside has shocked and surprise many a people.

The continued excellence of Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk, the greatness of Alisson in goal, and the mercurial talent of midfield maestro Alexis Mac Allister have all combined to deliver one of the finest seasons in Liverpool history. But while celebrations over winning the title will run for a while, one trophy they will not be getting their hands on this summer, is the FIFA Club World Cup.

Three English giants will be absent from the new tournament that will take place in 2025.

Revamped in its format and pitting some of the best teams in world football against each other, it promises to be one of the most exciting editions of the competition in recent memory. But, Slot's Liverpool will not be a part of the action. Below is everything you need to know why the 2024/2025 Premier League champions will be missing from the Club World Cup this summer.

As aforementioned, the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will feature 32 teams for the first time in competition history. However, FIFA have restricted it to allow only two clubs from the same country to be a part of the tournament. In the Premier League's case, it will be Manchester City and Chelsea who will be flying the flag for English football.

Qualification for this summer's tournament was determined by a team's performances in the Champions League from a four-year cycle starting from the 2020/2021 season. Chelsea and Man City both won European football's biggest prize within that time frame, with the Blues doing so in 2021, while Pep Guardiola's side managed that feat in 2023.

Liverpool of course had made it to the Champions League final themselves in 2022, and had they overcome Real Madrid, it would have been a completely different story. The Reds are currently ranked higher than Chelsea in UEFA's rankings, meaning that they would have joined City in playing at the Club World Cup.

This summer's tournament is set to hand out the biggest financial reward in Club World Cup history.

It all means Slot's side will not be in contention for the massive amount of prize money that is set to be on offer for being a part of the tournament, let alone winning it. The Reds' next chance to claim the Club World Cup title will now only arrive in 2029.

While the Reds may not have the chance of lifting the trophy this year, they have had previous experience of competing at the tournament. Their first foray came in 2005, when after their historic Champions League triumph in Istanbul over Milan, they went to the Club World Cup final to take on Sao Paulo. A goal from from Mineiro sealed the title for the Brazilian side as Rafa Benitez's side were left to rue their missed chances.

Liverpool and Man United have both won countless trophies over the years.

It would be 14 years later before Liverpool would return to the showpiece finale once again, but this time, they would take their revenge – and it would also come against another Brazilian side no less. A goal from Roberto Firmino was enough to secure Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool their first ever Club World Cup trophy against Flamengo after the game went into extra-time.

Their tally of one title and one runners-up finish makes them the fifth-most successful club in the competition's history, with only Bayern Munich, Corinthians, Barcelona and Real Madrid ahead of them in terms of performance. Chelsea and Manchester City will both have the opportunity to overtake them this summer given they also have one Club World Cup title each.

Uninformed NBA Legend Sparks Controversy with French Open Blunder

The upcoming French Open has been surrounded by unexpected drama even before the first serve is hit, thanks to none other than NBA icon Charles Barkley. A promotional segment featuring tennis prodigy Coco Gauff on TNT took a comical turn when Barkley displayed his ignorance about the tournament's long-standing name, Roland Garros. The blunder set off a chain reaction of reactions from fans worldwide, criticizing the lack of knowledge displayed by the NBA personalities.

Gauff, the 21-year-old tennis sensation, is gearing up to make her mark once again at Roland Garros, where she reached the final in 2022. Despite facing challenges in the 2025 season, Gauff remains determined to leave her mark on the clay courts of Paris. As anticipation builds for her return, the spotlight on Gauff only intensifies with each passing day.

The mix-up over the tournament's name, with Barkley mistaking Roland Garros for a rebranding of the French Open, led fans to question the knowledge of the NBA personalities commenting on the promo. While English speakers commonly refer to the event as the “French Open,” the tennis community recognizes and respects the historical significance of the name Roland Garros, paying homage to a World War I hero and aviation legend.

The online uproar following the viral clip highlighted the international interest in tennis and the importance of acknowledging the traditions and legacies of prestigious tournaments like Roland Garros. Fans took to social media to express their disbelief at the confusion displayed by the NBA broadcast team, emphasizing the significance of understanding the history and culture of the sports they cover.

As the tennis world gears up for the revered clay-court major, the focus remains on the athletes and the historic venue that has hosted some of the sport's greatest moments. While the naming debate may continue to swirl, one thing is certain: the spirit of Roland Garros will endure, keeping the essence of tennis alive in the heart of Paris for generations to come.

Iga Swiatek's Grass Court Struggles Spark Controversy as Wimbledon Rumors Swirl

Former World No.1 and five-time slam champion Iga Swiatek faced a shocking defeat in Madrid, leaving fans and analysts puzzled over her performance. The defending champion suffered a crushing loss to Coco Gauff in the semifinals, raising concerns about her form leading up to Wimbledon. Swiatek, visibly distraught during the match, admitted her inability to elevate her game, leading to speculations about her upcoming tournaments.

Despite previous success in Madrid, including a title win last year, Swiatek's recent setback has ignited rumors about her future plans. Reports suggest that the Polish star might consider taking a break from tennis if she fails to make an impact at the Italian Open and Roland Garros. This decision could potentially see her skipping the grass court season to focus on the US Open, casting doubt on her Wimbledon participation.

Known for her dominance on clay, Swiatek has struggled to replicate the same level of success on grass courts, with Wimbledon being her least favored Grand Slam event. Fans have expressed disappointment over her performance on this surface, with many questioning her ability to compete effectively at SW19. The debate intensifies as rumors circulate about Swiatek potentially prioritizing other tournaments over Wimbledon due to her historical struggles on grass.

As discussions around Swiatek's future plans continue to gain momentum, the tennis world awaits confirmation on whether the talented player will indeed opt out of Wimbledon to concentrate on her strengths. With her eyes set on the US Open and other major events, Swiatek's decision regarding the grass court season remains a topic of intrigue and uncertainty among fans and experts alike.

Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff are familiar foes, especially when it comes to the latter stages of tournaments.

The pair will meet in an WTA final for just the second time when they face off in for Madrid Open title on Saturday.

It calls to mind their dramatic US Open final in 2023 - the only other time that they have met with the trophy on the line.

Gauff was just 19 when she took on Sabalenka, who had already won a major that year at the Australian Open, and many expected her to claim her second. 

When the first set went to Sabalenka 6-2, many would have been forgiven for thinking the match was already a foregone conclusion.

However, what followed was one of the most thrilling comebacks in a major final as Gauff rallied to win the next two sets 6-3, 6-2 as Sabalenka uncharacteristically collapsed and lost all composure in her tennis. 

The result left both players emotional, with Sabalenka unwilling to hide hers as she stormed to her bench and began to uncontrollably cry. 

When asked in her post-match interview what she's most proud of from this year, she fought back tears again as she said: ""I don't know.""

That match still haunts the 26-year-old to this day, who admitted that while she has learnt lessons, she still gets flashbacks from it. 

""That was very difficult match, I got a little emotional and had this little flashback on last year's final, meaning the crowd atmosphere,"" said after the 2024 US Open final.

For Gauff, the 21-year-old admitted that she was surprised she cried, as it's something that she and her Dad never do.

""I do never cry but the US Open happened. I wasn't expecting that, okay? Y'all say what you want, I was not expecting that,"" she said on Instagram at the time.

""I don't think I was crying, to be honest, I think that girl in the video was crying because I don't like to cry. Not in front of people, I'll cry alone, I'll cry over a movie or a TV show but in front of people, no.

""Because I'm supposed to be a thug. Just kidding. I'm like my dad though, for real. Today was the first time I've ever seen my dad cry. He doesn't want me to tell y'all that but he got caught in 4K. He thinks he's so hard but he's not.""

Since that US Open final, the pair have met three times - all semifinals - with Gauff winning the most recent clash at the 2024 WTA Finals.

Their overall record is 5-4 in the American's advantage, but Gauff will know that records mean nothing in finals. 

Although what she will take into her clash with Sabalenka is the confidence she got from dismantling Iga Swiatek 6-1, 6-1 in the previous round.

“Obviously Aryna is world No. 1, so it would be cool to play her in the final and give myself that challenge,” Gauff said in her post-match press conference.

Sabalenka has been efficient in Madrid, she's won in straight sets in all but one of her matches as she plays in her third consecutive final in the Spanish capital.

The Belarusian's record in Madrid is imperious, winning 22 of her 26 matches on the red dirt with titles coming in 2021 and 2023.

In 2024, she lost to Swiatek in the final, but with the Pole out of the tournament, she will have every bit of belief she can pick up her third title in Spain and third title of the year.

Gauff is playing in her first final of the year - and first since winning the season-ending WTA Finals - a victory would give her a first title on clay since Rome in 2021.

While Sabalenka has been a dominant force all season she has lost three of her five finals this year and has won just 2 of her 19 titles on clay.

We may not see any tears between Gauff and Sabalenka but another classic will write another chapter in their storied rivalry.

The Norwegian winning his first 1000-level event would make for a great story, but it's hard to envision him overcoming the red-hot lefty.ByZachary CohenPublished May 03, 2025 copy_link

Published May 03, 2025

Casper Ruud has never won a 1000-level title, but he'll have a shot at it when he takes on Jack Draper in the Mutua Madrid Open final on Sunday. The good news for Ruud is that he'll be doing so on his preferred surface. Ruud's lone career ATP 500 title came in Barcelona, and he is a two-time runner-up at Roland Garros. The bad news is that Ruud is running into one of the hottest players on tour. Draper is 19-4 this season, won his first Masters event at Indian Wells and just seems to have everything working right now. On top of that, Ruud picked up a minor injury right before his semifinal match against Francisco Cerundolo, and he said that it was significant enough that he wasn't sure he'd finish that contest. Considering all of that, it's hard not to view this as an uphill battle for the Norwegian. So, I'm laying 2.5 games with the Brit.If Ruud is 100% healthy for this match, he could take a page out of Lorenzo Musetti's book. Last round, we saw the Italian keep himself in the match by targeting Draper's forehand. With Ruud's ability to generate heavy topspin on his own forehand, he could look to get the ball up super high and try to make Draper uncomfortable. The problem is that Ruud doesn't really have many other things he can go to.

If Ruud is 100% healthy for this match, he could take a page out of Lorenzo Musetti's book. Last round, we saw the Italian keep himself in the match by targeting Draper's forehand. With Ruud's ability to generate heavy topspin on his own forehand, he could look to get the ball up super high and try to make Draper uncomfortable. The problem is that Ruud doesn't really have many other things he can go to.

When Ruud goes cross court to Draper's backhand, he'll be hitting to one of the most dangerous shots in tennis. Draper, a natural righty, goes extremely big from the backhand wing, and he hits it deep in the court. Also, while Draper's forehand is the attackable side of the court, it's hardly a weakness. That's the shot that won him the BNP Paribas Open. He hits it with a lot of spin, pushing opponents all around the court and getting them far away from the baseline so that he can find angles or hit drop shots to win points.Draper is also a better server than Ruud by a pretty wide margin, and his returning has been remarkable all season long. That said, Draper is going to be a nightmare for Ruud to play against.The only thing I'm a little nervous about is Draper holding up physically. Musetti was moving him side to side in their semifinal, and I would have liked the Italian's chances of outlasting the Brit if that went to a decider. Ruud will likely try and do his best to deploy a similar strategy. Draper's conditioning really hasn't been an issue in 2025.

Antonelli gives verdict on first corner move from Piastri as he reflects on Verstappen pit lane incident during tough Miami Sprint

Lando Norris emerged as the winner in a dramatic Sprint at the Miami Grand Prix, with the Briton making a perfectly timed pit stop during a late Safety Car period to hold the lead to the end ahead of McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri.

Heavy rain had fallen at the Miami International Autodrome prior to the event getting underway, with the conditions catching out Charles Leclerc who crashed en route to the grid, putting him out of the running before the Sprint had started. And with visibility proving challenging when the formation lap began, the red flags were subsequently thrown.

When the Sprint eventually got underway in improved conditions, polesitter Kimi Antonelli lost out at the start to Piastri, the McLaren man holding the inside line at Turn 1 to move ahead while Antonelli suffered a wide moment and slipped down to fourth.

And while Piastri held a steady lead for several laps – amid various drivers pitting for slick tyres in the changing conditions – a chaotic sequence of events later in proceedings saw Norris become the new leader after Piastri pitted, a position the Briton held onto as he made his own stop just as the Safety Car was called following a crash for Fernando Alonso.

With Norris leading home Piastri for a McLaren 1-2, Lewis Hamilton took third place after pitting early in a solid strategy call from Ferrari, while Williams' Alex Albon was fourth ahead of Mercedes' George Russell, Aston Martin's Lance Stroll, Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson and Haas' Ollie Bearman in the rest of the points-paying positions, though both Lawson and Albon are set to be investigated by the stewards for separate incidents after the Sprint.

Sprint results

Following just one practice session on Friday, Sprint Qualifying took place later in the day to decide the grid for the 100km dash, in which points would be awarded to the top eight finishers from a maximum of eight for P1 down to one for P8.

The closing moments of SQ3 provided a thrilling sequence of events as Antonelli put together a stunning lap to claim his maiden pole position, the 18-year-old becoming F1's youngest-ever polesitter in the process as he held off the McLarens of Piastri and Norris.

Ahead of the Sprint getting underway, one change was confirmed to the grid as Yuki Tsunoda – who ended a challenging Sprint Qualifying in P18 – would start from the pit lane due to the set-up of the suspension on his Red Bull being changed under parc ferme conditions.

But there was further drama to come as torrential rain hit the Miami International Autodrome with the start time approaching – leading to Leclerc suffering a premature exit from the Sprint when he slid into the walls en route to the grid, putting him out of the event before it had even begun.

Given the unpredictable nature of the conditions – with the rain having stopped prior to the 19-lap encounter starting – question marks remained over which tyre the pack would be starting on at the damp track.

And when the tyre blankets were removed ahead of the formation lap – which would take place behind the Safety Car – it was revealed that everybody had bolted on the intermediate tyres, with the exception of Carlos Sainz on the full wets.

2025 Miami GP Sprint: Leclerc crashes out on wet track on his way to the grid

With plenty of spray being kicked up as the formation lap ensued, Antonelli and Piastri reported struggles with visibility in the conditions while replays showed Max Verstappen going wide. The Safety Car remained out on track to lead the field around – before a red flag was thrown, resulting in all 19 cars returning to the pit lane and parking in the fast lane.

After that pause in the action – during which the conditions looked to have improved, while Sainz made the switch from the wets to the intermediate tyres – it was announced that the Sprint would now get underway at 1228 local time. The Safety Car again led the drivers out for another formation lap in preparation for a standing start on the much more raceable track.

As the lights went out for the remaining 15 laps of racing – with the formation laps having added towards the count – Antonelli struggled to launch as well as Piastri, with the pair going into Turn 1 side-by-side before Piastri held the inside line to take the lead while Antonelli went wide, dropping down behind Norris and Verstappen in the process.

The Mercedes driver took to the team radio to suggest that he had been pushed off the track, just as Piastri began to build an early advantage from team mate Norris. Elsewhere Alonso – still looking for his first points of the season – had enjoyed a strong start to move from P10 to P8, with Lawson also making gains in P9 after starting from P14.

“It is drying very quickly,” Piastri reported, having now extended his lead to 1.7s – and while his first corner incident with Antonelli was noted by Race Control, it was then deemed that no investigation was necessary.

Sprint Highlights: 2025 Miami Grand Prix

Another driver potentially under scrutiny, though, was Verstappen, having been noted for a false start for being out of position – before this also was dismissed as requiring no further action. As Lap 8 ticked down, Piastri was leading from Norris, Verstappen, Antonelli, Russell, Hamilton, Albon and Alonso.

It looked like an intra-team battle could be on the cards at Mercedes, with Russell rapidly closing in on Antonelli in the fight for fourth place. There was also plenty of action a little further back as Albon chased down Hamilton in a scrap for sixth, the Williams driver being followed by Alonso in the process.

By Lap 11, questions were arising over whether anybody would gamble on a switch to the slick tyres – and Tsunoda became the first to make a move, diving into the pits for a set of used mediums to reemerge at the rear of the field.

Hamilton – who had been struggling for grip out on track – became the next to switch to slicks by bolting on the softs, with Stroll and Sainz soon following suit for mediums.

A flurry of action then ensued as Verstappen and Antonelli pitted – only for contact to occur between them as Red Bull released their driver just as the Mercedes man tried to pull into his box, resulting in debris scattering across the pit lane while the Italian was forced to continue on to the pit exit.

There was plenty of action throughout the field during the Sprint

Back on track, Sainz suffered a sudden puncture, forcing him to return to the pits to retire. Piastri, meanwhile, made a stop on Lap 14 for the mediums, leaving Norris out in the lead. It was not all smooth sailing for the Briton, though, who reported debris out on track following Sainz's issues, with replays showing that the Williams driver spun and clipped the wall.

Norris subsequently pitted on Lap 15 – just as the Safety Car was called following a heavy crash for Alonso, meaning that last year's Miami Grand Prix winner was able to reemerge as race leader ahead of Piastri, Hamilton, Verstappen – under investigation for that potential unsafe release in the pit lane – Albon, Russell, Stroll and Lawson.

It was soon confirmed that Verstappen had received a 10-second time penalty, while replays showed that Alonso had been tagged by Lawson, which triggered a spin into the barriers, another incident that had been noted by Race Control and would be investigated after the Sprint.

As the Safety Car remained out on track for the final laps, Norris ultimately crossed the line in P1 to take the Sprint victory ahead of Piastri, marking the Briton's first win since his triumph at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.

With that penalty for Verstappen dropping the Dutchman down to the bottom of the order, Hamilton followed the McLaren pair in third, a solid result for the sole Ferrari in the event, while Albon took fourth for Williams, though the Thai driver was noted for a Safety Car infringement that will be looked at later.

Russell was fifth from Stroll, Lawson – another driver set to be investigated post-Sprint for that Alonso collision – and Bearman making up the top eight.

Norris took his first victory since the Australian Grand Prix by winning the Sprint

""My luck in Miami seems pretty good at the minute so I'm happy,"" said Norris. ""The pace was still very good. It's always just difficult, these races, you never know when to box. You box early – it paid off for Lewis and he had a good strategy – or do you stay out later and maybe get the Safety Car? It's worked two years in a row. I would probably prefer if this happened tomorrow rather than today but I'll take it. I'm happy. A good job by the team so it was good fun.""

Following the Sprint, the drivers will next hit the track during Qualifying for the Grand Prix later on Saturday, with the session set to begin at 1600 local time. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

Oscar Piastri lost out on the opportunity to add another win to his season tally as his McLaren team mate Lando Norris benefitted significantly from the timing of a Safety Car during the Sprint in Miami.

The Aussie started the delayed session in P2, just ahead of Norris, and a mighty launch saw him charge through to take the lead at Turn 1 on the opening lap, sending polesitter Kimi Antonelli off the track.

As the surface gradually dried out after an earlier spell of heavy rain, Piastri maintained a steady gap back to Norris, although the two intermittently battled for control of the race.

With McLaren opting to pit Piastri for slick tyres first, the Briton stayed out and later managed to change his tyres just as the Safety Car was called for Fernando Alonso's collision with Liam Lawson.

Crucially, he crossed the pit exit line as the first driver behind the Safety Car, granting him victory as the Sprint ended under these restricted conditions where overtaking is not permitted.

“I feel like I did pretty much everything right there so obviously a bit disappointing to come away with second,” Piastri said. “That's how it goes sometimes, unfortunately racing is a pretty cruel business.

“Hopefully that means I've got a bit of luck for this afternoon and tomorrow. Another great start – I knew I had to get my elbows out on that one so I'm happy with what I did.

“I think we had a little bit of pace on the table yesterday in Sprint Qualifying and hopefully we can use that for Quali this afternoon. I've been enjoying it and I think we've got a quick car underneath us so I'll try and make it even quicker and have a bit of an easier race tomorrow.”

Norris has now claimed victory twice in Miami

Although it demoted Piastri to P2, the late Safety Car helped McLaren to claim a 1-2 finish ahead of a rapid Lewis Hamilton, with the mixed conditions enhancing this season's tight competition.

For Norris, today marked his second win around the Miami International Autodrome as he claimed his first Grand Prix victory here last season, marking the American city as a milestone in his F1 career.

“It's worked two years in a row. I would probably prefer if this happened tomorrow rather than today but I'll take it. I'm happy. A good job by the team so it was good fun.

“[Winning the Grand Prix is] the plan, but it's tricky. There's a lot of quick guys out there. I felt good yesterday to be honest, a couple of little mistakes but I'm ready to go again, so excited.”

Marvel's star-studded ensemble pic led by Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan is winning over critics and audiences alike as it kicks off the summer box office season.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Marvel's Thunderbolts* is storming to a promising domestic opening in the $73 million to $77 million range after topping Friday's chart with $31.5 million, including $11.5 million in Thursday previews.


	The star-studded movie, led by Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan, is kicking off the summer box office in what's become a tradition for Kevin Feige‘s studio with only a few exceptions. The pic is winning over critics and audiences alike; Thunderbolts* boasts a glowing 95 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, making it the third-highest score for a title in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a tie with Spider-Man: Far From Home and behind Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (98 percent) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (97 percent). It's still early, of course, and scores can change by one or two points as the weekend wears on. And on PostTrak exit polls, audiences are giving it a rave 4.5 out of 5 stars, while it received an A- CinemaScore.

	Heading into the weekend, tracking suggests the movie will open in the $70 million to $73 million range domestically and $160 million to $175 million globally, against a $180 million production budget before marketing. Word of mouth is seeing that number climb higher, although some rivals see it coming in between $72 million and $75 million.


	As a comparison, Marvel's Captain America: Brave New World had an audience RT score of 92 percent when opening to $88.8 million earlier this year. (That film's critics score was a rotten 48 percent, compared to 88 percent for Thunderbolts*.)


	The unexpected spring bloom is currently underway at the box office — led by Ryan Coogler's sleeper sensation Sinners — proves that people want the communal experience of watching a film together. Regarding Sinners, the Warner Bros. hit is enjoying a phenomenal third weekend, even if it falls to second place. The supernatural vampire pic continues to break all the rules and could fall just 26 percent this weekend to $33.7 million for a domestic tally north of $180 million.


Thunderbolts* is a pivotal moment for Marvel as it kicks off a new hoped-for franchise. Directed by Jake Schreier, the film brings together a band of dysfunctional outsiders — and lesser-known comic book characters — who discover their potential to be heroes when working together.

	











	In addition to Pugh (Yelena Belova) and Stan (Bucky Barnes), the movie features Wyatt Russell (John Walker), David Harbour (Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian), Lewis Pullman (Bob), Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost), Olga Kurylenko (Taskmaster) and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (CIA director Valentine Allegra de Fontaine).


	“Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan lead a gratifyingly fresh and soulful Marvel adventure,” The Hollywood Reporter‘s chief film critic David Rooney writes in his review. “While a handful of the characters and the actors playing them have appeared in previous entries, there's a disarming freshness to this first-time assembly, not to mention something even more unexpected: heart. That's due to an appealing ensemble cast and the new blood of a creative team with a distinctive take on the genre.”


	In the film, Louis-Dreyfus' villainous character has positioned a number of MCU loners and rejects to kill each other for her own nefarious reasons. But they instead decide to team up in response to the obvious setup, bringing along newcomer Bob, who suffers from a mental illness that has catastrophic consequences after he's subjected to cruel experimentation.


	Overseas, Thunderbolts* is opening everywhere timed to its release in North America, including in China.


	No other major studio dared open a wide release opposite the Marvel event pic. Elsewhere, Alec Baldwin's controversial-laced Rust finally opened in select theaters while also being available on premium VOD. The Western appears to be bombing — at least in cinemas — with an estimated opening gross of just $25,000 from 115 theaters.

	











	The movie opens four years after Baldwin, who co-wrote and produced the film, accidentally discharged a weapon he thought only had blanks. A live round was in the chamber, and the bullet fatally wounded cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and also hit Souza. What followed was a dramatic, closely reported story that revealed on-set negligence and raised questions about industry practices around gun safety. Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter. Still, his case was dismissed after new evidence came to light that Baldwin's lawyers alleged had been buried by the prosecutors. The film's prop armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was also charged and is serving an 18-month prison sentence.

""We're working on some music on her new album,"" he said.


													By
												

	Mitchell Peters



Anderson .Paak and Mariah Carey are working on new music together.


	During a Friday (May 2) appearance on the social media series Track Star — where guests try to identify mystery songs — the 39-year-old singer-songwriter and producer correctly guessed Carey's “Always Be My Baby,” which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1996.


	“This would be Mariah Carey. The Mariah Carey,” said .Paak, who was wearing a T-shirt featuring Mariah's face. “I remember in like 5th grade, or something, watching the music videos and having a huge crush. We're working on some music on her new album.”


	News of a musical collaboration between .Paak and Carey, 56, comes after the two were seen holding hands after the iHeartRadio Music Awards in March 2025, People reports. .Paak helped the superstar singer onto the stage as she accepted the icon award at the ceremony. 

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“Thank you iHeart for this incredible honor,” Carey said during her speech. “As a kid, I used to listen to my favorite artist on the radio and dream of being on the airwave myself. Now, for those of you who may not know what airwaves are, think of it as the non-Wifi version of streaming, OK?”


	Around the same time, the pair were reportedly also spotted leaving a restaurant together in West Hollywood. Prior to that, .Paak and Carey were seen holding hands following the conclusion of her Christmas tour in December 2024, according to People.


	Carey, recently nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, confirmed in an early April interview with the Associated Press that she's working on a new album, but she did not share additional details. Her most recent studio album, Caution, was released in 2018.


	In celebration of the 20th anniversary of The Emancipation of Mimi, Carey announced a special expanded edition of the album. The upcoming release will include bonus tracks, unreleased remixes and collaborations, instrumentals, a cappella versions, and live recordings. The two-disc vinyl edition is set to drop through Def Jam Records/UMe on May 30.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SATURDAY AM: Refresh for more analysis and chart…Marvel Studios and Disney's Thunderbolts* has a shot at coming in a bit better for the weekend at $73M-$77M. As we told you, Friday was close to $32M, with Disney calling it at $31.5M.


	While we'd expect more and want more from Marvel during the first weekend of summer, when you include Thunderbolts* in with all the other holdovers in the marketplace, there's nothing to complain about with all titles doing an estimated $145M this weekend. This is where originals now live with Marvel post Covid. However, what Thunderbolts* has going for itself are its exits. Audiences gave it a solid A- as compared to the B- they smacked Captain America: Brave New World with, and the Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Hannah John-Kamen and Geraldine Viswanathan-led movie has a great 71% definite recommend on PostTrak. All of that bodes well for this pic holding in the summer to come. You'll remember, there was some cynicism with the bowing of Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3 with a $118.4M opening, and that yielded a -19% ease in its second weekend and a 3x domestic multiple with a near $359M cume.

	











	More upbeat results from Thunderbolts*: 75% told PostTrak they want to see a sequel, while 40% said they went to watch because of the cast and 53% mentioned the big reason why they bought a ticket was because it's a Marvel movie. Diversity demos are 42% Caucasian, 26% Hispanic and Latino, 17% Black and 10% Asian. Men over 25 came in at 45%, women over 25 at 25%, men under 25 at 20% and women under 25 at 10%. This is a very similar turnout in terms of demo ages as Captain America: Brave New World; men under 25 were a little lower at 18%. Also diversity demos on that movie were 36% Caucasian, 26% Hispanic and Latino, 23% Black and 10% Asian.




			Watch on Deadline		







	IMAX and PLF are repping 39% of the weekend with 3D generating separately 11% (Disney has to get moviegoers back in a 3D mindset so they're primed for Avatar: Fire & Ash later this year). Best plays are East, Mountain and West. The AMC Dine-In Disney Springs (Fla.) leads single-location gross at $106K.


Thunderbolts*‘ social media universe stands at 570M according to analytics corp RelishMix, which is not far from Captain America: Brave New World‘s near 600M, but lower than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3‘s 709.7M followers across TikTok, YouTube, X, Instagram and Facebook. Pugh is not only the key cast driver in the run-up, but her well-boosted videos have driven over 23M views. Also on board are Harbour at 9.4M fans and Julia Louis-Dreyfus at 1.8M.

	











	Meanwhile, Warner Bros' Sinners is shaping up for a massive $33M third weekend, -28%. That is, of course, the best third weekend for a horror movie ahead of It‘s $29.7M third weekend. The 70MM Imax screenings which are coming back on May 15 are selling out, sources say. More depth to the box office has Warners' A Minecraft Movie at $13M for the weekend in third.


	Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 is now looking at a second weekend of $9.8M, -60% and a running 10-day of $41.4M.


	Also opening this weekend is Roadside Attractions' pick-up of Cannes title The Surfer starring Nicolas Cage, and it's shaping up for a 3-day around $750K after a $325K Friday at 1,085 theaters. Audiences at 48% on Rotten Tomatoes aren't catching the wave like critics are with an 86% certified fresh critical score. 


	The Alec Baldwin Rust western opened on 115 theaters to a very low estimated $25K or $217 per screen. That's not good — but here's what's going on. This is a theatrical day-and-date movie, so the marketing spend, which is minimal here, is weighted to promoting the movie on digital. Furthermore, whenever a theatrical distributor does a day-and-date PVOD release, contractually with the cable companies and digital OTT services, they have to open the movie in a specified amount of theaters. Falling Forward Films, the distributor of Rust, is a gun-for-hire by the producers. Funds from the pic go back to the family of late DP Halyna Hutchins, who was shot on the set. The better share of the film's revenues lie in PVOD, not theatrical. With PVOD, 80% of the revenue generally goes back to the distributor vs. the 50/50 exhibitor-distributor rental from the domestic box office.


	The Sailesh Kolanu crime thriller follows Arjun Sarkaar, a top Homicide Intervention Team officer from Visakhapatnam, who is sent to Jammu and Kashmir to investigate a series of brutal murders. As he pursues a group of elusive killers, the case tests his skills and mental strength. Best markets are Austin, Dallas, Seattle, Toronto, Atlanta, San Francisco, New York City and Baltimore.


AFTERNOON UPDATE: Marvel Studios and Disney's Thunderbolts* is looking at $32M today, including last night's $11.5M previews, for what's shaping up to be a $70M-$75M opening at 4,330 theaters, which has more or less been par for the course for an MCU original title post Covid. The movie has great reviews and immediate thumbs-up from fans. Clearly by tomorrow night, we'll know if it catches on and enters the Guardians of the Galaxy threshold ($94.3M), but as of this minute, no one is seeing it at that altitude.


	The opening of Thunderbolts* alone will exceed the total amount that all films made a year ago during the first frame of May ($73.9M, per Box Office Mojo). That's because the strikes pushed the release of Marvel's Deadpool & Wolverine to late July; Universal's The Fall Guy didn't excite anyone with a $27.7M start. The top five movies alone have the potential to do $137M in business, making this a solid weekend.

	











	Staying strong is Warner Bros' Sinners with $9M today and a 3-day between $30M-$35M at 3,347 — a terrific hold at -23% to -34% in Weekend 3. By comparison, Jordan Peele's Get Out posted a third weekend of $20.7M in 2017, -27%. Cume by Sunday will be $176.6M-$181.6M.


	Warners had bragging rights for third place as well with Legendary co-production A Minecraft Movie at 3,571 sites doing $3M today — $13M, -43% in its fifth weekend — for a running total of $397.5M.


	Fourth goes to Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 with a Friday of $3M, second weekend of $11.2M, -51%, and a running total of $41.6M, which is 12% behind the 2016 original at the same point in time.


	Sony Screen Gems' Until Dawn at 3,055 locations is in fifth with $1M in its second Friday and a $3M second weekend, -59% for an estimated running total by Sunday of $13.8M.


UPDATE AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Disney's official figure Thunderbolts* last night is $11.5M. More good news for Thunderbolts* this weekend: Out of the gate it has 4 1/2 stars on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak and a great 74% definite recommend. Also, 5 stars with kids under 12 and parents.


	The figure isn't that far from the $12M chalked up by February's Captain America: Brave New World; that preview repped 29% of the Anthony Mackie pic's first Friday, which turned into an $88.8M 3-day. Last night's money for the Pugh, Harbour and Stan-led movie is also under that of Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3 which posted $17.5M in previews for a $48.1M Friday and $118.4M 3-day.


	Warner Bros' Sinners ends its second week with $69M at 3,347 theaters, -11%, and a running cume of $146.6M. Yesterday was $4.8M, -20% from Wednesday. Even with Sinners ceding its premium screens this weekend, it's expected to have a robust hold. It was announced that the Ryan Coogler-directed title will return to nine select IMAX 70MM theaters from May 15-21.


	Disney/20th Century Studios' Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith didn't play on Thursday; however, the re-release's gross through Wednesday is $34.1M. The lifetime cume of the George Lucas Episode III is $414.3M.


	Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 is third for the week with $31.6M at 3,610 screens, after a $1.2M Thursday, -18% from Wednesday. The Ben Affleck Artists Equity sequel is slightly behind the original movie's first week tally of $33.8M.


	Warner Bros' A Minecraft Movie ends its fourth week with $27.2M at 3,841 sites, -49%, and a running cume of $384.5M. Thursday's take was $950K, -7% from Wednesday. 


	Sony Screen Gems' Until Dawn has a first week of $10.5M after a $527K Thursday, -5% from Wednesday. 


EXCLUSIVE: Disney and Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* is off to a very good start with around $11M tonight, we hear from non-Disney sources. Always know that forecast can swing higher or lower by the time late night monies come in Friday AM. Hopefully tonight's previews are an indicator to better days at the summer B.O. and that the current momentum from A Minecraft Movie and Sinners keeps up.


	Marvel had to postpone last year's summer kickoff pic, Deadpool & Wolverine, to late July due to the impact of the strikes. 

	











	Not only does the Pugh and Stan vehicle have a solid start, but it's also winning fans over tonight with a 96% Rotten Tomatoes audience score after its 88% certified fresh rating with critics. That's better than the MCU's Captain America: Brave New World from February (48% critics, 78% audience) which saw an $88.8M 3-day, $100M 4-day over the Valentine's Day/President's Day weekend, which translated to $200.2M stateside and $414.8M global take.

	Tonight's previews are roughly a million under Captain America: Brave New World's $12M, but they're also ahead of 2021's Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings ($8.8M) and Eternals ($9.5M). The weekend projection yesterday for the ragtag superhero movie — which is sort of a sequel to Disney+ series The Falcon and Winter Soldier and Hawkeye, as well as the movie Black Widow — was $70M-$75M stateside at 4,300 sites and $175M on the high end of its global start. Thunderbolts* (not to be confused with Thundercats) has all the premium ticket upcharges in IMAX, Dolby, ScreenX, 4DX, etc.


	We told you in the past week that previews/presales for Thunderbolts* are behind Captain America: Brave New World. However, presales for the Jake Schreier-helmed MCU title continue to be ahead of 2021's Shang Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings ($75.3M) and Eternals ($71.2M opening).


	We'll have more intel on Warner Bros' Sinners‘ third weekend tomorrow; however, some rivals are estimating that the Ryan Coogler-directed, Michael B. Jordan-starring period vampire movie is headed to a 3-day of $35M, which would be a remarkable dip of -23%. Forecasts had Sinners easing -25% to -30% in its third weekend for $32M-$34.2M yesterday.

	As the eponymous unconventional attorney/quasi-detective Elsbeth adapts to a changing dynamic with NYPD officer and friend Kaya following the latter's promotion, so will lead Carrie Preston adjust to a dramedy that will see a little less of co-star-turned-guest-star Carra Patterson.


	Thursday's episode of the CBS police procedural spinoff saw a major turning point for Kaya, who was promoted to join a special task force as an undercover agent in Washington D.C. Season 2's finale, May 8's episode “Ramen Holiday,” will feature a roster of guest stars and a celebratory toast in Kaya's honor.

	Speaking to TVLine about the change, Preston said the cast shocker allows “some wonderful stories” for the show's world, adding that working alongside Patterson has been “such a gift.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“What I love about our show is that we don't get too comfortable in anything, and so we enjoy those moments together [between Elsbeth, Kaya and Wendell Pierce's Captain Wagner] when we have them, and we will continue to enjoy them more when we get them, and we'll probably appreciate them even more because we won't be getting them every day,” she said. “So I think it's an opportunity to really enrich the character and the storylines, to have a fresh new take on what Elsbeth is like when she doesn't have someone like Kaya to lean on. How is she going to walk onto a crime scene without her? What's that going to look like?”


	Preston continued, “They so brilliantly and deftly just took [Kaya] to this place where it became a natural thing for her to be elevated and promoted. And it's just the structure of our show [that] Elsbeth doesn't work with the same detective on every case. And so, we came to this point, as well, story-wise, where Kaya needed to fly and echo, in some ways, what Elsbeth has been doing, which is reinventing herself. And so, we have this wonderful little parallel now between what Kaya is doing and what Elsbeth is continuing to do.”


	As reported by Deadline in an extensive interview with showrunner Jonathan Tolins, the show — already renewed for Season 3 and set to reconvene its writers room in a few weeks — has “no intention of forcing” another character into occupying Kaya's role.


	“We're going to go with the flow and see what happens and try some things. The wonderful thing is that Carrie Preston is wonderful with everybody,” Tolins said, adding, “Kaya is irreplaceable. She's not gone; she's still part of our world. So we're going to see what happens.”

	











	Meanwhile, Patterson shared in a statement, “My character, Kaya Blanke, is embarking on a new adventure as the story continues to unfold, and I am excited to do the same. But we will see Kaya again – fans will find out what she's been up to in her new role as ‘Detective' next season when I come back to guest star and play with Carrie and Wendell.  I am beyond grateful to the cast, crew, and producers, and of course, the fans, for all the love and support.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Hugh Hefner's Widow, Crystal Hefner, Gets Engaged","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/crystal-hefner-engaged-wedding-details-revealed/","Sat, 03 May 2025 15:52:32 GMT","

Wedding bells are ringing for Hugh Hefner‘s widow, Crystal Hefner! The former Playboy model is now engaged to James Ward after a year of dating.

Ward— the owner of the tour company SeeThrough Sea— got down on one knee on Friday, April 25, 2025, at Hefner's Hawaii home. Us Weekly reported that Ward popped the big question “with a six-carat, vintage mine-cut diamond set on a whisper-thin band.”

Speaking with the outlet, Hefner gushed about the unforgettable day and the thoughtful effort Ward put into making it perfect. She described the proposal as a full-circle moment, sharing that her now-fiance turned the already special place into something “permanent and symbolic.” Hefner added:

I thought we were just going for a walk, but when I saw the flowers, the handwritten notes, and the sea stretching endlessly in front of us, I knew something extraordinary was about to happen.

A post shared by Crystal Harris (@crystalhefner)

Ward proposed to Hefner shortly after they returned to the country from a month-long first-anniversary vacation in Africa. The soon-to-be bride admitted she “didn't suspect a thing” before the big moment.

The whole time we were [on a vacation] in Africa, I thought we were having a peaceful, unplugged adventure — but behind the scenes, he was coordinating this incredibly elaborate and meaningful proposal back home. I'm still amazed he pulled it off so seamlessly.

Despite the seemingly smooth proposal, Ward revealed just how challenging it was to keep it a secret from Hefner. In an interview with PEOPLE, he said his now fiancée “doesn't miss a thing,” making it especially tough to avoid oversharing. But with “a lot of help from a whole host of people,” the future groom managed to pull it off.

A post shared by Crystal Harris (@crystalhefner)

Meanwhile, Us Weekly reported that Hefner and Ward plan to “enjoy being engaged for a while.” The couple did discuss a potential timeline, though, eyeing to tie the knot in 2026.

Hefner also told PEOPLE that they're considering a tropical wedding somewhere that is “warm and familiar.” They also want it to be intimate. Hefner added:

We love somewhere warm and familiar to us, Hawaii and the Cook Islands would be perfect options. We've had the best time in the past in the Cook Islands, so that's at the top of our list. We want to be close to nature, close to the ocean, and just have things be simple and beautiful.

Crystal Hefner was previously married to the late Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. The couple got engaged in December 2010, but briefly called it off in June 2011. Later, they rekindled their relationship and tied the knot in December 2012. They remained married until Hugh's passing in 2017.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","'When Calls the Heart' Cast & Crew Mourn Beloved Colleague's Sudden Passing: 'We Loved You'","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/when-calls-the-heart-nathaniel-pelletier/","Sat, 03 May 2025 18:46:12 GMT","

For the second time in a year, the cast and crew of Hallmark Channel's hit series “When Calls The Heart” have lost one of their own. 

On May 2, 2025, WCTH production manager Mike Magnusson announced via social media that the show was mourning the death of Nathaniel “Nate” Pelletier, a beloved member of the show's transportation department. Pelletier cared for and drove the set's old-fashioned wagons and vehicles, and appeared on multiple episodes of the show as a taxi driver, per IMDb. 

Sharing a photo of the program from Pelletier's May 2 memorial service, Magnusson wrote, “We lost a member of our WCTH family, Nate Pelletier … Nate was all heart, a true ‘Unicorn,' smashing every 14 hour day with a wide smile & endless cheer for all. He ‘saw' people, and was always there with a kind word. He leaves a void of spirit we will not be able to replace. Nate you were one of a kind, and we loved you. You will be sorely missed my friend.” 

Pelletier died suddenly on April 11 at age 53, per his obituary, leaving the WCTH cast and crew in mourning for the second time in a year. In July, lost longtime director Neill Fearnley died after a long battle with ALS. 

A post shared by Mike Magnusson (@magnusson1343)

Multiple cast members left comments on Magnusson's post, including Johannah Newmarch, who plays Molly Sullivan on the series.

“Thank you for your bright and kind spirit dearest Nate,” she wrote. “I so enjoyed our warm friendship and your loss is devastating to our WCTH family. Holding you tenderly in my heart and praying you journey in light and love. ✨🙏❤️”

Andrea Brooks, who plays Dr. Faith Carter, left a brokenhearted emoji and Natasha Burnett, who plays Minnie Canfield, commented with two emoji — “😢😢”

According to Pelletier's obituary, he died “alone at home in Langley BC” and is survived by his “greatest love,” daughter Myhrsades (Murray) Jones as well as his brothers and parents. 

“His second greatest love was his work and work-family,” Pelletier's obituary read, noting that he “touched many lives with his generosity and extraordinary work ethic.” 

A post shared by When Calls The Heart (@wcth_tv)

On May 3, Hallmark's WCTH Instagram account paid tribute to Pelletier with a photo taken by Krista Petrie, one of many Hearties who got to know Pelletier during visits to the set of “When Calls The Heart” in Langley. He was a frequent presence at the annual Hearties Family Reunion, held for fans each summer. 

In addition to sharing Magnusson's words about Pelletier, the post said, “We know many #Hearties also had the privilege of meeting Nate at the Hearties Family Reunion (HRH). He loved interacting with the fans and he brought so much joy to the day. We'd love for you to share your memories in the comments below. ❤️ We're sending love to all who knew and loved him. He will be missed greatly.” 

Within hours, many fans had already left notes of sympathy and memories of Pelletier, including one who wrote, “When I introduced myself to him at #HFR2024 he greeted me like a long lost friend which I thought was so special. You could tell immediately how much he loved this time to connect with  #Hearties and share his passion with all of us. He will be missed.” 

Another shared, “So sorry to hear about your loss. When you lose a person like Nate, it puts a hole in your heart that remains for a long time. My prayers are with all of you! 🙏🏻”

“So sorry to hear this news,” another fan wrote on Magnusson's post. “He was such an integral part of the WCTH family and I loved seeing him embrace the Hearties these past years. He brought so much joy to the fans. ❤️ Thinking of you all and sending love.”

Pelletier's family asked that in lieu of sending flowers, donations be made to Joshua's House in his honor.

Donald Trump, who was raised Presbyterian and does not attend church regularly, would apparently like to crown himself the next pope. 


	Late Friday, the president posted an AI image of himself sitting on a gold throne wearing the traditional attire including a white cassock and a cross necklace. He has a serious expression and is holding up a finger. The White House shared Trump's AI portrait on social media as well. 

A post shared by The White House (@whitehouse)


	“I'd like to be pope. That would be my number one choice,” Trump told reporters following Pope Francis' death, when asked who should replace him. Trump added that he actually had no preference, but that Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, who is not on the list the Vatican is considering for the next pope, is “very good.” 


	On Thursday, Trump named Dolan to serve on his new Religious Liberty Commission. “We're bringing religion back to our country, and it's a big deal,” Trump said, who last year endorsed his very own version of the bible. Devotees can purchase a “God Bless the USA Bible” with Trump's signature for $1,000. Trump considers himself non-denominational. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Trump's play for the Vatican all seems to be tongue in cheek, although some MAGA faithful are taking it as a moment to suck up to Trump. 


	“I was excited to hear that President Trump is open to the idea of being the next Pope,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) posted on X. “This would truly be a dark horse candidate, but I would ask the papal conclave and Catholic faithful to keep an open mind about this possibility!”


	“The first Pope-U.S. President combination has many upsides. Watching for white smoke…. Trump MMXXVIII!” added Graham, who is Southern Baptist.


	Perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump's antics have drawn criticism. An Italian newspaper slammed Trump's AI image as an expression of his “pathological megalomania.” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said on X that the post, made during the period of mourning, “affirms how unserious and incapable he is. At 78 he remains a 10yo child, emotionally scarred and broken while desperate to prove he could be somebody. His problem: he can't grow up to prove it.”

	Republicans Against Trump called the image a “direct insult to Catholics around the world.”


According to Reuters, Matteo Bruni, a Vatican spokesman, declined to comment on the image during a press briefing. 


	Pope Francis died on Easter Monday shortly after meeting with Vice President J.D. Vance, an adult convert to Catholicism. The first Latin American pope used his Easter blessing to call for mercy for migrants. He had often made statements that appeared to be criticisms of Vance and the Trump administration. In 2016, Francis said that anyone who supports building walls is “not Christian” during a visit to Mexico near the U.S. border. 


	Trump stood out for wearing a blue suit to Pope Francis' funeral. 


	This is not the first time Trump used AI to boost his image on social media. For example, last August, he posted AI images of Taylor Swift fans endorsing him, including one marked “satire.” “I accept!” he wrote on Truth Social. In February, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich shared an AI image of Trump as a king with Manhattan in the background.

	After the protests were broken up in Saraçhane, a historic square in Istanbul, Professor Aslı Tunç descended into the metro, thinking she'd left the street noise behind. On the platform, a man stood quietly behind a food cart near the stairs. Then, from a small speaker beside him, the lyrics started to play:


	“Padişahı yine deviremedik, abi/Kuzular çok cahil/Kurtlar şeytani.” (“We still couldn't overthrow the sultan, man/The lambs are too ignorant/The wolves are demonic.”)


	“I was on the platform,” she recalls, “and suddenly, ‘Kufi' started playing from someone's speaker. The lyrics filled the station. It gave me goosebumps. I thought, ‘This is the song of this protest.'”


	What she heard in late March wasn't a chant or a manifesto. It was a song layered with repetition and absurdity, playing from a vendor's speaker beneath the streets of Istanbul. But that's exactly how modern protest sounds in Turkey, where humor and art are some of the only ways to cope with the socio-political environment. 

	











	After Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu was detained on March 19 and formally arrested four days later, a wave of protests shook the country. İmamoğlu had previously been convicted of insulting public officials in a 2019 speech, and prosecutors have since accused him of corruption and organized crime in connection with municipal contacts. These allegations are still under investigation and remain opaque to the public. The timing of his arrest — coinciding with his expected presidential candidacy announcement on the same day — has led many to view this as a politically motivated blow to Turkey's leading democratic opposition party, the CHP.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In response, the public took matters into their own hands, speaking up in the streets and online. Lyrics like “Elleri havada, kufi kafada” (“Hands in the air, kufi on the mind”) were blasted from speakers.


	“Kufi,” the first song that Turkish rock band Duman has released in over a decade, became the unexpected soundtrack of a politically charged movement. More than just a rock song, it's an anthem chanted in protests, blasted from subway speakers, and shared online by millions. The song has been streamed on Spotify more than 62 million times, drawn more than 50 million views for its two lyric videos on YouTube, and featured in more than 43,000 TikToks and Instagram reels collectively.

	“Kufi” wasn't the only unexpected voice to rise during the protests: One of the most recognizable figures to emerge was Pikachu. Videos of 21-year-old sports enthusiast Hasan Taşkan, dressed as the iconic Pokémon character, appeared in protest coverage across social media. He didn't carry a sign, chant, or sing. Instead, he moved through the crowd in his bright yellow suit, sometimes running, at times jumping, and usually just weaving quietly between protesters.


	“I didn't really do it for a specific purpose or to even protest,” Taşkan says. “There was a lot of tension in the atmosphere. I chose the Pikachu character to lighten things up, to add some color. It was a costume I used to wear to entertain little kids.”


	He hadn't expected to become a symbol. But when videos of him began circulating online, people responded. “Thousands of people said, ‘You made us smile.' That made me really happy,” he says. Soon, people began showing up in copycat Pikachu costumes — like the one pictured at the top of this story — turning his gesture into an unexpected trend at the protests. 


	Others, he notes, were less generous. “There were people who misunderstood me, or just wanted to criticize.” Taşkan is careful to clarify that his intent was never political: “I love my country, my nation, and my police.”

	While Taşkan's costume caught the eye with its surreal charm, others engaged with the protests in more personal and reflective ways. B.G., a Turkish student at Columbia University in New York, was visiting Istanbul and Ankara, the capital, when the protests began. She witnessed protests unfold in both cities. “People were marching in huge crowds, chanting,” she says. “The tension in the air was something I'd never experienced before.” (B.G. requested anonymity in this story out of concern for the potential consequences of speaking openly.)


	As the protests spread, she notes, so did the song: “‘Kufi' had actually dropped on Dec. 13, 2024, but it really gained traction once the demonstrations began.”


	A fixture in Turkey's alternative rock scene since the late Nineties, Duman rose to fame with grunge-influenced albums that blend poetic melancholy with protest undertones. The band had drawn attention in past political moments as well. During the 2013 Gezi Park protests — demonstrations over civil rights and public space sparked by an environmental sit-in in Istanbul — their song “Eyvallah” became one of the era's defining anthems. While Duman declined to participate in an interview for this story, the band has indicated that they believe their music expresses everything they want to say clearly and completely. 

	











	For B.G., seeing artists express support, even if indirectly, feels significant. “It's nice to see that a musician isn't afraid to be associated with protests. Some are afraid, and others who post without fear end up losing their jobs,” she says. “To see participation in this way, even through music, means something.”


	Though “Kufi” doesn't make an overt political statement, its message has resonated. “It's like a code, a form of symbolism,” she adds. “It became popular for that reason too. And even though some parts of the lyrics have been criticized, that symbolism stuck.” (Some listeners have found the lyrics “too surreal”, suggesting its cryptic tone left too much open to interpretation.)


	She recalls seeing a TikTok video where Duman's lead singer joked during a concert: “‘People keep asking me, when are they going to throw you in jail?' And he laughed. It's strange, we don't know whether to laugh or cry anymore.”


	For B.G., music has become a stand-in for other forms of protest. “Gathering around a song gives people a sense of belonging, it strengthens unity,” she says. “The fact that you can still criticize, at least in some form, reminds us that space for expression still exists. Even if it's slippery ground.”


	That same tension between visibility and risk is something Aslı Tunç has spent her career analyzing. A professor at Istanbul Bilgi University, Tunç specializes in media, protest culture, and freedom of expression. She sees this moment not just as protest, but as a cultural turning point — one likely to leave a lasting mark. “Every moment of resistance finds its soundtrack,” she says, pointing to examples like Italy's “Bella Ciao,” a folk song that became an anti-fascist anthem during World War II. “‘Kufi' is becoming one of those songs,” she adds. “You can't erase it now. Every time we hear it, we'll remember these days.”


	She sees Duman's reappearance in recent months after more than a decade of silence as intentional. “They've always carried a quiet protest energy,” Tunç says. “Now they're back with lyrics that are direct, absurd, ironic, and for this moment, brave.”

	What started as a cryptic lyric – “Hands in the air, kufi on the mind” – became something more. Not a slogan. Not a headline. Just a few words that found their way into playlists, protest chants, school yards, and social media platforms. Sung not because it was safe, but because it put into lyrics what could not have been spoken in speeches. And for many, that was everything. 

	











	For Tunç, it's the rhythm and repetition that make the song stick. “It captures that mechanical, urban loop, the sameness of political life here,” she says. “And then turns it into resistance.”

Fans Cannot Get Enough After Supernatural's Star Finally Shares First Look At His New Countdown Series","https://www.cinemablend.com/streaming-news/jensen-ackles-fans-cannot-get-enough-after-supernatural-star-finally-shares-first-look-countdown-series","Sat, 03 May 2025 18:07:45 GMT","

We always want more Jensen Ackles. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Jensen Ackles has been as busy as ever lately. The Supernatural alum not only stopped by the second season of CBS' Tracker to reprise his role as Colter's brother Russell, but he's also been filming the fifth and final season of The Boys, where he's reuniting with Supernatural co-stars Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins. Now, on top of all that, he's leading a new series, Countdown, that will be making its way to Amazon Prime and the 2025 TV schedule soon, and after a first look was revealed, fans can't get enough.

Countdown got some big news earlier this week, as Amazon announced that the series will be premiering on June 25. This project will also star Eric Dane, Jessica Camacho, Violett Beane, Uli Latukefu, and Elliot Knight, and it was created by Chicago Fire creator Derek Haas, so you know it's going to be good. Now, Prime Video has shared some first look photos on Instagram, and boy, am I excited:

A post shared by Prime Video (@primevideo)

A photo posted by on 

Ackles has been posting photos from the set of Countdown and even shared a lovely post after filming wrapped, but getting official stills from the series and the premiere date really solidified my excitement for this project. It also doesn't hurt that Ackles is looking pretty good in the images, as he usually does.

Many fans took to the comments of Amazon's post to share their thoughts on the actor's new show too, and some even threw in some great SPN references:

Amazon Prime Video: 30-day free trialAmazon Prime is a great service, and it includes a wonderful streaming platform. With it, you can watch shows like Fallout and The Boys. You can also try it out for a month for free before paying $14.99 per month for a subscription. 

It's still hard to believe that, come November, it will be five years since Jensen Ackles' Dean Winchester met a tragic fate in the Supernatural series finale. However, his current characters are alive and well, and knowing that we will soon be introduced to a new one is a great feeling. Of course, fans are over the moon with the fact that the actor will be coming back to television for a new leading role, and many of them will probably be watching just for him, and I can't say I blame them.

Although I have to say, I'm interested in this show for the plot too. Countdown's story kicks off when a Department of Homeland Security officer is murdered in broad daylight. Ackles' LAPD Detective Mark Meachum joins undercover agents from all other branches of law enforcement on a task force to investigate. Fans have seen Ackles in a law enforcement role before, as he portrayed Sheriff Beau Arlen on ABC's Big Sky. However, this feels different, and I can't wait to see this striking mystery play out.

Fans won't have to wait too long to see Jensen Ackles in action as Detective Mark Meachum. Countdown premieres its first three episodes on June 25 for those with an Amazon Prime subscription. New episodes will then premiere weekly. Between the intriguing storyline and the A-list cast that Ackles is part of, Countdown will be a series fans won't want to miss out on.

The CIA has a message for Chinese government officials worried about their place in Chinese President Xi Jinping's (習近平) government: Come work with us.

The agency released two Mandarin-language videos on social media on Thursday inviting disgruntled officials to contact the CIA. The recruitment videos posted on YouTube and X racked up more than 5 million views combined in their first day.

The outreach comes as CIA Director John Ratcliffe has vowed to boost the agency's use of intelligence from human sources and its focus on China, which has recently targeted US officials with its own espionage operations.

The videos are “aimed at recruiting Chinese officials to steal secrets,” Ratcliffe said.

“China is intent on dominating the world economically, militarily, and technologically,” he said. “Our agency must continue responding to this threat with urgency, creativity and grit, and these videos are just one of the ways we are doing this.”

The more than two-minute-long videos are of cinematic quality and feature scenes of Chinese Communist Party insiders, luxury automobiles and glittering skyscrapers, as narrators share their growing disillusionment with the system they have served.

In one video, a man described as an honest party member speaks of his unease about the power struggles among his peers, and what it might mean for his family's safety. As the pace of the music picks up, he says: “I've done nothing wrong, I can't go on living in fear!”

The man is then seen using his smartphone to contact the CIA, and the video ends with the agency's seal.

Links below the video offer instructions on contacting the agency securely, along with a warning cautioning potential informants about fake accounts that might impersonate the CIA.

The videos are the agency's latest attempt to make it easier and safer for potential informants to share information.

Last year, the CIA posted online instructions in Korean, Mandarin and Farsi detailing steps that potential informants can take to contact US intelligence officials without putting themselves in danger. The instructions include ways to reach the CIA on its Web site or on the darknet, a part of the Internet that can only be accessed using special tools designed to hide the user's identity. The CIA posted similar instructions in Russian three years ago.

A spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment about the videos.

Outgoing Chancellor Scholz cautioned against any rushed decisions after Germany's intelligence service designated the AfD party as ""right-wing extremist.""

These updates have been closed. Thank you for reading.

Below you find a roundup of news from Germany on Friday, May 2.

Antje von Ungern-Sternberg, a professor of constitutional law at Trier University, spoke to DW about the renewed discussions about banning the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

She said she supportsbanning the party and explained that Germany has a concept of ""militant democracy.""

""Due to our history, we want to defend our democracy against its opponents and enemies and, therefore, in the last resort, we have the instrument of a party ban,"" von Ungern-Sternberg said.

As for how the AfD can be considered in violation of the German constitution, the professor said most arguments focus on the party's approach to human dignity for all people.

She said denying equality to people with a migratory background or who have a different religion ""amounts to denying them human dignity."" 

The professor also said that ""the party and many of its adherents openly work against democratic institutions and delegitimizes them by saying they don't work properly.""

She acknowledged that considerable support for the AfD comes from people feeling left behind.

""Of course, all the political parties have to work together to try to help solve problems so that this feeling of being left behind and other serious issues are also solved politically,"" von Ungern-Sternberg told DW.

Germany's Foreign Ministry defended the decision to label the far-right AfD party as a right-wing extremist group after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the move ""tyranny in disguise.""

""This is democracy. This decision is the result of a thorough & independent investigation to protect our Constitution & the rule of law,"" the ministry wrote in a reply to Rubio on X. ""It is independent courts that will have the final say. We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.""

Germany's spy agency has designated the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) ""extremist.""

The party has slammed the label as ""nonsense"" and has vowed to mount a legal challenge. AfD lawmaker Beatrix von Storch vowed to escalate the move ""into an international issue.""

At least three people have been injured after a car drove into a crowd of people in the southern German city of Stuttgart.

Police said they had deployed a large number of officers to the scene and the driver had already been arrested.

It was not immediately clear if the incident was intentional or how it had happened. Germany has experienced a number of car ramming incidents in the past couple of years.

You can read the full story here.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has criticized the branding of the far-right AfD party as right-wing extremist by Germany's intelligence agency.

""Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition,"" Rubio said on X. ""That's not democracy — it's tyranny in disguise.""

The Trump administration has appeared favorable to the far-right party, with Trump ally Elon Musk hosting AfD co-leader Alice Weidel for an online talk just before Germany's February election.

""What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD — which took second in the recent election — but rather the establishment's deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes,"" the US top diplomat added.

While high-level diplomats have often refrained from commenting on the internal politics of other countries, especially allies, this has not been the case under the Trump administration.

Rubio went on to suggest that ""Germany should reverse course.""

Responding to the AfD being confirmed as an extremist entity by the county's domestic intelligence agency, a major union of journalists urged media outlets to tweak their coverage of Germany's top opposition party,

The AfD ""is not a normal party in a democratic spectrum,"" according to the head of the German Journalists' Association (DJV) Mika Beuster.

""We journalists have to underline the party's nationalist, racists and far-right aspirations more clearly,"" Beuster said, adding that journalists need to report on the AfD ""objectively and critically.""

""The AfD provides simple answers to complex problems, which initially appeals to many people. However, the side effect is a slow poisoning of the democratic discourse. This should be highlighted in all reporting on the AfD,"" he added.

The AfD has often complained ofbeing treated unfairly compared to other, more established German parties.

With Germany's new government due to take office in days, the leader of Olaf Scholz's center-left SPD party called for a joint decision on dealing with the AfD, including a possible ban.

""The AfD is an attack on Germany,"" Lars Klingbeil, a co-chief of the SPD and incoming finance minister, told Germany's Bild tabloid.

""They want a different country, they want to destroy our democracy. And we must take that very seriously.""

He also said elected politicians have a responsibility to decide how to protect democracy from its enemies.

""And we have to very quickly make decisions in the new government, the [new ruling] coalition, about what comes next,"" Klingbeil added.

While banning AfD could be seen as an option, Klingbeil also said that thorough consideration was needed before taking any dramatic steps.

Earlier today, outgoing Chancellor Scholz also warned any ban on the AfD ""must not be rushed.""

Dmitry Medvedev, who served as Russia's president between 2008 and 2012 and then prime minister under Vladimir Putin until 2020, dismissed the move to label Germany's AfD as an extremist entity.

""Strong words to use against a parliamentary party,"" he wrote on X.

""Apparently, the CDU/CSU, SPD and other German party trivia consider those with higher ratings to be extremists.""

What happens now? That's the question many are asking following the move to designate the AfD as a ""right-wing extremist"" organization.

Several lawmakers from across the political spectrum have been working to get enough support for a ban of the AfD party.

The domestic intelligence agency's decision to classify the AfD as extremist may give that effort new momentum.

DW's politics desk takes a deeper dive into what it takes for a party to be banned in accordance with the constitution and also looks at some of the positives and negatives of such a move. Read more here.

Heidi Reichinnek, the Left Party's top ranking lawmaker in Germany's parliament, pledged to do ""everything"" to bring about the ban on the AfD.

""It must be clear to everyone: A democracy does not survive power sharing with right-wing extremists like the AfD,"" said the 36-year-old head of the Left party faction in the Bundestag.

""Everyone who has campaigned for the normalization of the AfD and continues to do so are reinforcing right-wing extremists and endangering democracy,"" she said.

Upcoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz attempted and failed to pass a controversial law with support from the AfD in January. The move caused nationwide controversy and protests across Germany.

The Alternative for Germany (AfD), previously labeled a ""suspected"" extremist group by Germany's intelligence agency, challenged the designation in court but lost.

After a three-year investigation, the agency in its 1,100-page report now says it has concrete evidence that the AfD's actions threaten Germany's democratic order.

The report highlights the party's use of hateful rhetoric and incitement to undermine democratic institutions.

The agency concludes that the AfD's ethnocentric ideology is incompatible with Germany's constitution, violating the principle of human dignity.

An example includes AfD MP Stephan Brandner, who, in an interview with the extremist blog PI-NEWS, discussed the alleged threat posed by Muslim population growth, describing it as a ""problem"" for Germany despite distancing himself from the term ""birth jihad.""

The report also cites the party's authoritarian rhetoric, which casts doubt on democratic structures and the rule of law.

The AfD is now Germany's largest opposition party, especially in the east, but remains excluded from government due to the other parties' refusal to collaborate with a party with extremist tendencies, a situation known as the ""firewall.""

Friedrich Merz, the incoming chancellor, faced criticism — also from within his own party — for passing a non-binding motion in the Bundestag with AfD support during the election campaign.

Two issues now need to be considered as the latest developments begin to sink in:

Firstly, the AfD has called the move ""politically motivated"" and announced it will challenge its extremist classification in court.

Secondly, legal hurdles to ban a party are very high in Germany because of the country's history, but the agency's move has intensified calls for an AfD ban.

As the world appears to have become increasingly polarized, the gaps between different social groups and entire countries are deepening, observers warn.

It comes amid wars, conflicts, migration, trade, climate, social issues and problems surrounding technological progress which affect the entire world and pay no heed to divisions and gaps.

DW's Hans Pfeifer writes about how the far-right have used issues like migration as a vehicle to sow division. You can read more about that here.

Following the official decision to label the entirety of Germany's AfD as ""extremist,"" the far-right party decried the ""targeted interference"" in the democratic process.

""Today's decision by [the domestic intelligence agency] is a serious blow against German democracy,""  party leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said in a statement.

They pointed out that the current government is due to leave office in four days and pledged to fight ""defamation"" in court.

""And yet, the AfD is being discredited and criminalized as an opposition party shortly before the change of government,"" Weidel and Chrupalla said, adding that attacks on the ""democratic process of opinion building is therefore clearly politically motivated.""

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party achieved its best results ever in the 2025 election. It is set to be the main opposition party, giving a more prominent role to its co-leader Alice Weidel.

DW takes a closer look at the woman who's become the public face of Germany's far right.

Josef Schuster, the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said AfD officials should not be trusted with state power, reacting to the party's labeling as extremist.

""AfD representatives should never reach governmental positions, not even via important positions in parliamentary committees or similar, and they should also never get access to information related to security,"" Schuster said.

Following the parliamentary election in February, the AfD has officially become Germany's strongest opposition party, second only to Friedrich Merz's conservative bloc.

""Who could have imagined that in the year 2025, a confirmed right-wing extremist party will be holding almost a quarter of lawmakers in Germany's parliament?"" Schuster added on Friday.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

Will Intel release a next-generation GPU next year?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Intel's next-generation Xe3 Celestial GPU reportedly enters the pre-silicon validation stage, when the GPU design and architecture are being tested using software models and emulators. The chip giant conducts this testing with OEMs and independent BIOS vendors so that they can catch issues before committing actual silicon. X user Haze spotted this development and saw some details related to Celestial in the LinkedIn profiles of some Intel employees.

One profile listed “Celestial discrete GPU Pcode IP model development” as one of theresponsibilities, detailing it as “Developed pre-silicon HW modeling for power management IP in Intel Xe3 architecture for discrete GPU Celestial team (C/C++)” and “Mapped 13% of boot/reboot signal pathways for functional pcode in Celestial power management IP model (fmodel), migrating those modeled in Ruby from the test environment to C/C++ in the IP model.”

Another person said they “developed low-level system software and device drivers in C++ for Intel's Nova Lake & Xeon6 (Diamond Rapids) CPUs and Celestial discrete GPU.”

It seems that the pre-silicon model already has its firmware and power management ready, allowing Intel's partners to start testing it virtually with their systems. Once every kink has been ironed out and is confirmed to be working as intended, the Xe3 design can proceed to tapeout, the final step before fabrication begins.

Intel Fellow Tom Petersen previously said that the architecture for the Xe3 Celestial had already been completed in December 2024, and its team has now moved on to working on Xe4 Druid. With this development, the GPU seems to be on track according to Intel's GPU roadmap. If it does not encounter any major problems with the design and production of the graphics card, we might see Celestial enter production and be in the hands of gamers in around 12 to 18 months.

However, we don't have any idea what these Celestial GPUs will be, as Intel has recently been pretty tight-lipped around its Arc graphics cards. Even though the B580 and B570 Battlemage GPUs, which use the BMG-G21 chip, launched with overwhelmingly positive feedback, we still haven't heard any news about the arrival of higher-end Battlemage discrete GPUs that use the more powerful BMG-G31 silicon.

After being resoundingly beaten by Coco Gauff at the Madrid Open semifinal, Iga Swiatek and her team are contemplating serious changes.

Gauff ousted the champion with a 6-1, 6-1 victory in just over an hour on Thursday's game. Struggling to get into her usual stride, Swiatek has yet to appear in a final this season and openly admitted to her rough patch in Madrid.

Now, she's tasked with defending her titles in Rome and Roland Garros, but it's rumored she might forgo Wimbledon and the entire grass court season. Carlos Alcaraz, meanwhile, has yet to decide whether he'll play at the Italian Open.

Swiatek herself, reeling from the overwhelming loss where she made 28 unforced errors and took only two games, acknowledged the need for a break. ""For sure, I want to have some days off, especially because I didn't have [any] after Stuttgart. I'll for sure chill, but honestly, the coaches will do the schedule, so I'll see,"" the world No. 2 stated.

Despite speculation about her appearance at the Italian Open to defend her title, Przeglad Sportowy Onet suggests she'll stick out the clay season. Her future plans, though, hinge on the outcomes at both the Italian Open and French Open.



It's claimed the five-time Grand Slam champion may consider skipping the entire grass season, including Wimbledon, if she continues to face disappointing losses. Instead, she might opt for an extended vacation before focusing on the U.S. Open and North American hard-court swing.

Grass is not Swiatek's strongest surface, with the 23-year-old having only 130 ranking points to defend on it. In 2024, she didn't participate in any regular tour events on the grass, only competing at Wimbledon where she made it to the third round.

It has been revealed that Swiatek's grandfather passed away prior to the Madrid Open, leading the world No. 2 to fly home for his funeral. While Swiatek hasn't publicly addressed her loss, her team confirmed the news to Polish media outlets.

Swiatek will be back in action in Rome next week, benefiting from a first-round bye as one of the top seeds, which means she won't have to play her opening match until later in the week.

Swiatek has a successful history at the Foro Italico - she has clinched the tournament three times in five appearances.

The world No. 2 will then head to Paris aiming to secure the French Open title for the fourth consecutive time and the fifth overall. However, if her performance on the clay doesn't go as planned, fans might miss seeing her at the All England Club this year.

Max Verstappen has claimed the pit stop error which cost him points in the Miami Sprint is ""not what you want to see"" as the reigning World Champion lost further ground to McLaren rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

The Dutchman, who became a father for the first time on Thursday, started fourth for the Miami Sprint which began behind the Safety Car before eventually being red-flagged due to the wet weather just before the 100km dash.

After a delay so conditions could improve, the race begin with a standing start with Verstappen gaining a position at the expense of polesitter Kimi Antonelli, who had gone wheel-to-wheel with Piastri at Turn 1 before running wide.

As the two McLarens pulled further away, Verstappen managed the gap behind to Antonelli and the second Mercedes of George Russell before drivers began making pit stops to switch from the quickly wearing intermediate tyres to slicks.

""The race itself was pretty boring, there was not much going on for me,"" said Verstappen afterwards.

""Just doing my own thing, seeing the McLarens disappear and just keeping the gap to the cars behind.

""I think the call to slicks was good, could have maybe risked it a bit more but in my position at that time, P3 you don't really need to do that in a Sprint.""

Having been called into the pits, there was a moment of drama as Verstappen was released by his Red Bull mechanics straight into the path of Antonelli who was heading into his own pit box.

The Red Bull driver came to a halt momentarily after damaging his front wing before joining on the medium tyre, the combination of which meant he conceded a position on track to the Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton which was fitted with the soft compound.

Despite finishing fourth on-the-road, Verstappen was slapped with a 10-second penalty for the pit lane incident, which Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner described as ""human error and we'll learn from it"".

Verstappen added: ""The pit stop, I mean it was super clear what happened, I don't even really need to explain. It's not what you want to see.""

HIGHLIGHTS: Norris pips Piastri in incident-filled Miami Sprint with help from late Safety Car

Haas driver Ollie Bearman, Williams' Alex Albon, and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson have each received five-second time penalties for a myriad of incidents during the eventful Sprint at the Miami International Autodrome.

After a period of heavy rainfall caused a delayed start, everyone on the grid started on intermediate tyres. However, the surface quickly began to dry out – although there are no mandated pit stops in a Sprint, many of the drivers were forced into the pits to switch onto slick tyres.

As Haas finished changing Bearman's tyres, he was released into the pit lane, directly into the path of Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg. The German then had ""to brake and take evasive action"", as detailed in the Stewards' report of the incident.

The investigation used video evidence to determine that a five-second penalty was a suitable consequence for the unsafe release, dropping Bearman from P8 (where he had claimed the final point of the Sprint) to P14.

It had been an impressive performance from the rookie after an underwhelming Sprint Qualifying saw him settle for P20 on the starting grid. From there, he improved 12 positions around the temporary circuit, but the penalty leaves Haas with zero points so far in Miami as Esteban Ocon similarly finished outside of the top eight.

For Albon, his fourth place finish was taken away due to him failing to stay above the minimum time under Safety Car conditions, demoting him to P11. However, the Stewards noted that ""the track conditions were not ideal and that no unsafe or dangerous situation was created by the driver"", electing not to award him any penalty points.

Lastly, Lawson failed to escape a five-second penalty and an additional penalty point for his collision with Fernando Alonso during an attempted overtake which saw the Aston Martin racer retire from the Sprint.

The trio of decisions promotes Yuki Tsunoda to receive three points for Red Bull Racing, with Max Verstappen failing to score due to a 10-second time penalty given during the Sprint, also for an unsafe release.

Kimi Antonelli, who initially dropped down the order following the pit lane incident with Verstappen, and Alpine's Pierre Gasly were also pushed up into the points.

Behind the unaffected top-three finishers, the final order from the Sprint was George Russell in P4, followed by Lance Stroll, Tsunoda, Antonelli and Gasly.

Lando Norris claimed victory in the Miami Sprint as a late Safety Car allowed him to rejoin from the pits in front of McLaren team mate and early race leader Oscar Piastri, similar to his maiden F1 victory 12 months ago.

Drivers' Championship leader Piastri had led much of the 18-lap race after jumping polesitter Kimi Antonelli at Turn 1 following an earlier red flag due to the treacherous conditions.

Norris had followed his team mate throughout and pitted a lap later as drivers' intermediate tyres wilted on the drying surface, but the Briton rejoined just as a Safety Car was called following a collision between Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson which left the former in the barrier.

At a reduced pace, Piastri was unable to move back ahead of Norris before he rejoined the track as the race finished behind the Safety Car.

Elsewhere there was also a dramatic moment as Max Verstappen collided with Antonelli in the pit lane, with the Red Bull driver picking up a 10-second time penalty due to the unsafe release.
