Antonelli gives verdict on first corner move from Piastri as he reflects on Verstappen pit lane incident during tough Miami Sprint

Lando Norris claimed victory in the Miami Sprint as a late Safety Car allowed him to rejoin from the pits in front of McLaren team mate and early race leader Oscar Piastri, similar to his maiden F1 victory 12 months ago.

Drivers' Championship leader Piastri had led much of the 18-lap race after jumping polesitter Kimi Antonelli at Turn 1 following an earlier red flag due to the treacherous conditions.

Norris had followed his team mate throughout and pitted a lap later as drivers' intermediate tyres wilted on the drying surface, but the Briton rejoined just as a Safety Car was called following a collision between Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson which left the former in the barrier.

At a reduced pace, Piastri was unable to move back ahead of Norris before he rejoined the track as the race finished behind the Safety Car.

Elsewhere there was also a dramatic moment as Max Verstappen collided with Antonelli in the pit lane, with the Red Bull driver picking up a 10-second time penalty due to the unsafe release.

And while Piastri held a steady lead for several laps – amid various drivers pitting for slick tyres in the changing conditions – a chaotic sequence of events later in proceedings saw Norris become the new leader after Piastri pitted, a position the Briton held onto as he made his own stop just as the Safety Car was called following a crash for Fernando Alonso. With Norris leading home Piastri for a McLaren 1-2, Lewis Hamilton took third place after pitting early in a solid strategy call from Ferrari, while Williams' Alex Albon was fourth ahead of Mercedes' George Russell, Aston Martin's Lance Stroll, Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson and Haas' Ollie Bearman in the rest of the points-paying positions, though both Lawson and Albon are set to be investigated by the stewards for separate incidents after the Sprint. Following just one practice session on Friday, Sprint Qualifying took place later in the day to decide the grid for the 100km dash, in which points would be awarded to the top eight finishers from a maximum of eight for P1 down to one for P8. With plenty of spray being kicked up as the formation lap ensued, Antonelli and Piastri reported struggles with visibility in the conditions while replays showed Max Verstappen going wide. The Mercedes driver took to the team radio to suggest that he had been pushed off the track, just as Piastri began to build an early advantage from team mate Norris. Elsewhere Alonso – still looking for his first points of the season – had enjoyed a strong start to move from P10 to P8, with Lawson also making gains in P9 after starting from P14. “It is drying very quickly,” Piastri reported, having now extended his lead to 1.7s – and while his first corner incident with Antonelli was noted by Race Control, it was then deemed that no investigation was necessary. Another driver potentially under scrutiny, though, was Verstappen, having been noted for a false start for being out of position – before this also was dismissed as requiring no further action. As Lap 8 ticked down, Piastri was leading from Norris, Verstappen, Antonelli, Russell, Hamilton, Albon and Alonso. It looked like an intra-team battle could be on the cards at Mercedes, with Russell rapidly closing in on Antonelli in the fight for fourth place. There was also plenty of action a little further back as Albon chased down Hamilton in a scrap for sixth, the Williams driver being followed by Alonso in the process. Hamilton – who had been struggling for grip out on track – became the next to switch to slicks by bolting on the softs, with Stroll and Sainz soon following suit for mediums. A flurry of action then ensued as Verstappen and Antonelli pitted – only for contact to occur between them as Red Bull released their driver just as the Mercedes man tried to pull into his box, resulting in debris scattering across the pit lane while the Italian was forced to continue on to the pit exit. It was not all smooth sailing for the Briton, though, who reported debris out on track following Sainz's issues, with replays showing that the Williams driver spun and clipped the wall. Norris subsequently pitted on Lap 15 – just as the Safety Car was called following a heavy crash for Alonso, meaning that last year's Miami Grand Prix winner was able to reemerge as race leader ahead of Piastri, Hamilton, Verstappen – under investigation for that potential unsafe release in the pit lane – Albon, Russell, Stroll and Lawson. It was soon confirmed that Verstappen had received a 10-second time penalty, while replays showed that Alonso had been tagged by Lawson, which triggered a spin into the barriers, another incident that had been noted by Race Control and would be investigated after the Sprint. Russell was fifth from Stroll, Lawson – another driver set to be investigated post-Sprint for that Alonso collision – and Bearman making up the top eight. "My luck in Miami seems pretty good at the minute so I'm happy," said Norris. It's always just difficult, these races, you never know when to box. You box early – it paid off for Lewis and he had a good strategy – or do you stay out later and maybe get the Safety Car?

Saturday's action in Miami got off to the worst possible start for Charles Leclerc before the Sprint even got underway, as he crashed on his way to the grid amid heavy rain.

The Ferrari driver was heading to his starting spot of P6 for the Sprint when he drifted into the wall, severely damaging his front right tyre, and forcing him out of the 19-lap dash.

Leclerc complained about aquaplaning on the circuit as his team now have an intense repair job ahead of Qualifying for the Grand Prix later today, leaving Lewis Hamilton as their sole driver in the Sprint.

Despite Miami's reputation for warm weather, pouring rain meant that the track was unexpectedly damp ahead of the Sprint in which Kimi Antontelli will start from pole position for the first time in his F1 career.
