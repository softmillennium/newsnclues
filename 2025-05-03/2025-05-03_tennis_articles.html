                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lorenzo Musetti has enjoyed a blistering start to his clay-court season, reaching the semi-finals of both Masters 1000 events. Carrying that momentum through to Madrid, Musetti took down Tomas Martin Etcheverry, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Alex de Minaur, and Gabriel Diallo on his way to the semi-finals. There, Musetti lost to British star Jack Draper, 3-6, 6-7, as his run at the Madrid Open came to an end. Ahead of his return to action at the Italian Open next week, Musetti has been told what he must now do if he wants to compete for Grand Slam titles. A post shared by THE COACH (@patrickmouratoglou) “That's why his matches during Monte-Carlo were up and down all the time, because he was constantly hesitating between I'm going to go, I'm going to take my chance, I have to dictate. “He's lost a lot of first sets during this Open, badly, and then he was sometimes even a break down. “If he manages his will more, his determination to be the one dictating and being defensive only when he has no other option. The Frenchman then shared whether he believes Musetti can compete for Grand Slam titles. “Is Lorenzo Musetti close or far to playing Grand Slam finals?” asked Mouratoglou. “The ball is really super lively when he hits the ball, he can accelerate anytime, and he can accelerate with his backhand and with his forehand. “I think that's why he likes clay the most.” Mouratoglou thinks Musetti has everything to compete at the highest level, should he start to dictate points on a more frequent basis. But how has he performed at the four Major tournaments throughout his ATP career to date? Musetti's run to the last four of Wimbledon in 2024 was his career-best result at a Grand Slam, securing several impressive wins at SW19. He did, however, fail in his bid to reach a maiden Grand Slam final, losing to seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in the semis. It remains to be seen whether Musetti will reach a Major final in 2025, but if he keeps playing as he has done on clay so far this year, it wouldn't come as too much of a surprise to see him make waves in Paris next month. The 2025 French Open is set to begin on Sunday, May 25.</p>

Ruud is also a (literal) student of the Spaniard, and his road to his first final here has been a worthy one as well. He has wins over Taylor Fritz, Daniil Medvedev, and Francisco Cerundolo this week, all in tight two-setters. “But I really seeked help, and it's been working, so I'm happy to feel more joy and feel like I'm in a better place…I'm happy that I was honest with myself and felt like I needed some help, and it's been paying off quite quickly.”Both of these guys have won half of their finals: Ruud is 12 of 24; Draper is three of six. Draper is currently ranked nine spots higher at No. 6, he already has a Masters win this year, in Indian Wells, and Ruud nursed a rib injury through his semifinal with Cerundolo.If he's healthy, though, this will be competitive. They're both content to rally with their topspin two-handed backhands. Ruud's heavy topspin forehand is perfect for most clay courts, but Draper's flatter lefty version may be better for this clay.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All four ATP Tour players who have won ‘big' titles in 2025 (Grand Slams and Masters 1000s) are under the age of 24. 23-year-old Jannik Sinner won the Australian Open in January, picking up his third Major title, with a straight sets win over Alexander Zverev. Shortly after, Jack Draper beat Holger Rune, 6-2, 6-2, to clinch his maiden Masters 1000 title at Indian Wells. Transitioning onto clay courts, Carlos Alcaraz won the Monte-Carlo Masters, as the Spaniard picked up his 18th tour-level title before his 22nd birthday. However, it was a player younger than all three who won at the Miami Open earlier this year, as one top coach now claims he is competing at a level much higher than his ranking would suggest. “[Jakub] Mensik is not top ten yet because he's coming from far, and he's rising fast in the rankings, and it takes time to reach the top ten,” said Mouratoglou. “Don't forget that he won a Masters 1000 in Miami just a few weeks ago, beating Novak [Djokovic] in the final, so his level is much higher than his ranking.” Mouratoglou's thoughts came as part of a wider discussion, reacting to Alexander Bublik's comments about the state of men's tennis during his defeat to Mensik in Madrid. “Remember when tennis was easy, like five years ago, it was so easy to play tennis,” said Bublik to umpire Mohamed Lahyani. “You had a bunch of random people in the top 50, barely moving. Mouratoglou disagreed with Bublik's comments, suggesting that using Mensik as an example of tennis becoming stronger was unfair. “For me, it's more that he was losing; he was emotional in his own way, which is to be funny and say crazy things. “He says the top 50 is so much stronger now than five years ago. He cannot take Mensik as an example. “So he's playing a guy whose ranking is lower than his real level. “I feel like the level is extremely high. Mensik then backed that performance up with a strong run to the last eight in Madrid, where Cerundolo put an end to his nine-match Masters 1000 winning streak. Not only is Mensik on pace to reach the top ten, but he also currently resides in the qualification spots for this year's ATP Finals in Turin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Djokovic's defeat against Alejandro Tabilo in Monte Carlo and his loss against Matteo Arnaldi in his first match at the Madrid Open set alarm bells ringing louder than ever as a player who will toast his 38th birthday this month admitted he may be running out of time to win a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title. “Kind of new reality for me, I have to say,” said Djokovic after the defeat against Arnaldi. “You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament. Now I'm trying to, you know, use this as a driving force for the future. Obviously, Grand Slams, I was saying many times, are the most important tournaments for me. Novak Djokovic backed to ‘turn it on' and win a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title ‘I still don't feel it's enough for me' – Novak Djokovic makes telling motivation comment Djokovic may have been wise to step away from the game for a few weeks, with his motivation to play in regular ATP Tour events waning for some time now. Yet he faced a similar scenario last year and came up with an unexpected solution. While his performances in Monte Carlo and Madrid were not quite as poor as they were this year, Djokovic felt the need to get more matches on clay under his belt before heading to Roland Garros and opted to enter the ATP 250 tournament in Geneva. World No 1 Jannik Sinner has entered Hamburg as he looks to build up match practice following his three-month drug ban, with the prospect of Djokovic not playing any more matches ahead of Roland Garros a gamble he should avoid taking. Grand Slam, I'm not going into Roland Garros as one of the main favourites. Taylor Fritz has also confirmed he will play in Hamburg so Djokovic could face strong opposition if he decides to play one more clay court event before his assault on another Roland Garros title.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff are familiar foes, especially when it comes to the latter stages of tournaments. The pair will meet in an WTA final for just the second time when they face off in for Madrid Open title on Saturday. Gauff was just 19 when she took on Sabalenka, who had already won a major that year at the Australian Open, and many expected her to claim her second. When the first set went to Sabalenka 6-2, many would have been forgiven for thinking the match was already a foregone conclusion. However, what followed was one of the most thrilling comebacks in a major final as Gauff rallied to win the next two sets 6-3, 6-2 as Sabalenka uncharacteristically collapsed and lost all composure in her tennis. That match still haunts the 26-year-old to this day, who admitted that while she has learnt lessons, she still gets flashbacks from it. "That was very difficult match, I got a little emotional and had this little flashback on last year's final, meaning the crowd atmosphere," said after the 2024 US Open final. "I do never cry but the US Open happened. Y'all say what you want, I was not expecting that," she said on Instagram at the time. Not in front of people, I'll cry alone, I'll cry over a movie or a TV show but in front of people, no. "Because I'm supposed to be a thug. I'm like my dad though, for real. Today was the first time I've ever seen my dad cry. Their overall record is 5-4 in the American's advantage, but Gauff will know that records mean nothing in finals. Although what she will take into her clash with Sabalenka is the confidence she got from dismantling Iga Swiatek 6-1, 6-1 in the previous round. 1, so it would be cool to play her in the final and give myself that challenge,” Gauff said in her post-match press conference. The Belarusian's record in Madrid is imperious, winning 22 of her 26 matches on the red dirt with titles coming in 2021 and 2023. In 2024, she lost to Swiatek in the final, but with the Pole out of the tournament, she will have every bit of belief she can pick up her third title in Spain and third title of the year. Gauff is playing in her first final of the year - and first since winning the season-ending WTA Finals - a victory would give her a first title on clay since Rome in 2021. While Sabalenka has been a dominant force all season she has lost three of her five finals this year and has won just 2 of her 19 titles on clay. We may not see any tears between Gauff and Sabalenka but another classic will write another chapter in their storied rivalry.

Born in Acton, London, on November 11, 1934, Pat moved to the Island after meeting her husband Ken Maclean. Together, they had two children, Alistair and Sheena. As recently as 2024, Pat visited Wimbledon with members of Ryde's Mead Lawn Tennis Club, watching a range of elite matches and even bumping into Cliff Richard. Despite rubbing shoulders with tennis stars and celebrities on her frequent trips to Wimbledon, Pat's heart always remained with the Ryde community. After Ken died in 2011, Pat moved to Brigstocke Terrace in Ryde, overlooking Mead Lawn Tennis Club, where she taught many years ago. Presenting the award, mayor of Ryde, Cllr Richard May, said: "Pat Maclean's name is etched into Ryde's sporting history.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It also marks the last major tournament on clay before Roland Garros. Just under a week from the start of play, tournament organizers have announced the impressive prize money totals that will be distributed among standout participants. According to the official ATP Tour website, the total prize pool for the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, held in Rome and featuring both men's and women's singles and doubles draws, will be €8,055,385 (approximately $9.1 million). Prize money scales down for players eliminated in earlier rounds, with first-round exits earning around $23,000. As with all Masters 1000 events, the tournament carries significant prestige and offers a large number of ATP ranking points, which could prove decisive in shaping the standings. Rafael Nadal holds the record for most Rome Open titles (10) 6 Jack Draper opens up on reaching Madrid Open final against Casper Ruud The Rome Masters 1000 is set to run from May 7 to May 18—just a week before Roland Garros begins. The first to officially withdraw from Rome was Novak Djokovic, who announced his decision in late April, shortly after suffering an early elimination in the first round of the Madrid Open against Matteo Arnaldi. But he also made it clear that his ultimate focus lies elsewhere: “My hope is to play in Rome. Rafael Nadal holds the record for most Rome Open titles, winning 10 out of 12 finals played. Behind him is Novak Djokovic with six championships. However, with Nadal now retired and Djokovic sitting out this year's edition, the title race is wide open. One of the leading favorites is World No. Finally, all eyes will be on Jannik Sinner—not only because he's Italian and the current World No. 1, but also because this will be his first tournament back following a three-month doping suspension.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After being resoundingly beaten by Coco Gauff at the Madrid Open semifinal, Iga Swiatek and her team are contemplating serious changes. Gauff ousted the champion with a 6-1, 6-1 victory in just over an hour on Thursday's game. Now, she's tasked with defending her titles in Rome and Roland Garros, but it's rumored she might forgo Wimbledon and the entire grass court season. Carlos Alcaraz, meanwhile, has yet to decide whether he'll play at the Italian Open. Swiatek herself, reeling from the overwhelming loss where she made 28 unforced errors and took only two games, acknowledged the need for a break. Despite speculation about her appearance at the Italian Open to defend her title, Przeglad Sportowy Onet suggests she'll stick out the clay season. It's claimed the five-time Grand Slam champion may consider skipping the entire grass season, including Wimbledon, if she continues to face disappointing losses. Instead, she might opt for an extended vacation before focusing on the U.S. Open and North American hard-court swing. Grass is not Swiatek's strongest surface, with the 23-year-old having only 130 ranking points to defend on it. In 2024, she didn't participate in any regular tour events on the grass, only competing at Wimbledon where she made it to the third round. Don't miss...

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not long ago, the Tennis world was ruled by two gladiators, and the audience was equally balanced on both sides. Despite being the undisputed GOAT in terms of titles won, Novak Djokovic had to wait a long time to get somewhat same love that the other two members of Big 3 received. Also Read | Carlos Alcaraz to take final call on whether to participate in the Italian Open amid injury setback Novak Djokovic's former coach and Wimbledon 2001 winner Goran Ivanisevic made an honest reflection on why the Serbian wasn't thrown the same light which Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal basked in. “One is Swiss, one is Spanish, then comes a guy from Serbia,” said Ivanisevic in an exclusive interview. Because he had his own opinion,” he added, recalling the flak Djokovic received during his Covid vaccination ordeal. But he proved them wrong on the court, and they can't take that from him. Eventually, they had to acknowledge him, because he's the greatest (tennis player of all time).” Djokovic may not become a fan-favorite like Roger and Rafa, but this aspect may not echo in the grander scheme of things. The Serbian has left his footprints on the game to an extent that an eternity may not be enough to erase them.</p>

Gulbis excelled in sports from a young age, competing in basketball and swimming before ultimately focusing on tennis during his teenage years. This decision led him to a career where he faced tennis icons such as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic. Gulbis trained at the prestigious Nikola Pilic Academy in Germany, the same facility where Novak Djokovic honed his craft. However, Gulbis always set himself apart, famously declaring, “When he [Djokovic] started winning titles, his eyes changed”. Early in his career, Gulbis stirred the pot by stating, “Luckily for me, money is not an issue. I don't play for money or fame. My motivation is to prove I can be better than everyone else”. Yet one match stands out—the 2010 Rome Masters semifinal, where Gulbis pushed Nadal to the brink before falling 1-6, 7-5, 6-4. Afterward, Nadal remarked, “If being better means hitting the ball as hard as possible without caring where it lands, then yes, he was better than me”. Gulbis' crowning achievement came at the 2014 French Open, where he stunned Roger Federer in a five-set thriller during the fourth round. It was one of only two victories Gulbis secured against Federer in their five meetings, the other being at the 2010 Rome Masters. Gulbis reached his career-high ranking of world No. 10 in 2014 after a standout performance at Roland Garros, where he made the semifinals. Known for his explosive game and unpredictable results, his talent often shone in individual matches rather than over sustained tournaments. Between 2010 and 2014, Gulbis claimed six ATP titles, all at the 250 level. Injuries and a lack of consistency plagued his later years, though he briefly reemerged in 2018, reaching the Stockholm final before losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas.
