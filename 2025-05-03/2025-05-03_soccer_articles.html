                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Football, or soccer as they call it overseas, is experiencing a golden age in the United States. Today it is the fourth most popular national sport, behind American football, basketball and baseball. Among young people under the age of 18, it is now the second most played sport. Moreover, some 15% of Americans declare themselves fans of a football team (it was less than 4% in the 1990s). And the next two years will be crucial for the growth of football in America. A sport on the rise thanks to long and constant work, often fuelled by the passion of European emigrants and their descendants, who have never abandoned their love for football. "I grew up in a family where football was the only thing that mattered." A passion handed down by his father, to whom the new President has emotional memories of. "If my father were still alive, he would be proud of me. I still remember when Italy lost the World Cup semifinal in 1990. "My mother answered and said 'Are you ok?' I couldn't speak and she put my father on the phone. Today, for Stillitano, football is a job. In '94 I started this adventure and my father was no longer there. An adventure that went beyond being a fan. Today he would be happy to see me here". In the 1970s, when football in the United States was taking its first steps, Stillitano had an encounter he would never forget. After an exhibition match between Santos and Lazio, the legendary Pele wanted to give him his jersey, but Charlie decisively refused: "I don't want it, he broke my heart," he said that day, recalling Italy's defeat at the hands of Brazil in the 1970 World Cup. Years later, destiny still wanted him at Pele's side as a friend. "You are the only one who ever refused my jersey," Pele said, smiling. "But you wouldn't have respected that child if he was false," was the reply. Days later, Pele, without saying anything, delivered him a frame with his autographed Brazilian national team jersey inside. Anecdotes and memories that make Stillitano's presence in Italian football and in Serie B even more special. A decision that came thanks to 'Charlie's many years of international experience in the world of football.' I told him 'There are really reliable people here. "So Tom, like me, saw it as a great opportunity. They have done a great job both football-wise and financially," says the new president. "All we want to do is help. We don't want to create confusion or stir things up. "Our project will only work if we manage to get into Serie A. If we don't get there this year, it's not the end of the world. Roberts' decision to invest in Italian football was dictated not only by his passion for football, but also by the certainty of being able to count on the experience and contacts of a manager like Stillitano. "Tom was very clear when he agreed to throw himself into this adventure. He told me 'I don't need you for the money. I don't need you for the actual operational management, but I do need you for your football expertise. To myself I thought 'It would really be a waste. I have already contacted many people, but I don't want to say who yet,' he adds with a half smile. And among the big names in world football who have congratulated Stillitano on his new role, in addition Del Piero, Pirlo and Maldini, are icons such as the very powerful prosecutor Jorge Mendes, Real Madrid CEO José Ángel Sánchez and people of the calibre of Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Sir Alex Ferguson. "I was certainly moved by the messages from Sanchez and Ferguson," Stillitano continues. Stillitano certainly doesn't hide his ambition. "Yes, you can dream big, but keep your feet on the ground. I think that if we look at everything through Tom's eyes as an investor, there are many opportunities on the business side. But first of all, what we dream of is to become a stable Serie A team." "The long-term goal is to become a stable Serie A team, like Udinese, Torino or Verona, but the ultimate dream is to be like Atalanta," Stillitano reveals. For Stillitano, who has always been used to moving between passions and international projects, Spezia can become much more than just a stage. "It is curious," he smiles in conclusion. "I was born into a family of Calabrian origins, from Gioia Tauro, the largest port in the Mediterranean. I grew up in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the main port hub of the American Northeast. And now here I am, in another seaside town. "A new voyage, to another port city: one of those places from which one departs, returns, but above all builds."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kevin De Bruyne admitted that his participation at the Club World Cup is unclear, with the Manchester City captain's contract set to expire mid-tournament. New director of football Hugo Viana is looking at tying up moves for Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz and Morgan Gibbs-White at Nottingham Forest in the midfield area over the summer. ‘I don't know [about the Club World Cup],' De Bruyne told TNT Sports Mexico. ‘For me, it will depend on whatever happens in the future, depending on what team I'll go and what competition I'll play. ‘And also if the new team doesn't want me to play, doesn't want to risk whatever happens.' De Bruyne's contract takes in three group matches – against Wydad, Al Ain and Juventus - up until the start of July but doesn't cover the knockout stages. ‘If they want to have a conversation, we can. De Bruyne has consistently told of his sadness at leaving the Etihad Stadium since announcing the news last month and his team-mates believe their talisman can still do a job at the highest level. Jeremy Doku, who assisted De Bruyne's goal on Friday night and who features with him at international level, said: ‘Obviously it's very sad and I do think he still has the qualities to play here and he showed it again. ‘It's a pity he's going to leave us but I still play with him in the national team so I can still get to enjoy that. ‘To see player of his calibre leave is sad and I can understand them. I just enjoy every moment I play with him and would say the supporters have to do the same.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Craig Burley isn't convinced by Casemiro's resurgence following the Brazilian's performance in Man United's 3-0 win over Athletic Club in the Europa League semifinal. Manchester United are making a move to sign Jonathan Tah from Bayer Leverkusen just when Barcelona thought a deal was done, while Real Madrid are exploring a move to sign Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold before his contract expires. - Mascherano: Inter Miami 'clearly Messi-dependent' - Sources: Brazil give Ancelotti May 26 deadline - Source: City eye possible Ederson replacements It's opened the door for Man United to make a move, and they have held initial discussions, though their chances of success may rest on winning the Europa League and qualifying for next season's Champions League. - Real Madrid are hopeful of signing Liverpool right back Trent Alexander-Arnold in time for the FIFA Club World Cup, according to Diario AS. The 26-year-old's contract doesn't expire until the end of June, but it's reported that Liverpool would be open to "waiving" the final month of his salary, while also accepting a small fee from Los Blancos that is expected to be under €1 million. - Chelsea are interested in Ajax defender Jorrel Hato, reports De Telegraaf. Hato, a Netherlands international, has made 46 appearances across all competitions for Ajax this season. Muller, 35, is reported to have explored a potential move to the MLS club, who could face competition for his signature from both San Diego FC and Chicago Fire FC. Muller has already turned down an offer from FC Cincinnati, while he is also considering retiring after his contract at the Allianz Arena expires next month. - Multiple clubs are in the race to sign Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyökeres, reports Sky Sports Deutschland. Talks have taken place between Arsenal and the 26-year-old's representatives, with the Gunners viewing him as a more attainable reinforcement than Newcastle's Alexander Isak. If clubs are looking for a towering presence in the centre of defence, they should look no further than Jonathan Tah. And that's exactly why so many clubs want to sign the Germany international on free transfer. But they will get a proven title winner and 35-cap international for nothing. Over the last two seasons, Tah has literally been head and shoulders above any other defender to play 35+ games. - A move for on-loan Real Betis winger Antony is being considered by Atlético Madrid. Manager Diego Simeone's side is the latest to be linked, and the Red Devils are expected to request an offer worth between €40m and €50m. - Bilal El Khannouss is a potential transfer option for Arsenal as Mikel Arteta looks to add squad depth. - Juventus are ready to sit down and discuss a new contract with USMNT star Weston McKennie. The midfielder, who has made 40 appearances this season, is about to move into the final year of his deal and Juve want to avoid a cut-price departure. - Theo Hernández is one of the left-back options Real Madrid are looking. Hernández's deal at Milan is up in 2026, making him an accessible option. Girona's Miguel Gutierrez has an €8m clause in his contract which would enable Los Blancos to re-sign the 23-year-old. They also like Benfica's Alvaro Carreras but his €50m valuation is likely to complicate the deal, while Xabi Alonso would like to bring versatile defender Piero Hincapie with him from Bayer Leverkusen for €40m. - Arsenal have added Atalanta forward Ademola Lookman to their list of options for the summer, though there are other clubs keen on the 27-year-old. Lookman is planning to take the next step in his career having recorded 20 goals and seven assists across all competitions this term, and the Premier League return is seen as a possible option for him. - Man United are preparing a move for AFC Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, with scouts impressed by his performances. - Man United have made very positive progress in a meeting with the camp of Wolves forward Matheus Cunha. Key details on the salary structure of a contract until 2030 are settled, with only minor details remaining amid confidence that an agreement on personal terms can be reached soon. - Tottenham have been watching Borussia Monchengladbach striker Tim Kleindienst, who could be available for €28m if the Bundesliga club fail to qualify for Europe. - Arsenal are facing competition from Borussia Dortmund and Internazionale for the signature of Brazilian forward Luighi. - Bayer Leverkusen,Bayern Munich and West Ham United are interested in AC Milan centre-back Malick Thiaw. - Arsenal, Barcelona, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City are all interested in Flamengo right-back Wesley, with the Blues having made an initial contact with the 21-year-old's representatives. - Everton are considering making a move to sign Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap ahead of Chelsea and Man United. - Lazio are looking at Borussia Monchengladbach left-back Luca Netz, while Valez Sarfield's Valentin Gomez, Valencia's Cristhian Mosquera, Lugano's Albian Hajdari and Leicester City's Wout Faes are being considered for the centre of their defence. - West Ham United are ahead of Newcastle United in their efforts to sign Southampton goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale, with the Hammers preparing an offer of around £20m.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To register Trent before the Club World Cup starts on 14 June, Madrid would need to pay Liverpool some kind of compensation. When it comes to Trent Alexander-Arnold's proposed move to Real Madrid, things are heating up, almost finalized, pending only the final handshake. Trent's contract with Liverpool will expire this summer, and he has ignored every attempt from the club to negotiate a renewal. More wishful thinking than reality, though, as Madrid is now poised to accelerate proceedings. Trent Alexander-Arnold salutes #LFC fans who've been loudly singing his name. However, they also note that “it hasn't been forgotten that he's leaving without bringing in a transfer fee…” As the third highest earner in the squad, that amounts to approximately $970,000 (£180,000 gross per week - which works out at $11.8 million per year). The next condition likely falls on Real Madrid's side—a compensation fee. While it would essentially be a goodwill gesture, Liverpool wouldn't let Trent leave while he is still technically under contract at zero cost. That said, the amount wouldn't be exorbitant—under €1 million (approximately $970,000). However, with this arrangement, they would save the portion of his salary corresponding to June while securing a bit extra through compensation. That's the price tag for his freedom. Trent and Bobby win it at Stamford Bridge 👊#CHELIV 19/20 ⏪ pic.twitter.com/i7mtY6ojoi For Real Madrid, the last hurdle is merely a formality—official registration. FIFA has opened two additional transfer windows for clubs participating in the Club World Cup. Madrid is focused on the first deadline. There is a chance that Dani Carvajal might be available from the start of the tournament, but he has been out of action since suffering an ACL tear in October and with five league games left to play, is not expected to return before the end of the campaign. His arrival could be the key piece Madrid needs. Whether you're into NFL touchdowns, NBA buzzer-beaters, world-class soccer goals, or MLB home runs, our app has it all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid will be busy this summer, and the first of likely multiple signings is expected to be Trent Alexander-Arnold. Alexander-Arnold has been courted by Real Madrid for months, and their efforts are about to pay off. His Liverpool contract expires on the 30th of June, but interestingly, there is a good chance that he joins up with Los Blancos before this date. Due to the new format of the Club World Cup taking place this summer, there is an additional window for clubs to make signings prior to the tournament kicking off. And given that Real Madrid are involved, there is a desire for them to have Alexander-Arnold in their squad to make the trip to the United States. Liverpool are not competing at the Club World Cup, and as a result, they are prepared to let Alexander-Arnold leave prior to his contract expiring – but not for free. They would ask for compensation, and according to Diario AS, it would amount to a figure in the region of €1-2m. On top of this, it is reported that the player himself is willing to forego the final month of his salary at the Premier League champions in order to join Real Madrid before this summer's tournament. The expectation is that all parties will be able to reach an amicable agreement, and that is what Real Madrid are after. They could certainly do with taking Alexander-Arnold to the Club World Cup, given that Lucas Vazquez is their only 100% available right-back – Dani Carvajal is hoping to be fit, but it is unlikely that he will be fully available given that he is coming off the back of an ACL injury.</p>

South Africa's Premier Soccer League champions Mamelodi Sundowns, who won the 2016 CAF Champions League, will be among the four CAF representatives, alongside Egyptian giants Al Ahly, Wydad AC (currently coached by former Sundowns and Orlando Pirates coach Rhulani Mokwena) and Espérance de Tunis. Twelve European giants will feature in the competition, including tournament holders Manchester City, Spanish giants and record five-time winners Real Madrid, 2021 winners Chelsea, two-time winners Bayern Munich as well as Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan and Porto. Alex Okyere, Managing Director, MultiChoice Ghana, says: “As Africa's biggest sports broadcaster, we are proud to be able to bring fans the best in sporting action; to bring them the biggest names in the game and, of course, the biggest clubs coming up against one another. “As we've seen with some innovations on the European continent with the new UEFA club competition format, fans are primed for fresher approaches to long-standing traditional tournaments. “We see the FIFA Club World Cup 25's evolution from seven participating teams to the staggering 32 teams as a move that will pique the football interest of passionate fans. The crème de la crème of global club football will descend on the US, hosts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as Brazilian outfits Palmeiras, Flamengo, Fluminense and Botafogo are joined by Argentine foes River Plate and Boca Juniors. Lionel Messi's Inter Miami CF have also qualified for the tournament as hosts and have been grouped with African giants Al Ahly, Palmeiras and FC Porto. Sundowns have been drawn into Group F alongside Fluminense FC, Borussia Dortmund, and Ulsan HD from Korea. Wydad AC will tussle with Manchester City, Al Ain FC from the UAE and Juventus FC in Group G. SuperSport's full broadcast information will be communicated closer to the start of the tournament.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City have not spoken to Kevin De Bruyne over his potential participation in the FIFA Club World Cup - a competition just six weeks away. De Bruyne's City contract expires at the end of June, midway through the expanded Club World Cup competition which concludes on July 13 if City were to reach the final in New York. With City taking the decision not to extend De Bruyne's contract, a question remains over his involvement in the USA. De Bruyne has reiterated that he wants to continue to play at the top level, so he must also decide how a potential Club World Cup campaign could impact his next steps. However, speaking after his goal was the difference against Wolves on Friday night, De Bruyne once again asserted that he feels like he can still continue at City - even if Pep Guardiola avoided talk of a sensational u-turn regarding his contract. And in an interview with TNT Sport Brazil, De Bruyne offered his clearest answer yet over his stance on the Club World Cup - admitting that he may have to prioritise his next club over City, who are yet to ask him about his position. For me, it will depend on whatever happens in the future, you know, depending on what team I'll go, what competition I'll play," De Bruyne replied. "Also if another team doesn't want me to play, doesn't want to risk whatever happens. If they want to have a conversation, we can. And hopefully win the FA Cup, that would be a nice ending." Hopefully he can continue playing football in another place, but I don't know. It's the first time he plays this competition and at the end of the first three games he is still under contract but after that if we go through I don't know. Kevin has to tell and after that for the fact that the future can it be legally possible or not." If De Bruyne does not represent City in their world title defence, his final game will be the Premier League trip to Fulham on the final day of the season, following fixtures against Southampton, Bournemouth, and Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bayern Munich will have an expanded roster at the Club World Cup... According to a report from kicker journalist Frank Linkesch (via @iMiaSanMia), Bayern Munich is developing its plans for the Club World Cup and the roster could include quite a few youngsters. Over the next few days, Bayern will discuss which youth players and loan players will be included in the Club World Cup squad. • Adam Aznou, Paul Wanner and Frans Krätzig are likely to be brought back from loan in time for the tournament • Mathys Tel and Bryan Zaragoza are unlikely to be included as the club is no longer planning with them • Bayern are in talks with Hoffenheim to release Tom Bischof for the tournament This could be a key summer to get some of the club's younger players integrated into the first team. Will any of them stick around for the 2025/26 campaign? Looking for more thoughts and discussion on Bayern Munich's performance over the weekend against Mainz and where things stand in the Bundesliga? What about some chatter on whether or not bringing Leroy Sané back is a good idea? Finally, we hit on how Tom Bischof might fit in at Bayern Munich and whether or not that undermines the work being done on Bayern Munich's campus.
