                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the eponymous unconventional attorney/quasi-detective Elsbeth adapts to a changing dynamic with NYPD officer and friend Kaya following the latter's promotion, so will lead Carrie Preston adjust to a dramedy that will see a little less of co-star-turned-guest-star Carra Patterson. Thursday's episode of the CBS police procedural spinoff saw a major turning point for Kaya, who was promoted to join a special task force as an undercover agent in Washington D.C. Season 2's finale, May 8's episode “Ramen Holiday,” will feature a roster of guest stars and a celebratory toast in Kaya's honor. 'The Equalizer' Cast Reacts To Cancellation After 5 Seasons: "Forever Changed And Eternally Grateful" “So I think it's an opportunity to really enrich the character and the storylines, to have a fresh new take on what Elsbeth is like when she doesn't have someone like Kaya to lean on. How is she going to walk onto a crime scene without her? Preston continued, “They so brilliantly and deftly just took [Kaya] to this place where it became a natural thing for her to be elevated and promoted. And it's just the structure of our show [that] Elsbeth doesn't work with the same detective on every case. And so, we came to this point, as well, story-wise, where Kaya needed to fly and echo, in some ways, what Elsbeth has been doing, which is reinventing herself. And so, we have this wonderful little parallel now between what Kaya is doing and what Elsbeth is continuing to do.” As reported by Deadline in an extensive interview with showrunner Jonathan Tolins, the show — already renewed for Season 3 and set to reconvene its writers room in a few weeks — has “no intention of forcing” another character into occupying Kaya's role. Meanwhile, Patterson shared in a statement, “My character, Kaya Blanke, is embarking on a new adventure as the story continues to unfold, and I am excited to do the same. But we will see Kaya again – fans will find out what she's been up to in her new role as ‘Detective' next season when I come back to guest star and play with Carrie and Wendell.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On May 2, 2025, WCTH production manager Mike Magnusson announced via social media that the show was mourning the death of Nathaniel “Nate” Pelletier, a beloved member of the show's transportation department. Sharing a photo of the program from Pelletier's May 2 memorial service, Magnusson wrote, “We lost a member of our WCTH family, Nate Pelletier … Nate was all heart, a true ‘Unicorn,' smashing every 14 hour day with a wide smile & endless cheer for all. He ‘saw' people, and was always there with a kind word. He leaves a void of spirit we will not be able to replace. Pelletier died suddenly on April 11 at age 53, per his obituary, leaving the WCTH cast and crew in mourning for the second time in a year. In July, lost longtime director Neill Fearnley died after a long battle with ALS. “Thank you for your bright and kind spirit dearest Nate,” she wrote. According to Pelletier's obituary, he died “alone at home in Langley BC” and is survived by his “greatest love,” daughter Myhrsades (Murray) Jones as well as his brothers and parents. A post shared by When Calls The Heart (@wcth_tv) On May 3, Hallmark's WCTH Instagram account paid tribute to Pelletier with a photo taken by Krista Petrie, one of many Hearties who got to know Pelletier during visits to the set of “When Calls The Heart” in Langley. He was a frequent presence at the annual Hearties Family Reunion, held for fans each summer. We'd love for you to share your memories in the comments below. ❤️ We're sending love to all who knew and loved him. Within hours, many fans had already left notes of sympathy and memories of Pelletier, including one who wrote, “When I introduced myself to him at #HFR2024 he greeted me like a long lost friend which I thought was so special. You could tell immediately how much he loved this time to connect with  #Hearties and share his passion with all of us. Another shared, “So sorry to hear about your loss. “So sorry to hear this news,” another fan wrote on Magnusson's post. “He was such an integral part of the WCTH family and I loved seeing him embrace the Hearties these past years. He brought so much joy to the fans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anderson .Paak and Mariah Carey are working on new music together. During a Friday (May 2) appearance on the social media series Track Star — where guests try to identify mystery songs — the 39-year-old singer-songwriter and producer correctly guessed Carey's “Always Be My Baby,” which reached No. “I remember in like 5th grade, or something, watching the music videos and having a huge crush. News of a musical collaboration between .Paak and Carey, 56, comes after the two were seen holding hands after the iHeartRadio Music Awards in March 2025, People reports. “Thank you iHeart for this incredible honor,” Carey said during her speech. “As a kid, I used to listen to my favorite artist on the radio and dream of being on the airwave myself. Prior to that, .Paak and Carey were seen holding hands following the conclusion of her Christmas tour in December 2024, according to People. Carey, recently nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, confirmed in an early April interview with the Associated Press that she's working on a new album, but she did not share additional details. Her most recent studio album, Caution, was released in 2018. The two-disc vinyl edition is set to drop through Def Jam Records/UMe on May 30.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eighteen-year-old John Foster is becoming a household name now that he's made it to the top 10 on season 23 of “American Idol.” But that name is is one of the many things Foster's hometown supporters in Addis, Louisiana, want to shed some light on for fans. The young country singer's full name is John Foster Benoit, family and friends told The Adovcate on May 1, 2025, but he dropped his last name for his blossoming music career. During his audition, though, he represented the family name by bringing coolers full of Cajun delicacies from his family's meat shop —Benoit's Country Meat Block — to judges Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie, and Carrie Underwood. One of the store's longtime employees, family friend Rick Bourgoyne, told The Advocate, “ I was telling his daddy, I said, ‘I hope people don't think that's his last name because he is a Benoit, and this (store) is Benoit's.' As Foster grows more visible on “American Idol,” with millions tuning into each episode, he has noticed some inaccuracies reported about himself online. On April 30, he tried to clear up some of those rumors in a Facebook post, including verifying his age and background. “I'm not related to Dwight Yoakam,” he wrote, “nor am I currently signed under any record label (there was some misinformation that Dwight Yoakam signed me under Sugar Hill Records).” Foster has a huge support system behind him, with 31 family members heading to Los Angeles for the next round of competition, according to The Advocate. Even while competing on “American Idol,” he's been taking online classes for his second semester at Louisiana State University, majoring in biology, his grandma Verbie Benoit told the paper. On May 2, Foster launched a Facebook fundraiser for the American Cancer Society, writing, “As many of you know, I am currently studying to become an oncologist (a physician who treats cancer). With a goal of raising $500 by raffling off an autographed photo, Foster raised nearly $3,500 in less than 24 hours. The next rounds of “American Idol” air live coast-to-coast on May 4 and 5 at 8 p.m. Eastern time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marvel's star-studded ensemble pic led by Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan is winning over critics and audiences alike as it kicks off the summer box office season. The star-studded movie, led by Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan, is kicking off the summer box office in what's become a tradition for Kevin Feige‘s studio with only a few exceptions. The pic is winning over critics and audiences alike; Thunderbolts* boasts a glowing 95 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, making it the third-highest score for a title in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a tie with Spider-Man: Far From Home and behind Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (98 percent) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (97 percent). It's still early, of course, and scores can change by one or two points as the weekend wears on. As a comparison, Marvel's Captain America: Brave New World had an audience RT score of 92 percent when opening to $88.8 million earlier this year. Regarding Sinners, the Warner Bros. hit is enjoying a phenomenal third weekend, even if it falls to second place. The supernatural vampire pic continues to break all the rules and could fall just 26 percent this weekend to $33.7 million for a domestic tally north of $180 million. Directed by Jake Schreier, the film brings together a band of dysfunctional outsiders — and lesser-known comic book characters — who discover their potential to be heroes when working together. In addition to Pugh (Yelena Belova) and Stan (Bucky Barnes), the movie features Wyatt Russell (John Walker), David Harbour (Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian), Lewis Pullman (Bob), Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost), Olga Kurylenko (Taskmaster) and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (CIA director Valentine Allegra de Fontaine). “Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan lead a gratifyingly fresh and soulful Marvel adventure,” The Hollywood Reporter‘s chief film critic David Rooney writes in his review. “While a handful of the characters and the actors playing them have appeared in previous entries, there's a disarming freshness to this first-time assembly, not to mention something even more unexpected: heart. That's due to an appealing ensemble cast and the new blood of a creative team with a distinctive take on the genre.” In the film, Louis-Dreyfus' villainous character has positioned a number of MCU loners and rejects to kill each other for her own nefarious reasons. No other major studio dared open a wide release opposite the Marvel event pic. Elsewhere, Alec Baldwin's controversial-laced Rust finally opened in select theaters while also being available on premium VOD. The Western appears to be bombing — at least in cinemas — with an estimated opening gross of just $25,000 from 115 theaters. The movie opens four years after Baldwin, who co-wrote and produced the film, accidentally discharged a weapon he thought only had blanks. What followed was a dramatic, closely reported story that revealed on-set negligence and raised questions about industry practices around gun safety. Still, his case was dismissed after new evidence came to light that Baldwin's lawyers alleged had been buried by the prosecutors. The film's prop armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was also charged and is serving an 18-month prison sentence. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SATURDAY AM: Refresh for more analysis and chart…Marvel Studios and Disney's Thunderbolts* has a shot at coming in a bit better for the weekend at $73M-$77M. As we told you, Friday was close to $32M, with Disney calling it at $31.5M. While we'd expect more and want more from Marvel during the first weekend of summer, when you include Thunderbolts* in with all the other holdovers in the marketplace, there's nothing to complain about with all titles doing an estimated $145M this weekend. This is where originals now live with Marvel post Covid. However, what Thunderbolts* has going for itself are its exits. Audiences gave it a solid A- as compared to the B- they smacked Captain America: Brave New World with, and the Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Hannah John-Kamen and Geraldine Viswanathan-led movie has a great 71% definite recommend on PostTrak. All of that bodes well for this pic holding in the summer to come. More upbeat results from Thunderbolts*: 75% told PostTrak they want to see a sequel, while 40% said they went to watch because of the cast and 53% mentioned the big reason why they bought a ticket was because it's a Marvel movie. This is a very similar turnout in terms of demo ages as Captain America: Brave New World; men under 25 were a little lower at 18%. IMAX and PLF are repping 39% of the weekend with 3D generating separately 11% (Disney has to get moviegoers back in a 3D mindset so they're primed for Avatar: Fire & Ash later this year). The AMC Dine-In Disney Springs (Fla.) leads single-location gross at $106K. Thunderbolts*‘ social media universe stands at 570M according to analytics corp RelishMix, which is not far from Captain America: Brave New World‘s near 600M, but lower than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3‘s 709.7M followers across TikTok, YouTube, X, Instagram and Facebook. Pugh is not only the key cast driver in the run-up, but her well-boosted videos have driven over 23M views. Meanwhile, Warner Bros' Sinners is shaping up for a massive $33M third weekend, -28%. That is, of course, the best third weekend for a horror movie ahead of It‘s $29.7M third weekend. Also opening this weekend is Roadside Attractions' pick-up of Cannes title The Surfer starring Nicolas Cage, and it's shaping up for a 3-day around $750K after a $325K Friday at 1,085 theaters. Audiences at 48% on Rotten Tomatoes aren't catching the wave like critics are with an 86% certified fresh critical score. The Alec Baldwin Rust western opened on 115 theaters to a very low estimated $25K or $217 per screen. That's not good — but here's what's going on. Furthermore, whenever a theatrical distributor does a day-and-date PVOD release, contractually with the cable companies and digital OTT services, they have to open the movie in a specified amount of theaters. The Sailesh Kolanu crime thriller follows Arjun Sarkaar, a top Homicide Intervention Team officer from Visakhapatnam, who is sent to Jammu and Kashmir to investigate a series of brutal murders. As he pursues a group of elusive killers, the case tests his skills and mental strength. Best markets are Austin, Dallas, Seattle, Toronto, Atlanta, San Francisco, New York City and Baltimore. AFTERNOON UPDATE: Marvel Studios and Disney's Thunderbolts* is looking at $32M today, including last night's $11.5M previews, for what's shaping up to be a $70M-$75M opening at 4,330 theaters, which has more or less been par for the course for an MCU original title post Covid. The movie has great reviews and immediate thumbs-up from fans. Clearly by tomorrow night, we'll know if it catches on and enters the Guardians of the Galaxy threshold ($94.3M), but as of this minute, no one is seeing it at that altitude. Staying strong is Warner Bros' Sinners with $9M today and a 3-day between $30M-$35M at 3,347 — a terrific hold at -23% to -34% in Weekend 3. By comparison, Jordan Peele's Get Out posted a third weekend of $20.7M in 2017, -27%. Warners had bragging rights for third place as well with Legendary co-production A Minecraft Movie at 3,571 sites doing $3M today — $13M, -43% in its fifth weekend — for a running total of $397.5M. Fourth goes to Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 with a Friday of $3M, second weekend of $11.2M, -51%, and a running total of $41.6M, which is 12% behind the 2016 original at the same point in time. Sony Screen Gems' Until Dawn at 3,055 locations is in fifth with $1M in its second Friday and a $3M second weekend, -59% for an estimated running total by Sunday of $13.8M. UPDATE AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Disney's official figure Thunderbolts* last night is $11.5M. More good news for Thunderbolts* this weekend: Out of the gate it has 4 1/2 stars on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak and a great 74% definite recommend. The figure isn't that far from the $12M chalked up by February's Captain America: Brave New World; that preview repped 29% of the Anthony Mackie pic's first Friday, which turned into an $88.8M 3-day. Last night's money for the Pugh, Harbour and Stan-led movie is also under that of Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3 which posted $17.5M in previews for a $48.1M Friday and $118.4M 3-day. Warner Bros' Sinners ends its second week with $69M at 3,347 theaters, -11%, and a running cume of $146.6M. Even with Sinners ceding its premium screens this weekend, it's expected to have a robust hold. It was announced that the Ryan Coogler-directed title will return to nine select IMAX 70MM theaters from May 15-21. Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 is third for the week with $31.6M at 3,610 screens, after a $1.2M Thursday, -18% from Wednesday. EXCLUSIVE: Disney and Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* is off to a very good start with around $11M tonight, we hear from non-Disney sources. Always know that forecast can swing higher or lower by the time late night monies come in Friday AM. Hopefully tonight's previews are an indicator to better days at the summer B.O. Not only does the Pugh and Stan vehicle have a solid start, but it's also winning fans over tonight with a 96% Rotten Tomatoes audience score after its 88% certified fresh rating with critics. That's better than the MCU's Captain America: Brave New World from February (48% critics, 78% audience) which saw an $88.8M 3-day, $100M 4-day over the Valentine's Day/President's Day weekend, which translated to $200.2M stateside and $414.8M global take. Tonight's previews are roughly a million under Captain America: Brave New World's $12M, but they're also ahead of 2021's Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings ($8.8M) and Eternals ($9.5M). Thunderbolts* (not to be confused with Thundercats) has all the premium ticket upcharges in IMAX, Dolby, ScreenX, 4DX, etc. We told you in the past week that previews/presales for Thunderbolts* are behind Captain America: Brave New World. However, presales for the Jake Schreier-helmed MCU title continue to be ahead of 2021's Shang Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings ($75.3M) and Eternals ($71.2M opening). We'll have more intel on Warner Bros' Sinners‘ third weekend tomorrow; however, some rivals are estimating that the Ryan Coogler-directed, Michael B. Jordan-starring period vampire movie is headed to a 3-day of $35M, which would be a remarkable dip of -23%. Forecasts had Sinners easing -25% to -30% in its third weekend for $32M-$34.2M yesterday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the Hallmark Channel premiere of “Hats Off to Love” on May 3, 2025, longtime fan-favorite Holly Robinson Peete will be back in the saddle again — literally. The movie marks her return to the network after a nearly two-and-a-half-year absence, which both she and fans are thrilled about. Robinson Peete, who last appeared in 2022's “Holiday Heritage,” has been busy juggling family, her charitable foundation, and other TV roles, telling EntertainmentNOW it took a while to “reconnect and get back in the groove” with Hallmark, but that she's hoping “Hats Off to Love” is the first of many more projects there. “I went, you know, pretty much since 2015, making one, two, sometimes three movies a year,” she said of her history at Hallmark. An alum of “21 Jump Street” and hit sitcoms like “Hangin' With Mr. Cooper,” Robinson Peete first appeared on Hallmark Channel in 2015's “Angel of Christmas” and quickly became a fan-favorite on the network, starring in the “Morning Show Mysteries” franchise and many holiday films, as well as her family's reality show, “Meet the Peetes,” in 2018 and 2019. In “Hats Off to Love,” she plays Louisville socialite Rosalind, whose son Christian (John Clarence Stewart) is training a horse for the upcoming derby when he falls head over heels for Stella (Ginna Claire Mason) who designs derby hats and fascinators for the annual race day. “She's a woman who's finding her way,” Robinson Peete said of her character, “and realizing that, you know, she's getting older, but that it's never too late to go for it in life. She's a very astute, fashionably put-together business woman who loves her horses. “Had I not gone to that Derby, I would not have really known how seriously people are about the Derby,” she marveled. Once she was offered the Hallmark movie, Robinson Peete said she drew inspiration from her friend Eden Bridgeman, the owner of Ebony magazine and a Kentucky Derby aficionado. “She's very connected in this society and just fabulous,” Robinson Peete said. “I was watching her (at the 2024 Derby) with the outfits and showing up at this party and hosting that (event) and I was like, ‘Look at this lady!' I kept sending her pictures during the film and going, ‘Would Rosalind wear this?' I'm really looking forward to her seeing this. Among Robinson Peete's favorite things about filming “Hats Off to Love” were getting to know Broadway alum Mason, whom she described as “talented beyond belief,” and working with the horses. “Never happened,” she laughed, “but I lived vicariously through Rosalind, who owns several. The handlers were saying, ‘You seem very comfortable on this horse.' Robinson Peete joked that there was one day on the Tampa set when “a couple of horses were like, ‘Call my agent, I'm not doing this,'” but that most of them were “very cooperative.” “At one point in the stable scenes, there were like, 20 or 30 horses in there,” she said, “and I just had the best time, because our dressing rooms were in the stables, so you would hear noises and I'd go out and say hi to them. Although Robinson Peete isn't sure what's next for her at Hallmark, she said she's “talking with them all the time about doing more” and even has some ideas for unscripted shows. In the meantime, “Hats Off to Love” premieres on May 3 at 8 p.m. Eastern time and will be available to stream on Hallmark+ the following day.</p>

The Museum of Modern Art is spring cleaning its archives for a special ode to Old Hollywood. The exhibit “Face Value: Celebrity Press Photography,” which will open June 28, 2025 and be on display through June 21, 2026, features the best studio shots of iconic stars such as Clara Bow, Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Barbara Stanwyck, Elizabeth Taylor, Harry Belafonte, and more. “Face Value” will feature over 200 works from 1921 to 1996, with studio photography of Joan Crawford, Louis Armstrong, Carole Lombard, Louise Brooks, Mia Farrow, Dennis Hopper, Lena Horne, Buster Keaton, Anna May Wong, W. C. Fields, Hattie McDaniel, Lupe Velez, Mae West, Bela Lugosi, Carmen Miranda, Elvis Presley, Diana Ross, Spencer Tracy, and Oprah Winfrey, in addition to the aforementioned stars. Historical figures such as Jackie Robinson, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Amelia Earhart, Ruby Berkley, and Eleanor Roosevelt are also among the portraits.

As the MoMA exhibit description states, the exhibition will “explore how these images were manipulated for public consumption through hands-on editing techniques long before digital tools became standard.” The pieces include works by more than 58 photographers, with “untouched” candid images juxtaposed with traditional press practices of the era such as silhouetting, in-painting, masking, sectioning, and collage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These noncitizens were given Social Security numbers, as is completely standard — in fact, the process was automated during Trump's first term — but Gracias and Musk, the world's richest man, treated it like a scandal. Under their watch, DOGE has moved to fire thousands of SSA workers, shutter dozens of field offices, and implement sweeping changes that are expected to make it more difficult for Social Security recipients to get their payments on time, if at all. The administration has reportedly declared millions of people dead within the Social Security program, making live people fight for their payments, and has started deliberately marking some immigrants as deceased. (A White House spokesperson says SSA's “death data” is “being reviewed by three separate teams,” and that the immigrants targeted were either “on the terrorist watch list” or have “FBI criminal records.”) Meanwhile, Social Security beneficiaries may have to wait until November to receive the higher payments they were promised in a law passed last year. Despite all of Musk and Gracias' rhetoric about rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in Social Security, scant attention has been paid to how the pair has become phenomenally wealthy with support from Americans' retirement funds. It's well-known that Musk's space company, SpaceX, has long cashed in on federal contracts — a trend turbocharged by Trump's administration. In the past decade, Gracias' private equity firm, Valor Equity Partners, has received at least $1.7 billion in investment commitments from state and local pension funds — which manage the retirement savings of unionized teachers, firefighters, social workers, bus drivers, and cops — according to a Rolling Stone review of public documents. Much of this money has come from Democratic states and locales. For its most recent fund, Valor received $800 million in investment commitments from a range of state and local pension funds. Trump Leaves Major Cities Without Top Meteorologists Ahead of Hurricane Season North Carolina Justice Speaks Out About Republicans' Effort to Steal Her Seat Musk recently used xAI to purchase his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) at a valuation of $33 billion, a 25-percent haircut from the $44 billion he spent to buy Twitter. While Gracias complains about 1.3 million immigrants being on Medicaid — numbers that have not been independently verified by Rolling Stone, but would mean these immigrants are getting access to preventive care and saving hospitals money on emergency room expenses — Gracias himself is accruing large profits from the management fees that his firm charges government retirement systems. Valor and DOGE did not respond to Rolling Stone's requests for comment. A 54-year-old University of Chicago Law School alum who has been associated with Musk since the PayPal days, Gracias has played a key role in helping prop up Musk's embattled yet sprawling business empire. Gracias' longstanding friendship and business dealings with Musk have been lucrative for both men. Musk is worth an estimated $386 billion, in large part due to his Tesla holdings. Agencies across the federal government are increasingly using Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet business. SpaceX and defense contractor Anduril, another company that Gracias' firm has invested in, are the frontrunners to build Trump's proposed “Golden Dome” missile shield, a proposal that experts estimate will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. As Trump and Musk have run roughshod over the law to pursue drastic cuts of the federal government through DOGE, they have been supported by an eclectic cast of characters. While 19-year olds or those with openly racist proclivities or nicknames like “Big Balls” get the bulk of media attention, arguably nobody has been more important to implementing DOGE's slash-and-burn agenda than Gracias. With his entry into the heights of Washington policymaking, Gracias, like Musk, has brought an overall mentality to the Trump administration with well-defined origins in private equity. Core to the history of private equity is a conception that government is a vehicle for private profit, and that the point of business is to extract as much cash as possible from targets, no matter the impact. As an example, Ballou notes, “They're exploring sale leasebacks to sell underlying government property and lease it back to itself,” a hallmark of the private equity model. “They're pursuing the same type of cost-cutting techniques that private equity firms pursue when they take over a company, which end up costing you vastly more money in the long run. It's almost comical how similar it is to the takeover of a company by a private equity firm, what they are doing to the government.” (BlackRock, whose CEO Larry Fink recently resuscitated the long-discredited idea of investing part of Social Security in Wall Street-controlled private accounts, did Musk a massive favor last year when the financial firm voted its investors' proxies in favor of Musk's record-setting $46 billion Tesla pay package.) Gracias began working with the Social Security Administration in early February. Dozens of Social Security offices are expected to close, while DOGE pushes major technological changes that could make more people need to visit those offices. A White House spokesperson says SSA has only lost 2,000 workers so far, with most departing voluntarily, and adds that “the agency has not permanently closed or announced the permanent closure of any local field office.” Additionally, Gracias has reportedly led a DOGE task force working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services to integrate sensitive personal data from Social Security, with the apparent goal of aiding Trump's deportation dragnet. Speaking about DOGE's efforts in the Social Security Administration, former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley said in March, “Most of the actions necessary to create a total system collapse of the Social Security Administration have been taken.” In late April, the Trump SSA pledged that they would seek to convert large swaths of SSA employees to “Schedule F,” which would effectively eliminate longstanding civil service protections and serve to speed up firings at the agency. That role is currently being held by Scott Coulter, who used to work for private equity giant Blackstone and Lone Pine Capital, a hedge fund, and has worked as a DOGE apparatchik. “Private equity has profited immensely in recent decades off of asset stripping — using public resources to plunder businesses and communities, leaving behind carcasses of enterprises in many cases,” he says. DOGE is executing something very similar at the federal level. But they're gutting not just a specific enterprise or community but the entire federal government, to advance a longer-term desire among corporate interests in this country to free themselves from any public or social oversight. In many ways, what we're seeing with DOGE is the private equity asset stripping model [taken] to its logical conclusion.” Employees of private equity firms spent $236 million on campaign contributions in the 2024 election. The American Investment Council, a lobbying group for private equity, has estimated that about half of private equity's capital that is invested in America comes from U.S. public pension funds. Private equity is distinguished by its lack of regulation, limited transparency, high fees, and vulnerability to misconduct. A leaked 2020 report from the FBI found that private equity firms, along with their closely related siblings in asset management, hedge funds, are widely used to conduct illicit money laundering operations. “Public pension funds are one of the biggest sources of capital for private equity firms,” says Oscar Valdés Viera, who analyzes private equity at Americans for Financial Reform. “Workers indirectly fund private equity's predatory practices through their pension funds. “It's just insane the amount of fees that they charge from these pension funds.” Beyoncé Receives Cease-and-Desist From Sphere Over 'Cowboy Carter' Tour Footage: Reports Walton Goggins Shuts Down Interview Over Aimee Lou Wood Questions Piper Rockelle Has a Lot to Say About That Netflix Documentary Brett Christophers, a professor at Sweden's Uppsala University who has studied asset management, tells Rolling Stone that the actions of DOGE clearly resemble foundational principles of the private equity industry. “When private equity investors go into operating companies, the most consistent theme across all their investments is cost cutting as a way in theory to maximize their investment and make companies lean and more valuable to other potential investors,” he says.</p>

While the trailer promises a chaotic series of events from a robbery to a “plot twist,” the film will no doubt be centered around “the hero's journey where something crazy happens” and Cooper will have to “figure it out.” Kevin Smith executive produced the project, alongside Logic, Jordan Monsanto, and Liz Destro.

The music industry was shocked this week upon the news that groundbreaking singer-songwriter Jill Sobule died in a house fire outside of Minneapolis on Thursday at age 66. She was preparing to see Sobule soon before she heard the news of Sobule's passing, as Sobule was supposed to stay at Lewis's home in Los Angeles next week when she came into town. Dual Lawsuits Accuse and Deny José Menendez's Alleged Sexual Assaults of Menudo Members Lewis says she “hasn't been able to move past shock” as she still comes to terms with what's happened. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter a day after Sobule's death, Lewis describes her friend as a one of a kind writer driven purely by her own creative expression, and a nomadic artist who lived her life freely in whatever way she wanted. Jill was definitely not like anyone you've ever met. I know that in itself is a cliche You're going hear all those things like about marching to her own drum. But when I say she's the only one of her kind, I mean literally, the only person like her. I can't make analogies that are human. She's like fairy dust, sparkle,  brilliance and originality. You never knew whether she was in New York or LA or on tour, and that's kind of the charm of her too. She filled the room with this whirlwind of whimsy. Kay [Hanley, lead singer of Letters to Cleo] and I had a project/band called The Dilettantes. Lisa Loeb was one of them and did a song with us. Tracy Bonham did a song with us. Jill met us for the first time to do a Dilettante song. She thought it was really fun to write with two other women. She was the favorite person to many of us. It will be one hell of a memorial. Every single call or text from Jill had the potential for an adventure. Anytime she asked me to do something, I knew there would be an adventure attached to it, so I always said yes, even when I was pregnant with my son. We had this one adventure together where she asked me to write a song for Ariana Huffington's book release, which was going to include Ariana Huffington rapping. The book was called Right is Wrong, it was about how the right wing of politics tended to be wrong. We wrote this song around that title with a rap by Ariana in the middle. Ariana came to my home studio to record the rap, and then for the actual book release, we ended up on a private jet to Larry Ellison's house in San Francisco to perform the song with Ariana in front of Nancy Pelosi. That was one of my big adventures with Jill. Larry David and his wife were there, Nora Ephron. Another one was when we opened for Bernie Sanders on his 2016 presidential tour. We went to Iowa and did one of the rallies. Kay would come through and do it too, and then there would be some weird opportunity to perform it in the house of a billionaire. It was never flexing in any way. She was like a muse of a political movement and really satirized the more ridiculous things about the right wing. The other thing that's kind of heartbreaking about this, so many people have been slogging through this political time. We were really looking forward to writing. It still hasn't hit me that we're not going to be able to do that. She was untethered in the best way. It was just a freedom that doesn't exist in people anymore, She was a free spirit. But part of the deal with her is that she was gonna be moving around. But there was no other way she could be. She was an inspiration for ideas, but never bossy or overwhelming. She was just buoyant and had a constant flow. We were doing a lot of our adventuring when I was pregnant with my son. The last time she was here a few weeks ago, we were writing, and she stayed after. My son came home from school, he's 17 now. She left and he went down this total Jill wormhole of her songwriting. The next day he raves about how she's this heavy songwriter and names all these songs like Underdog Victorious and Mexican wrestler. Because she's my friend, I completely took it for granted these genius moments. That reminded me what a motherfucking songwriter she was, it's easy to forget when you're just thinking about her as your friend. For all the personality, the humor of her persona, underneath that was this songwriting brilliance that I really hope people discover, rediscover, and will truly appreciate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that the two actors — who starred in 1994's Speed — will be joining forces again as the leads for an upcoming, untitled romantic thriller at Amazon MGM Studios. Although there are no details about the plot, it was described as “propulsive” to THR. Bullock via Fortis Films, Reeves, Gordon, and Bibby Dunn through the Mark Gordon Company are set to produce the project, along with Oppenheim and Sarah Bremner with Prologue Entertainment. It was one of the biggest action movies of the Nineties and spawned a sequel that was not as well-received.

Reeves most recently voiced Shadow the Hedgehog in Sonic the Hedgehog and starred in 2023's action film, John Wick: Chapter 4. The actor is also tied to From the World of John Wick: Ballerina and Good Fortune, both scheduled to release this year. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Universal Music Group, Spotify, Live Nation and Deezer also posted gains following their quarterly earnings reports. Though economic uncertainty lingers, some music companies' stocks got boosts following their first quarter earnings releases this week, while a better-than-expected jobs report on Friday (May 2) lifted stocks across the board. Led by HYBE's 13.8% gain following its first quarter earnings report on Tuesday (April 29), the four South Korean companies had an average share price gain of 10.3%. The 20-company Billboard Global Music Index (BGMI) rose 3.6% to 2,690.13, its fourth consecutive weekly improvement. At 2,690.13, the BGMI has improved 19.1% since a two-week slide and stands just 2.4% below its all-time high of 2,755.53 set during the week ended Feb. 14. Foreign markets were mostly positive but more subdued. South Korea's KOSPI composite index gained 0.5%. Universal Music Group (UMG) gained 4.3% to 25.86 euros ($29.23) following a quarterly earnings report showing that recorded music subscription revenue grew 11.5% and overall revenue improved 11.8%. JP Morgan analysts' conviction on UMG “remains very high,” and the strong quarter “should help rebuild confidence and share price momentum” dented by Pershing Square's sale of $1.5 billion in UMG shares, analysts wrote in an investor note on Tuesday. Spotify finished the week up 3.7% to $643.73 despite its shares dropping 3.4% on Tuesday after the company's first-quarter earnings report included guidance on second-quarter subscription additions that seemed to underwhelm investors. Gross margin of 31.6% beat Spotify's 31.5% guidance. UBS maintained its $680 price target and “buy” rating. Guggenheim maintained its “buy” rating and $675 price target. Live Nation, which reported first quarter earnings on Thursday (May 1) and predicted a “historic” 2025, gained 2.3% on Friday and finished the week up 0.7%. A slew of analysts updated their price targets on Friday. Nearly all streaming stocks posted gains. LiveOne was the week's top performer, jumping 18.0% to $0.72. French music streamer Deezer gained 1.4% to 1.44 euros ($1.63) after the company's first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
