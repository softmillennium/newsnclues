                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aptamer Group plc, a developer of synthetic oligonucleotide-based binding reagents for life sciences applications, and Alphazyme LLC (Alphazyme), a Maravai LifeSciences company specializing in enzymes for molecular biology, have executed a licensing agreement for a proprietary Optimer® binder developed for hot-start polymerase chain reaction (PCR) applications. The licensed Optimer® functions as a reversible, temperature-dependent inhibitor in hot-start DNA amplification protocols. The synthetic binder maintains DNA polymerase in an inactive state at ambient temperatures, preventing non-specific primer extension and primer-dimer formation during reaction assembly. Upon thermal activation, the binder-enzyme complex dissociates, restoring full enzymatic activity. This mechanism enhances assay specificity and sensitivity in applications including clinical diagnostics, genomic analysis, and library preparation for next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflows. Under the agreement, Aptamer Group grants Alphazyme non-exclusive worldwide rights to incorporate the enzyme-modulating Optimer® into hot-start PCR and NGS product formulations. This integrated supply arrangement ensures quality control and supply chain continuity while generating contract manufacturing revenue for Aptamer Group. Alphazyme's internal validation studies confirmed temperature-dependent modulation of both exonuclease and polymerase activities. Notably, the single Optimer® binder replicates functionality typically requiring two distinct antibody reagents, offering potential advantages in manufacturing economics and formulation complexity. Following this success, a second Optimer® development programme for enzyme modulation has been initiated with Alphazyme to broaden the customer's product portfolio. This project has recently completed the development phase, with candidate molecules having been delivered to Alphazyme for internal testing with positive results in the customer's hands. We are delighted to announce the signing of this licensing agreement with Alphazyme. This second enzyme modulation licensing agreement validates both the technical performance and commercial appeal of Optimer® technology in the molecular biology market. One of the standout features is the ability of our product to replace two antibodies with a single product, offering significant performance and manufacturing advantages, which will drive further licensing opportunities on successful technical validation of the second project. We look forward to building on the relationship with Alphazyme through our ongoing development programmes, which will provide the opportunity for further licensing of our Optimer® technology.” Dr Arron Tolley, Chief Executive Officer, Aptamer Group Please use one of the following formats to cite this article in your essay, paper or report: Aptamer Group and Alphazyme execute licensing agreement for synthetic aptamer-based enzyme modulation in hot-start PCR.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even a low daily intake of alcohol--just 9 g or around one standard drink-is linked to a 50% heightened risk of mouth (buccal mucosa) cancer in India, with the greatest risk associated with locally brewed alcohol, finds a large comparative study, published online in the open access journal BMJ Global Health. And when combined with chewing tobacco, it likely accounts for 62% of all such cases in India, the findings suggest. Mouth cancer is the second most common malignancy in India, with an estimated 143,759 new cases and 79,979 deaths every year. Rates of the disease have risen steadily, and now stand at just under 15 for every 100,000 Indian men, note the researchers. Less than half (43%) of those affected survive 5 or more years, they point out. As alcohol consumption and tobacco use often go hand in hand, it's not clear how much each factor individually contributes to mouth cancer risk, especially in India, where the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use is high, point out the researchers. Nor have the potential effects of locally brewed alcohol, which is particularly popular in rural communities, been assessed, they add. To find out more, the researchers compared 1803 people with confirmed buccal mucosa cancer and 1903 randomly selected people free of the disease (controls) from five different study centres between 2010 and 2021. The average length of tobacco use was higher for cases (around 21 years) than for the control group (around 18 years). Cases were also more likely to live in rural areas and to drink more alcohol every day: nearly 37 g compared with around 29 g. As little as under 2 g a day of beer was associated with a heightened risk of buccal mucosa cancer. And just 9 g a day of alcohol-equivalent to around one standard drink--was associated with an approximately 50% increased risk. Concurrent alcohol and tobacco use was associated with a more than quadrupling in risk, such that 62% of all buccal mucosa cancer cases in India are likely attributable to the interaction between alcohol and chewing tobacco, calculate the researchers. But alcohol was a contributory factor to the heightened risk of mouth cancer irrespective of how long tobacco had been used. The findings suggest that more than 1 in 10 cases (nearly 11.5%) of all buccal mucosa cancers in India are attributable to alcohol, rising to 14% in some of the states with a high prevalence of the disease, such as Meghalaya, Assam, and Madhya Pradesh, say the researchers. Possible contamination with toxins, such as methanol and acetaldehyde, in locally brewed alcohol, might help explain the higher risk associated with these drinks, the manufacture of which is largely unregulated, they suggest. However, the locally-brewed liquor market is unregulated, with some forms used by participants containing up to 90% alcohol content," they point out. They conclude: "In summary, our study demonstrates that there is no safe limit of alcohol consumption for [buccal mucosa cancer] risk…Our findings suggest that public health action towards prevention of alcohol and tobacco use could largely eliminate [buccal mucosa cancer] from India."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For over a century, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been considered irreversible. Consequently, research has focused on disease prevention or slowing, rather than recovery. Now, a research team from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center has challenged this long-held dogma in the field. They tested whether brains already badly afflicted with advanced AD could recover. Through studying diverse preclinical mouse models and human AD brains, the team showed that the brain's failure to maintain normal levels of a central cellular energy molecule, NAD+, is a major driver of AD, and that maintaining proper NAD+ balance can prevent and even reverse the disease. While AD is a uniquely human condition, it can be studied in the laboratory with mice that have been engineered to express genetic mutations that cause AD in people. One line of mice carried multiple human mutations in amyloid processing, and the other mouse line carried a human mutation in the tau protein. Amyloid and tau pathology are two of the major early events in AD, and both lines of mice develop brain pathology resembling AD, including blood-brain barrier deterioration, axonal degeneration, neuroinflammation, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, reduced synaptic transmission, and widespread accumulation of oxidative damage. These mice also develop severe cognitive impairments that resemble what is seen in people with AD. After finding that NAD+ levels in the brain declined precipitously in both human and mouse AD, the research team tested whether preventing the loss of brain NAD+ balance before disease onset, or restoring brain NAD+ balance after significant disease progression, could prevent or reverse AD, respectively. The study was based on their previous work, published in Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA, showing that restoring the brain's NAD+ balance achieved pathological and functional recovery after severe, long-lasting traumatic brain injury. They restored NAD+ balance by administering a now well-characterized pharmacologic agent known as P7C3-A20, developed in the Pieper lab. Remarkably, not only did preserving NAD+ balance protect mice from developing AD, but delayed treatment in mice with advanced disease also enabled the brain to fix the major pathological events caused by the genetic mutations. Moreover, both lines of mice fully recovered cognitive function. This was accompanied by normalized blood levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a recently approved clinical biomarker of AD in people, providing confirmation of disease reversal and highlighting a potential biomarker for future clinical trials. "We were very excited and encouraged by our results," said Andrew A. Pieper, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH. "Restoring the brain's energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer's. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain's NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer's." Dr. Pieper also holds the Morley-Mather Chair in Neuropsychiatry at UH and the CWRU Rebecca E. Barchas, MD, DLFAPA, University Professorship in Translational Psychiatry. "The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function." Dr. Chaubey further explained, "Through our study, we demonstrated one drug-based way to accomplish this in animal models, and also identified candidate proteins in the human AD brain that may relate to the ability to reverse AD." Dr. Pieper emphasized that currently available over the counter NAD+-precursors have been shown in animal models to raise cellular NAD+ to dangerously high levels that promote cancer The approach in this study, however, uses a pharmacologic agent (P7C3-A20) that enables cells to maintain their proper balance of NAD+ under conditions of otherwise overwhelming stress, without elevating NAD+ to supraphysiologic levels. "This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery," said Dr. Pieper. This work also encourages new research into complementary approaches and eventual testing in patients, and the technology is being commercialized by Cleveland-based company Glengary Brain Health, co-founded by Dr. Pieper. "Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer's reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team led by investigators at Mass General Brigham and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has developed and validated an artificial intelligence (AI)–based noninvasive tool that can predict the likelihood that a patient's oropharyngeal cancer-a type of head and neck cancer that develops in the throat-will spread, thereby signaling which patients should receive aggressive treatment. "Our tool may help identify which patients should receive multiple interventions or would be ideal candidates for clinical trials of intensive strategies such as immunotherapy or additional chemotherapy," said senior author Benjamin Kann, MD, of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) Program at Mass General Brigham and a radiation oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital. "Our tool can also help identify which patients should undergo de-intensification of treatment, such as surgery alone." Treatments for oropharyngeal cancer, including combinations of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, can be difficult to tolerate and may have lasting negative effects. Therefore, it's important to identify subgroups of patients who may benefit from less or more intensive treatment approaches. One way to accomplish this involves assessing whether the patient has pathologic extranodal extension (ENE), which occurs when cancer cells invade beyond the lymph node into surrounding tissue. Currently, ENE can only be definitively diagnosed by surgically removing and examining lymph nodes. To provide a method to assess ENE before treatment decisions are made, Kann and colleagues developed an AI-based tool that can take imaging data from computed tomography scans and predict the number of lymph nodes with ENE, an indicator of a patient's prognosis and likelihood of benefiting from intensified therapy. When the tool was applied to imaging scans from 1,733 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma, the tool was able to predict uncontrolled cancer spread and worse patient survival. Integrating the AI's assessment into established clinical risk predictors improved risk stratification, leading to more accurate predictions of survival and cancer spread in individual patients. "The AI tool enables the prediction of number of lymph nodes with ENE, which could not be done before, and shows that it is a powerful, novel prognostic biomarker for oropharyngeal cancer that could be used to improve the current staging scheme and treatment planning," said Kann.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Volume 12 of Oncoscience on October 14, 2025, titled "Bridging clinical insight and laboratory model in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) using DNA sequencing-based profiling of TP53." The findings validate OVCAR3 as a reliable model for HGSOC and provide researchers with a valuable laboratory tool for developing targeted therapeutic strategies. HGSOC is responsible for the majority of ovarian cancer-related deaths, largely due to its late diagnosis and resistance to standard therapies. To determine whether OVCAR3 can effectively represent clinical cases, the researchers compared its genetic profile to that of clinical ovarian cancer samples. Using Sanger sequencing, a widely used and cost-effective genetic analysis method, they found that both the lab and clinical samples shared the same non-mutated form of the TP53 gene, a key marker often altered in ovarian cancer. This result supports the relevance of OVCAR3 in modeling disease behavior. The study also explored how two repurposed drugs-metformin and chlorpromazine (CPZ)-affect ovarian cancer cells. Cell death measurements and colony formation assays showed that while each drug had moderate effects alone, the combination significantly reduced cancer cell survival. These results were consistent across both clinical and laboratory samples, further validating the model's accuracy in predicting therapeutic responses. By aligning laboratory experiments with clinical data, the research strengthens the foundation for more accurate preclinical testing, an essential step toward personalized medicine and more effective cancer treatments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By engineering a system replicating the womb lining with high biological accuracy, researchers at the Babraham Institute and Stanford University have been able to study the implantation of human embryos, opening up this enigmatic process to investigation. This now allows scientists to study interactions between the womb and embryo, and look for the causes behind implantation failure, a main reason for early pregnancy loss, and the origins of pregnancy complications. "Understanding embryo implantation and embryo development just after implantation has significant clinical relevance as these stages are particularly prone to failure," said Dr Peter Rugg-Gunn, senior group leader at the Babraham Institute who led the study. "In particular, the high rate of implantation failure represents one of the main limiting factors for IVF success." The team isolated two essential cell types that form endometrial tissue – epithelial cells and stromal cells – from tissue donated by healthy people who had endometrial biopsies. Information from donated endometrial tissue was used to identify the tissue components that give the womb lining its structure. Once assembled, this formed an advanced replica of the womb lining, matching a biopsy of endometrial tissue in terms of cellular architecture, and showing responses to hormone stimulation that indicate the engineered womb lining's receptivity for embryo implantation. The team tested their model using donated early-stage human embryos from IVF procedures, and found that the embryo – at this point a compact ball of cells – underwent the expected stages expected of adhesion and invasion into the endometrial scaffold. Following implantation, the embryos increased secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a biochemical marker used in pregnancy tests to confirm pregnancy, and other pregnancy-associated proteins. Dr Rugg-Gunn said: "We were really excited to see that our system released essential factors that are needed to nourish the embryo in the first few weeks of pregnancy. Their results provide new insight into the complex interactions between the embryo and endometrial environment that underpin embryo development immediately after implantation. Dr Irene Zorzan, co-first author of the study and postdoctoral fellow, explained the impact of the model to this field of research: "Embryo implantation and post-implantation development are crucial events normally hidden from view, and this has limited our ability to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this critical phase. "Now, we can witness the unexplored aspects of the earliest moments of development and uncover new insight into how the foundations of a successful pregnancy are laid". In addition to extending our textbook understanding of development at this crucial stage, the team's model could be used to detect differences in the endometrial response in the embryo-womb lining communication for individuals experiencing infertility issues and also to test treatments that may increase reception of the embryo by the endometrium. Dr Sarah Elderkin, co-first author of the study and senior research scientist, concluded: "The synchronised communications between the embryo and womb lining are essential for a healthy baby and a healthy mother. Our model provides the ability for us to understand how this connection is established at implantation with implications for infertility, improving pregnancy success and early identification of pregnancy disorders. We are hugely grateful to people who donate surplus embryos to enable research like ours, without whom it wouldn't be possible."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have engineered a protein able to record the incoming chemical signals of brain cells (as opposed to just their outgoing signals). These whisper-quiet incoming messages are the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate, which plays a critical role in how brain cells communicate with one another but until now has been extremely difficult to capture. The special protein that researchers at the Allen Institute and HHMI's Janelia Research Campus have engineered is a molecular "glutamate indicator" called iGluSnFR4 (pronounced 'glue sniffer'). It's sensitive enough to detect the faintest incoming signals between neurons in the brain, offering a new way to decipher and interpret their complex cascade of electrical activity that underpins learning, memory, and emotion. The findings have just been published in Nature Methods and could transform how neuroscience research is done as it pertains to measuring and analyzing neural activity. To understand the significance of this discovery, it helps to understand how the brain works: billions of neurons "talk" to each other by sending pulses of electricity down their branch-like axons. It's like a row of falling dominos, but vastly more complex: Each neuron receives inputs from thousands of other neurons, and specific patterns and combinations of those input neurons firing is what makes the next (receiving) neuron fire. With this new discovery, scientists can now identify the critical patterns and combinations of input neuron activity that cause the next neurons to fire. Until now, detecting these incoming signals in living brain tissue was nearly impossible. Now researchers can hear the entire conversation rather than fragments of it. The incoming signals were always too faint and fast to capture, until now. "Neuroscientists have pretty good ways of measuring structural connections between neurons, and in separate experiments, we can measure what some of the neurons in the brain are saying, but we haven't been good at combining these two kinds of information. "What we have invented here is a way of measuring information that comes into neurons from different sources, and that's been a critical part missing from neuroscience research." "The success of iGluSnFR4 stems from our close collaboration started at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus between the GENIE Project team and Kaspar's lab. That research has extended to the phenomenal in vivo characterization work done by the Allen Institute's Neural Dynamics group," said Jeremy Hasseman, Ph.D., a scientist with HHMI's Janelia Research Campus. "This was a great example of collaboration across labs and institutes to enable new discoveries in neuroscience." This discovery removes a significant barrier in modern neuroscience: the inability to clearly monitor and make sense of how brain cells receive information. With this powerful new tool available to researchers through Addgene, some of the brain's deepest mysteries may soon be revealed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have used a cutting-edge robotic system capable of synthesizing hundreds of metal complexes to develop a possible antibiotic candidate - offering fresh hope in the global fight against drug-resistant infections. This rapid screening process identified a promising new iridium-based antibiotic candidate that kills bacteria while remaining non-toxic to human cells. As bacteria become increasingly resistant to existing treatments, the world faces a silent pandemic. Over one million people die annually from preventable drug-resistant infections. Without new drugs, routine procedures such as hip replacements, chemotherapy and organ transplants could soon become life-threateningly dangerous due to the risk of untreatable infection. This unique geometry allows them to interact with bacteria in completely different ways, potentially overcoming the resistance mechanisms that defeat current drugs. However, the Frei Lab utilized robotics and "click" chemistry – a method where two molecular components are "bolted" together efficiently – to supercharge the process. Postdoctoral researcher Dr David Husbands used this automated platform to combine almost 200 different "ligands" (molecules that surround a metal centre) with five different metals. The result was the synthesis of over 700 new metal complexes in just under a week – a task that would typically take months of manual labour. One compound in particular – a complex based on the metal iridium – stood out. It demonstrated high effectiveness against bacteria, including strains similar to the deadly MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), while displaying low toxicity to human cells. Traditional screening methods are slow and the pharmaceutical industry has largely withdrawn from this space due to low returns on investment. By combining smart 'click' chemistry with automation, we have demonstrated that we can explore vast, untapped areas of chemical space at unprecedented speed. We aren't just looking for one drug; we are proving a methodology that can help us find the 'needle in the haystack' much faster. This approach could be the key to avoiding a future where routine infections become fatal again." Historically, there has been a misconception that metal-based drugs are inherently toxic. However, data from the Community for Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery (CO-ADD) suggests that metal complexes actually have a higher "hit rate" for being antibacterial without being toxic compared to standard organic molecules. The University of York team hopes that this new methodology will encourage the wider scientific community and pharmaceutical companies to revisit metal complexes. The team is now working to understand exactly how their new iridium compound attacks bacteria and is expanding their robotic platform to test other metals. The research also demonstrated that this rapid-synthesis method could be applied to other fields, such as discovering new catalysts for industrial processes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using detailed geographic data and open-source routing tools, researchers reveal stark regional differences in how easily Australians can reach hospitals, GPs, and pharmacies, creating a powerful new resource to study healthcare access nationwide. Study: Travel times and distances to health services in Australia. Geographic accessibility is an important aspect of healthcare delivery, referring to the ease with which people can physically reach healthcare services. It is commonly assessed by analyzing factors such as the availability of healthcare facilities (supply), population distribution (demand), and transportation networks. A 2020 report revealed that more than 42,000 people living in inner regional, outer regional, remote, or very remote areas of Australia lacked access to any primary healthcare service within a one-hour drive. In addition, approximately 65,000 individuals lacked access to a general practice (GP) within one hour. Limited geographic access has been associated with lower healthcare utilization and poorer health outcomes. In the present study, researchers estimated modeled driving distances and travel times to the nearest healthcare services in Australia using only car-based routing. Health service coordinates were indexed using k-d trees to efficiently retrieve the ten nearest candidate providers to each mesh block centroid. Map of Australia divided into Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2s), color-coded based on the shortest travel time to each type of health service.Map of Australia divided into Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2s), color-coded based on the shortest travel time to each type of health service. Data on mesh blocks (MBs), the smallest geographic units defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), were used. Centroids were calculated using a geographic information system (GIS), specifically QGIS. Each centroid record was linked to higher-level geographic classifications, including Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2), and the corresponding state or territory. The dataset was further linked to population counts, postal areas, and Modified Monash Model (MMM) classifications. MMM categorizes areas by population size and remoteness, while postal areas represent ABS mesh block approximations of postcode boundaries. OpenStreetMap data for Australia was used to initialize an Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) server. The OSRM table service computed modeled driving distances and travel times from each mesh block centroid to the nearest private and public hospitals, GPs, EDs, bulk-billing GPs, and pharmacies. The higher density of pharmacies and GPs meant that most residents could access these services within a ten-minute drive. In contrast, residents of the Australian Capital Territory exhibited relatively long travel times to emergency departments and public hospitals, likely reflecting the limited number of such facilities despite the territory's small geographic size. The Northern Territory showed relatively flat travel-time distributions, reflecting sparse health facility coverage and wide variability in travel distances. This study describes a nationally consistent dataset capturing car-based healthcare accessibility across Australia. The use of OSRM provided routing results comparable to commercial navigation services, although travel times may be underestimated where road routes are unavailable. The public release of this dataset supports research into healthcare access, utilization, and outcomes, promotes methodological consistency across studies, and offers a framework that can be adapted to other countries.
