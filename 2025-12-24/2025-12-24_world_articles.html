                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eighteen Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging a new Trump administration policy seeking to bar transgender care for minors at federally-funded hospitals. The latest proposal by the Department of Health and Human Services focuses on hospitals' provision of gender identity care for transgender minors. However, the administration has also taken steps to attack transgender medical care for all ages, as part of a broad campaign against transgender rights that has included barring their participation in the military, eliminating references to transgender people from government websites, and ending programs to collect data on trans related health issues. The states' lawsuit centers on a proposal, announced in a December 18 declaration by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to target hospitals that provide transgender medical care, such as puberty blockers, to minors, by barring their participation in federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Kennedy claimed that the procedures failed to “meet professionally recognized standards of care.” The challengers allege that this policy would violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which puts guardrails on how executive branch agencies implement policies. The states claim the policy unlawfully interferes with their administration of Medicaid and it impedes on states' authority to regulate medical practices within their borders. “Health care decisions should be made by patients, families, and their providers – not by politicians making false claims about the safety of care,” Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. The other states bringing the lawsuit are Oregon, Washington, New York, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin, as well as the District of Columbia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than a year after the storm ripped apart families and farms, growers are bullish about strength of their industry Christmas tree farmers in western North Carolina are still rebuilding from last year's devastating Hurricane Helene, but growers are optimistic about business and the overall strength of their industry in the region. “There's still a lot of recovery that needs to happen, but we're in much better shape than we were this time last year … sales are good,” Kevin Gray, owner of Hickory Creek Farm Christmas Trees in Greensboro, said earlier this month, while the buying season was in full swing. As people all over the nation thrill to the twinkling lights and accumulating gifts under the boughs this festive season, few who buy a real tree may spare a thought for where it came from. In October, 2024, Helene tore through the region, killing at least 95 people and causing widespread damage to homes, farms, roads, land and infrastructure. Officials estimated that the storm, at one stage a category 4, caused about $125m in losses of ornamental nurseries and Christmas trees alone. A year later, while full recovery for some farms is still distant, many growers said their sales before the holidays were lively. At Avery Farms, a 200-year-old family operation in Avery county, Helene ripped out about 80,000 of their Christmas trees, wrecked fields, equipment and buildings, and destroyed the home of manager Graham Avery's parents. That fall, the family sold what they could to the customers: a limited number of trees, wreaths, boughs and improvised tabletop trees fashioned from salvaged tops. Avery's parents' home was rebuilt with help from “lots of people donating their time” and they moved back in just a month ago. The family bulldozed damaged fields, fertilized the soil and planted about 20,000 trees this spring, a long-term project to regain pre-Helene output, as Christmas trees take from six to 12 years to mature. Even with significantly reduced inventory, Avery said, this season's sales have been “very, very good” and the farm has doubled its wreath output and is shipping them nationwide. “We had a great spring with April rainfall,” she said, noting the trees “have actually had a great growing season”. Dee Clark, owner of Christmas Corner and C&G Nursery in Avery county, shared similar optimism, despite retail sales plummeting last year when a road washed out and remained closed until summer. “Early indications look promising,” Clark, 63, said, earlier in December. He added that his son had developed social-marketing efforts to boost sales. Clark, who said the storm “almost put us out of business”, has focused on repairs, replanting and restoring the land. He expects it will take years to replace lost trees, and knows many growers face a similar, long climb. But, he said: “The Christmas tree industry in western North Carolina as a whole is probably the best shape it's ever been in as far as the supply of trees right now.” At Cartner's Christmas Tree Farm, owner Sam Cartner said he felt fortunate no lives or homes were lost in the flooding, but said landslides destroyed up to 10,000 trees. “We probably won't ever be able to plant those areas back, because the topsoil slid off,” he said. One of their trees was even selected last year to be displayed at the White House. Jamie Bookwalter, an extension specialist at North Carolina State University, recalled attending its send-off ceremony in Avery county. “That Christmas tree represented a lot of people problem-solving,” she said, “which I think is what this area of the country is kind of known for: resiliency, problem-solving and self-reliance.” “Helene was a terrible event, but farming in general is just becoming more difficult as temperatures become more unpredictable and we get wetter periods – the wetter periods are wetter, the drier periods are drier,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on Tuesday that guard members, as they have in other deployments in large cities, will be tasked with supporting federal law enforcement partners, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. Parnell added that the national guard troops will be deployed through February. “And so a big shoutout to both of them.” Critics have argued a national guard deployment is unwarranted and could cause fear in the community, and they point out that New Orleans has actually seen a decrease in violent crime rates. Landry has praised Trump for sending troops to other cities, including Washington DC and Memphis, Tennessee. Trump on Sunday announced he was appointing the governor to serve as his special envoy to Greenland, the strategic, vast and semi-autonomous territory of Denmark that Trump has said the US needs to take over. New Orleans has been on pace for much of the year to have its lowest number of murders in decades, according to preliminary data from the city's police department. There have been 97 homicides in 2025 as of 1 November, including 14 revelers who were killed on New Year's Day during a truck attack on Bourbon Street. A US army veteran driving a pickup truck that bore the flag of the Islamic State group wreaked carnage on New Orleans' raucous new year's celebration as he steered around a police blockade and slammed into revelers before being shot dead by police. There were 124 homicides last year and 193 in 2023, according to city figures. Armed robberies, aggravated assaults, carjackings, shootings and property crimes have also trended downward. New Orleans is no stranger to having national guard members in the city.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After courting coal miners during his campaign, Trump has left a trail of broken promises. Independent journalism at Truthout faces unprecedented authoritarian censorship. If you value progressive media, please make a year-end donation today. James Bounds has been working in the mines since 1969. “I wanted to continue to work … and mining pay, y'know, so I can keep things going here at the house.” It wasn't until 2009, years after he was forced into retirement, that Bounds started receiving black lung benefits. For many miners in Appalachia, this year was supposed to be one of progress in which they would finally see a commitment to solving the issue of black lung. Last year, on April 18, 2024, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) issued its final rule, Lowering Miners' Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica and Improving Respiratory Protection, which aimed to reduce miners' exposure to an airborne compound that is a major cause of black lung, and improve respiratory protection for all airborne hazards. “Every time they delay it, you can count the lives that you lost in between delays and that really burdens me down. It really makes me sad that people have to give their life before they are able to pass anything,” he said. They can't make a living for their family.” In an April 8 executive order, President Donald Trump also required agencies to rescind any policies “that seek to transition the Nation away from coal production or otherwise establish preferences against coal as a generation resource.” Trump frequently campaigned with coal miners during his 2016 presidential run, and has since continued to participate in photo-ops using miners as a symbolic backdrop for his energy policies while campaigning and serving in office. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay of the final rule in response to a petition from the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association, which is challenging the rule in court. Soon after, it announced a temporary enforcement pause until August 18, citing “unforeseen NIOSH restructuring” and “other technical reasons.” Further updates were supposed to be announced in October, but they never came. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, was slated to lose at least 900 workers, which represents more than 90 percent of the entire agency workforce, as part of a “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) plan. After facing considerable pushback from labor (specifically coal miner organizations) and congressional lawmakers (including Republicans from West Virginia), and a federal lawsuit brought by a coal miner, the Trump administration changed plans regarding the planned layoffs at the federal health agency. Similarly, the administration also dropped plans to terminate leases and close 34 offices in the MSHA, after considerable pushback from mining communities. NIOSH is important to implement the rule well, and because the administration sillily or stupidly cut NIOSH staff, they also couldn't enforce the rule,” said Quenton King, government affairs specialist at Appalachian Voices. “I'm happy to work with the Black Lung Association, which is former coal miners, Trump voters. “It feels like a betrayal of what he promised people. But I think that's been very common throughout his administration.” “Capito, Miller, and Moore, they ain't doing nothing. Whatever Trump wants, they just back,” said Gary Hairston, 71, a retired coal miner from West Virginia who is the president of the National Black Lung Association, referring to West Virginia's congress members Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, Rep. Carol Miller, and Rep. Riley Moore. “They're worried about the coal mine itself,” he said. On another front, coal miners suffering from black lung also continue to fight for better benefits and a streamlined process to access the benefits. Inflation increased 8 percent in 2022, but in January 2023, the black lung monthly benefit only increased 4 percent, according to Appalachian Voices. The benefit for a miner and a dependent in 2025 is $1,178 a month — more than $3,000 lower than the average cost of living for people in coal communities like Indiana County, Pennsylvania; Pike County, Kentucky; and Kanawha County, West Virginia, Appalachian Voices reported. For the last several years, the Black Lung Benefits Improvement Act has been introduced in Congress but has not progressed, explained King. “It's going to be introduced hopefully soon this year,” he said. “It would raise the stipend to be in line with inflation every year. So the value is worth less than it used to be. But now, since people are getting black lung in their 40's, that's 25 years of not working. So the benefit is more important now than it used to be,” King said. Despite Trump's plans for achieving American energy dominance and reinvigorating America's “Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,” miners can't help but notice that his executive order leaves out an essential part of the industry — the miners themselves. “Well, I think they forgot about the coal miners. They always say that we keep the lights on, but they don't never show it to the coal miners. Seems like we just a number to them. And they just put somebody else in our place.” December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a churchyard, about 100 miles west of London, the rain drives at a 45-degree slant, pounding the stone footpath so hard it bounces back as white fuzz that hovers just below the ankle. St Mary's Church is the 14th-century nucleus of Painswick, a town in the Cotswolds, a region in southwest England famed for its hills and honey-colored cottages. It is a chunk of that Jane Austen-esque, close-to-cloyingly twee England that has long attracted tourists and homebuyers — sometimes despite the weather. Lately, though, local real estate agents told CNN, increasing numbers of Americans are calling it home. According to those agents, some want their children to attend prestigious British schools and universities; others seek a bucolic, slower pace of life. Some feel pushed to leave the United States by the threat of wildfires or gun violence, or by political changes they oppose. She described living vicariously through the pages of Country Life, a British property magazine teeming with glossy photos of manor houses and their multi-acres. “It was love at first sight,” she said of her new home. Katy Campbell, Schultz's buying agent — a type of realtor finding properties and negotiating their prices on behalf of buyers — told CNN that she's seen a 20% increase in the number of American clients over the past year. Historically, a big chunk of these clients were already living in the UK — usually London — when they came to buy their countryside boltholes. Now, Campbell said she's fielding more calls from Americans based in the United States, and has grown familiar with their tastes. “So you can be fairly incognito in the Cotswolds.” Naturally, Campbell won't name names, but did say that some clients are “from films.” The Cotswolds span several of England's “shires” and are sprinkled with British celebrities. David Beckham regularly posts vignettes of life on his Oxfordshire estate to Instagram, including making honey and digging for vegetables. American celebrities have also drawn attention to the area. Comedian Ellen DeGeneres helped put the area on international radars when she moved there from California in 2024. Vice President JD Vance spent part of his family vacation in the Cotswolds this summer. Ellen DeGeneres says she was ‘kicked out of show business.' “This tiny town is full of characters like the tiny town in North Carolina I grew up in,” she said, noting that she allows plenty of time for trips to the local library as she expects to stop for several conversations along the way. “The Hamptons is much more whizzy,” Shultz said. Buying agent Harry Gladwin said he noticed the number of enquiries from America beginning to rise late last year. They are up around 30% since then, he noted, with some clients citing politics as a key motivation to move. Gladwin said he recently helped an American client purchase a manor house dating back to the 1300s. Pennsylvanian Lauren Neely is a student of that history. The 35-year-old writer of historical fiction moved to Painswick with her husband and two children six months ago. So when a work opportunity cropped up for her husband near Painswick, they jumped. “I think it dates from the 1700s,” Neely said. “(There are) these beautiful archways where you can see where three carriages would have been.” She describes it as “modest” compared with others nearby. “We're not coming from generational wealth, or the higher privilege that some do, especially here in the Cotswolds,” she added. Neely is embracing her new life in Painswick. She said her husband and son are ensconced in the local football scene and believes the locally sourced food has improved her family's health. Yet, Neely said, “there isn't much that we miss.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police officers involved in the torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in an explosion in Moscow, sources within Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 24. Russia's Investigative Committee confirmed that the explosion killed two police officers. Ukrainian intelligence sources said the officers had previously taken part in Russia's war against Ukraine and were implicated in the abuse of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs). The intelligence sources said the attack took place at around 1 a.m., when a local resident approached a police car parked near a police station and threw an improvised explosive device through the vehicle's window. Russian authorities have not confirmed this claim. Russia's Investigative Committee said it opened a criminal case under articles related to attempts on the life of law enforcement officers and the illegal trafficking of explosive devices. The incident follows another high-profile attack in Moscow earlier this week. On Dec. 22, Fanil Sarvarov, head of the operational training department of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, was killed in a car bombing, the Investigative Committee reported. Tim Zadorozhnyy is the reporter for the Kyiv Independent, specializing in foreign policy, U.S.-Ukraine relations, and political developments across Europe and Russia.

Tim is fluent in English, Ukrainian, and Russian. "'May he perish,' each of us may think to ourselves," Zelensky said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kyiv Independent's Myroslava Chauin speaks with Kateryna Rashevska, a legal expert at the Regional Center for Human Rights and a children's rights activist, about evidence that Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied territories were transferred to a children's camp in North Korea. The plant, located in the town of Efremov, produces dual-use synthetic rubber and polymers used in military vehicle tires, armored personnel carriers, and other weapons-related applications. "The role of unmanned systems on the battlefield is growing, and therefore the production of innovative instruments of war is our number one priority," Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said. Ukrainian intelligence sources said the officers had previously taken part in Russia's war against Ukraine and were implicated in the abuse of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs). While many respondents expressed hopes for an end to the fighting, they largely expect it to conclude on terms "proclaimed as its goals," reflecting continued alignment with the Kremlin's narrative. That is the main threat," plant director Serhii Tarakanov said. A Ukrainian drone attack in Russia's Belgorod Oblast killed one person and injured three others, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov claimed late on Dec. 23.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Volodymyr Zelensky speaks at the EU Summit in Brussels on Dec. 18.Geert Vanden Wijngaert/The Associated Press The United States and Ukraine have reached a consensus on several critical issues aimed at bringing an end to the nearly four-year conflict, but sensitive issues around territorial control in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, along with the management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, remain unresolved, Ukraine's president said. The draft proposal, which reflects Ukraine's wishes, intertwines political and commercial interests to safeguard security while boosting economic potential. Asked about the plan, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow would set out its position based on information received by Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met with U.S. envoys in Florida over the weekend. Peskov declined to share further details, saying that Moscow believed it was “highly inappropriate to conduct any kind of communication via the media.” U.S. intelligence shows Putin's territorial ambitions in Ukraine remain unchanged, sources say This is “the most difficult point,” Zelensky said. He said these matters will be discussed at the leaders level. In a bid to facilitate compromise, the United States has proposed transforming these areas into free economic zones. Ukraine insists that any arrangement must be contingent upon a referendum, allowing the Ukrainian people to determine their own fate. Dmitriev met with U.S. envoys in Florida over the weekend.Kristina Kormilitsyna/Reuters How the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest plant in Europe which is under Russian occupation, will be managed is another contentious issue. The U.S. is proposing a consortium with Ukraine and Russia, with each party having an equal stake in the enterprise. “But we have significantly brought most of the positions closer together. Zelensky said: “We are in a situation where the Russians want us to leave the Donetsk region, and the Americans are trying to find a way so that it is ‘not a way out' – because we are against leaving – they want to find a demilitarized zone or a free economic zone in this, that is, a format that can provide for the views of both sides.” Ukraine's stance is that any attempt to create a free economic zone must be ratified by a referendum, affirming that the Ukrainian people ultimately hold the decision-making power, Zelensky said. This process will require 60 days, he added, during which time hostilities should stop to allow the process to happen. “Since there is no faith in the Russians, and they have repeatedly broken their promises, today's contact line is turning into a line of a de facto free economic zone, and international forces should be there to guarantee that no one will enter there under any guise – neither ‘little green men' nor Russian military disguised as civilians,” Zelensky said. Ukraine is also proposing that the occupied city of Enerhodar, which is connected to the Zaporizhzhia power plant, be a demilitarized free economic zone, Zelensky said. This point required 15 hours of discussions with the U.S., he said. “It is clear that for Ukraine this sounds very unsuccessful and not entirely realistic. How can you have joint commerce with the Russians after everything?” Opinion: Ukraine has earned the right to shape its own future. Washington and Moscow are denying it that right The document ensures that Ukraine will be provided with “strong” security guarantees that mirror NATO's Article 5, which would obligate Ukraine's partners to act in the event of renewed Russian aggression. Zelensky said that a separate bilateral document with the U.S. will outline these guarantees. This agreement will detail the conditions under which security will be provided, particularly in the event of a renewed Russian assault, and will establish a mechanism to monitor the ceasefire. “The mood of the United States of America is that this is an unprecedented step towards Ukraine on their part. The draft contains other elements including keeping Ukraine's army at 800,000 during peace time, and by nailing down a specific date for ascension to the European Union. Ukraine would like to receive short-term privileged access to the European market and a robust global development package, that will cover a wide-range of economic interests, including a development fund to invest in industries including technology, data centres and artificial intelligence, as well as gas. The goal will be to attract US$800-billion through equity, grants, loans and private sector contributions. Ukraine is also asking that all prisoners since 2014 be released at once, and that civilian detainees, political prisoners and children be returned to Ukraine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Volodymyr Zelensky speaks at the EU Summit in Brussels on Dec. 18. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would be willing to withdraw troops from the country's eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end Russia's war, if Moscow also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarized zone monitored by international forces. The proposal offered another potential compromise on control of the Donbas region, which has been a major sticking point in peace negotiations. But it was unclear what that idea would mean for governance or development of the region. A similar arrangement could be possible for the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently under Russian control, Zelensky said. Zelensky spoke to reporters Tuesday to describe an overarching 20-point plan that negotiators from Ukraine and the U.S. hammered out in Florida in recent days, though he said many details are still being discussed. In fact, Moscow has insisted that Ukraine relinquish the remaining territory it still holds in the Donbas – an ultimatum that Ukraine has rejected. Asked about the plan, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Moscow would decide its position based on information received by Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met with U.S. envoys in Florida over the weekend. U.S. intelligence shows Putin's territorial ambitions in Ukraine remain unchanged, sources say American negotiators have engaged in a series of talks with Ukraine and Russia separately since U.S. President Donald Trump presented a plan to end the war last month – a proposal widely seen as favouring Moscow, which invaded its neighbour nearly four years ago. Meanwhile, on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the U.S. has proposed creating a consortium with Ukraine and Russia, in which each party would have an equal stake. Zelensky countered with a proposal for a joint venture between the U.S. and Ukraine, in which the Americans would be able to decide how to distribute their share, including giving some of it to Russia. Zelensky acknowledged that the U.S. has not yet accepted Ukraine's counter-proposals. “But we have significantly brought most of the positions closer together,” Zelensky said. Creating the demilitarized economic zone in the Donbas would require difficult discussions on how far troops would be required to move back and where international forces would be stationed, Zelensky said, adding that it should discussed at the leaders level. This point required 15 hours of discussions with the U.S., he said, and no agreement was reached. “How can you have joint commerce with the Russians after everything?” he asked. The working draft ensures that Ukraine will receive “strong” security guarantees that would require Ukraine's partners to act in the event of renewed Russian aggression. That would mirror NATO's Article 5, which says an armed attack on one member of the alliance is an attack on all. Zelensky said a separate document with the U.S. will outline these guarantees. “The mood of the United States of America is that this is an unprecedented step toward Ukraine on their part. The draft contains other elements, including keeping Ukraine's army at 800,000 during peacetime and making Ukraine a member of the European Union by a specific date. Limiting the size of Ukraine's military is a key Russian demand. Opinion: Ukraine has earned the right to shape its own future. Ukraine would like to receive short-term privileged access to the European market and a robust global development package that would include the creation of a development fund to solicit outside investment in Ukraine's industries. Other points include raising funds for Ukraine's reconstruction, with the goal of attracting $800 billion through equity, grants, loans and private sector contributions. Ukraine is also asking that all prisoners taken since 2014 be released at once, and that civilian detainees, political prisoners and children be returned to Ukraine. In other developments, an explosion in Moscow on Wednesday killed three people, including two police officers, Russian investigators said, days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking general not far away. An official from Ukraine's military intelligence agency, known as GUR, told the Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation. Another official from the agency said the police officers had taken part in Russia's war in Ukraine, without providing details.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Mark Hayward realised there was no cavalry coming to save Ukraine after the Russian invasion, he decided to go himself. Mr Hayward, a former member of the US special forces, initially believed America would uphold its security promises to Ukraine made decades earlier in the Budapest Memorandum. The ex-Green Beret is one of what are believed to be thousands of American soldiers who, alongside those from Britain, Australia and other countries, signed up to defend Ukraine. Many of them had long passed their physical prime, and some of the tools they were given to fight that war, including those supplied by the US, were barely fit for purpose in those early days. Fighting in Ukraine meant going up against an enemy vastly bigger and better equipped than themselves, relying on their ability to improvise and never knowing if their makeshift weapons would quite literally blow up in their faces. But many of that group, like Mr Hayward, had lived and served through the Cold War. Years after leaving active duty, his status as a member of the elite special forces still carried some amount of mystique. Mr Hayward moved to Nome on Alaska's Seward Peninsula after leaving the army, and it was while working for a health non-profit on St Lawrence Island, a remote stretch of land on the Bering Sea, that Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. There is high ground on the western side of the island where you can see mainland Russia, which for years has used its warships and fighter jets to menace Alaska. That made the invasion “a little more personal”, he said. Russia's campaign was meant to be a lightning offensive, sending columns of tanks across the Ukrainian border to seize Kyiv and take over its government in about three days. Fighting has now been raging for more than three years. He flew back to Nome from St Lawrence Island soon after and told his wife: “Babe, this is the war that I trained to fight.” She shrugged and said she'd been thinking the same thing, he said. “When I went into special forces, the training model was still very much the sort of unconventional warfare model where you wind up in somebody else's backyard and you're cut off from resources,” Mr Hayward said. “You're working with a local population trying to resist an army of occupation.” The Ukrainian military does not release figures on the number of American volunteers who have come across since war broke out, but estimates range from 1,000 to several times that number. Within those ranks, there is a range of motivations. Many, but not all, make the journey because of their outrage at Russia's unprovoked invasion of its neighbour, its brutal tactics and war crimes that have come to light in Bucha and elsewhere. “Some people come to Ukraine with a motive to fight for freedom, for what is right,” Senior Lt Mykola Lavrenyuk, the Ukrainian commander of a platoon, told The New York Times in September. “Others want to make money or are running from the law.” Mr Hayward falls firmly into the former camp. That was how he found himself, one interview with a military attaché later, crossing the border into Ukraine from Poland on March 12 in a restored ambulance. Before that, Mr Hayward had spent a few days preparing in Kraków. Mr Hayward felt a sense of kinship with the strange creature, seemingly an imitation of Kraków's 20-feet tall, fire-breathing Wawel Dragon Statue. And there are war fighters who make me look like what I am, a middle-aged, overweight, former action guy.” An estimated seven million have fled Ukraine since the war broke out, many heading first to Poland before heading further afield: to the US, Britain and elsewhere. The plan was to meet up with a contact in Ukraine's International Legion at a petrol station, which went “like s---”. It later turned out Russia had launched cruise missiles at one of the legion's bases: that person was either dead or busy trying to survive. Neither of them knew the first thing about the British weapons, which only entered service in 2009, and had to spend a night poring over an instruction manual before a training session the next morning. He also learnt another lesson: improvisation was not just a way of life in Ukraine but the only way to survive. Supplied with the passwords that would allow him to bypass military checkpoints, Mr Hayward headed south to Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine which Russia had failed to capture despite intense shelling. Javelin missiles had been sent over by Donald Trump's first administration in 2018, but they “were so convinced that Ukraine was going to fall next week that they stripped out everything that might be useful”, he said. “We're going to take out the tactical manuals. We're going to take out the spare battery. We're going to take out all that useful s---,” he recalled. “What these b------s were sending us was stripped, not equipped.” “That was an act of desperation,” he said. “People were telling us that it not only wouldn't work, but that it would destroy the launcher”, a piece of kit worth more than $200,000 (£148,000). “But otherwise it was effectively an expensive paperweight. Its only military use would be to try and bludgeon someone with it. “I think this battery will work and it probably won't blow up your launcher. Mind if I try it?” Mr Hayward said he told the Ukrainians. From an old metal shop, the Mykolaiv team built an operating table out of aircraft aluminium that was light enough for a medic to carry, durable enough to support a soldier wearing their gear, and compact enough to fit in an SUV. Before that, one surgeon had been forced to operate on patients on their kitchen tables because the Nato-supplied folding hospital beds would collapse under strain. And Mr Hayward said oscillating saws, the kind he might use to cut through dry wall back home in Alaska, were being used by medics for speedy battlefield amputations. “I can't understand why my country isn't looking at Ukraine and saying, ‘We want every one of these men and women on our side, because these guys and gals are force multipliers like you read about.' Not everything has a solution that's elegant or cheap, however. Mr Hayward said most of his money had gone on vehicle repairs and petrol, having drained his savings and run up a $50,000 (£37,000) debt on a credit card.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anders Vistisen, a member of the European Parliament from the Danish People's Party, believes that US President Donald Trump can take control of Greenland without 'firing a shot,' using economic methods. "The U.S. can gain control of Greenland without firing a shot - through investment, economic dependence and security-policy realities," he told Politico Europe. The member of the European Parliament also noted that Denmark "cannot defend Greenland alone," but he suggested that any military invasion would be "political suicide" for Washington. According to him, talk of Greenland's independence can turn the island into "an Arctic Puerto Rico." On December 22, the Danish Foreign Ministry summoned US Ambassador to Denmark Ken Howery in connection with Trump's appointment of Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as the country's special envoy to Greenland. On March 13, Trump stated that the United States would annex Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark. On March 4, he said he would approve of the island's people's decision to join the United States. He threatened to impose high tariffs on Denmark if it did not give up the island. Even during his first term, Trump offered to buy Greenland. In 1951, Washington and Copenhagen, in addition to their allied commitments to NATO, signed the Greenland Defense Treaty.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After weeks of talks, Ukraine and the U.S. have prepared a draft of the revised peace plan to end Russia's full-scale war. The initial 28-point plan, which effectively pushed Ukraine toward capitulation, has been reworked into a 20-point framework, which President Volodymyr Zelensky presented to journalists on Dec. 23 for the first time. In addition, a three-party security guarantee draft between Ukraine, the U.S., and Europe has been developed, as well as a bilateral security guarantee agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. Another document between Kyiv and Washington is focused on economic cooperation and was described as the "roadmap for Ukraine's prosperity." "We have made significant progress toward finalizing the documents," Zelensky said. Those signing a potential agreement from the European side are yet to be decided. The ceasefire is expected to start as soon as the agreement is signed. For the agreement to take effect it must be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament and/or supported by the people of Ukraine in a referendum that would take place potentially within 60 days. So far, Ukraine and the U.S. have not reached an agreement on two major issues in the revised plan, points 12 and 14 — control of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and control of the Donbas region, ravaged by war since 2014. The deal also does not mention Ukraine's aspirations for NATO membership. The signatories affirm that Ukraine is a sovereign state. A monitoring mechanism will be set up to oversee the conflict line using satellite-based unmanned surveillance, ensuring early detection of violations. The size of Ukraine's Armed Forces will remain at 800,000 personnel during peacetime. The U.S., NATO, and European signatory states will provide Ukraine with “Article 5–like" guarantees. A) If Russia invades Ukraine, a coordinated military response will be launched, and all global sanctions against Russia will be reinstated. B) If Ukraine invades Russia or opens fire at Russian territory without provocation, the security guarantees will be considered void. If Russia opens fire on Ukraine, the security guarantees will come into effect. C) The U.S. will receive compensation for providing security guarantees. D) Previously signed bilateral security agreements between Ukraine and around 30 countries will remain in place. Russia will formalize its non-aggression stance towards Europe and Ukraine in all necessary laws and documents, ratifying them by Russia's State Duma. Ukraine will become an EU member at a clearly designated time and will receive a short-term preferential access to the European market. "As of today, the timing of Ukraine's accession is a bilateral discussion between the United States and Ukraine, without European confirmation for now," Zelensky said. "Membership in the European Union is also our security guarantee, and therefore we want to set a date — when this will happen. Ukraine will receive a global development package, detailed in a separate agreement, covering various economic areas: A) A development fund will be created for investing in fast-growing industries, including technology, data centers, and artificial intelligence. B) The U.S. and U.S. companies will work with Ukraine to jointly invest in the restoration, modernization, and operation of Ukraine's gas infrastructure, including pipelines and storage facilities. C) Joint efforts will be made to rebuild war-torn areas, focusing on restoring and modernizing cities and residential neighborhoods. D) Infrastructure development will be prioritized. E) Extraction of minerals and natural resources will be expanded. F) The World Bank will provide a special funding package to support the acceleration of these efforts. G) A high-level working group will be established, including the appointment of a leading global financial expert as the prosperity administrator to oversee the implementation of the strategic recovery plan and future prosperity. Ukraine will accelerate the process of negotiating a free trade agreement with the U.S. Ukraine reaffirms its commitment to remaining a non-nuclear state, in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Ukraine opposes Russian control over the plant. “We believe that for all of this to take place and function safely, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the city of Enerhodar, and the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant must be demilitarized, because at present there are Russian troops and war there, and there is no necessary level of security,” Zelensky said. Ukraine will approve EU rules on religious tolerance and minority language protection. In Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, the line of military positions on the date of signing will be recognized as the de facto front line. A) To determine troop movements needed to end the war and set up potential "free economic zones," with Russia withdrawing its troops from these areas. B) Russia must withdraw its troops from occupied parts of Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv oblasts for the agreement to take effect. C) International forces will be placed along the front line to monitor the agreement's implementation. D) The parties agree to follow the rules and obligations imposed by the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols, including universal human rights. "So we are in a situation where the Russians want us to withdraw from Donetsk Oblast, while the Americans are trying to find a way for us not to withdraw because we are against withdrawal," Zelensky said. We fought for a single word — 'potential.' We believe that such potential economic zones can exist," he added. That is why it says 'potential zones' here. But if we do not agree to 'remain where we are,' there are two options: either the war continues, or something will have to be decided regarding all potential economic zones." Russia and Ukraine commit to refraining from using force to alter territorial arrangements and will resolve any disputes through diplomatic means. Russia will not obstruct Ukraine's use of the Dnipro River and the Black Sea for commercial purposes. A separate maritime agreement will ensure freedom of navigation and transport, with the Russian-occupied Kinburn Spit being demilitarized. Establishment of a humanitarian committee that will ensure the following: B) All detained civilians, including children and political prisoners, will be freed. C) Actions will be taken to address the problems and alleviate the suffering of conflict victims. Ukraine must hold presidential elections as soon as possible after the deal is signed. The deal will be legally binding. Its implementation will be monitored by the Peace Council, chaired by U.S. President Donald Trump. Ukraine, Europe, NATO, Russia, and the U.S. will be part of this process.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Why Stronger States Are More Fearful Than Weaker Ones A basic premise unites most foreign policy thinking: power begets security. Because no global police force can respond in times of trouble, states must accumulate power to ensure their safety. They must build strong militaries to protect their homelands and defend vital international interests. U.S. President Donald Trump is pursuing a military buildup and economic self-sufficiency to deter adversaries, a policy his advisers call “peace through strength.” Chinese leader Xi Jinping, meanwhile, is plowing money into the People's Liberation Army and the manufacturing sector to make his country “self-reliant and strong.” It is true that power can bolster security in purely material terms. Leaders and citizens alike want large militaries in order to feel safe, not simply for their own sakes. Yet almost no psychological research supports the idea that feelings of safety align with objective statistics about material power. The strong, it turns out, are far more likely than the weak to skip careful, reasoned analysis when making decisions. While the weak know they must think critically to navigate their surroundings, the strong imagine they can rely on stereotypes and other mental shortcuts to get by. To see whether this psychological finding applies to international relations, I examined how both foreign policy elites and ordinary people think about state power and threat perception. I looked specifically at the thinking of American decision-makers during the Cold War, Russian policymakers before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and contemporary Chinese and American publics. Their leaders and citizens imagine or exaggerate threats. As a result, they are more likely to support starting and escalating wars than individuals who feel their state is feeble. But this strategy is likely to have the opposite of its intended effect. Should Washington grow stronger, it will become more convinced that Beijing is a menace. The result could be a vicious cycle: as each country becomes more capable, it will feel more insecure, prompting further military buildups that drive each side's anxiety higher still. To avoid this outcome, officials in both the United States and China—and, indeed, in any strong country—should try to neutralize the psychological effects of power. That means they should pause before making decisions. They should carefully evaluate all available evidence regarding a potential threat rather than jumping to conclusions. One of the oldest and most dominant ideas in international relations is that power leads to security and weakness to insecurity. Or as Shakespeare's Henry IV observes, “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.” Psychologists directly studied the effects of strength in the aftermath of World War II in an effort to understand how supposedly normal individuals could commit acts of great cruelty when they felt powerful. In the infamous 1971 Stanford prison experiment, for example, psychologists assigned study participants to serve either as a hypothetical guard or as a hypothetical prisoner and found that the guards quickly turned abusive. A decade earlier, Stanley Milgram conducted notorious obedience experiments in which participants were instructed to administer electric shocks to another participant. (In reality, that other participant was an actor, simply pretending to get shocked.) Milgram's subjects continued to administer the supposed shocks when told to do so, even in doses that would have been lethal. These controversial studies provided initial indications that power can have corrupting effects on individual behavior—effects so corrupting that they inspired new protocols for research ethics in academia. In the decades that followed, researchers such as Susan Fiske and Dacher Keltner started testing these intuitions in a rigorous and scientific fashion. The findings were striking: a sense of power appeared to activate impulsive and intuitive thinking writ large. They were quicker to dehumanize others, engage in hypocrisy, and rely on racial biases when interacting with members of marginalized groups. They were less empathetic and saw others as threatening. The study, the experimenters wrote, suggested that power activates “Hobbesian” thinking marked by a tendency “to distrust others and therefore rely more on deterrence as a punishment motive.” Fiske, Keltner, and their colleagues, of course, were mostly studying how power affects individual thinking in controlled environments—a far cry from the high-stakes world of foreign policy decision-making. States, after all, generally have many institutions and bureaucracies designed to foster deliberation among competing voices. Yet my research found that the psychological literature was in fact highly relevant. One might hope that these effects would be tempered in democracies, where public opinion could constrain a leader's worst impulses. But in my surveys of American (and Chinese and Russian) citizens, I found that ordinary people who feel their country is stronger also have higher threat assessments and are more supportive of hawkish policies than those who feel their country is weaker. Democracies are therefore just as vulnerable to this kind of thinking. It was surrounded by dozens of capable, sovereign Indian nations. Even the U.S. founders were unsure whether their fledgling nation could survive. President George Washington regularly hosted and honored Indian delegations, just as he did European dignitaries, and paid these nations for land cessions. Dreams of enjoying “full security,” warned Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, were “too visionary to be a rule for national conduct.” Decision-makers concluded that Indian nations were not potential partners but intolerable threats. They relied more heavily on racialized stereotypes that portrayed Indians as warlike and irrational. The government therefore decided it had no choice but to attack them. In 1890, a religious movement known as the “Ghost Dance” sought to reunite participants with their ancestor's spirits to resist the United States' westward expansion and cultural assimilation. Rather than feeling safer with strength, the United States literally began chasing ghosts. Some of this aggression was driven by opportunity, not fear. With growing power, Washington could simply acquire more land than when it was weaker. The end of World War II brought about another massive increase in American power. Before the war, other governments could at least claim to be Washington's equals. But afterward, the United States had no true peer. France, Germany, and Japan had been torn apart. The United Kingdom avoided invasion, but it had suffered heavy casualties and German bombings had damaged its cities and industrial centers. The Soviet Union was closer in stature, but it, too, was exhausted: it suffered around 27 million military and civilian deaths, compared with fewer than 500,000 for the United States, and a number of its major cities were left devastated by German advances. Its economy and military paled in comparison with the United States's industrial might, blue-water navy, and network of overseas bases. Instead, leaders in Washington fretted more than they had before the war. From almost the moment Japan surrendered, U.S. officials began worrying about communist governments. Less than three months after its release, Truman had U.S. troops flood the Korean Peninsula in response to North Korea's invasion of its southern neighbor. But primed for suspicion, American officials interpreted the North's invasion as an attempt by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to start a chain reaction that would transform government after government into communist regimes (or what policymakers would later call “domino theory”), culminating in a world war aimed at the United States. If this was allowed to go unchallenged it would mean a third world war.” The far weaker British, by contrast, saw things more clearly. The Canadians, who were even weaker, went further in questioning Washington's response. The most urgent threat to international security, they assessed, was not Stalin, but rather an American overreaction in Korea. It was no longer merely the world's most powerful country. It was the first uncontested global superpower in human history. But even this lofty status failed to ease U.S. fears. A country that can deploy special operations forces around the world in 30 minutes and launch a full-scale ground invasion that topples regimes within days is more willing to start wars than one that can't. Washington's intelligence reports suggested that he lacked weapons of mass destruction. “We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud,” she explained. U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld put a finer point on it: “no terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people and the stability of the world than the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.” Bush's thinking was even less reasoned. Moscow, too, has a lengthy history of power-induced fear. In response, it began to worry more about American influence in Afghanistan and thus embarked on an incredibly costly invasion of the country. Today, Moscow is no longer a superpower, but it remains both strong and insecure. In fact, a 2020 survey of high-ranking Russian elites and government officials—including people in the armed forces and security agencies—found that officials who felt that Russian power was on the rise were the ones most likely to view Ukraine, the United States, and NATO as threats. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not among those surveyed, but he seems to hold similar views. His decision to invade Ukraine was no doubt motivated in part by irredentism. Yet in speeches and treatises justifying the war, he has repeatedly expressed fear that Washington will use Kyiv to threaten Russian security. Over the last 50 years, it has pulled off nothing short of an economic miracle. Yet China's surge to superpower status over the past half century does not seem to have solved Beijing's fundamental security concerns. The country's leader, Xi Jinping, has purged high-ranking officials from the party apparatus, ordered mass arrests of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region out of fear of domestic terrorism, and even restricted elements of Western culture in the Chinese media to quell perceived U.S. influence. The world, then, might seem as if it is headed in a very dangerous direction. It will, after all, be hard for the leaders of these various strong countries to become less fearful. But they can make better choices by actively trying to think like the weak—which is to say, deliberately, empathetically, and realistically. It is something that a strong United States, at least, has some experience with. Faced with what he saw as rising Soviet expansionism and an incoherent, costly, and increasingly militarized U.S. foreign policy, President Dwight Eisenhower initiated a top-secret review of grand strategy design in 1953. After reviewing their analysis, Eisenhower decided that a milder approach would work well and opted for a more cost-effective strategy of containment rather than a more expensive one of actively and aggressively rolling back Moscow's influence. Eisenhower's exercise did not require a pricey restructuring of bureaucracies and institutions. To avoid dangerous entanglements, strong states should do more of this. Such an exercise, for example, might steer Washington away from its current military buildup in the waters around Venezuela. Fentanyl is perhaps the primary cause of American overdose deaths, yet there is no evidence that Venezuela produces fentanyl at any significant level. Instead, they risk starting a major new conflict that would consume massive amounts of American resources, easily pushing spending beyond what the recently passed, nearly $1 trillion defense budget provides for. And that enormous budget is itself unlikely to bring Washington a sense of peace. None of this means that governments shouldn't make investments in their armed forces. It certainly doesn't mean that they should abandon efforts to expand their economies.
