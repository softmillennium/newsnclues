                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New federal restrictions on foreign-made drones, announced this week, promise to boost Washington state as a hub for domestic drone manufacturing — adding thousands or even tens of thousands of jobs in the process. He cites the presence of companies including Boeing, Blue Origin, Amazon (with its Prime Air unit) and SpaceX, along with an existing base of aerospace suppliers and technicians. The FCC this week added foreign-made drones to its list of equipment deemed national security threats. There is a carve-out: existing models that have received prior FCC approval can still be sold, which means that the impact will unfold over an extended period of time. But as current inventory depletes and DJI's product line ages, U.S. manufacturers will need to scale up. Washington's aerospace industry employs more than 77,000 workers directly and generates more than $71 billion in total economic activity, according to a July 2024 analysis by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. He relocated Brinc from Las Vegas to Seattle in 2021, drawn by the region's engineering talent pool. Speaking with GeekWire this week, Resnick said DJI's dominance stems from billions in Chinese government subsidies, making fair competition nearly impossible. Resnick said the new restrictions will require a further shift toward domestic suppliers: “Moving forward, we are going to have to do a lot more business with American companies.” Resnick said this shift ensures the U.S. industrial base remains resilient even if international partners face constraints during a conflict. While the transition presents a hurdle, Resnick described it as an “organizational cost that we're very happy to pay” in exchange for a market free of state-sponsored Chinese competition. He acknowledged that there could be a price premium in the drone market overall as American suppliers scale up, a process he estimates will take two to three years. When asked if he sees these events as an opening for Brinc to expand into other sectors, beyond public safety, Resnick didn't entirely rule out the possibility. “The free world,” he said, “needs more drone manufacturing capacity in a whole bunch of different verticals.” Brinc will integrate Echodyne radar to help expand 911 response drones beyond visual line of sight Redmond, Wash., police partnering with Brinc on drone tech as part of first responder program Redmond, Wash., police roll out more public safety tech with license plate reader cameras</p>

Microsoft has introduced a new form of hardware-accelerated BitLocker encryption in Windows 11, offloading encryption and decryption to a purpose-built cryptography accelerator baked into future CPUs to improve performance and efficiency. This new tech will undo the performance penalties that Microsoft imposed on its users by forcing them to use software-based encryption by default, offering twice the storage performance in some types of workloads. According to our testing and support documentation, software-based BitLocker encryption is enabled by default on new installs of Windows 11 Pro. Hardware-accelerated BitLocker is already available for storage devices, with the encryption offload being handled on the storage device itself, be it an SSD or HDD, as long as it is TCG Opal-compliant. Most modern SSDs include hardware-based encryption, in which all encryption/decryption processing occurs directly on the drive with no performance impact. However, Microsoft, being Microsoft, opted to force-enable the software version of BitLocker for new Windows Pro installs, hurting performance and battery life — you can only use hardware-based SSD encryption if you jump through a complicated series of largely undocumented hoops. Hardware-accelerated BitLocker will initially be available on Windows 11 devices with Intel vPro platforms based on upcoming Intel Core Ultra series 3 “Panther Lake” CPUs, with broader support planned. The latest version of BitLocker is expected to leverage new capabilities on upcoming chips, including crypto offloading, where the bulk of cryptographic operations will be moved from software running on the CPU to a dedicated fixed-function crypto engine. Additionally, BitLocker bulk encryption keys will be hardware-wrapped on select SoCs to improve security by reducing exposure to CPU and memory vulnerabilities.

The company has also shared CrystalDiskMark performance test results in a video, showing that a drive with software-based BitLocker encryption achieved read speeds of 1632 MB/s on single-thread sequential workloads, compared with 3746 MB/s on a drive with hardware-based BitLocker enabled.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Waymo is shipping a software update to help its robotaxis navigate disabled traffic lights during power outages “more decisively,” the company said Tuesday in a blog post that explains why its self-driving vehicles got stuck at intersections during a blackout in San Francisco this past weekend. Waymo said the self-driving system in its robotaxis treats dead stop lights as four-way stops, just like humans are supposed to. Instead, many of the vehicles requested a “confirmation check” from Waymo's fleet response team to make sure what they were doing was correct. All Waymo robotaxis have the ability to make these confirmation checks. With such a widespread outage on Saturday, there was a “concentrated spike” in these confirmation requests, Waymo said, which helped create all the congestion caught on video. “While this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the [self-driving software] with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively,” the company wrote. Waymo also said it will improve its emergency response protocols by “incorporating lessons from this event.” “Navigating an event of this magnitude presented a unique challenge for autonomous technology,” the company wrote. Saturday's mess is the latest example of how Waymo is still uncovering unforeseen issues with its software and its approach to designing a reliable fleet of self-driving vehicles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“While digging through Waymo's mobile app code, I discovered the complete system prompt for its unreleased Gemini integration,” Wong wrote in a blog. “The document, internally titled ‘Waymo Ride Assistant Meta-Prompt,' is a 1,200+ line specification that defines exactly how the AI assistant is expected to behave inside a Waymo vehicle.” “While we have no details to share today, our team is always tinkering with features to make riding with Waymo delightful, seamless, and useful,” Julia Ilina, a spokesperson for Waymo, told TechCrunch. Wong writes the assistant is instructed to possess a clear identity and purpose: “a friendly and helpful AI companion integrated into a Waymo autonomous vehicle” whose primary goal is “to enhance the rider's experience by providing useful information and assistance in a safe, reassuring, and unobtrusive manner.” The bot is directed to use clear, simple language and avoid technical jargon, and is instructed to keep its responses succinct to one to three sentences. If a rider asks for a feature that Gemini can't control, the bot is to reply with “aspirational phrases,” like, “It's not something I can do yet.” So when replying to a question such as, “How do you see the road?” Gemini shouldn't say “I use a combination of sensors,” and instead should reply, “The Waymo Driver uses a combination of sensors…” The system prompts include a range of compelling tidbits, such as how the bot is meant to handle being asked questions about competitors like Tesla or the now-defunct Cruise, or which trigger keywords will get it to stop talking. The assistant is also directed to avoiding speculating on, explaining, confirming, denying, or commenting on real-time driving actions or specific driving events. “Your role is not to be a spokesperson for the driving system's performance, and you must not adopt a defensive or apologetic tone,” the prompt reads. It is not allowed to take real-world actions like ordering food, making reservations, or handling emergencies. Waymo isn't the only company integrating AI assistants into driverless vehicles. Gemini appears to be programmed to be more pragmatic and ride-focused, while Grok is pitched more as an in-car buddy that can handle long conversations and remember context from previous questions.

This new model has a 4K QD-OLED running panel at 240 Hz, complemented by a BlackShield filter that claims to offer an even deeper black level than the already-inky hue common in OLED displays and dramatically improved scratch prevention. Note that the specs list we managed to dig up came from unofficial sources, but they all look in line with what we'd expect for a new revision. Things get more interesting with Dolby Vision support, standard HDR10, and DisplayHDR 500 True Black certification, which guarantees at least 500 nits of brightness in HDR mode. Those are pretty good specs already, especially with the assumption the monitor a fourth-gen LG QD-OLED panel with higher and more stable brightness versus previous offerings. Although OLED displays are self-emissive and have zero black level by nature (and superior to any other display type), any ambient light is reflected on the panel surface, making pure black colors look ever so slightly grey or purple, especially in brightly lit rooms. Glossy coatings are the best to fix that, but those introduce distracting screen reflections, so panel and monitor makers often have to find a balanced trade-off, or come up with novel ideas, as Asus apparently has done. The rest of the specifications are about what you'd expect from a high-end OLED display: 90 W USB-C power delivery, connectivity options including Display HDR 2.1a UHBR20 and HDMI 2.1, and an integrated hub. It's safe enough to assume that the included stand will be height and tilt-adjustable, and there will be RGB lighting on tap. Given the specs of this unit, don't expect it to be affordable.

Ahead of CES 2026, LG Display has just announced a seemingly revolutionary development in the OLED world, at least as far as its own panels are concerned. To understand why this is such a big deal, we first have to look at how subpixel structures inform the image quality that you see. However, LG's panels also add a fourth white subpixel in the equation to boost brightness. See, OLED panels are inherently weak when it comes to being bright because driving those sweet organic pixels as hard as possible will wear them out quickly, leading to burn-in. Therefore, you need ingenuity to tackle this issue, and so far, LG has relied on that white subpixel for the most part, but that comes with a downside. This is why Samsung's QD-OLED panels are touted for their superior color performance, since they don't have a white subpixel and instead emit blue light that passes through quantum dots to filter colors. Now, getting rid of that white subpixel and reverting back to a true RGB structure does hurt brightness outright, at least in the first-gen implementation, but it could be a worthwhile tradeoff. Instead of putting the subpixels in a triangular or rectangular structure — or really any other pattern — LG places the red, green and blue subpixels right next to each other in a straight line, forming a "stripe." But, again, they've always had that white subpixel in the middle, creating a RGWB pattern instead. This leads to reduced fringing and distortion in text, since the font engines rendering that expect a more conventional layout. LCDs and such have striped subpixel arrangements for ages, but OLEDs have suffered either because of the white subpixel or just a differently shaped layout altogether, such as in QD-OLED panels. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. To be clear, OLEDs with this kind of a layout have existed before, but they're niche and limited to just 60Hz, as LG points out in its own press release, so achieving a 240 Hz refresh rate is quite impressive and nicely brings the tech into the modern day. The branding is a bit confusing, because the "W" in that WOLED doesn't mean it has a white subpixel; rather, the multi-stack method used by LG emits near-white light that is converted by color filters, which is what forms those RGB subpixels eventually. Just to clarify, the other "Tandem OLED" designation is reserved for smaller format displays meant for phones, tablets, laptops and cars, and it's similar to LG's RGB OLED where each subpixel produces its own light instead of being filtered through a white base layer. That's what powers the new iPad Pros, but it's not meant for TVs or monitors. We should learn more about pricing and availability as CES rolls around.

Just computing the member list of a room is a disaster due to the complex resolution algorithm - I spoke to a homeserver admin once who found that the DB storage space of just the member list can easily reach multiple gigabytes for larger rooms.Also years later, we still don't have custom emojis, user statuses, user bios, invite links etc. - very basic things that literally every messaging platform has. - very basic things that literally every messaging platform has.

One of the uses for that is state resolution, but it could equally well just be calling the /messages API or any other point you need to know historical state. You probably would do that even if there was no state resolution at all> Simply fixes some of the many ways that rooms can explode or be bricked.How many other ways are there? If speed is a concern, why did you all stick with Synapse (essentially single-threaded due to the GIL) over moving to Dendrite? However, at this point the likelihood is that rather than progressing Dendrite we'll instead look to add more Rust to Synapse and fix its resource usage. That said, others are of course very welcome to continue progressing Dendrite forwards, and I personally find it super depressing that we failed to progress both servers at the same time.

All other application-level networks have identifiers of their own, in addition to IP addresses.The goal of the design is: - to prevent correlation of which IP address communicates with which, - to prevent IP address from servers not chosen by the users.It is not supposed to protect IP addresses from all servers, and Tor does not achieve that either, as Tor relays are servers too.The reasons not to embed Tor are listed here: https://simplex.chat/faq/#why-dont-you-embed-tor-in-simplex-...Disclaimer: I designed SimpleX network, and the founder of SimpleX Chat.

We do not plan any coins.We plain a private payment mechanism for the servers that will utilize blockchain for valid reasons - we call it Community Vouchers.

My primary issue is that they changed the voice chat system, broke existing self hosted installs, and the new system was barely documented. It may not be good enough for your grandma, but certainly can support your software dev team, and there are countless of those active most probably. Also using Discord and Slack, and to me these look like a UX Christmas trees full of blinking lights, and far from anything you can call 'calm technology'.Update: Seeing who I respond to, taking opportunity to mention these recent UX musings.. there used to be 'favorites' in one click in Element, now it is in a drop-down of filters not shown by default (I make distinction of 3 groups 'favorites', 'people', and 'rooms' for all/other. Not using spaces at all (except for the record)). And then there's paragraph spacing between replies given one after the other, is to small. Setting margin to 10px (think its 4px now) makes a world of improved reading already. Oh, I might add very long UI (re)loading times of a browser tab refresh of Element, as somewhat annoying and to avoid.

One user Janne made an alternative implementation that worked within the new constraints but it was also very bluntly rejected by the devs.I was really appalled by this decision. Thanks - the Favourites roomlist section will be back shortly; we just hadn't re-added sections to the rewritten roomlist (and in retrospect, probably shouldn't have launched without it). In fact I think they've already landed (experimentally) on the same roomlist component but in the Element X Web playground at https://github.com/element-hq/aurora.> And then there's paragraph spacing between replies given one after the other, is to small.

I can only assume our experience in private servers is way different than people logging into the matrix.org server or in extremely populated rooms? Yes Federation is hard and it brings lots of new challenges. Everything that is not federated has a single entity managing it which can be threatened with punitive actions. With federation everyone can run their own server meaning too many people to go after.I understand these guys don't want it and they have good reason but federation in general should not die. I understand these guys don't want it and they have good reason but federation in general should not die. I wanted to believe, but sadly privacy must be hard-coded or the people with a large set of technical skill, access to AI agents who will restlessly pursue their mission, and a dysfunctional moral compass will attempt to technologically dominate users. I joined the mozilla matrix, and ironically, this caused the auth system to completely break down for some reason since I would log in each time.It suggested to reset the whatever login data cookie thing because it did not want to trust me anymore, displaying red warning or whatever.I asked around, and apparently they disagreed about that strict cookie policy, which felt quite ironic coming from the mozilla community.

Meanwhile more radical proposals like MSC4256 (https://github.com/dklimpel/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/mls-R...) go and remove senders entirely and encrypt room state via MLS.The reason Matrix hasn't prioritised metadata protection earlier is:* If you're particularly concerned about metadata footprint, you can run your own servers in whatever network environment you feel like - you are NOT surrendering metadata to some central or 3rd party server as you would in a centralised platform. * We've had to focus on getting decentralised encryption stable, which turns out to be hard enough without also throwing in metadata protection - it's only this year that we've turned that corner. * Unless you're using a mixnet, network traffic gives away a significant amount of metadata anyway.Anyway, yes: Matrix can do better on obfuscating metadata on servers, and we'll continue improving it in 2026.Meanwhile, if anyone's feeling nostalgic you can see a presentation I wrote preempting the challenge of metadata protection back in 2016 (on the day we first turned on E2EE in Matrix, ironically): https://matrix.org/~matthew/2015-06-26%20Matrix%20Jardin%20E.... In some other world perhaps we would have got to this point sooner, but better late than never.EDIT: I can't face going through all the other points in this post, but it's worth noting that some of it is just entirely false - e.g. the hackea claims of "an impressive collection of private data being sent to Matrix central servers, even when you use your own instance", or the fact that media isn't authed (it has been since Jun 2024).

Like, if we're still in this "why doesn't the pleb just become a part time sysadmin" way of thinking, it's hard to think it's not just DoA. FWIW, I'm the kind of weirdo who gets annoyed by having to add a new noscript rule for every federated instance. There's no decentralized protocol as they're centered around their developers. Too much human effort and attention has been centered around software.The ephemeral gibberish of software developers approaches religious like obsession with sigils and notation levels of absurdity. It will see humanity to the promised land!Meanwhile in meat space everyone I socialize with is tired of software engineers; "they over complicate everything!"

This little filter bubble is probably fostering asocial mental illness's in many of its disciples But I really do wish we had doubled down on XMPP. If we could have just solved the mobile case (which, was solved, just not in popular server versions) then we would have been in a better place today.Hatred of XML has cost us so many wonderful things, the one that hurts me most is SMF (the solaris init system) which obviated the major issues people have with systemd. The web platform's still (for now) really good and fast at working with xml. I tried prosody, but then after a multi-server cleanup killed it off. Up next, i'd like to try either self-hosting my own ejabberd server, or if i don't want manage yet another host might consider the paid option of Snikket...or maybe go through jmp.chat which if i recall correctly includes xmpp hosting with some jmp chat paid plan, etc. That's the way Matrix goes, but that's not an inherent property of federation (XMPP doesn't leak nearly as much metadata as Matrix does, for instance)Also, there is no free lunch in this space: p2p is slow and inefficient (bandwidth as much as battery) for modern mobile usecases, the workarounds generally consist of having edge servers to act as caches or preferred routing points, and that brings us back to the exact same set of tradeoffs found in the federation model, except with less control.In short, I agree with the premise that Matrix is terrible,  but not that federation is necessarily bad, nor that P2P is clearly superior.

Their arguments against the middle ground (federation) made no sense. Yes, some current implementations are flawed in that you can poison caches with spam and csam, but that's not inherent to federation. In fact, it looked more like they were upset that you can't censor federated communities sufficiently to their liking (nuke them out of existence on a whim?). Their main, and really only, argument against Lemmy was group think but...it's a consensus platform, that's its purpose. There is a time and place for communities to build group consensus organically and it's a viral part of society, so while I can understand chafing at that from time to time, I wouldn't call it a protocol failure. The entire secure messaging app space is open source, why anyone would bother with writing a proprietary app and thus omit verifiability of the security claims is beyond me.EDIT: Also, no proxy settings, meaning your IP address can't be masked with Tor/SOCKS5 proxy.Do NOT use.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a federal judge on Tuesday blocked Texas from implementing a new age-verification law for app stores, Apple announced it will pause previously announced plans for the state as it continues to monitor the “ongoing legal process.” The law, SB 2420, or the App Store Accountability Act, would have required app stores, like those run by Apple and Google, to verify user ages and require parental consent for those under 18 to download apps or make purchases. In addition, it would have required the age data be shared with developers. A judge, citing First Amendment concerns, blocked the law's enforcement that was set to take effect in January. To comply with the coming law, Apple had announced in October a series of new requirements for apps in Texas, which included all users under the age of 18 would have to join a Family Sharing group, where parents or guardians would provide consent for all App Store downloads, app purchases, and in-app transactions. Parents would be able to revoke their consent for an app at any time. Apple on Thursday announced other developer tools for complying with new age-assurance laws will remain available for testing, including its Declared Age Range API, Significant Change API under PermissionKit, New age rating property type in StoreKit, and App Store Server Notifications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is it, Carol: the season one finale of Pluribus. Vince Gilligan's sci-fi standout got a two-season order from Apple TV right off the bat, so fans knew a tidy conclusion wouldn't be coming. However, while a cliffhanger ending was to be expected, the climb we took to get there was packed with Pluribus' trademark blend of careful pacing, high-wire tension, and observations about humanity that are both hilarious and heartbreaking. First, a deeply unsettling prologue kicks off “La Chica o El Mundo”: it's now 71 days after the Joining, and we're in a remote village in Peru, home of Kusimayu—one of the survivors who attended Carol's disastrous summit back in episode two. With that familiar bland smile now fixed to her face, Kusimayu opens the pen containing all her animals, including the most poignant baby goat this side of Severance. In Albuquerque, Carol and Zosia watch satellite footage of Manousos getting closer. Carol is nervous about this intrusion; she's just gotten comfortably settled into her newfound happiness (or the illusion of happiness, anyway) with Zosia, and his arrival is absolutely going to disrupt the fantasy. (By the way, this is 60 days post-joining, so we've rewound to before Kusimayu's transformation.) Zosia makes herself scarce, and Carol receives Manousos alone, in a scene about a million times more awkward than we could have imagined. Their previous interactions consisted of screaming back and forth at each other over the phone—frustrating, but also a hopeful sign that someone, anyone capable of even having a screaming argument still exists. And as we've seen, Manousos was so intrigued by Carol's video he made an agonizingly long trek to find her, learning English (sort of) and suffering grievous injuries along the way. But upon meeting face-to-face, the two immediately clash. He's leery of entering her home, convinced the Others (he calls them “the weirdos”) have installed surveillance equipment without her knowledge. When they finally talk outside, he insists on holding an umbrella to prevent prying eyes from drones overhead. But even when they finally compromise on where they should converse, things are still very prickly between them. Carol insists she doesn't want to “destroy” the Others; Manousos maintains, “These weirdos are evil” because “they have stolen everyone's soul.” Carol argues that they're still human; Manousos argues that they are not. Then, Carol—who has just underlined the fact that the Others cannot lie—tells a whopper to Manousos, saying she doesn't know why they returned to Albuquerque after abandoning her for 40 days. (Good thing she asked Zosia to have that giant “come back” plea she'd painted onto the street removed before Manousos' arrival.) Eventually, they move their chat—aided by the monotone of Google Translate, though Manousos' English is by now far better than Carol's very rudimentary Spanish—into Carol's house. He won't engage until he does a thorough search for listening devices and finds something very odd hidden in Carol's liquor cabinet. When Carol calls Zosia demanding answers, she finds out it's a sensor that's been there for years. Like, since 2011, when she was freezing her eggs. Detail-obsessed Pluribus fans will remember that Carol has referenced freezing her eggs before, making a joke about it during that flashback to Carol and Helen's stay in the Norwegian ice hotel. So that's two mentions of Carol's eggs across Pluribus season one, and series creator Vince Gilligan isn't dropping that information in vain. Needing some time away from her new frenemy, Carol gets him to move into the empty house next door, something he's very reluctant to do. This reaction is very much in keeping with his desire to pay for everything he takes, or at least sign an IOU for it. This guy has a moral code that's remained firmly in place, even as the world has dramatically shifted around him. At any rate, while Carol is getting drunk and falling asleep to Golden Girls, Manousos is prying into her activities by talking to Zosia. He could really talk to any of the Others—it would truly make no difference—but summoning Zosia in particular is designed to get a rise out of Carol, and it works. She drags Zosia away, but Manousos quickly requests another Other come talk to him instead. While Carol is fumbling through Zosia's gentle insistence that “We love him the same as we love you”—logically, Carol knows that's how the hive mind works, but emotionally, she can't comprehend that; Zosia is her special, uh, “chaperone,” after all—Manousos takes a page from Carol's own playbook. Carol, frantic, races next door and sees that Manousos has caused the mass seizure event this time. He's been deliberately agitating the Other sent to replace Zosia to try and pull him out of his hive-mind stupor. It doesn't work, and to Carol's horror, the Others decide it's Manousos' turn to be put in isolation—and since he's now in Albuquerque, that means another mass exodus from Carol's hometown. For a moment, Pluribus makes us think that Carol has chosen Zosia. Carol is happy, and she's startled by how good it feels. Though this newfound happiness has been blissful, she'd rather be miserable forever with her individuality intact. And besides, back in Las Vegas, didn't Mr. Diabaté assure her that the survivors could not be converted without their express consent? It put Carol in an actual good mood. But now, she has a horrible realization: her eggs. They don't need to stick a giant needle into her hip. “How long do I have?” she asks Zosia. She's thrilled that Carol will soon be forced into receiving this marvelous gift. Manousos is still alone in Albuquerque, and he hears a helicopter approaching. We see that Zosia is the pilot, and Carol's sitting beside her. They share a very loaded look as Carol climbs out. When a baffled Manousos approaches, Carol tells him, “You win. But they're obligated to give Carol whatever she wants. Bringing a giant bomb into the story is bang-up way to set up the events of season two, isn't it?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most people treat their monitor like a printer. But if you work from home or spend hours gaming every night, it's worth an upgrade. How about something with smart features so it can double as a television—or springing for one of those flashy OLED monitors? Those are all worthwhile features, but don't splurge for the latest thing before you know what you're getting into. If you're looking to upgrade from a basic 1080p monitor you've been using for a decade, I recommend buying the Dell 27 Plus 4K. It's sharp, has good colors, and is shockingly affordable. But if you're shopping around, I have advice ranging from panel types to refresh rate. For more information on panel types, read our in-depth look at the tech that distinguishes these panel types from each other. This isn't the brightest or most color-accurate type of panel, but it's grown into the cheapest and most widely accessible option. IPS (in-plane switching) is the most common, while VA (vertical alignment) is still used in some cheaper creator-focused monitors, and TN (twisted nematic) is available in some lower-end gaming monitors. Fortunately, there has been some development on IPS over the years, which improves various elements of the image quality. I've tested a 6K monitor that uses Nano IPS Black, combining them all together to produce one of the best IPS displays possible. As good as these are, though, they can't achieve the highs of more advanced forms of backlighting. OLED (organic light-emitting diodes) is the other primary option these days. But over the past couple of years, OLED has become a popular high-end option, especially in the world of gaming monitors. As opposed to LED, OLED uses individually-backlit pixels, meaning each can be turned on and off entirely. If you can get to complete black, the only thing holding back your dynamic range is brightness. The crop of OLED panels, whether manufactured by LG (known as W-OLED) or Samsung (known as QD-OLED), typically range up to a claimed 1,000 nits of peak HDR (high dynamic range) brightness. Some OLED monitors don't get very bright in SDR (standard dynamic range), which is important to consider, as that's how you will use the screen most of the time. Contrast and brightness aren't the only benefits. Viewing angles are significantly better, there's a shorter response time (more on that later), and you don't have light bleed to deal with along the edges of the screen. Most OLED monitors also have great color performance as well, though it differs panel-to-panel. The only thing holding back adoption was price, and that has come down drastically in just the past year or so. When OLED gaming monitors first launched in 2022, there was nothing under $1,000. We've also seen OLED now supported at different screen sizes, resolutions, and refresh rates. A few nongaming OLED monitors for creators even launched this year, including the Dell 32 Plus QD-OLED and Samsung Smart Monitor M90SF. With so many static elements on a computer monitor, such as the menus and taskbars, you might think the risk of burn-in isn't worth it. Most manufacturers also offer longer warranties, sometimes up to three years. Long-term testing in the industry has shown that while burn-in is possible, it's not something most people have to worry about anymore. Mini-LED displays use various zones of lighting to improve contrast and brightness. On current monitors, mini-LED displays can get brighter than OLED, both in SDR and HDR. You do not want to buy a cheap mini-LED gaming monitor like this one with only 337 dimming zones across its 27-inch screen, while a monitor like the KTC M27T6 has 1,152 zones for only $30 more. The difference in contrast between these two screens is massive. The number of dimming zones isn't the only important spec in a mini-LED display, as Apple's 32-inch Pro Display XDR has just 576 dimming zones, yet has exceptional contrast and brightness. That said, mini-LED hasn't enjoyed the adoption that OLED has, and outside of Apple, there aren't many nongaming options out there. As outlined in a white paper on the matter, Apple chose it for very specific reasons, including for its “better uniformity, sustained thermal and brightness performance, off-axis viewing characteristics, and resistance to permanent burn-in.” While OLED might be the future of monitors, mini-LED is going to continue to play a role in the near future as the brighter and more efficient option. Monitors have seen an explosion of experimental new shapes and sizes over the past few years. Overall, they've gotten bigger, but we've also seen different trends, such as curves or wider aspect ratios. But 16:9 is hardly the only option these days. Ultrawide monitors, with their 21:9 aspect ratio, have become a popular shape, especially for PC gamers. This gives you a wider view in games, but it's also a solid alternative to using dual screens for multitasking. The 34-inch size has become the go-to form factor, but there are also larger versions of 21:9 that measure 38 or 40 inches across. If you really want to go big, though, there are some insane 32:9 aspect-ratio monitors out there, also known as super ultrawide. These monstrosities are sold in either the 45-inch or 49-inch size. Whether it's standard ultrawide or super ultrawide, these monitors almost always come with a curve, immersing you a bit more in the center of the screen. For example, this 49-inch super ultrawide monitor has a 3800R curve, which is a very gentle curvature, slightly pulling the sides in. On the other hand, an 800R curve is the most aggressive curve you'll find on a monitor, which isn't great for work but really doubles down on in-game immersion. There's nothing more important than the sharpness of your monitor. We tend to only think of that in terms of resolution, but the real measure is pixel density, or pixels per inch (ppi). 1080p might look OK on your 13-inch laptop screen, but stretched out on your 27-inch monitor, you'll be able to see those pixels. That's why I always recommend considering both the resolution and size hand-in-hand. 5K and 6K monitors are finally getting closer to the sharpness of high-end laptops. We typically sit farther back from monitors since they are larger, though, so that increase in sharpness may not be as easily perceived. For remote office work and content creators, I recommend getting a monitor with over 100 ppi to attain a sharpness you'll be satisfied with over the long haul. Increasingly, you can get 4K 27-inch monitors for well under $300. This equation is different for gaming monitors, which tend to lean more toward lower resolutions. For the longest time, it was assumed that all monitors and screens had a 60-Hz refresh rate. But as PC performance increased, gaming monitors were quick to begin offering higher frame rates, and the ceiling only continues to rise. That's why anything over 240 Hz is only noticeable and beneficial for competitive esports gamers looking to get an edge over their opponents. It's not even a particularly premium feature anymore, showing up in monitors like the Dell Plus 27 4K. This is a point of confusion for PC gamers, as the terms often get thrown around interchangeably. Input lag and response time might feel like a similar problem, but they have very different causes. Input lag measures the second you click on your mouse or keyboard and when something triggers on your screen. This total measurement includes many factors, including the signal transmission from your mouse, the processing of your PC, and more. Response time is how fast a pixel on your monitor can change from one color to another. In particular, it's how fast a pixel can change from a certain percentage of gray to another, also known as gray-to-gray (GtG). The reason it's been talked about more recently is due to OLED, which has a drastically faster response time than LED. Monitor manufacturers often make exaggerated claims about this, selling an OLED display for its 0.5 millisecond GtG response time. I wouldn't take any specific response time claims too seriously, except to know that OLED is a huge step forward in response time. So as long as there are no other weak links in the chain of your input delay, overall responsiveness in games should feel noticeably improved. Monitors have up to four types of adjustability: height, swivel, tilt, and rotate. Budget monitors may not have any of these, while more expensive options may offer a wide range of motion in all four adjustments. Unless you plan to use a monitor arm, being able to position your monitor at eye level is crucial for keeping a healthy posture. Just be careful: Some monitors with rotate adjustability can't fully flip 90 degrees into horizontal mode. Sometimes it's a limitation due to the lack of proper height adjustment, for example. Almost all monitors have one these days, but you'll still occasionally come across some budget-tier displays that don't. All monitors have HDMI and DisplayPort to connect to a PC (or even VGA if it's a really old one). That's particularly useful if your laptop doesn't have many ports, or if you frequently move your laptop and like to keep it as cable-free as possible. Many monitors also include Power Delivery over USB-C, letting you connect and charge your laptop through a single cable. Some workstation-level monitors take this a step further and also include a KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) switch, which allows you to switch between multiple laptops or PCs, all plugged into the same monitor. Most people don't need this, but if you run multiple PCs for any reason, it's a must. The placement of these ports is also important. Ideally, you won't have to reach the back of your monitor too often, because let's be real, it's a huge pain. Back-facing ports, meanwhile, are easier to plug in. Some of the new Dell monitors even include a pop-down, forward-facing port module for quick access to USB-C or a headphone jack. Most people will likely be shopping in the sub-$300 range, which is what makes options like the Dell 27 Plus 4K so impressive. It's not a perfect monitor by any means, but in my own testing, it hits the sweet spot in price and quality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two years ago, Lizmary Fernandez took a detour from studying to be an immigration attorney to join a free Apple course for making iPhone apps. But Fernandez found the program's cost-of-living stipend lacking—“A lot of us got on food stamps,” she says—and the coursework insufficient for landing a coding job. “I didn't have the experience or portfolio,” says the 25-year-old, who is now a flight attendant and preparing to apply to law school. Since 2021, the academy has welcomed over 1,700 students, a racially diverse mix with varying levels of tech literacy and financial flexibility. About 600 students, including Fernandez, have completed its 10-month course of half-days at Michigan State University, which cosponsors the Apple-branded and Apple-focused program. Seven graduates who spoke with WIRED said they had good experiences at the academy, citing benefits such as receiving mentorship from past students. Fernandez says she was impressed by a focus on developing inclusive apps and a series of speakers from Apple who were genuinely willing to help and share frank lessons. “Their heart was in the right place,” she says. The program does expose people of color to new possibilities. “It changed my life,” says Min Thu Khine, who's now mentoring coding students and working at an Apple Store Genius Bar. “My dream is to be a software engineer at Apple.” The academy also draws positive grades from some researchers who study tech education, such as Quinn Burke. He says its fully subsidized in-person instruction surpasses the quality of many coding bootcamps, which proliferated over the past decade and sometimes left students in debt and with narrow skills. One entire family attended together, and at least two mothers have come with their daughters. Students on average are in their 30s, ranging from 18-year-olds to, for example, a grandfather in his 70s who wanted to develop a photo app for his grandchild, according to Sarah Gretter, the academy leader for Michigan State. “I found my grades improved,” he says, crediting the academy. Even so, Fernandez says, she leaned on waitressing shifts and government food aid to supplement the provided stipend and make it through the tuition-free academy. Gordon Shukwit, a senior director at Apple overseeing the program in Detroit and 17 other Apple academies abroad that have been opened since 2013, says increasing student aid is a constant focus. The university declined to comment on cost per student estimates and comparisons to community college spending, saying that the academy offers an unparalleled experience. About 70 percent of students graduate, which Gretter describes as higher than typical for adult education. “I went in with zero coding experience or knowledge,” says Dayan Abdulla, 22, who graduated from the main program in June and works in quality assurance at a software startup while studying computer science at Henry Ford College. About 71 percent of graduates from the last two years went onto full-time jobs across a variety of industries, according to academy officials. Amy J. Ko, a University of Washington computer scientist who researches computing education, calls under 80 percent typical for the coding schools she has studied but notes that one of her department's own undergraduate programs has a 95 percent job placement rate. Susan Prescott, Apple's vice president of worldwide developer relations, says most graduates take on roles that involve coding, design, project management, and marketing skills honed at the academy. “We're excited to continue our partnership with Michigan State University and partners across the state to build on this success,” Prescott says. Shukwit adds that the academy's primary goal is teaching teamwork, research, and technology skills relevant to any career students choose to pursue in the future. The emphasis is on learning Apple operating systems like iOS, and two graduates said their limited proficiency in competing platforms such as Android hurt their ability to find jobs. Underwriting a program built around iOS development may no longer be sensible in the years to come. “The job market for junior developers and graduating computer science majors is certainly the worst it's been in some time,” says Ashley Rea Maharaj, an assistant professor in technical communication at University of North Texas. Businesses have long funded and shaped training programs in fields like nursing and construction in the hopes of creating a workforce that benefits them. Last year, industry accounted for about $7.6 billion of voluntary support for US higher education, a small percentage of overall college and university budgets, according to the nonprofit Council for Advancement and Support of Education. But now, tech companies are spending big on education, betting that the rise of AI will muddy traditional career paths. This year, Google committed to spending $1 billion over the next three years on AI education and job training programs in the US. Microsoft plans to outlay $4 billion in the next five years worldwide. Michigan State was a natural partner because Apple had already agreed to support a separate undergraduate app design program at the university. Public records show Apple signed a 3-year “scientific and technological cooperation agreement” with Michigan State in May 2021—several months after the initial announcement of the academy. That announcement said Apple expected to help about 1,000 students each year “cultivate the skills necessary for jobs in the rapidly growing iOS app economy.” Though thousands now apply annually, the academy averages just a few hundred attendees each year across a four-week introductory program and a months-long intensive course. Use of any non-Apple software requires Apple's approval, the agreement states. In practice, officials say students are free to use and explore competing systems. The contract allows for up to 200 students annually in the longer program, in which teams of students develop apps for Apple's App Store. About 50 graduates are invited for a second year, during which teams learn about client relations by developing apps for local organizations, such as the Detroit Historical Museum and the Michigan Black Business Alliance. Pete Lasher, a principal at management consultancy Huron who advises higher education institutions on fundraising, says he's encouraged by the university's “skin” in the deal because it typically leads to healthy alignment. Previously unreported funding records for the academy's first four years show Apple contributed about $11.6 million. Nearly $2.6 million came from the state and non-academy students' tuition. Several graduates say they received about $800 to $1,500 a month, and while Fernandez found it insufficient, some viewed the money as transformative. “It helped me get out of debt, get my first car, and move out of my parents',” says Tyson Walker II, who acknowledges that making coding “his main thing” remains a distant dream. Some current students are receiving less financial support than they expected, which Shukwit attributed to an unspecified new Michigan rule that he claims restricted access to state funding. In addition, they say free parking passes, sick days, remote working, and collaboration spaces were also limited. But they allege the biggest challenge is that many current second-year projects are for small businesses that are unclear about their goals for an app and seem unlikely to hire the students when they finish. By the time Fernandez graduated, she had been inspired: Coding was no longer “rocket science” to her. Upon leaving, Fernandez wanted to develop a diet tracking app. Fernandez wishes everyone could attend for two years, which is the case at some academies. “It was only halfway through that I started understanding concepts,” she says. Apple's Shukwit says he loves that students want more, and adjustments are possible. For example, when students wanted to develop apps for Apple Vision Pro headsets and Apple TV boxes, the academy added relevant workshops. AI can't be a shortcut to avoid learning, Shukwit says. Alumni can also access virtual lessons on generative AI. Apple's own data shows that its US tech workforce went from 6 percent Black before the Detroit academy opened to about 3 percent this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What if there were an ad on TV, and it wasn't made with AI? For plenty of people on the internet, that's apparently an exciting and praiseworthy prospect. Here, for instance, is the 2025 Porsche Christmas ad: It has a certain high-class elegance, but it's also as gentle and frictionless as an episode of Cocomelon. If you're considering being in the market for a Porsche, it might build some nice brand associations. I will never have enough money for a Porsche, so to me it's just nice colors and music. What's getting people excited, however, is the assumption that no AI was used to make it. After all, this year's McDonald's Christmas ad made with AI would rank high on any list of the worst ads of all time. Porsche reportedly created their new ad without using any AI. The advertising blog 80 Level praises the ad's lack of AI, saying “Let's see if the trend of promoting things as AI-free continues and how brands will approach their ads next holiday season.” Gizmodo reached out to Parallel Studio to confirm that the ad was really made without AI, and will update if we hear back. The Porsche ad doesn't seem, to be clear, like it was made with AI, but that's the case with most ads. Here's a recent ad from Taco Bell, that, much like the good Porsche ad and the bad McDonald's one, is a dreamy montage of disparate scenes that share a theme. It's the kind of thing that certainly could be AI, but no one seems to be under the impression that it is, as far as I can tell. Nevertheless, in a world where we all have to watch ads, fewer AI duds hurting our eyes would be a welcome trend. If the Porsche ad really is meant to be an anti-AI statement, that's terrific.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A postmortem from Waymo on Tuesday is offering at least some clarity about what the hell happened to its poor, benighted San Francisco operation after much of the power across the city went out on Saturday.Waymo behavior at dark stoplights forced the Alphabet-owned company to call all its San Francisco robotaxis back home, a logistical catastrophe. But in fairness, social media posts probably made Waymo's ad-hoc solution look even more haphazard than it actually was, giving the impression that all the Waymos in San Francisco had been zapped at the same time by whatever caused the outage, causing them to halt in place, including in busy intersections, as if their robot drivers had been raptured to robo-heaven. Power outage took out the waymos RIP pic.twitter.com/DPte8oOGku— Vincent Woo (@fulligin) December 21, 2025 “While the Waymo Driver is designed to handle dark traffic signals as four-way stops, it may occasionally request a confirmation check to ensure it makes the safest choice. While we successfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday, the outage created a concentrated spike in these requests. When the Waymo Driver encounters a truly heterogeneous driving situation, it sends out for human feedback, which we're not supposed to think of as a bailout. You might or might not consider this the input of a “remote driver” or a “teleoperator.” Waymo clearly doesn't.At any rate, all these furtive Waymos at blacked-out stoplights in San Francisco on Saturday created a logjam of these requests for human feedback, and Waymo's postmortem acknowledges that the logjam caused even worse traffic. So what Waymo says happened next seems like a reasonable course of action in response to causing traffic during a blackout: “We directed our fleet to pull over and park appropriately so we could return vehicles to our depots in waves. This made it look like San Francisco was a post-apocalypic wasteland strewn with dead robotaxis. But it's also reasonable for Waymo to want to avoid a critical mass of Waymos disrupting San Francisco like a herd of stampeding Wildebeasts, and thus making the vehicles just wait on the side of the road until their group is called. This created a further bad look for Waymo: alongside the Waymos that did become obstructions, there were at least some crowds of safely parked Waymos, not glitching out, but simply waiting for the signal to go back to their depots in an orderly fashion. 6 Waymo's parked at a broken traffic light blocking the roads. Seems like they were not trained for a power outage pic.twitter.com/9fBkoxgKwe— Walden (@walden_yan) December 21, 2025 6 Waymo's parked at a broken traffic light blocking the roads. Seems like they were not trained for a power outage pic.twitter.com/9fBkoxgKwe There are no future plans mentioned in the postmortem about introducing remote drivers. What future plans are included, rather puzzlingly, don't include anything—at least so far—about changing the Waymo Driver's fundamental driving software at all. The three bullets about Waymo's “path forward” all focus on emergencies: “Integrating more information about outages,” “Updating our emergency preparedness and response,” and “Expanding our first responder engagement.” Robotaxis are programmed to drive conservatively, and thus have boy scout-like behavior records in aggregate, but this postmortem doesn't show Waymo reflecting at all about the fact that these are aliens on our roads who will misbehave and fail in totally novel ways that can't be predicted. In fact, it ends on a note of defiance, saying “we are undaunted by the opportunity to challenge the status quo of our roads, and we're proud to continue serving San Franciscan residents and visitors.”</p>
