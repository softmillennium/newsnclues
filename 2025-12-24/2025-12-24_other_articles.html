                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ever since Conan O'Brien got screwed out of his NBC deal in 2010, I've distanced myself from late-night programming because it's always the same format. There's a monologue about the president, celebrity and musical guests, and rehearsed interviews that become increasingly ridiculous once you notice stars doing their press rounds, reciting the same jokes and stories verbatim from show to show. Conan was the outlier because he brought surreal, over-the-top bits to the table that made the format feel less stale, something that should have been encouraged rather than outright eliminated from primetime, late-night television. Late Night with the Devil has so much going for it, and I'm honestly mad I only just watched it for the first time this week. Across all three modes, the film thrives at generating unease, and it's a blast watching everything unravel as the story is told from multiple vantage points. His solution is a Halloween-themed episode centered on the occult, stacking the desk with guests who promise a lively, media-friendly discussion. Spoiler alert: nothing about this ends up being media friendly. Jack's first guest is Christou (Fayssal Bazzi), a psychic who claims he can communicate with the dead. At first, his act feels like a John Edwards-style cold-reading parlor trick, but everything shifts when he reveals a premonition about Jack's late wife that was never publicly disclosed. Moments later, Christou becomes violently ill and is rushed off the set, never to be seen again. The next segment brings out Carmichael Haig (Ian Bliss), a professional magician and outspoken skeptic who insists there must be a logical explanation for what just happened. Carmichael ups the ante by offering a substantial cash reward to anyone who can definitively prove the existence of supernatural phenomena, positioning himself as the voice of reason in a studio that's already starting to feel unsteady. While Carmichael assumes the entire thing is an elaborate ratings stunt, Jack and his producers scramble behind the scenes because they genuinely have no idea what's happening. Making matters worse, Jack begins to suspect that he may be more connected to the demonic presence than he ever realized. Unlike many found footage films that rely on shaky cameras and questionable edits that break immersion, Late Night with the Devil succeeds because of its setting. A television studio is the perfect environment for this approach. Color footage represents what actually aired, while black-and-white sequences capture what happens during commercial breaks as the crew desperately tries to regain control after each increasingly bizarre incident. That contrast grounds the premise and keeps everything feeling authentic. Even better is watching Jack and his guests tense up as a producer counts down to the moment they're live again, only for everyone to snap back into polished, performative mode the second the cameras roll. It feels like a real late-night show that went catastrophically off the rails, was quietly pulled from syndication, and then rediscovered years later. If you've felt like late-night programming hasn't been the same since Coco took his hit in 2010, Late Night with the Devil is exactly the kind of chaotic breath of fresh air you've been waiting for, and it's streaming on Hulu as of this writing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But how does this dual density PEBA foam trainer at a very respectable 8.85 oz / 251g US9 for its max cushion 42mm heel /  34mm forefoot stack height fit and run? How does a shoe from a new UK/LA brand first known for edgy shoe geekery sneaker culture  (R.A.D Intro Video),  and their first gym/functional fitness shoes, measure up in a crowded field of super critical foam powered run trainers? How does it compare to others in its light and stacked category? Stunning visual design that brilliantly matches the run experience: Sam/Peter Soft ride and high stack makes them not particularly stable and can lead to some fatigue on longer runs (over 10) or for slow very easy runs”  Peter/Sam Platform Width:  90mm heel /  80mm midfoot  / 110mm forefoot (at ground contact) Peter: What are these awesome looking hot pink beauties? I think the RAD UFO is a great looking shoe. They take some design cues from basketball shoes—and have a nice high stack and a big ol' slab of foam. Even my cynical 13 year old said they look “tough”. Step-in is super comfortable and the well padded tongue and sleek lacing system hold the foot in place beautifully. Soft, bouncy, good at any speed and left me feeling fresh. The UFO also has some nice reflective touches that help you stay visible. We knew it was RAD from miles away as their shoes are so colorful. It is always fantastic, and actually quite rare, when visual design perfectly matches the run experience and here with the UFO it does! The upper, as befitting a $200 shoe, is premium in materials, very comfortable and light. The main mesh is thin, single layer, soft and supportive. I have a higher arch lower volume foot and at my true to size US8.5 / EU 42 in the sample, I have to pull the laces very tight yet unlike similar situations once laced I have no excessive pressure and a very adequate midfoot hold. Do I wish for a touch more overall support for the uptempo purposes of the shoe and its soft midsole? Maybe, via a bit denser thicker overall mesh but I have no significant complaints. The toes area is well held with a substantial vertical internal toe bumper. While just behind the front there is plenty of well held mesh give the toe box is a bit pointy and low (but not felt over my dodgy big toes). Sam: The 42mm heel / 34 mm forefoot full stack height is made up of a dual layer PEBA blend, a notably soft layer below the foot with a somewhat firmer layer at the ground. The platform despite its bulbous joyous look is pretty average in width for such a high stack shoe at 90mm heel / 80mm midfoot / 110mm forefoot at outsole contact and a bit broader if one takes into account the foam beyond. The feel is soft, super bouncy and energetic. At 8.64 oz / 245g in my US8.5 sample we have a light shoe accentuating its dynamic foam I do think the lower layer could be firmed up a some to help stabilize and also provide a touch more decisive response The softer layer of foam near the foot may be a hair too soft, but I don't really notice that on runs under 10 miles. I was a bit worried that the foam might collapse a bit over time, but I'm nearly 100 miles in and they feel pretty much the same as when I started. CPU “rubber” is lighter than conventional rubber and in my experience longer lasting allowing thin outsoles, again helping reduce weights. Grip is excellent of wet and dry pavement. While a mostly rigid rocker shoe they do have some far front flex, similar to the EVO SL's. Each section has grooves and a hole in the middle. Wear seems to be minimal at 100 miles, so I expect that they will hold up well. Peter: Absolutely one of my favorite shoes from the first run. I've reached for them for nearly every run since I got them and they've been just fantastic. It's a nearly perfect mix of cushioning,energy return and propulsion. I highly recommend that anyone try a pair on and see how they feel. It's a great way to see what the new foams can feel like. Peter's Score 9.8  Not an inexpensive shoe at $200 and I get a little fatigued when I go long, but boy are they fun. The UFO due to its softness and to a lesser extent its upper favors faster paces over easy ones as it can feel a bit unstable back on the heels. The UFO shines brightest for me at faster daily training to tempo paces and, agreeing with Peter for medium length runs. I think a slightly firmer lower midsole layer could improve its versatility. At $200 they are on the pricey side but not out of line with direct competitors such as the Megablast and Superblast. RAD's debut shoe is for sure an “eye opener”, and on many levels from of courseits looks to its 5 Smiles ride. Ride (50%): 9.4 Supreme fun but could be a bit more stable Value (15%): 9 Ok for a small brand's debut given premium materials Sam: The $150 Maverick is another out of left field eye opener from a brand not known for running shoes before. It's simple upper is just fine with superior foot hold compared to the UFO but is rougher in feel if still comfortable and adequate with, as with the Azura and EVO SL below a tradeoff in part to keep the price low for such a shoe, $50 less than the UFO. Peter: These are two of my favorite shoes. On longer runs I prefer Adidas, but  for any daily short run the RAD UFO is right there in the mix. Sam: While there foams are similar in soft energetic feel, the inclusion of the small midfoot plate in the adidas relegates them to fast paces only for me as I find them awkward and over rigid otherwise. The adidas is a very reasonable $150 but has a not so secure upper which only accentuates the imbalance between soft foam and rigid midfoot for me. RAD UFO Vs. Adizero EVO SL ATR (RTR Review) Peter: Both of these are non-plated super shoes. It's bouncier and a fun change from other running shoes. Sam: The early 2026 releasing Azura is lighter at 7.72 oz/ 219g US8.5 sitting on a 2mm lower stack height. It's PWRRUN Pb expanded beads PEBA foam is somewhat firmer, more stable and more on the responsive side than the UFO soft bouncy spring. Also with a CPU outsole, its front toe off is almost plate like and more responsive. At $150 the Azura is a better value with a more traditional feeling ride, dare I say more “practical”, but is not nearly as much pure fun as the UFO. Peter lives in California and has been a sub 3 hour marathoner as well as a 1:21 half marathoner in recent years. Sam is the Editor and Founder of Road Trail Run. He is in his 60's with 2025 Sam's 54th year of running roads and trails. These days he runs halves in the just sub 1:43 range. Sam trains 30-40 miles per week mostly at moderate paces on the roads and trails of New Hampshire and Park City, Utah be it on the run, hiking or on nordic skis. He is 5'9” tall and weighs about 160 lbs, if he is not enjoying too many fine New England IPA's. Post a Comment Thanks for reading Road Trail Run!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>James Melzer is a Senior Staff Writer at MovieWeb, working remotely from Pennsylvania. James has been a regular staple at MovieWeb for almost three years, writing everything from lists and features, to breaking news and movie reviews. Before joining MovieWeb, James covered pop culture news for a variety of different media sites, including Manolith and Real TV Addict. In the realm of reality TV shows that focus on thrilling adventures and paranormal entities, it doesn't get much better than those hosted by Josh Gates. The results were Expedition Unknown, as well as a successful spin-off that was launched in 2020 and is already up to its 11th season. It will feature the return of Gates as host (and sometimes adventurer) along with Phil Torres and Heather Amaro, who took over for Jessica Chobot in Season 8. It comes hot on the heels of Season 10, which wrapped up on October 22 with the episode "Welcome to the Real Derry," which saw Heather and Phil traipse through Bangor, Maine to explore haunted locations from Stephen King's IT. Premiering back in 2020 right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Expedition X quickly became a favorite of fans thanks to the show's thrilling adventures that took Phil and Jessica everywhere from the infamous Island of the Dolls in Mexico City, to Bangkok, Thailand, where they investigated a mysterious UFO cult. From time to time, they've been joined by guest investigators including Amy Bruni and Adam Berry from Kindred Spirits, actor/comedian Rhys Darby, and UFO disclosure activist, Luis Elizondo. Thus far, it's been revealed that they'll be heading to North Carolina's Ocracoke Island, La Mancha, Spain, the USS Hornet in San Francisco, and rural Pennsylvania to investigate a legendary and powerful shapeshifting bird. That being said, things are kicking off with a bang as they head to Vulture City, Arizona, along with a very special guest fans of the paranormal will easily recognize: "In the season premiere, special guest and paranormal investigator Jack Osbourne teams up with Heather Amaro in Vulture City, AZ, a former old west gold mining village that brings new meaning to the term 'ghost town.' With its violent and bloody past, Vulture City is rife with paranormal activity, from phantom voices to shadow figures, poltergeist activity, and even a possessed doll. But an ancient legend surrounding the land unveils another layer of fear and darkness. Do the vengeful spirits of the town's brutal past still linger, or has something bigger and even more evil taken over, driving them into hiding?"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first forms of life on Earth were microbial, preceding the evolution of multicellular life by more than two billion years. Based on our current understanding of the origin of life, it is likely that the first life forms on any extraterrestrial world would also be microbial. Due to the extreme temperatures, radiation or aridity on most planetary surfaces, such extraterrestrial microbes would most likely dwell in subsurface environments. Earth's subsurface features a wide range of environments, including deep marine sediments, crustal aquifers, rock fracture fluids, hydrocarbon reservoirs, caves and permafrost soils. These environments are known to host an immense diversity of life forms, predominantly microbes that survive or even thrive under extreme conditions and energy scarcity. Life's ability to endure and possibly evolve in Earth's subsurface lends credence to the possible existence of life beyond our planet and provides a blueprint for the extraterrestrial life forms and biosignatures we might expect. The exploration of space via extraterrestrial samples analysed on Earth, in situ extraterrestrial analyses, and remote sensing continue to advance our search for and understanding of potential biosignatures on other planetary bodies. In this opinion article, we discuss the latest highlights in subsurface research and technology, how Earth's subsurface environments serve as models for potential environments on other planetary bodies, why insights into subsurface microbiomes inform the search for life elsewhere, and which technologies and developments will advance the field in the future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar's visit to Kabul on July 17, 2025, officially paved the way for fast-tracking the Uzbekistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan (UAP) railway project. The signing of the landmark Trilateral Agreement or the Framework Agreement on the Joint Feasibility Study for the Naibabad–Kharlachi railway reflects a significant step in Pakistan's quest for accessing the heartland of Central Asia. This represents a groundbreaking development for Pakistan as it edges closer to consolidating its ‘Vision Central Asia' guided by the pursuit of geo-economics. The UAP Railway Corridor has been widely recognized as a major milestone for regional connectivity in South and Central Asia. The project envisions extending 700 kilometers of railway line starting off from Termaiz (Uzbekistan), passing through Mazar-i-Sharif and Logar in Afghanistan, making its way to Pakistan through the Karlachi border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. This direct overland route offers the shortest path connecting Central Asia with the ports of Pakistan, providing CARs strategic access to the Arabian Sea[2]. The route forms the Eastern Corridor of the broader Trans-Afghan Railway whereas the Western Corridor runs from Mazar-e-Sharif (Afghanistan) to the industrial city of Herat, passing through the town of Dilaram (Nimroz) and Kandahar (Afghanistan) to enter Pakistan via Chaman border, finally reaching Pakistani seaports (Karachi and Gwadar). Analysts label it as the “Suez Canal of Asia”. This mega-infrastructural project can virtually transform regional trade by decreasing freight transit time between Uzbekistan and Pakistan by up to five days[3] while slashing transportation costs by about 40 percent. Some conservative estimates predict this railway line to be shipping between 15 to 20 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2030[4], illustrating its considerable geo-economic potential, thus making it into one of the most critical economic arteries linking Central Asia and South Asia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UFO researcher Jacques Vallée has recently made startling remarks regarding the communication with extra-terrestrial entities in a recent interview. While talking in the podcast titled Weaponized hosted by Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp,  Vallée shared the details of a classified US program in which officials interacted with non-human entities 20 years ago. The government was capable of establishing “direct, structured communications” with a non-human intelligence through a “very sophisticated process,” conducted on an ongoing basis under controlled laboratory conditions at a secure facility he had never heard publicly referenced, he added. “What they described to me, is a very sophisticated process by which we may be able to interact with The Entities,” the UFO expert said in response to a question related to non-human beings. When the host asked about the factual nature of the claims in which the US was able to make communication with non-human intelligence, Vallée called the account factual. “Yes, Yes, it is factual based on the people I met with,” he added. At the same time, he also noted uncertainty over whether the entity was real or simulated, distinguishing it from cases like the 1945 Trinity crash. During the podcast, Vallée also interpreted the 1917 Fatima event as a deep one in the term of testimony as 80,000 people witnessed massive disc, silver thing between them and the sun.
