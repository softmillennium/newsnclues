                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The former first lady told “IMO” podcast listeners Wednesday about the challenging moment with Malia, 27, and Sasha, 24, during which her husband, Barack Obama, “was traveling.” Acknowledging that the little ones were “usually great kids,” Michelle admitted they were “rambunctious” that particular evening. When “no one was listening” to the lawyer, she announced, “Well, that's it… I'm done parenting. Michelle and Barack's eldest child quickly apologized since she doesn't know what she'd “do without” her mom — but their youngest had a different response. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

This is what I wanted from you, lady. “She got five steps up, and I was like, ‘If you don't turn around and get back down here,'” she continued. Michelle noted that the anecdote is an accurate depiction of Malia and Sasha's current personalities. “My younger daughter, she wants to learn her way,” the “Becoming” author explained. “She doesn't want to be told that this is how you do it. This dynamic led to Barack having a more “difficult” time raising Sasha, Michelle said on “IMO” over the summer. “Sasha is like a cat,” Michelle explained in August. Michelle and Barack, 64, learned to “be chameleon[s]” as parents. Malia is a Harvard University graduate and filmmaker, while her sibling has a sociology degree from the University of Southern California. While the girls have yet to appear on Michelle and brother Craig Robinson's podcast, Barack was a guest in July. He poked fun at rampant split rumors surrounding his and Michelle's marriage during the episode, quipping that their relationship had been “touch and go for a while.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two months after Sean “Diddy” Combs filed a two-page notice of appeal signaling plans to challenge both his conviction and sentencing, an in-depth appeal has been filed. Shapiro argues that the court determined Combs' 50-month sentence following his conviction on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution with “heavy reliance on acquitted conduct.” At the time, the jury rejected prosecutors' claims Combs ran a criminal enterprise and coerced two ex-girlfriends into drug-fueled sex with male escorts. “We've filed the final appellate brief in United States v. Combs, and it raises issues that go well beyond this case. In addition to the sentencing appeal, the document presents “a separate and independent basis for overturning Combs's convictions,” arguing that his First Amendment rights were violated by the district court “as a consumer of the sexual performances that took place during freak-offs and hotel nights.” Combs's attorneys claim he was “an observer and producer,” but did not have sex with those present and involved in the videos he filmed. Pink Floyd's Mesmerizing 'Wish You Were Here' Video Arrives 50 Years After Song's Release 40 Years Later, Slick Rick Still Has a Story to Tell Judge Subramanian previously stated, “At some point, illegal activity can't be laundered into constitutionally protected activity just by the desire to watch it.” In the appeal filing, this statement is quoted with attorneys adding the comment, “whatever that means.” In October 2025, he was transferred to the New Jersey federal prison FCI Fort Dix. His projected release date is May 8, 2028, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Combs' defense initially asked for no more than 14 months, which would have been well below the federal probation department's recommended range of 70 to 87 months, or around six to seven years.</p>

There's something about a bleak Birmingham winter that just screams Christmas, which Netflix clearly knew when they released the teaser trailer for “Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man” on Wednesday. Last we saw Cillian Murphy as the lovable gangster Tommy Shelby, he was riding off into the distance on a white horse in the wake of another dispute that cost him multiple loved ones. But as we know, it takes more than a bit of guilt and spilt blood to deter a Shelby, meaning that Tommy is back for what the logline of the film calls “his most destructive reckoning yet.” Related Stories The ‘Pluribus' Finale Defines Humanity's Point of No Return in the Cutest Way Possible Why Rachel Sennott Had to Go Big — and Go to New York — for the ‘I Love LA' Finale Written by “Peaky Blinders” series creator Steven Knight and directed by Tom Harper (“Wild Rose,” “The Aeronauts”), “Immortal Man” co-stars highly decorated newcomers Rebecca Ferguson, Tim Roth, and Barry Keoghan, alongside series regular Sophie Rundle and Season 6 addition Stephen Graham, who is in the midst of a career high following Netflix's “Adolescence.” Back in February, Knight gave his assessment of the film and its stellar cast to Variety: “I would say this — wouldn't I? We've got the best, I think, the best British actors all in one place.” Meanwhile, “Saltburn” star Keoghan told IndieWire of the project a few months before, “I read the script and loved it and have chatted to Cillian about it and it's going to be epic.” It hints at the fact that, once again, we'll see Tommy at a crossroad, torn between giving into his demons and trying to chart a new, more constructive path.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hallmark star Sarah Drew is an incredibly busy actress, not only with her popular series “Mistletoe Murders” but also with other projects. Given that she's also the mother of a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old, it's understandable that finding relaxation can be difficult. In a long-ranging chat with Jennie Garth on her “I Choose Me” podcast, the multi-hyphenate revealed the self-care she chose to get back into a joyful spirit after a particularly grueling year. “Last year, I burned myself out a little bit with work, writing, producing, while also starring on a show,” Drew told Garth. “And I was so exhausted that, by the time November hit, I decided to start reading romantasy.” I had to give it up for Lent. “But I will say, I was saying earlier, it's very difficult for me to do something that… just, just brings me joy and delight, that is not accomplishing anything,” she added. I have a bone to pick with you #jenniferlarmentrout #primalofbloodandbone #romantasy #romantasybooks #romantasybooktok Sarah Drew has been outspoken about her love for the romantasy genre. She often posts on her social media accounts which books she's currently reading and which are her favorites. Drew also recently revealed that she'd love to be in an adaptation of the romantasy series “A Court of Thorns and Roses” (ACOTAR). She's okay with not being a lead character. “Unfortunately, all of those heroines are 17,” she told Soaps.com. “Seventeen and saving the world, it's fine. I can play one of the moms,” she said.

Episode 9, “La Chica o El Mundo,” begins less than two months later, when another guest from that initial meeting — Kusimayu (Darinka Arones), the young Peruvian woman who longed to join her family post-Joining — is about to get her wish. is on its way to her tiny farming village, and one whiff will correct whatever biological error left her separated from everyone else. As she waits for the container to arrive, Kusimayu sits in a small paddock, cradling a baby goat. She strokes its fur slowly, gazing down on the dear creature with blissful affection. But after she sniffs those consciousness-altering vapors, Kusimayu doesn't care about the goat anymore. Her smile may seem similar to what the goat conjured a few minutes prior, but it's not the same. Without realizing it, Kusimayu has done the unthinkable: She's given away her dog. Had Carol been paying attention to Xiu Mei on Air Force One, perhaps she could've recognized the Chinese woman's fierce devotion to her dog mirrored humanity's fierce devotion to our pets — goats very much included. Sure, we may be able to shrug off atrocities inflicted on our fellow man with alarming ease, but if Jesus Christ Himself came down from Heaven and accidentally landed on an innocent pupper, we'd run Him out of town faster than you could say “Hallelujah.” Simply put, there's just an elemental connection between the empathy we show animals and whatever it is that makes us human. “Pluribus” Episode 9 beautifully illustrates as much in its heartbreaking opening scene. Without saying a word, we can tell when Kusimayu joins the hive mind, she loses a part of herself that's good, pure, and soulful. Something is missing, and whatever you want to call it, you feel its acute, agonizing absence when Kusimayu walks away from her tiny goat. Kusimayu's choice sets the stage for Carol's own decision at episode's end, when she has to choose between continuing her pretend life with her pretend wife within their indulgent delusions, or going home to help Manousos (Carlos-Manuel Vesga) do the hard, right, and real thing (aka saving the world). Even without Kusimayu's tear-jerking precurso, griven all we've come to learn about Carol, it's impossible to imagine her living the rest of her days on a romantic vacation with Zosia (Karolina Wydra), to say nothing of agreeing to Join once her own personalized vapor dose is ready. Of course she's going to do the work to “put things back in their place,” as Manuosos describes it. But it's not good enough to know what Carol will do. But “Pluribus” is tackling one of the most challenging and enduring existential questions out there: What makes us human? That's the question Vince Gilligan wants us thinking about in 2025 (and beyond), and that's why “Pluribus” has spent its first season providing answer after answer through a series of enthralling examples. (OK, sometimes they're not so enthralling, but hey, that's human subjectivity for ya.) Well, what about in Episode 8, when Carol writes the first chapter of her next book and lets Zosia read it? Now they can discover something new, discuss what it means with the author, and share in eager anticipation of whatever comes next. Or when Carol cautiously invests in a new romantic relationship only to eventually accept her “chaperone” has just been going through the motions. Just like their time together mirrors a typical courtship, their break-up can be seen as a common, relatable split: These two lovebirds can't overcome a fundamental disparity: Carol needs to be seen and understood by the person sitting across from her, and all the knowledge in the world (aka the hive mind) can't provide her that. I wonder what Vince Gilligan might be trying to tell us here. [picks up iPhone] “Hey Siri, what is ‘Pluribus' about?“) She goes home — and brings an atom bomb with her. I won't pretend to know what happens when Carol unboxes her giant crate (especially since there's a decent chance Gilligan doesn't know either), but my best guess is she brought it home as insurance: If the “weirdos” try to Join her or they succeed in building that giant antenna, she'll set off the nuke and put an end to their interstellar takeover. (“Weirdos,” it must be said, is a term I love not only because it's the perfect descriptor for these well-meaning but distant individuals, but also because it's a handy way to avoid stepping on “Lost's” toes by calling them “the Others.”) No matter her plans, the bomb itself still represents loss. Bombs destroy, and Carol is trying to preserve. “I think there's a way to put things back in their place,” Manuosos says. If they can't do it — if they can't bring back our shared humanity — then we've lost everything that matters. Things like unexpected friends, new art, and true love. And what better way to drive home the point than with a baby goat, trotting after its owner, wondering why she was so eager to give him away? “Pluribus” Season 1 is available in full on Apple TV.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crave's steamy hockey romance is a global sensation, and Canadian artists are reaping the rewards — including multiple Francophone acts from Quebec. Heated Rivalry is a worldwide sensation, and Canadian artists are reaping the rewards. The TV series — written and directed by Jacob Tierney, produced by Bell Media's Crave streamer, licensed to HBO Max and based on Nova Scotia author Rachel Reid's Game Changers series — is arguably the biggest Canadian television success story since Schitt's Creek. Leading up to its finale on Dec. 26, the steamy gay hockey romance has become one of the most talked-about shows of 2025. Episode 5, which aired this weekend, features a crucial synch for Montreal  band Wolf Parade and their 2005 song "I'll Believe In Anything." The episode is now tied with Breaking Bad's "Ozymandias" as the only episode to ever receive a perfect 10/10 rating on IMDb. Since Dec. 19, global streams of "I'll Believe In Anything" have risen by over 2,650%, according to Spotify. Feist's 2007 song "My Moon My Man" also appears in Heated Rivalry, and has seen a resurgence of over 1,500% in streams, Spotify says. The series, which is set partially in Montreal, is also filled with Francophone acts from Quebec, and they've all benefitted from the Heated Rivalry bump. Acts including Philippe B, Alfa Rococo, Malko, Jessica Charlie and Unessential Oils have all jumped tens of thousands of percent in streams and thousands of new playlist adds in just days, Spotify says. Physical copies of the original books are sold out, which has led to a major surge for the Game Changers audiobook series. Bublé's 2011 holiday classic has reached the Billboard Canadian Albums top spot in 2011, 2012, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and now 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tylor Chase is getting help from familiar faces as concern grows over his well-being. The former “Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide” actor, who played Martin Qwerly on the Nickelodeon series, reunited this week with ex-co-star Daniel Curtis Lee in Los Angeles. Chase, 36, drew renewed attention earlier this week when a clip from September resurfaced online showing him living on the streets of Riverside, California. After greeting each other with a long embrace, Lee took Chase out for pizza and later FaceTimed fellow series alum Devon Werkheiser. The clip ended with Lee checking Chase into a hotel and discussing next steps toward treatment. One step closer to long-term treatment,” Lee captioned the post. Lee later shared more details about his efforts to support Chase, explaining that beyond food and shelter, he also helped Chase reconnect with his father. “Love is all we can really give people sometimes, and I'm happy that he was able to have that connection with his pops,” Lee said in an Instagram reel. “I really believe we can get Tylor back on his feet, and you know I'm super feeling it right now with the holiday season,” he added. Lee, Werkheiser, and fellow “Ned's Declassified” alum Lindsey Shaw previously addressed Chase's situation when the video of him living on the streets first surfaced in September. Chase has also drawn support beyond his former Nickelodeon castmates. Shaun Weiss, best known for playing Greg Goldberg in “The Mighty Ducks,” revealed that concrete steps are already in place to help Chase access treatment. I reached out to some friends of mine, and we have a bed for him at a detox, and we have a place for him to go and get long-term treatment,” Weiss said in an Instagram video. “All we need to do now is find him,” he added. Devon Werkheiser also spoke candidly about watching his former co-star struggle. “Tylor was a sensitive, sweet, and kind kid,” Werkheiser told TMZ. “Anyone who has dealt with severe addiction and deep mental health issues knows it's an unbelievably challenging situation if they don't want help,” he continued. Werkheiser said he hopes the renewed attention leads to meaningful intervention. “My only hope is that from this exposure, someone with real understanding and resources can step in, get Tylor into treatment, and help him get back on track,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We witness her final minutes as an individual. In another context, this could all pass as some kind of ancient tribal coming-of-age ritual: charming, moving. Trailing behind, Kusimayu's beloved baby goat bleats. How are we supposed to feel about this? As this Pluribus season has approached its end, I've seen more and more rumblings online from viewers whose patience is being tried. Too many long scenes with no dialogue, I'm hearing. Too many episodes where the plot barely moves. And if not, I hope my use of the word “infestation” here is clarifying. I believe the Joined have good intentions and that they tell the truth as they know it. I also think this doesn't matter—which is why I also don't care much about the particulars of the Joining. You can be the “happiest” entity in the universe, but if your life consists of working all day and then heading straight to sleep—without taking a few hours to yourself to read a romantasy novel or watch The Golden Girls—then that is, objectively, A Bad Thing. For me, what happens to Kusimayu is chilling. As for the way Pluribus has been telling its story…I feel like we had these same arguments about Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul? He likes to watch people think their way through problems—and so do I. The problems Carol faces in this episode are trifold. After the opening credits, we jump back to the Day 60 arrival of Manousos in Albuquerque, where he immediately creates three complications for Carol: 1.) the vast difference between how radical they want to be in their approach to the Joined; and 3.) Let's take these one by one, starting with the language barrier, which generates some sublime comedy. The credited writers for this episode are Alison Tatlock and Gordon Smith (the latter also directed), but it's very Vince Gilligan to consider every potential snag his characters might face and then to come up with entertaining results. In this case, when Manousos pulls up to Carol's house in his ambulance, after they've exhausted their respective English and Spanish vocabularies, Carol pulls out her cell phone and opens an unexpectedly annoying translator app. First of all, it's not entirely accurate. The app can't determine that Carol means “listening device” when she says “bug.” (A confused Manousos: “Insecto?”) When it can't figure out a translation, it inserts the phrase “unknown word or name.” And it won't…stop…translating. Even when a paranoid Manousos grabs her phone and tosses it down a storm drain, we can still hear it babbling away. This brings us to the second complication, which is that Carol sees the Joining as a problem to be solved eventually, while Manousos sees it as an emergency. He doesn't understand why Carol would be using a phone the Others could monitor. Her best, most reasonable explanation for why she engages with them at all is that she still thinks of the Joined as humans, who can be saved. Manousos though says these “weirdos” are better off dead. She believes these folks are fundamentally harmless, given their “no kill” ethos. (Manousos, unmoved: “Isn't it evil to value a man the same as an ant?”) Also, since she's forbidden them from harvesting her stem cells, Carol's sure she's in no danger of being absorbed into the hive mind against her will. The yawning gap between how Carol and Manousos intend to approach this crisis provides some rich drama. Carol is understandably wary of the machete-wielding Manousos, who insists they hide from the Joined by talking in his ambulance. (Carol: “No, we talk in the casa.”) Carol also really wants Manousos to see that her new friends aren't so bad…which is why her heart sinks when he finds a motion sensor she wasn't aware of stashed inside her liquor cabinet. Carol learns from Zosia that the sensor was installed by Helen to make sure Carol wasn't sneaking booze when they were going through fertility treatments. But this explanation hardly placates Manousos, who is now also very curious about Carol's chummy relationship with her “chaperone.” He screams in the face of an Other named Rick, then uses his radio and the unique signal he found back in Paraguay to soothe Rick and to try to coax some humanity back into him. (Meanwhile, back at Carol's house, Zosia is convulsing. But for Manousos, it's a solid start. She's not ready to accept that Manousos's aggressive presence in Albuquerque now means Zosia (and everyone else) will leave again. Nor is she ready to engage with Manousos's pithy challenge: “Do you want to save the world or get the girl?” It's more complicated than that. “La Chica O El Mundo” takes a couple of unexpected turns at the end. They look to be having a great time in their little bubble of abundance, shielded from the emptiness of the world just outside their range of vision. During a conversation at the ski lodge, Carol senses a hesitation in some of Zosia's answers about the future. After further probing, Carol learns the Joined are actively planning to convert her. They can access her stem cells from the eggs she froze with Helen, and they're about a month away (or maybe two or three) from figuring out how to make them usable, at which point Carol will Join. Zosia replies, “We have to do this because we love you.” She then adds, unconvincingly, “Because I love you.” We close on a cliffhanger, as Zosia deposits Carol and a big crate back in Albuquerque, via helicopter. But we don't need to wonder why she's feeling so apocalyptic. We can see it in the stricken look she gives to Zosia before she steps off the helicopter and says goodbye…perhaps forever. Think about this persistent pessimist being lucky enough to find a wife who understands her moods—and then losing her in the Joining. And now here's Zosia, who outwardly affirms Carol while secretly planning to change her. Imagine how devastating all of this must be. With Zosia, Carol insists—sincerely—that she's the best, happiest version of herself. Noel Murray is a contributor to The A.V. Recommended for You1OK Go helps us kick off A.V.

Electronic music is added to the national Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage, acknowledgement that the artform is shaping France's artistic identity. “Electronic music has a rightful place in our national intangible heritage,” says French Culture Minister Rachida Dati, following the ministry's labelling of clubs as “places of artistic expression and celebration”. Special mention is given to Jean-Michel Jarre, who, in his late 20s created the masterpiece Oxygène, an album of sweeping electronic tunes, all of them made on early synthesizers, without a vocal in the mix.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier today, Paramount announced that the new Last Airbender sequel film, The Legend Of Aang, which returns the series to its original protagonist, Aang, will skip theaters and head straight to streaming next fall. Aang is an expansion of the wildly popular Last Airbender franchise, taking place between Avatar and Legend Of Korra, and will be followed by a new streaming series, Avatar: Seven Havens. First announced in 2021, the movie has a formidable voice cast, including Taika Waititi, Geraldine Viswanathan, Dee Bradley Baker, Freida Pinto, Ke Huy Quan, Dave Bautista, Eric Nam, Jessica Matten, Dionne Quan, Román Zaragoza, and Steven Yeun. Both Avatar and its first spin-off, The Legend of Korra, have remained viable animated franchises over the years, with a growing and fervent fanbase. There was, of course, M. Night Shyamalan's 2010 live-action adaptation, which people often forget was actually a pretty big hit. There was also a live-action Netflix series that was released in 2024, which, frankly, failed to have the stickiness of Netflix's other live-action adaptation of another beloved animated fantasy, One Piece. Still, while Avatar is an American production, its heavy anime influence surely would've grabbed some of the moviegoers who made Demon Slayer and Chainsaw Man hits. We're just a website that wants people to go to the movies more, and an animated family adventure film based on popular IP would've been a good opportunity to make our dreams a reality.
