                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During a recent interview with Magenta TV, Muller was asked about the speculation regarding whether Messi will be part of the Argentina squad next summer in North America. “It would be an interesting project from my point of view if he were there,” the German player began. However, Thomas made it clear that Messi's presence would not necessarily provide a boost for Argentina. These comments relate to a topic often debated about Messi's role on the field. He remains a decisive player, even at 38, in the creative aspects of the game, but his defensive contributions are minimal, forcing his teammates to work harder to compensate. Messi has yet to confirm whether he will play in the 2026 World Cup with Argentina. After facing each other for more than a decade at the international level and in European soccer, Thomas Muller and Lionel Messi met again this year in the United States, in the Major League Soccer final between Vancouver Whitecaps and Inter Miami. FIFA Ranking update leaves Messi's Argentina, Ronaldo's Portugal and Top 10 unchanged ahead of 2026 World Cup In the same interview, reflecting on Lionel Messi, Thomas Muller shared his thoughts on Argentina's chances of repeating their 2022 World Cup title, acknowledging that the South American team is “high on the list” of favorites. Finally, he also spoke about his country's own prospects. “At first glance, when you read the names of the opponents, it is of course a must to go through,” he said, referring to Ecuador, Ivory Coast, and Curacao, Germany's Group E rivals. But when you then look again at the overall set-up, that the eight best third-placed teams from 12 groups also go through, then going through is again a must,” Muller added. Lionel Messi's successor in Catalonia, Yamal, has not only matched the elite—he has surpassed them at just 18, topping Mbappe in a decisive attacking feat that underlines how rapidly the balance of power is shifting. Lionel Messi emerged as Inter Miami's offensive leader, leading them to their first MLS Cup. Despite this, the veteran was firmly accompanied by Tadeo Allende, who stepped up his level. Pedri addressed the rumors surrounding a potential return of Lionel Messi to Barcelona. Ousmane Dembélé thrived at PSG, ultimately winning the 2025 Ballon d'Or.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Al-Nassr thrashed Iraqi side Al-Zawraa 5-1 to end the group stage of the AFC Champions League Two with a 100 per cent record. After skipping the first five group games, Cristiano Ronaldo finally played a continental match as he provided an assist in the game. However, it was Kingsley Coman who stole the limelight as his brace helped Al-Nassr bulldoze past their opponents. Saudi Pro League giants Al-Nassr capped off their AFC Champions League Two group stage with a 100 per cent record as they scored five past Al-Zawraa at their home on Wednesday. Seven minutes later, Wesley doubled Al-Nassr's lead. Joao Felix attempted a first-time header from a corner, which was initially stopped, but the midfielder pounced on the rebound ball and found the back of the net. Abdulelah Al-Amiri then added a third goal before the half-hour mark as he converted a clinical header from Felix's corner. While Ronaldo contributed in the encounter with an assist, the veteran star mostly remained silent on a night that truly belonged to Coman. Coman was a livewire on the right flank for Al-Nassr and was the most important player for his side as the Frenchman scored a double and provided the assist for Felix's goal just before the break.

The Al-Zawraa backline remained clueless throughout the game as they did not have any answer to Al-Nassr's relentless attack throughout the 90 minutes, as they gave their opponents ample space to exploit near their penalty box. It proved to be a cakewalk for the Saudi giants eventually. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting</p>

Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen "An international event like the 2026 World Cup creates a short-term surge in lodging demand that allows homeowners to earn significantly more than during a typical rental period," said Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bayern Munich are closely monitoring Cardiff City teenager Dylan Lawlor, with the Bundesliga giants alerted to the defender's rapid rise by Wales manager Craig Bellamy. talkSPORT have reported that the German champions have taken a serious interest in the 19-year-old, whose development in League One has not gone unnoticed across Europe. Lawlor, who turns 20 on New Year's Day, has already established himself as one of the most promising young defenders in the British game. Despite operating outside the Premier League spotlight, his composure, intelligence and maturity have attracted scouts from England's top flight, while Bayern now appear to be positioning themselves at the front of a growing queue. Bellamy's relationship with Bayern head coach Vincent Kompany stretches back more than a decade, built first as teammates and later as colleagues on the coaching staff. The pair played together 36 times for Manchester City between 2009 and 2011, before reuniting years later in management. Bellamy served as Kompany's assistant at Anderlecht and later followed him to Burnley, cementing a professional bond based on trust and shared footballing values. Bellamy's presence at Cardiff's recent EFL Cup quarter-final defeat to Chelsea further underlined his hands-on approach. In total, Lawlor has made 23 first-team appearances this year, each performance adding to the sense that he is developing at an accelerated pace. Those close to the club speak of a player growing in authority with every outing. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Lawlor's progress has been mirrored on the international stage. His first call-up to the Wales senior squad came in June for World Cup 2026 qualifiers, a clear signal of Bellamy's faith in his ability. In September, Bellamy handed Lawlor his first international start against Kazakhstan. He followed that display by starting both of Wales' November qualifiers, contributing to results that secured a World Cup play-off place. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting The report suggests that Kompany has begun to track Lawlor's progress closely, encouraged by Bellamy's glowing assessment. While Bayern have not made a formal approach, the fact that they are monitoring a League One defender underlines the esteem in which Lawlor is held. For Cardiff, the attention represents both validation and a looming challenge. Holding onto a player of such promise will not be easy if Bayern's interest intensifies, particularly given the German club's reputation for decisive action when they identify a long-term target. His current contract runs until 2027 and contains exit clauses that could be activated in the upcoming window, with reports suggesting £57m would be enough to open negotiations. However, there has been no indication from the 32-year-old that he is seeking a new challenge, and discussions over an extension remain a possibility.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new High Impact Player rule, introduced Tuesday by the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), allows teams to spend as much as $1 million above the salary cap on players who meet certain criteria. A player needs to only satisfy one of eight metrics outlined by the rule, with each geared toward quantifying their skill set and commercial marketability. Or a high-impact player, as defined by the league, could include anyone who was selected as a league MVP finalist or was named to the year-end Best XI first team within the last two seasons. Ironically, this new roster mechanism risks pulling that decision-making power away from NWSL teams and placing it with the entities doing the ranking, some of which are directly tied to the league through its $240 million broadcast deal or have selection processes that are questionable at best. Players themselves are critical of the new rule. NWSL Players Association executive director Meghann Burke relayed their concerns in an email to The Athletic on Tuesday, saying players “feel that this is a rushed decision to solve a short-term problem that will have long-term consequences” and sharing their belief that it “circumvents the collective bargaining process” and “unilaterally establishes criteria that relies on third party publications to drive player compensation.” They added that it “privileges a biased voting system that heavily favors European players” and does not account “for the high impact that Brazilian, African, and Japanese Players (sic) have had and will continue to have on NWSL.” The Guardian appears more intentional about curating a globally diverse set of voters and publishes that list, and how they voted, alongside that of the players. ESPN is a media partner of the NWSL. Spanish forward Alexia Putellas is the highest-ranking women's football player on the 2025 SportsPro Most Marketable list, at number 36; female athletes above her include Simone Biles (2), Ilona Maher (3), Caitlin Clark (7), Coco Gauff (10), and A'ja Wilson (31). The media and events company says it compiles its yearly list based on an athlete's brand strength, addressable market, and economics. The other women's football players on this year's list are Beth Mead (46); Aitana Bonmati (63); Lucy Bronze and Mary Earps (70 and 71); Millie Bright (79); Trinity Rodman (120); Mapi Leon (123); Lindsey Horan (127); Lauren James, Sophia Wilson (who is listed as Sophia Smith, despite having married and changed her name nine months before the release of the list), and Marta (137-139); Pernille Harder (141); Patri Guijarro (146); Keira Walsh and Salma Paralluelo (149-150). Most of those same players also cannot qualify as high impact with USWNT minutes, leaving only the still-Eurocentric Ballon d'Or, the Guardian, ESPN FC rankings, and NWSL awards as realistic pathways right now for that group of players. That offers some solace, because at present, the league has narrowed the scope of that future for some players by skewing their chances of being considered high impact. Take these current NWSL players who do not meet the league's criteria but would otherwise be considered high impact, for example: Leicy Santos, Rosemonde Kouassi, Rebeca Bernal, and Gift Monday at the Spirit; Dudinha and Gia Corley of the San Diego Wave; Hina Sugita of Angel City; Claudia Dickey of Seattle Reign, or Taylor Flint of Racing Louisville. Or, even more worrying, the players who have yet to be discovered. A person at the NWSL reiterated to The Athletic on Tuesday that the rule was not crafted for any specific player, although it came eight days before the international transfer window opens and European clubs are likely to up their offers to free agent Trinity Rodman. The NWSL is the only premier women's soccer league in the world that abides by a hard salary cap, which it argues ensures an even distribution of competition, and thus higher numbers of entertaining matches each season to draw in fans and broadcast ratings. It has positioned NWSL clubs to be outbid by teams from other leagues, particularly in Europe, that aren't limited in how much they can spend on a player. In January, center back Naomi Girma left the San Diego Wave to join Chelsea on what was then a record-breaking transfer fee, and, nine months later, winger Alyssa Thompson left Angel City, her hometown club, to join Girma in London to play with Brazilian-American and fellow U.S. teammate Catarina Macario. That trio is part of a growing contingent of top U.S. players in Europe, which also includes Emily Fox at Arsenal; Phallon Tullis-Joyce at Manchester United; Lindsey Heaps, Lily Yohannes, and Korbin Shrader at OL Lyonnes; and Crystal Dunn and Eva Gaetino at Paris Saint-Germain. The league's apparent disinterest in raising the salary cap by $1 million without restrictions, as the NWSLPA has suggested, is a doubling down on its desire to attract and retain a specific type of talent: one they feel confident can return their investment through their commercial appeal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marc Guehi's future appears to be drifting further away from Barcelona after reports in Spain suggested the reigning champions have cooled their interest in the Crystal Palace captain due to his wage demands. Guehi, 25, is under contract at Palace until the summer of 2026 and has already informed the club he will not sign an extension. That decision has effectively guaranteed his departure, setting the stage for a fierce battle among Europe's elite while simultaneously placing Palace in a difficult strategic position. Barcelona had earmarked central defence as a priority area for 2026, with sporting director Deco and head coach Hansi Flick aligned on the need for an experienced left-sided centre-back to partner teenage prodigy Pau Cubarsí. Guehi was viewed internally as the ideal profile, but enthusiasm has now waned. According to Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona had been monitoring Guehi closely and were in contact with his representatives, aware that he could sign a pre-contract agreement as early as next week. However, once the latest salary expectations became clear, discussions stalled and have not resumed in recent weeks. Each, however, would command a substantial transfer fee, and Barcelona's eventual budget remains unclear. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Speaking to DAZN, Eberl stressed Bayern's priority is extending Dayot Upamecano's contract, but admitted alternatives must be considered if talks fail. Eberl said: "It's absolutely clear that we as Bayern Munich are exploring the market. Our clear goal is to extend Upa's [Dayot Upamecano] contract. If that doesn't work out, we have to be prepared. I've not confirmed anything, but we are active in the market." Liverpool, meanwhile, continue to view Guehi as a potential long-term successor to Virgil van Dijk, who will turn 35 next season. The sense of urgency at Anfield has been heightened by Ibrahima Konate's contract situation, with his deal also due to expire in 2026 and rival clubs circling, including Real Madrid.

Speaking to Sky Sports, he played down the emotional impact, revealing he leaned heavily on his faith and the support of teammates, including Palace colleague Maxence Lacroix. He said: "I think everyone has this perception that it was difficult. Because when you're focused on what's the most important thing, it becomes easy. I know that God has a plan for me, and whatever that plan will be, will come into fruition at some point. And fortunately for me, I get to do it with people like Max." For now, his immediate focus remains on Palace, including Sunday's Premier League clash with Tottenham. Yet with Barcelona stepping back and Liverpool and Bayern pushing forward, the next chapter of his career could be written within the next few weeks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jadon Sancho has dropped a cryptic message on Instagram as the winger continues to struggle to reignite his stalling career. Sancho joined Aston Villa on loan from Manchester United over the summer with the hopes of returning to his best form having failed to make his mark following his £73m move to Old Trafford from German side Borussia Dortmund back in 2021. The England international briefly returned to Borussia Dortmund on loan in 2024 having been excluded from the United squad by then-boss Erik ten Hag. Dortmund had looked into re-signing Sancho but were unable to agree a fee with the Premier League side for the 25-year-old. The English wideman, who is out of contract at Old Trafford at the end of the season, joined Villa on loan over the summer as he sought to reignite his stuttering career, but has struggled for game time at Villa Park this season under head coach Unai Emery. Indeed, Sancho is yet to start a league match for the Villans, with all seven outings coming from the bench, though he has featured prominently in the Europa League, starting four of Villa's six European games so far. And Sancho has since made a rare Instagram post, featuring a series of 11 photos and messages. "You gotta serve a purpose to be around me in my new season. Despite a lack of game time at Villa Park, however, Emery has hinted that Sancho could play a significant role in the second half of the season. Emery's Villa side are flying high in the Premier League, and currently sit third, just three points off top spot, despite a five-game winless run to kick off the campaign. Yet with the games coming thick and fast, Emery is set to call upon every player in his squad as Villa look to enjoy another memorable season under the Spaniard.

Emery admitted that Sancho needs to recapture his best form, and last week said of the on-loan star: "Jadon is still being young, he has had an amazing career and is now in a moment where he needs help to recover his best performance. He is really being demanding [of] himself to try to get his best moment this season with us. I believe in him and hopefully we can get it." Sancho isn't the only on-loan player struggling for game time at Villa Park, with Harvey Elliott unable to force his way into Emery's plans. The 22-year-old's move included a clause that meant Villa would make the switch permanent for £35m if Elliott made 10 appearances for Emery's side. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting However, Elliot has made just five appearances for Villa since joining from Liverpool, and ahead of the Europa League win over FC Basel earlier this month, Emery confirmed that the club won't be signing the England U21 Euros winner permanently. "We are speaking with him and about his situation. "First, my decision and also the situation. He is on loan playing with us, but he is not definitely adding to us with a permanent contract. He is training well, but we have one circumstance with him. Elliott, however, is hampered by FIFA rules that means a player can only play for two clubs in a football season. The youngster made two appearances for parent side Liverpool prior to securing his move to Villa, which means Elliott's options are limited to remaining at Villa Park or returning to Anfield for the second half of the campaign.</p>
