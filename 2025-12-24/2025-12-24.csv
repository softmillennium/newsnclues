            Eighteen Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging a new Trump administration policy seeking to bar transgender care for minors at federally-funded hospitals.
    


            The new proposal and the legal fight it has provoked is the latest front in the battle over transgender rights and medical care.
    


            The latest proposal by the Department of Health and Human Services focuses on hospitals' provision of gender identity care for transgender minors. However, the administration has also taken steps to attack transgender medical care for all ages, as part of a broad campaign against transgender rights that has included barring their participation in the military, eliminating references to transgender people from government websites, and ending programs to collect data on trans related health issues.
    


            The states' lawsuit centers on a proposal, announced in a December 18 declaration by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to target hospitals that provide transgender medical care, such as puberty blockers, to minors, by barring their participation in federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
    


            Kennedy claimed that the procedures failed to “meet professionally recognized standards of care.”
    


            The challengers allege that this policy would violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which puts guardrails on how executive branch agencies implement policies. The states claim the policy unlawfully interferes with their administration of Medicaid and it impedes on states' authority to regulate medical practices within their borders.
    


            “Health care decisions should be made by patients, families, and their providers – not by politicians making false claims about the safety of care,” Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.
    


            The other states bringing the lawsuit are Oregon, Washington, New York, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin, as well as the District of Columbia.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signaled new willingness to make concessions on several key negotiating points that have threatened to stall a nascent peace process with Moscow, effectively putting the ball in Russia's court.
    


            In an unusually candid and wide-ranging meeting with reporters Tuesday, Zelensky gave new details about a 20-point plan that he described as “a foundational document on ending the war, a political document between us, America, Europe, and the Russians.” The Ukrainian president also discussed specifics of security guarantees between Ukraine, the United States and European countries that would form a crucial part of any peace deal with Russia.
    


            Zelensky said he expected to receive a response from Moscow Wednesday after the US side engages with the Kremlin.
    


            The draft 20-point agreement represents a slimmed-down version of an original 28-point plan the US previously discussed with the Russian side. In his remarks, Zelensky outlined what the Ukrainian side says would be an acceptable compromise for withdrawing its troops from portions of the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine that are currently not held by Russian forces.
    


            That area includes the “fortress belt” of fortified Ukrainian cities such as Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in Donetsk region that currently stand in the way of any potential Russian advance deeper into the heart of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Ukraine must effectively cede all of Donetsk for a peace plan to work.
    


            Detailing his country's position, the Ukrainian president said Russia would have to engage in a withdrawal of its forces equivalent to ground ceded by Ukrainian troops, effectively establishing a demilitarized zone around some of the present front lines.
    


            “If we establish a free economic zone here, and it envisages a virtually demilitarized zone, – meaning heavy forces are removed from this area – and the distance, for example, is 40 kilometers (it could be five, 10, or 40 kilometers) – then if these two cities, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, are our free economic zone, the Russians would have to pull back their troops accordingly by five, 10, or 40 kilometers,” Zelensky said.
    


            Among the other key points of the draft plan outlined by Zelensky, including proposed revisions by Kyiv:
    


            • An affirmation of Ukraine's sovereignty and a non-aggression agreement between Russia and Ukraine;
    


            • Security guarantees provided to Ukraine by the United States, NATO, and European states that Zelensky said would “mirror Article 5” – NATO's cornerstone principle of mutual self-defense. The plan would call for a military response and reinstatement of sanctions on Moscow if Russia invades Ukraine, but the guarantees would be rescinded if Ukraine launches an attack on Russia or opens fire on Russian territory without provocation;
    


            • A development package to support Ukraine's postwar economic recovery, including establishment of a Ukraine Development Fund to invest in technology, data centers, and artificial intelligence as well as investment in Ukraine's natural gas sector by US companies. Zelensky estimated the overall economic losses caused by the war to be $800 billion;
    


            • A compromise proposal for the operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, currently held by Russia. Zelensky said Ukraine proposes the plant would be operated by a joint enterprise between the US and Ukraine, with 50% of the electricity output going to Ukraine and the remainder allocated by the US;
    


            • The withdrawal of Russian troops from the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv regions of Ukraine;
    


            • A legally binding agreement, with implementation monitored and guaranteed by a Peace Council chaired by US President Donald Trump; and
    


            • A full ceasefire taking effect immediately once all parties agree to the deal.
    


            Control of territory is the most complex point of any deal, along with the potential sequencing of events. Zelensky also spoke at length about a potential nationwide referendum in Ukraine that would formalize the end of the war.
    


            “People could then choose: does this ending suit us, or does it not?” he said. “That would be the referendum. A referendum requires at least 60 days. And we need a real ceasefire for 60 days; otherwise, we cannot hold it. In other words, the referendum would not be legitimate.
    


            People living in territories controlled by Russia, Zelensky said, cannot be expected to cast a fair vote.
    


            “But in the territory we control, where a legal and fair referendum can actually be conducted, the voting and preparation process – just as, by the way, with the potential elections our partners talk about – must take place under secure conditions,” he said. “Without security, legitimacy is in question as well. We explain all of this to our partners.”
    


            Ukraine has been under pressure to hold elections as soon as possible after an agreement is signed. Putin has long maintained that the government in Kyiv is not legitimate and that Ukraine must hold elections for a peace deal to work. Zelensky's presidential term expired in 2024, but elections cannot be held under martial law that was imposed after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Those wartime measures that have been upheld by the Ukrainian parliament.
    


            The Trump administration's peace effort – led by US special envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner – has been slowly inching forward in recent weeks. Over the weekend, a Ukrainian delegation led by Ukrainian National Security Secretary Rustem Umerov and Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev met separately with their American counterparts in talks that Witkoff described as “constructive and productive.”
    


            Speaking to reporters Wednesday on a conference call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Dmitriev gave Putin “a detailed briefing on the results of his trip to Miami. Based on this information, Moscow will formulate its next steps and continue contacts in the very near future through existing channels.”
    


            Peskov declined to discuss specifics, saying Moscow considered it “counterproductive” to discuss negotiations in the press.

            In a churchyard, about 100 miles west of London, the rain drives at a 45-degree slant, pounding the stone footpath so hard it bounces back as white fuzz that hovers just below the ankle.
    


            St Mary's Church is the 14th-century nucleus of Painswick, a town in the Cotswolds, a region in southwest England famed for its hills and honey-colored cottages. It is a chunk of that Jane Austen-esque, close-to-cloyingly twee England that has long attracted tourists and homebuyers — sometimes despite the weather.
    


            Lately, though, local real estate agents told CNN, increasing numbers of Americans are calling it home.
    


            According to those agents, some want their children to attend prestigious British schools and universities; others seek a bucolic, slower pace of life. Some feel pushed to leave the United States by the threat of wildfires or gun violence, or by political changes they oppose. Most are incredibly wealthy.
    


            “I have this funny feeling,” Frances Shultz, a 60-something North Carolinian who bought a Cotswolds cottage in 2023, told CNN, “of being sort of dropped in the middle of a TV series, a very wholesome, sweet BBC one.”
    


            It's an ambition that Schultz, a journalist and author writing about homes and interior design, had nursed for years. She described living vicariously through the pages of Country Life, a British property magazine teeming with glossy photos of manor houses and their multi-acres.
    


            A divorce in 2022 provided the necessary push: Schultz soon bought a four-bed cottage a stone's throw from St Mary's. “It was love at first sight,” she said of her new home.
    


            Katy Campbell, Schultz's buying agent — a type of realtor finding properties and negotiating their prices on behalf of buyers — told CNN that she's seen a 20% increase in the number of American clients over the past year.
    


            Historically, a big chunk of these clients were already living in the UK — usually London — when they came to buy their countryside boltholes. Now, Campbell said she's fielding more calls from Americans based in the United States, and has grown familiar with their tastes.
    


            They purchase homes — usually their second, third or fourth — for between £1 million ($1.3 million) and “tens of millions,” she said. They want cozy (think Kate Winslet's cottage in “The Holiday,” just much, much bigger) and they want discretion. “They can wander in villages and people don't really turn and stare,” she added. “So you can be fairly incognito in the Cotswolds.”
    


            Naturally, Campbell won't name names, but did say that some clients are “from films.”
    


            The Cotswolds span several of England's “shires” and are sprinkled with British celebrities. David Beckham regularly posts vignettes of life on his Oxfordshire estate to Instagram, including making honey and digging for vegetables. Kate Moss has been photographed tramping around the same shire in muddy boots since the early 2000s.
    


            American celebrities have also drawn attention to the area. Comedian Ellen DeGeneres helped put the area on international radars when she moved there from California in 2024. Vice President JD Vance spent part of his family vacation in the Cotswolds this summer.
    


            Schultz spends her summers in Painswick and the rest of the year in New York City. She once owned a cottage in the Hamptons — the see-and-be-seen vacation spot for the city's elite that has drawn comparisons to the London-Cotswolds axis — but picked Painswick for its relative simplicity.
    


Ellen DeGeneres says she was ‘kicked out of show business.' Is it time to welcome her back?



            “This tiny town is full of characters like the tiny town in North Carolina I grew up in,” she said, noting that she allows plenty of time for trips to the local library as she expects to stop for several conversations along the way.
    


            “The Hamptons is much more whizzy,” Shultz said. “(It's) glitzier, it's more social, it's more dressy, it's slicker. And the Cotswolds — even the posh Cotswolds — are much more low-key.”
    


            According to real estate site Rightmove, the average house in the Cotswolds sold for almost £440,000 ($590,000) during the past 12 months, almost two-thirds more than the UK average.
    


            Buying agent Harry Gladwin said he noticed the number of enquiries from America beginning to rise late last year. They are up around 30% since then, he noted, with some clients citing politics as a key motivation to move.
    


            About one fifth of Gladwin's clients are now American, some of whom were were already based in the UK. Typically, they have budgets between £6 million ($8 million) and £8 million ($10.8 million) and are drawn to the history of the homes on offer. Gladwin said he recently helped an American client purchase a manor house dating back to the 1300s.
    


            “That's what I think a lot of Americans particularly love about the UK — is that incredible history,” he said. “The story behind all these houses… and the fact that they can own a bit of history.”
    


            Pennsylvanian Lauren Neely is a student of that history.
    


            The 35-year-old writer of historical fiction moved to Painswick with her husband and two children six months ago. For many years, the couple fantasized about moving to the UK after an unforgettable college semester in Scotland. So when a work opportunity cropped up for her husband near Painswick, they jumped.
    


            The family rents a four-bed former coach house in the center of town. “I think it dates from the 1700s,” Neely said. “(There are) these beautiful archways where you can see where three carriages would have been.” She describes it as “modest” compared with others nearby.
    


            “We're not coming from generational wealth, or the higher privilege that some do, especially here in the Cotswolds,” she added.
    


            Neely is working on a novel set in the 1400s and takes inspiration from Painswick's history, occasionally cutting through the yard of St Mary's Church to indulge in writerly superstitions: “I just stop in there sometimes after putting the kids on the bus in the morning, and just take a moment and touch the stone, and it takes me back (to that time) absolutely.”
    


            Neely is embracing her new life in Painswick. She said her husband and son are ensconced in the local football scene and believes the locally sourced food has improved her family's health.
    


            She doesn't exclude the possibility of one day returning to the United States. Yet, Neely said, “there isn't much that we miss.”

Imperialist powers, including former colonizer France, are trying to “provoke chaos” within the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), Niger's interim president, General Abdourahamane Tchiani, has said. He warned that no foreign actor, international organization, or lobby will be allowed to dictate terms to the group.

Speaking at a summit of the AES in Mali's capital, Bamako, on Tuesday, Tchiani framed the alliance as a sovereignty project born out of frustration with years of foreign military involvement and political pressure in the Sahel.

“Decisions concerning our peoples are taken in Ouagadougou, in Bamako, in Niamey, on confederal territory, by the authorities of the confederation … and nowhere else,” he noted.

The Nigerien leader said the Sahel's poverty and insecurity had been driven by unequal partnerships and external influence, arguing that “there is no progress… without true independence.”

The AES was formed in September 2023 by the three former French colonies after coups in each country and amid a jihadist insurgency linked to Al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) that has killed thousands and displaced millions across the region over the past decade. The alliance was upgraded to a confederation in July 2024, and Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger later quit the West African regional bloc ECOWAS after disputes over post-coup sanctions and accusations that the organization served external powers.

Since 2020, a wave of military coups has reshaped politics across the Sahel region in Africa, toppling civilian governments in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger.

France, once the region's dominant external power, has steadily lost influence amid rising anti-French sentiment and deep frustration over insecurity, economic stagnation, and foreign interference. The former colonial power was forced to withdraw troops from Mali in 2022, Burkina Faso in 2023, Niger later that year, and Chad in early 2025.

About 4,500 soldiers had been deployed under Operation Barkhane, France's largest overseas mission, across Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad – a campaign that the military governments in Bamako, Niamey, and Ouagadougou have said only permitted Islamist insurgents to expand their activities.

The three West African states have established the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) and withdrawn from the International Organization of Francophone Nations (OIF) operating in Francophone countries, many of them former French colonies. The AES has forged new alliances, including with Russia, which its leaders hail as a more reliable economic and security partner.

The AES leaders have repeatedly blamed France for failed counterinsurgency efforts and have accused it of interference and “aggression.” They have also accused Ukraine of backing terrorist groups operating in the Sahel, allegations Kiev denies.

On Tuesday, Tchiani said the group has “put an end to all predatory contracts and biased commitments that only serve interests contrary to those of our states and our populations.”

He described security as “a strategic priority choice, against any other foreign political diktat incompatible” with the socio-cultural values of the AES, labeling the crisis “an existential threat.”

During the summit, the second since the AES was inaugurated, the group launched the Confederal Investment and Development Bank (BCID-AES), capitalized at 500 billion CFA francs (about $820 million), and unveiled AES Television, intended to counter what officials describe as hostile foreign media narratives.

India has successfully launched its heaviest commercial communications satellite to a low earth orbit.

The Indian Space Research Organization's (ISRO) LVM3 ‘Baahubali' rocket launched the BlueBird Block-2 communication satellite of US-based AST SpaceMobile from Sriharikota in southern India.

“LVM3-M6 successfully and precisely injected the BlueBird Block-2 communication satellite in the intended orbit,” ISRO Chairman V. Narayanan said on Wednesday.

“We are strengthening the foundations for future missions such as Gaganyaan, expanding commercial launch services and deepening global partnerships,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X. “This increased capability and boost to self-reliance are wonderful for the coming generations.”

The mission was undertaken as part of the commercial agreement signed between NewSpace India Ltd (NSIL), a commercial arm of ISRO, and AST SpaceMobile, NDTV reported.

The ‘Baahubali' rocket lifted off at 8:55am local time on Wednesday.

The BlueBird Block-2 got separated from the rocket after 15 minutes and reached its intended orbit.

This is the heaviest payload carried by an Indian launcher.

The aim of the communications satellite is to beam broadband from space to ordinary smartphones without any special gear.The mission marks the sixth operational flight of LVM3, which has successfully launched Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3, and two OneWeb missions carrying 72 satellites. The previous launch of LVM3 was the LVM3-M5/CMS-03 mission on November 2.

The ISRO aims to triple its annual spacecraft production over the next three years and increase the global share of the country's space industry from the current 2% to 8% by 2030.

Sudanese Prime Minister Kamil Idris on Monday presented a new peace initiative to the UN Security Council to end the country's civil war. The brutal conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been raging since April 2023.

The proposal was unveiled during an open Security Council session convened at the request of Sudan's civilian government.

Idris said the plan envisages a phased process, beginning with an internationally monitored ceasefire. This would be followed by the withdrawal of RSF fighters from urban areas to designated camps under the supervision of the UN, the African Union, and the Arab League.

“The Sudanese civilian government's initiative to end the conflict begins with a ceasefire, disarmament, non-selective justice, and non-formal reconciliation,” the Sudanese official stated. 

He added the plan also involves the disarmament of the RSF, alongside transitional justice measures including war crimes prosecutions, a review of conflict-related legal cases, and the possible integration of some RSF members into national security forces. Humanitarian access would be restored, and displaced civilians would be allowed to return to their homes.

The proposal builds on a roadmap submitted to the UN in March 2025, which similarly called for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of RSF forces from cities and a three-month window for humanitarian access, and the return of displaced civilians. 



Sudan descended into chaos in April 2023 when fighting erupted between the national army (Sudanese Armed Forces, SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This occurred after months of tension between their commanders, army generals Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo ‘Hemedti', respectively, over a planned transition to civilian rule. What began in the capital, Khartoum, as a power struggle has devastated the country, killing tens of thousands and displacing millions.

Regional and international peace efforts, including African Union mediation and Saudi–US talks in Jeddah, have repeatedly stalled. Sudanese officials have named Colombians and Ukrainians among mercenaries backing the RSF against the army. Officials have also accused Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates of involvement and recently claimed the European Union has an “incomplete understanding of the complex situation” in the country.

Khartoum has also accused authorities in neighboring Kenya of backing the RSF and has broken ties with the East African grouping IGAD amid mistrust of regional mediation. In July, TASIS, a political coalition aligned with the paramilitary, announced the formation of a rival government months after its members signed a charter in Nairobi. It named Gen. Dagalo as chairman of a 15-member presidential council, a move rejected by the UN and AU.

In September, the ‘Quartet' of the US, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt unveiled a proposal outlining a three-month humanitarian pause in Sudan, followed by a ceasefire, and a nine-month transition toward civilian rule. However, Sudan's army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, last month rejected the US-backed proposal, calling it the “worst” initiative so far.

On December 11, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Moscow is ready to help facilitate political dialogue in Sudan if requested by the country's authorities. He stressed that the focus should be on finding a solution to the crisis and reiterated that Russia “is ready to facilitate” peace efforts, noting that Moscow “has such capabilities.”

Critics say deployment is unwarranted and could cause fear in the city, which has seen a decrease in violent crime rates

The Trump administration is deploying 350 national guard troops to New Orleans ahead of the new year, launching another federal deployment in the city at the same time that an immigration crackdown led by border patrol is under way.

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on Tuesday that guard members, as they have in other deployments in large cities, will be tasked with supporting federal law enforcement partners, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. Parnell added that the national guard troops will be deployed through February.

Louisiana's governor, Jeff Landry, a Republican, praised Donald Trump and the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, for coordinating the deployment and predicted the guard's presence would have a positive impact. “It's going to help us further crack down on the violence here in the city of New Orleans and elsewhere around Louisiana,” Landry said in an appearance on the The Will Cain Show on Fox News. “And so a big shoutout to both of them.”

Critics have argued a national guard deployment is unwarranted and could cause fear in the community, and they point out that New Orleans has actually seen a decrease in violent crime rates.

The deployment of the national guard to the Democratic-led city comes as border patrol agents have been carrying out an immigration crackdown since the beginning of the month. According to the Department of Homeland Security, agents have arrested several hundred people during the first couple weeks of what is expected to be a months-long operation that has a goal of 5,000 arrests.

Back in September, Landry asked Trump to send a 1,000 federally funded troops to Louisiana cities, citing concerns about crime. Landry has praised Trump for sending troops to other cities, including Washington DC and Memphis, Tennessee.

The president has also taken a shine to Landry. Trump on Sunday announced he was appointing the governor to serve as his special envoy to Greenland, the strategic, vast and semi-autonomous territory of Denmark that Trump has said the US needs to take over.

New Orleans has been on pace for much of the year to have its lowest number of murders in decades, according to preliminary data from the city's police department. There have been 97 homicides in 2025 as of 1 November, including 14 revelers who were killed on New Year's Day during a truck attack on Bourbon Street.

A US army veteran driving a pickup truck that bore the flag of the Islamic State group wreaked carnage on New Orleans' raucous new year's celebration as he steered around a police blockade and slammed into revelers before being shot dead by police.

There were 124 homicides last year and 193 in 2023, according to city figures. Armed robberies, aggravated assaults, carjackings, shootings and property crimes have also trended downward.

New Orleans is no stranger to having national guard members in the city. In January, 100 guard members were sent to the city to help with security measures after the New Year's Day truck attack. Guard members were also present for major events in the city this year, including the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Known as Tea Tyme, Tynesha McCarty-Wroten arrested over 3 November death of Darren Lucas in Zion, Illinois

The social media creator who allegedly hit and killed a pedestrian as she hosted a livestream while simultaneously driving through a Chicago suburb has been arrested, according to authorities.

Known best to her online followers as Tea Tyme, Tynesha McCarty-Wroten was arrested Tuesday for her role in the 3 November death of 59-year-old Darren Lucas, said Lt Paul Kehrli of the Zion, Illinois, police department.

Local jail records show McCarty-Wroten, 43, faces felony charges of reckless homicide and aggravated use of a communications device resulting in death.

Lucas's son-in-law, Chris King, said Tuesday that the state attorney's office had informed his family of McCarty-Wroten's arrest.

“The family and myself are glad to see the wheels of justice moving,” King said.

Lucas was walking at an intersection in Zion, near his home town of Beach Park, when a motorist reportedly struck him, leaving him unconscious. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital emergency room from blunt force injuries.

McCarty-Wroten remained at the scene of the crash to speak to investigators and wasn't immediately charged. But she ultimately drew the police's scrutiny after they became aware of a video that suggested Lucas had been hit by a driver livestreaming on a TikTok account associated with Wroten at the time.

​​The video in question was a screen recording of a TikTok livestream. It showed user “Tea_Tyme_3” speaking at her telephone before a loud thud prompted her to say: “Fuck, fuck, fuck … I just hit somebody.”

Tea_Tyme_3 ended the livestream just as a child in the car asked what had happened. Someone else in the car, meanwhile, questioned whether the driver was OK.

That account was subsequently made private, and a biography section that said the user was from Zion was deleted.

McCarty-Wroten – who is linked to the Tea Tyme moniker in online profiles and Illinois state business records – later sparked a social media outcry when she hosted a livestream days after Lucas's death and solicited donations on the Cash App platform that she said were meant to support her taking “mental leave” from the web.

“You know I don't like asking y'all for shit, but if y'all … find it in y'all's heart and y'all wanna support, my CashApp is right there,” she said, according to a recording of the plea made to a restricted TikTok audience.

Among numerous negative replies to McCarty-Wroten's plea was a TikTok comment reading: “Wow despicable!!! She has no remorse!!!” Another read: “CASH APP???? AFTER MOWING OVER SOMEBODY…????”

Besides being a TikTok personality, online profiles associated with Tea Tyme tout her as a musician and book publisher.

Lucas's family has launched a GoFundMe campaign meant to raise financial support for his widow, whom King described as the late man's “everything”.

Studies through the years have attributed cell phone use while driving to an increase in the potential for crashes like the one that killed Lucas.

TikTok prohibits drivers from livestreaming on the platform as a matter of safety. But setting a customized background with the platform's green screen function can defeat the safety measure.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Nuclear plant to restart

Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) plans to restart the first unit of its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, the world's biggest, on Jan. 20, TEPCO president Tomiaki Kobayakawa told reporters yesterday. This week, the prefecture assembly in Niigata, the region where the plant is located, gave a green light for the partial restart of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant. It would be the first for TEPCO since its Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear reactor's meltdown in 2011. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa was among 54 reactors shut after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima plant.

Crash kills eight

Eight people, including several children, were killed when a kindergarten director lost control of an SUV and plunged into a pond, state media reported yesterday. The crash occurred on Tuesday afternoon in Pengze County, 480km west of Shanghai. The crash took place on a downhill section of road likely made slippery by rainfall, New Security reported. The seven-seat SUV was typically used to transport children attending a private kindergarten in the area, the report said.

 THAILAND

Party names PM candidate

Caretaker Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul yesterday was picked by his Bhumjaithai Party to stand as its candidate in a general election in early February. Less than 100 days after he was elected prime minister, Anutin dissolved the parliament earlier this month when his minority government faced the threat of a no-confidence vote. Speaking to party members and supporters yesterday, Anutin said that he and his Bhumjaithai Party were ready to return to power, describing the Feb. 8 election as “the most consequential poll” for the party since its formation in 2008. “Today we are sure and ready to enter the election race to serve Thailand and its people,” Anutin said. “This is the first time the Thai people has high expectations from the Bhumjaithai Party.”

 RUSSIA

Moon plans unveiled

Roscosmos plans to put a nuclear power plant on the moon in the next decade to supply its lunar space program and a joint Russian-Chinese research station. The state space corporation in a statement said that it planned to build a lunar power plant by 2036 and signed a contract with the Lavochkin Association aerospace company to do it. Roscosmos said the purpose of the plant was to power the nation's lunar program, including rovers, an observatory and the infrastructure of the Russian-Chinese International Lunar Research Station. “The project is an important step towards the creation of a permanently functioning scientific lunar station and the transition from one-time missions to a long-term lunar exploration program,” Roscosmos said.

 UNITED STATES

Palau asked about transfers

Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau spoke with Palauan President Surangel Whipps Jr about transferring third-country nationals to the Pacific island nation. “The leaders discussed a new US-Palau memorandum of understanding regarding the transfer of third-country nationals with no known criminal histories,” the Department of State said in a statement after Tuesday's call. In late July, Palau's Congress said it “cannot accept” a proposal by Washington for it to accept asylum seekers from other countries.

Taiwan is to pursue and expand ties with like-minded countries to counter Beijing's poaching, rather than reactively defending existing relationships with diplomatic allies, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) said earlier this month. 

He made the remarks in a video interview released earlier this month by the YouTube channel Hsiaochun Taiwan Plus (筱君台灣PLUS), saying that Taipei's Diplomatic Allies Prosperity Project would showcase the advantages of being Taiwan's friend to the world. 

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is making a pivot from a “defensive” diplomatic strategy to an “offensive” one, emphasizing developing links with old and new friends, he said.

That is because the former strategy of passively guarding existing ties against China's overtures has resulted in a steady loss of diplomatic allies, Lin said. 

Taiwan's rising power and relative importance to the world have enabled the ministry to use the nation's economic, military and cultural assets in burnishing its international profile, he said. 

Foreign governments are coming to the realization that developing relations with Taiwan would provide them with insight on how to handle China and a chance to secure the first island chain, Lin said. 

Aggressive diplomacy has already blunted China's legal warfare against Taiwan, as the European Parliament voted to condemn Beijing's distortion of UN Resolution 2758, he said. 

The EU legislative body's adaptation of the text denouncing the resolution's misinterpretation stemmed from the ministry's years of work with the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, Lin said. 

Beijing was forced to reiterate its “one China” principle with the more receptive leaders of the so-called global south, which did little to cover its loss, he said. 

The overwhelming consensus among Taiwanese and the international community is that Taiwan does not belong to the People's Republic of China, and that Taiwan is not the problem of the Taiwan Strait, but the solution to the “China problem,” Lin said. 

European officials have acknowledged to their Taiwanese counterparts that they understand that cooperation with Taiwan is a key to contain China's and Russia's authoritarian expansionism, he said 

The Chinese Communist Party deems Taiwan to be an enemy, as evidenced by Chinese public figures calling for the Chinese military to “seize the island and wipe out the people” should it invade the nation, Lin said. 

Taiwanese must face the reality that appeasing China would not save them, and that signing peace treaties with Beijing would leave Taiwan disarmed and at China's mercy, he said. 

Taiwan should seek to help China's integration into the global community, he said, adding that the world would welcome Beijing with open arms if it demonstrates peaceful intentions and goodwill. 

Taipei and Washington achieved consensus on tariffs, as the two sides are working on the exchange and texts connected to trade matters, he said. 

Taiwan and the US are in fundamental agreement about bilateral trade due to shared interests, and changes in Washington's political leadership would not affect it negatively, he said. 

Chinese President Xi Jinping's (習近平) initiation of a telephone call last month with Washington indicated that he was more eager to engage in talks than US President Donald Trump, Lin said.

A boat belonging to an Egyptian pharaoh is being assembled in full view at the Grand Egyptian Museum's exhibition hall.

Staff on Tuesday morning began piecing together the cedarwood boat, one of two that were found that belonged to King Khufu, as dozens of visitors watched.

The assembly of the 42m-long vessel, which sits next to its already-assembled twin that has been on display, is expected to take about four years, said Issa Zeidan, head of restoration at the Grand Egyptian Museum.

It contains 1,650 wooden pieces.

King Khufu ruled Egypt about 4,000 years ago and built the Great Pyramid of Giza.

“You're witnessing today one of the most important restoration projects in the 21st century,” said Egyptian Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Sherif Fathy, who attended the event.

The US$1 billion museum, also known as GEM, was touted as the world's largest when it was lavishly inaugurated last month. It is home to nearly 50,000 artifacts, including the collection of treasures from the tomb of the famed King Tutankhamun, which was discovered in 1922.

The museum, located near the pyramids at the edge of Cairo, is expected to boost Egypt's tourism revenues and help bolster its ailing economy.

The boat was one of two discovered in 1954, opposite the southern side of the Great Pyramid.

The excavation of its wooden parts began in 2014, the museum's Web site says.

The exact purpose of the boats remains unclear, but experts believe they were either used to transport King Khufu's body during his funeral or were meant to be used for his afterlife journey with the sun god Ra, the Web site says.

Police officers involved in the torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in an explosion in Moscow, sources within Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 24.

The attack highlights the ongoing targeting of Russian officials linked to war crimes in Ukraine. Russia's Investigative Committee confirmed that the explosion killed two police officers. 

Ukrainian intelligence sources said the officers had previously taken part in Russia's war against Ukraine and were implicated in the abuse of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs).

According to the HUR sources, the officers were involved in the systematic torture of Ukrainian POWs, practices that violate the Geneva Conventions and the laws and customs of war. 

The intelligence sources said the attack took place at around 1 a.m., when a local resident approached a police car parked near a police station and threw an improvised explosive device through the vehicle's window. The blast killed two officers inside the car and injured two more.

The attacker acted ""in protest against the Kremlin's aggressive policy,"" according to the HUR sources. Russian authorities have not confirmed this claim.

Russia's Investigative Committee said it opened a criminal case under articles related to attempts on the life of law enforcement officers and the illegal trafficking of explosive devices.

Russian forces have faced repeated accusations from Ukraine and international organizations of widespread mistreatment of captives since the start of the full-scale invasion.

The incident follows another high-profile attack in Moscow earlier this week. On Dec. 22, Fanil Sarvarov, head of the operational training department of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, was killed in a car bombing, the Investigative Committee reported.

Ukrainian intelligence sources said the officers had previously taken part in Russia's war against Ukraine and were implicated in the abuse of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs).



While many respondents expressed hopes for an end to the fighting, they largely expect it to conclude on terms ""proclaimed as its goals,"" reflecting continued alignment with the Kremlin's narrative.



The number includes 1,090 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

""No one can guarantee that the shelter facility will remain standing after that. That is the main threat,"" plant director Serhii Tarakanov said.

After weeks of talks, Ukraine and the U.S. have prepared a draft of the revised peace plan to end Russia's full-scale war. 

The initial 28-point plan, which effectively pushed Ukraine toward capitulation, has been reworked into a 20-point framework, which President Volodymyr Zelensky presented to journalists on Dec. 23 for the first time.

In addition, a three-party security guarantee draft between Ukraine, the U.S., and Europe has been developed, as well as a bilateral security guarantee agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. Another document between Kyiv and Washington is focused on economic cooperation and was described as the ""roadmap for Ukraine's prosperity.""

""We have made significant progress toward finalizing the documents,"" Zelensky said.

The U.S. is expected to deliver the 20-point draft to Moscow later on Dec. 24. If approved, the final document must be signed by the leaders of Ukraine, the U.S., Europe, and Russia. Those signing a potential agreement from the European side are yet to be decided.

The ceasefire is expected to start as soon as the agreement is signed. For the agreement to take effect it must be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament and/or supported by the people of Ukraine in a referendum that would take place potentially within 60 days.

So far, Ukraine and the U.S. have not reached an agreement on two major issues in the revised plan, points 12 and 14 — control of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and control of the Donbas region, ravaged by war since 2014. The deal also does not mention Ukraine's aspirations for NATO membership. 

The Kyiv Independent is publishing the draft of the potential 20-point peace plan, developed by Ukraine and the U.S, and presented and paraphrased by the president of Ukraine.

1. The signatories affirm that Ukraine is a sovereign state.

2. The document constitutes a full and unquestionable non-aggression agreement between Russia and Ukraine. A monitoring mechanism will be set up to oversee the conflict line using satellite-based unmanned surveillance, ensuring early detection of violations.

3. Ukraine will receive security guarantees.

4. The size of Ukraine's Armed Forces will remain at 800,000 personnel during peacetime.

5. The U.S., NATO, and European signatory states will provide Ukraine with “Article 5–like"" guarantees. Following points apply:

A) If Russia invades Ukraine, a coordinated military response will be launched, and all global sanctions against Russia will be reinstated.

B) If Ukraine invades Russia or opens fire at Russian territory without provocation, the security guarantees will be considered void. If Russia opens fire on Ukraine, the security guarantees will come into effect.

C) The U.S. will receive compensation for providing security guarantees. (This provision has been removed.)

D) Previously signed bilateral security agreements between Ukraine and around 30 countries will remain in place.

6. Russia will formalize its non-aggression stance towards Europe and Ukraine in all necessary laws and documents, ratifying them by Russia's State Duma.

7. Ukraine will become an EU member at a clearly designated time and will receive a short-term preferential access to the European market.

""As of today, the timing of Ukraine's accession is a bilateral discussion between the United States and Ukraine, without European confirmation for now,"" Zelensky said.

""Membership in the European Union is also our security guarantee, and therefore we want to set a date — when this will happen. For example, 2027 or 2028.""

8. Ukraine will receive a global development package, detailed in a separate agreement, covering various economic areas:

A) A development fund will be created for investing in fast-growing industries, including technology, data centers, and artificial intelligence.

B) The U.S. and U.S. companies will work with Ukraine to jointly invest in the restoration, modernization, and operation of Ukraine's gas infrastructure, including pipelines and storage facilities.

C) Joint efforts will be made to rebuild war-torn areas, focusing on restoring and modernizing cities and residential neighborhoods.

D) Infrastructure development will be prioritized.

E) Extraction of minerals and natural resources will be expanded.

F) The World Bank will provide a special funding package to support the acceleration of these efforts.

G) A high-level working group will be established, including the appointment of a leading global financial expert as the prosperity administrator to oversee the implementation of the strategic recovery plan and future prosperity.

9. The creation of several funds to address the restoration of the Ukrainian economy, the reconstruction of damaged areas and regions, and humanitarian issues will be established. The aim is to mobilize $800 billion, the estimated cost of the damage from the Russian war.

10. Ukraine will accelerate the process of negotiating a free trade agreement with the U.S.

11. Ukraine reaffirms its commitment to remaining a non-nuclear state, in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

12. Control over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and the restoration of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant.

Washington proposes that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant be jointly operated by Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S., with each country controlling 33%, and the U.S. serving as the primary overseer of the station.

Ukraine opposes Russian control over the plant. Kyiv proposes that the plant be managed by a joint venture consisting of the U.S. and Ukraine, where 50% of the electricity generated will go to Ukrainian-controlled territories, while the U.S. determines the distribution of the other 50%.

“We believe that for all of this to take place and function safely, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the city of Enerhodar, and the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant must be demilitarized, because at present there are Russian troops and war there, and there is no necessary level of security,” Zelensky said.

13. Ukraine and Russia will introduce school courses that promote understanding and tolerance of different cultures, fight racism and prejudice. Ukraine will approve EU rules on religious tolerance and minority language protection.

14. In Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, the line of military positions on the date of signing will be recognized as the de facto front line.

A) To determine troop movements needed to end the war and set up potential ""free economic zones,"" with Russia withdrawing its troops from these areas.

B) Russia must withdraw its troops from occupied parts of Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv oblasts for the agreement to take effect.

C) International forces will be placed along the front line to monitor the agreement's implementation.

D) The parties agree to follow the rules and obligations imposed by the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols, including universal human rights.

""So we are in a situation where the Russians want us to withdraw from Donetsk Oblast, while the Americans are trying to find a way for us not to withdraw because we are against withdrawal,"" Zelensky said.

""They are looking for a demilitarized zone or a free economic zone, meaning a format that could satisfy both sides. We consider a free economic zone a potential option for a sovereign state to choose such a path. We fought for a single word — 'potential.' We believe that such potential economic zones can exist,"" he added.

""We are saying: if all regions are included and if we remain where we are, then we will reach an agreement. That is why it says 'potential zones' here. But if we do not agree to 'remain where we are,' there are two options: either the war continues, or something will have to be decided regarding all potential economic zones.""

15. Russia and Ukraine commit to refraining from using force to alter territorial arrangements and will resolve any disputes through diplomatic means.

16. Russia will not obstruct Ukraine's use of the Dnipro River and the Black Sea for commercial purposes. A separate maritime agreement will ensure freedom of navigation and transport, with the Russian-occupied Kinburn Spit being demilitarized.

17. Establishment of a humanitarian committee that will ensure the following:

A) All-for-all prisoner exchange.

B) All detained civilians, including children and political prisoners, will be freed.

C) Actions will be taken to address the problems and alleviate the suffering of conflict victims.

18. Ukraine must hold presidential elections as soon as possible after the deal is signed.

19. The deal will be legally binding. Its implementation will be monitored by the Peace Council, chaired by U.S. President Donald Trump. Ukraine, Europe, NATO, Russia, and the U.S. will be part of this process. Violations will lead to sanctions.

20. The ceasefire will take effect immediately once all parties agree to the deal.

Volodymyr Zelensky speaks at the EU Summit in Brussels on Dec. 18.Geert Vanden Wijngaert/The Associated Press

The United States and Ukraine have reached a consensus on several critical issues aimed at bringing an end to the nearly four-year conflict, but sensitive issues around territorial control in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, along with the management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, remain unresolved, Ukraine's president said.

Volodymyr Zelensky briefed journalists on each point of the plan on Tuesday. His comments were embargoed until Wednesday morning. The draft proposal, which reflects Ukraine's wishes, intertwines political and commercial interests to safeguard security while boosting economic potential.

Asked about the plan, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow would set out its position based on information received by Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met with U.S. envoys in Florida over the weekend.

Peskov declined to share further details, saying that Moscow believed it was “highly inappropriate to conduct any kind of communication via the media.”

At the heart of the negotiations lies the contentious territorial dispute concerning the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, known as the Donbas. This is “the most difficult point,” Zelensky said. He said these matters will be discussed at the leaders level.

Russia continues to assert maximalist demands, insisting that Ukraine relinquish the remaining territory in Donbas that it has not captured – an ultimatum that Ukraine has rejected. Russia has captured most of Luhansk and about 70 per cent of Donetsk.

In a bid to facilitate compromise, the United States has proposed transforming these areas into free economic zones. Ukraine insists that any arrangement must be contingent upon a referendum, allowing the Ukrainian people to determine their own fate. Ukraine is demanding the demilitarization of the area and the presence of an international force to ensure stability, Zelensky said.

How the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest plant in Europe which is under Russian occupation, will be managed is another contentious issue. The U.S. is proposing a consortium with Ukraine and Russia, with each party having an equal stake in the enterprise.

But Zelensky countered with a joint venture proposal between the U.S. and Ukraine, in which the Americans are able to decide how to distribute their share, presuming it would go to Russia.

“We did not reach a consensus with the American side on the territory of the Donetsk region and on the ZNPP,” Zelensky said, referring to the power plant in Zaporizhzhia. “But we have significantly brought most of the positions closer together. In principle, all other consensus in this agreement has been found between us and them.”

They left India for jobs in Russia, then disappeared in the fog of war

Point 14, which covers territories that cut across the eastern front line, and Point 12, which discusses management of the Zaporizhzhia plant, will likely be major sticking points in the talks.

Zelensky said: “We are in a situation where the Russians want us to leave the Donetsk region, and the Americans are trying to find a way so that it is ‘not a way out' – because we are against leaving – they want to find a demilitarized zone or a free economic zone in this, that is, a format that can provide for the views of both sides.”

The draft states that the contact line, which cuts across five Ukrainian regions, be frozen once the agreement is signed.

Ukraine's stance is that any attempt to create a free economic zone must be ratified by a referendum, affirming that the Ukrainian people ultimately hold the decision-making power, Zelensky said. This process will require 60 days, he added, during which time hostilities should stop to allow the process to happen.

More difficult discussions would require hammering out how far troops would be required to move back, per Ukraine's proposal, and where international forces would be stationed. Zelensky said ultimately “people can choose: this ending suits us or not,” he said.

The draft also proposes that Russian forces withdraw from Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Kharkiv regions, and that international forces be located along the contact line to monitor the implementation of the agreement.

“Since there is no faith in the Russians, and they have repeatedly broken their promises, today's contact line is turning into a line of a de facto free economic zone, and international forces should be there to guarantee that no one will enter there under any guise – neither ‘little green men' nor Russian military disguised as civilians,” Zelensky said.

Ukraine is also proposing that the occupied city of Enerhodar, which is connected to the Zaporizhzhia power plant, be a demilitarized free economic zone, Zelensky said. This point required 15 hours of discussions with the U.S., he said.

For now, the U.S. proposes that the plant be jointly operated by Ukraine, the U.S. and Russia, with each side receiving dividends from the enterprise.

“The USA is offering 33 per cent for 33 per cent for 33 per cent, and the Americans are the main manager of this joint venture,” he said. “It is clear that for Ukraine this sounds very unsuccessful and not entirely realistic. How can you have joint commerce with the Russians after everything?”

Ukraine offered an alternative proposal, that the plant be operated by a joint venture with the U.S. in which the Americans can determine independently how to distribute their 50-per-cent share.

Zelensky said billions in investments are needed to make the plant run again, including restoring the adjacent dam.

“There were about 15 hours of conversations about the plant. These are all very complex things.”

Opinion: Ukraine has earned the right to shape its own future. Washington and Moscow are denying it that right

The document ensures that Ukraine will be provided with “strong” security guarantees that mirror NATO's Article 5, which would obligate Ukraine's partners to act in the event of renewed Russian aggression.

Zelensky said that a separate bilateral document with the U.S. will outline these guarantees. This agreement will detail the conditions under which security will be provided, particularly in the event of a renewed Russian assault, and will establish a mechanism to monitor the ceasefire.

This mechanism will utilize satellite technology and early warning systems to ensure effective oversight and rapid response capabilities.

“The mood of the United States of America is that this is an unprecedented step towards Ukraine on their part. They believe that they are giving strong security guarantees,” he said.

The draft contains other elements including keeping Ukraine's army at 800,000 during peace time, and by nailing down a specific date for ascension to the European Union.

The document proposes accelerating a free-trade agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. once the agreement is signed. The U.S. wants the same deal with Russia, said Zelensky.

Ukraine would like to receive short-term privileged access to the European market and a robust global development package, that will cover a wide-range of economic interests, including a development fund to invest in industries including technology, data centres and artificial intelligence, as well as gas.

Also included are funds for the reconstruction of territories destroyed in the war.

“Ukraine will have the opportunity to determine the priorities for distributing its share of funds in the territories under the control of Ukraine. And this is a very important point, on which we spent a lot of time,” Zelensky said.

The goal will be to attract US$800-billion through equity, grants, loans and private sector contributions.

The draft proposal also requires Ukraine to hold elections after the signing of the agreement. “This is the partners' vision,” Zelensky said.

Ukraine is also asking that all prisoners since 2014 be released at once, and that civilian detainees, political prisoners and children be returned to Ukraine.

Chris Young/The Canadian Press

I've spent this fall engaging readers about the problem governments created decades ago by failing to prepare for the costs associated with boomers getting older. Old Age Security and medical care are concentrated in later life, yet taxation has been largely age-blind.

The result is now unavoidable. As the share of seniors doubled from 10 to 20 per cent over the past half-century, the annual cost of OAS has risen rapidly. Its price tag in 2029 will be $60-billion higher than in 2014, more than the entire federal deficit projected for the decade's end. At the provincial level, population aging adds $66-billion annually to medical budgets, shifting nearly every province from surplus to deficit.

This means boomers' wallets are protected by government borrowing – comforting in the short term but risky over time. 

The politics of Old Age Security reform are shifting

Younger Canadians face the flip side. Since boomers' costs were never fully prepaid, most of the gains from economic growth now flow to priorities for older generations, leaving less for housing, child care, postsecondary education and climate action – even as younger generations contribute more income taxes to finance boomers' retirements.

Fixing this problem requires clarity about when policy should be less sensitive to age, and when it should be more so. Cash subsidies are best targeted based on need, not age. But universal access to essential services must be protected by paying closer attention to age – accounting for whether different generations will, or will not, fully pay for the services they use.

That's why I've argued OAS should be modernized by asking retirees with six-figure household incomes to accept smaller subsidies. Today, only 4 per cent of seniors have incomes too high to qualify, so $14-billion of OAS's $83-billion budget flows to retirees in households enjoying more than $100,000 in annual income.

Under my proposal, that share would fall to about $7-billion. The savings would eliminate seniors' poverty with an extra $5,000 for every poor retiree, while still freeing billions to ease affordability pressures facing younger generations. 

Reducing cash subsidies for financially secure boomers can help correct governments' past failure to raise enough revenue to fund their generations' retirement benefits and medical care. But asking people to accept less cancer care or reduced access to specialists would be neither just nor cost-effective.

Some might think the solution is to make wealthier boomers pay more at the bedside. But decades of research show that public medical systems function best when everyone enters through the same door at the point of care, with more affluent citizens contributing more through progressive taxation. 

A boost to OAS would help too little where it's needed, and too much where it's not

Charging wealthier patients fees at the bedside pushes them toward private alternatives. Profit-motivated providers then skim easier, lower-cost patients, leaving the most complex and expensive care to the taxpayer-funded system – while also shrinking its tax base.

Protecting universal access will therefore require a revenue discussion. Since younger generations already pay 20 to 40 per cent more income taxes toward older people's well-being than boomers did at the same age, financially secure retirees may need to make up for lost time through annual medical-care premiums collected through the tax system – much in the same way boomers were asked to absorb 68-per-cent CPP premium increases starting in the late 1990s.

Some may try to deflect by focusing only on the ultra-wealthy. While they do control a frightening share of global resources, Canada's fiscal math makes clear that a resilient revenue base cannot start and end with the top 1 per cent.

Consider the NDP's proposed wealth tax in the 2025 election campaign, estimated to raise $23-billion a year from fortunes above $10-million. That sounds substantial – until you recall that Ottawa's deficit now exceeds $70-billion and population aging adds $66-billion to provincial medical spending.

This makes the work ahead politically difficult. Year's end invites reflection on the values that should guide us forward.

Cash subsidies ought to be targeted by need. Essential services such as health care, education and child care should be universal at the point of entry – funded through progressive taxation that reflects how costs fall across generations. That is how we protect boomers' healthy retirements and keep faith with the generations that follow.

Heavy rainfall near the southern French city of Montpellier has unleashed widespread flooding, which local officials say could be the worst they have seen in 30 years.

Torrential rains set off ""exceptional flooding"" near the French city of Montpellier, local authorities said on Wednesday.

The floodwaters appear to be receding, but weather alerts are to remain in place until December 24.

No casualties have been reported so far.

Almost 1,000 homes were left without electricity on Monday evening in the department of Hérault on the south coast, including 520 in Montpellier where parks, gardens, cemeteries, the local zoo and the Christmas market remain closed.

Public transport routes were partly closed off, too, and the prefect of Hérault, Chantal Mauchet, said getting around the region remained difficult.

The highest water levels in the region were recorded just to the south of Montpellier in the coastal town of Agde, where the River Hérault reached more than 11 feet, leading to what forecasters said was likely the worst flooding the region had experienced since November 1994.

Local residents posted footage of flooded promenades along the banks of the river – but no major damage or human casualties were reported.

The French flood warning service Vigicrues reported ""exceptional flooding"" and issued a red flood warning for the Hérault department – plus orange warnings for the surrounding departments of Aveyron, Lozère and Tarn.

Deaths were reported following two explosions and fire at a nursing home outside Philadelphia, with several people still unaccounted for, officials have said.

At least two people were killed and several were missing after a pair of explosions rocked a nursing home in Bristol Township, outside the US city of Philadelphia.

The explosions on Tuesday sparked a fire and caused part of the nursing home's building to collapse, officials and police said.

The blasts at the Bristol Health and Rehab Center in Bristol Township, about 21 miles (33 kilometers) northeast of Philadelphia, are believed to have been caused by a gas leak.

Five people were believed to be missing hours after the explosions and fire tore through the facility, Bristol Fire Marshal Kevin Dippolito told a press conference on Tuesday evening. However, some may have left the scene with family members, he added.

In addition to the two confirmed deaths, Dippolito said an unspecified number of people had sustained injuries.

Dippolito said firefighters found a ""major structural collapse""  after receiving the first reports of an explosion on Tuesday afternoon and rushing to the scene.

News footage from local TV showed large flames and smoke billowing from the destroyed building shortly after the first blast.

The local gas company PECO said its personnel were at the facility responding to complaints of a gas leak when the first explosion occurred.

""PECO crews shut off natural gas and electric service to the facility to ensure the safety of first responders and local residents. It is not known at this time if PECO's equipment, or natural gas, was involved in this incident,"" the company said in a statement.

The fire marshal added that numerous nursing home patients and staff who were initially trapped in the collapsed part of the building had been rescued by first responders.

Several victims were removed from the debris. Firefighters were able to pull at least two more people from the collapsed basement before retreating due to lingering gas fumes, Dippolito said.

""We got everyone out that we could, ​that we ​could find, that we could see, and we exited the building,"" the fire marshal explained.

""Within approximately 15 to 30 seconds of us exiting the building, knowing there was a heavy odor of natural gas around us, there was another explosion and fire,"" he added.

It was not immediately clear exactly how many patients and staff were at the nursing home, which is certified for up to 174 beds, at the time of the explosions.

A nurse working at the facility told local TV news that more than 50 patients aged between 50 to 95 were normally in the building at any given time.

""We are still in rescue mode until we know the building is clear,"" Dippolito said.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said the facility had been acquired by new owners this month. He also said state health inspectors had visited the facility on December 10 and met with staff to devise a plan to update the standards at the nursing home.

Shapiro praised the emergency response, saying in a post on X, ""Tonight, we saw real heroism in Bucks County.""

Shapiro praised the firefighters ""who rushed towards danger to put out this fire and rescue people from the burning building,"" as well as the police officers who ""literally carried them on their backs to safety.""

The governor also highlighted the solidarity shown by nearby residents who had ""rushed out of their houses, away from their families"" to help the victims.

			On the frontline, improvisation is the only way to survive, says former member of special forces

When Mark Hayward realised there was no cavalry coming to save Ukraine after the Russian invasion, he decided to go himself.

Mr Hayward, a former member of the US special forces, initially believed America would uphold its security promises to Ukraine made decades earlier in the Budapest Memorandum. Then the truth sunk in. “Nobody's sending the A Team,” he realised.

The ex-Green Beret is one of what are believed to be thousands of American soldiers who, alongside those from Britain, Australia and other countries, signed up to defend Ukraine.

Many of them had long passed their physical prime, and some of the tools they were given to fight that war, including those supplied by the US, were barely fit for purpose in those early days.

Fighting in Ukraine meant going up against an enemy vastly bigger and better equipped than themselves, relying on their ability to improvise and never knowing if their makeshift weapons would quite literally blow up in their faces.

But many of that group, like Mr Hayward, had lived and served through the Cold War. In many ways, Ukraine's battle against Russia was the one they trained to fight but never had the chance.

Mr Hayward enlisted in the special forces in 1994 with the Colorado National Guard, later transferred to the regular army, and served in a series of campaigns including Kuwait and Iraq.

Years after leaving active duty, his status as a member of the elite special forces still carried some amount of mystique.

This was the same case in Ukraine, where he travelled with the expectation of becoming a combat medic.

“Everybody assumes that if you used to be a Green Beret, this means you're Rambo and know everything about weapons and tactics and whatnot,” Mr Hayward told The Telegraph.

“They completely overlook the fact that you're fat and old and haven't been in the game for 20 years.”

Mr Hayward moved to Nome on Alaska's Seward Peninsula after leaving the army, and it was while working for a health non-profit on St Lawrence Island, a remote stretch of land on the Bering Sea, that Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

There is high ground on the western side of the island where you can see mainland Russia, which for years has used its warships and fighter jets to menace Alaska. That made the invasion “a little more personal”, he said.

Many of the assumptions of the war in those early days turned out to be wrong.

Russia's campaign was meant to be a lightning offensive, sending columns of tanks across the Ukrainian border to seize Kyiv and take over its government in about three days. Fighting has now been raging for more than three years.

Mr Hayward also thought Ukraine's leadership would fall, and that the war would turn into an asymmetric, guerilla campaign.

He hoped the US would live up to its obligations in the Budapest Memorandum, signed by Bill Clinton in 1994, and send special forces to support the beleaguered Ukrainians. That view, he says now, was “stupid”.

He flew back to Nome from St Lawrence Island soon after and told his wife: “Babe, this is the war that I trained to fight.” She shrugged and said she'd been thinking the same thing, he said.

It was a war that appeared to be made for the soldiers who trained and learned to improvise in the shadow of the Cold War.

“When I went into special forces, the training model was still very much the sort of unconventional warfare model where you wind up in somebody else's backyard and you're cut off from resources,” Mr Hayward said.

“You're working with a local population trying to resist an army of occupation.”

The Ukrainian military does not release figures on the number of American volunteers who have come across since war broke out, but estimates range from 1,000 to several times that number.

Within those ranks, there is a range of motivations. Many, but not all, make the journey because of their outrage at Russia's unprovoked invasion of its neighbour, its brutal tactics and war crimes that have come to light in Bucha and elsewhere.

“Some people come to Ukraine with a motive to fight for freedom, for what is right,” Senior Lt Mykola Lavrenyuk, the Ukrainian commander of a platoon, told The New York Times in September.

“Others want to make money or are running from the law.”

Mr Hayward falls firmly into the former camp. He was “angry” at Vladimir Putin and believes the Russian leader poses an existential threat to Europe, the US and the rest of the world.

“The fact that governments aren't doing their job, that doesn't give us an out. We are still on the hook for the world we give to our kids,” he said.

That was how he found himself, one interview with a military attaché later, crossing the border into Ukraine from Poland on March 12 in a restored ambulance.

In the back of the vehicle were four 27-gallon containers known in Alaska as “totes”, body armour, a helmet, night vision goggles, and a drone, although this was before they would become the defining weapon of the war.

Before that, Mr Hayward had spent a few days preparing in Kraków. On the margins of the city he discovered a makeshift statue of a dragon hammered together out of scrap metal.

Mr Hayward felt a sense of kinship with the strange creature, seemingly an imitation of Kraków's 20-feet tall, fire-breathing Wawel Dragon Statue.

“He's kind of pot-bellied, and he's got this derpy expression on his face… I thought, ‘f--- , you're me,'” he recalled.

“There are people who are professionally trained to do this s---. There are dragons that make you look like what you are: a middle-aged, overweight dragon. And there are war fighters who make me look like what I am, a middle-aged, overweight, former action guy.”

As he headed over the border at the Korczowa crossing, women and children streamed in the other direction, many of them carrying a single suitcase each.

An estimated seven million have fled Ukraine since the war broke out, many heading first to Poland before heading further afield: to the US, Britain and elsewhere.

The plan was to meet up with a contact in Ukraine's International Legion at a petrol station, which went “like s---”. It later turned out Russia had launched cruise missiles at one of the legion's bases: that person was either dead or busy trying to survive.

Alone in a foreign country on a Sunday, he did the only thing he could think of: he went to church, specifically a Mormon one in Lviv, where he linked up with Americans who had joined another legion.

After a period ferrying the group, who had been engaged by American Baptist churches to evacuate congregants from the war zone, around in the ambulance, he headed east to Kyiv with a friend who went under the call sign “Texas”.

For around 48 hours in Ukraine's capital city, the pair trained soldiers to use shoulder-mounted NLAW missiles, which would be used to devastating effect to decapitate columns of Russian tanks.

Neither of them knew the first thing about the British weapons, which only entered service in 2009, and had to spend a night poring over an instruction manual before a training session the next morning. Thankfully they were “dead simple” to use.

He also learnt another lesson: improvisation was not just a way of life in Ukraine but the only way to survive.

Supplied with the passwords that would allow him to bypass military checkpoints, Mr Hayward headed south to Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine which Russia had failed to capture despite intense shelling.

There, he became a trainer and instructor.

From the start, Mr Hayward said, Ukrainian efforts were undermined by the US' fatalism about its prospects for holding out against the Russian invasion.

Javelin missiles had been sent over by Donald Trump's first administration in 2018, but they “were so convinced that Ukraine was going to fall next week that they stripped out everything that might be useful”, he said.

“We're going to take out the tactical manuals. We're going to take out the spare battery. We're going to take out all that useful s---,” he recalled.

“What these b------s were sending us was stripped, not equipped.”

They were effectively “dead in the water”. Then Mr Hayward had a brainwave: in the place of the 24-volt batteries in the launch unit, they could wire together two 12-volt motorcycle batteries instead.

“That was an act of desperation,” he said. “People were telling us that it not only wouldn't work, but that it would destroy the launcher”, a piece of kit worth more than $200,000 (£148,000).

“But otherwise it was effectively an expensive paperweight. Its only military use would be to try and bludgeon someone with it.

“I think this battery will work and it probably won't blow up your launcher. Mind if I try it?” Mr Hayward said he told the Ukrainians. “And the damn thing powered up.”

Anything with a potential military use was quickly tinkered with and converted.

From an old metal shop, the Mykolaiv team built an operating table out of aircraft aluminium that was light enough for a medic to carry, durable enough to support a soldier wearing their gear, and compact enough to fit in an SUV.

Before that, one surgeon had been forced to operate on patients on their kitchen tables because the Nato-supplied folding hospital beds would collapse under strain.

And Mr Hayward said oscillating saws, the kind he might use to cut through dry wall back home in Alaska, were being used by medics for speedy battlefield amputations.

“Their problem-solving skills, their improvisational skills, are second to none,” he said of the Ukrainians.

“I can't understand why my country isn't looking at Ukraine and saying, ‘We want every one of these men and women on our side, because these guys and gals are force multipliers like you read about.'

“They're like, “it's not a problem. I've got a screwdriver and a soldering iron.'”

Not everything has a solution that's elegant or cheap, however. Mr Hayward said most of his money had gone on vehicle repairs and petrol, having drained his savings and run up a $50,000 (£37,000) debt on a credit card.

“What do we save money for? We save money to live well in our old age, and to give our children and our children's children an inheritance,” he said.

“I'm old already. And the best inheritance that I can give to my children, and my children's children, is a world where this kind of s--- doesn't go unanswered.”

After courting coal miners during his campaign, Trump has left a trail of broken promises.

James Bounds has been working in the mines since 1969. Now 78, and living in Fayette County, West Virginia, he was first diagnosed with black lung in 1984. He was told to quit working at the mines, but he didn't. He continued working until 2003, when he was permanently disabled with black lung.

“I had so many obligations at that time that I couldn't quit the mines,” he said. “I wanted to continue to work … and mining pay, y'know, so I can keep things going here at the house.” It wasn't until 2009, years after he was forced into retirement, that Bounds started receiving black lung benefits.

Today, Bounds has difficulty walking around his yard or carrying groceries 25 feet from his driveway to his house. “There's nothing you can do. Every time you go out in the yard, even walk around the yard, you got to have an oxygen tank with you,” he said.

For many miners in Appalachia, this year was supposed to be one of progress in which they would finally see a commitment to solving the issue of black lung. Last year, on April 18, 2024, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) issued its final rule, Lowering Miners' Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica and Improving Respiratory Protection, which aimed to reduce miners' exposure to an airborne compound that is a major cause of black lung, and improve respiratory protection for all airborne hazards. The law, which establishes a uniform permissible exposure limit and requirements for monitoring, had a compliance/enforcement date of April 14, 2025. The date came and went, and miners are still waiting for the rule to come into effect.

According to Bounds, miners have tried for years to have a silica rule implemented, but to no avail. “Every time they delay it, you can count the lives that you lost in between delays and that really burdens me down. It really makes me sad that people have to give their life before they are able to pass anything,” he said. “Meanwhile, the miners are getting sick, they're dying. They can't make a living for their family.”

“Every time you go out in the yard, even walk around the yard, you got to have an oxygen tank with you.”

The Trump administration, early on, promised to reinvigorate America's “beautiful clean coal industry,” direct relevant agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, lift barriers to coal mining, and prioritize coal leasing on those lands. Some miners hoped that this would lead to an increase in work available to them. In an April 8 executive order, President Donald Trump also required agencies to rescind any policies “that seek to transition the Nation away from coal production or otherwise establish preferences against coal as a generation resource.”

Trump frequently campaigned with coal miners during his 2016 presidential run, and has since continued to participate in photo-ops using miners as a symbolic backdrop for his energy policies while campaigning and serving in office.

However, despite the president courting the CEOs of the mining industry heavily during his campaign, miners themselves feel neglected and left behind. Days after the executive order, on April 11, just before coal mines were expected to be compliant with the final rule, the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay of the final rule in response to a petition from the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association, which is challenging the rule in court. Soon after, it announced a temporary enforcement pause until August 18, citing “unforeseen NIOSH restructuring” and “other technical reasons.” Further updates were supposed to be announced in October, but they never came. Now, the updated response delays enforcement indefinitely.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, was slated to lose at least 900 workers, which represents more than 90 percent of the entire agency workforce, as part of a “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) plan. After facing considerable pushback from labor (specifically coal miner organizations) and congressional lawmakers (including Republicans from West Virginia), and a federal lawsuit brought by a coal miner, the Trump administration changed plans regarding the planned layoffs at the federal health agency. Similarly, the administration also dropped plans to terminate leases and close 34 offices in the MSHA, after considerable pushback from mining communities.

“First it was stalled because the Department of Labor voluntarily delayed it because of the cuts at NIOSH. NIOSH is important to implement the rule well, and because the administration sillily or stupidly cut NIOSH staff, they also couldn't enforce the rule,” said Quenton King, government affairs specialist at Appalachian Voices. “Now that NIOSH is back, or now that NIOSH is kind of back, this lawsuit is still happening, and the judge in the case has issued a stay on it. Our complaint is that the administration doesn't seem to be fighting that stay or fighting the lawsuit,” he said, referring to the case brought by the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association against the final rule.

“The stuff we need to get passed, the stuff that we need to protect ourselves … seems like they always put it on the back burner.”

The rule was first drafted and released in 2023. Coal miners had been working with a sense of urgency to get the rule passed in 2023 and 2024, due to fears that the Trump administration could repeal the rule if the Biden administration waited too long to enact it. “I'm happy to work with the Black Lung Association, which is former coal miners, Trump voters. And they're saying that we, you know, ‘We supported you, and now we're asking you to stand up for us,'” King added. “It feels like a betrayal of what he promised people. But I think that's been very common throughout his administration.”

On November 26, the Department of Labor (DOL) and the mining industry filed a status update in the lawsuit over the silica dust rule, stating that “in order to avoid an unnecessary expenditure of resources by the parties and the Court, the government moves to have this appeal held in abeyance,” effectively suspending activities in the case while the DOL undertakes a new “limited” rulemaking to reconsider portions of the rule.

“Capito, Miller, and Moore, they ain't doing nothing. Whatever Trump wants, they just back,” said Gary Hairston, 71, a retired coal miner from West Virginia who is the president of the National Black Lung Association, referring to West Virginia's congress members Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, Rep. Carol Miller, and Rep. Riley Moore. “They're worried about the coal mine itself,” he said. “They don't care about us, but when they run for reelection, they get coal miners standing beside them. But yet, when it comes to protecting us, they ain't protecting us.”

On another front, coal miners suffering from black lung also continue to fight for better benefits and a streamlined process to access the benefits. Inflation increased 8 percent in 2022, but in January 2023, the black lung monthly benefit only increased 4 percent, according to Appalachian Voices. For recipients who are completely disabled, this leaves them having to make up for the deficits elsewhere. The benefit for a miner and a dependent in 2025 is $1,178 a month — more than $3,000 lower than the average cost of living for people in coal communities like Indiana County, Pennsylvania; Pike County, Kentucky; and Kanawha County, West Virginia, Appalachian Voices reported.

For the last several years, the Black Lung Benefits Improvement Act has been introduced in Congress but has not progressed, explained King. “It's going to be introduced hopefully soon this year,” he said. “It would raise the stipend to be in line with inflation every year. Currently it is not. It doesn't rise with inflation. So the value is worth less than it used to be. And because, it used to be, you're older, you get the benefit. Like, that's helpful, but you already retired. But now, since people are getting black lung in their 40's, that's 25 years of not working. So the benefit is more important now than it used to be,” King said.

Despite Trump's plans for achieving American energy dominance and reinvigorating America's “Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,” miners can't help but notice that his executive order leaves out an essential part of the industry — the miners themselves.

“Well, I think they forgot about the coal miners. They always say that we keep the lights on, but they don't never show it to the coal miners. They show it to the coal companies, but they don't never back the coal miners,” Hairston said. “The stuff we need to get passed, the stuff that we need to protect ourselves… seems like they always put it on the back burner. Seems like we just a number to them. We just die. And they just put somebody else in our place.”

Eight months after the acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said at a border security conference that the Trump administration aims to carry out its mass deportation operation with the same efficiency as Amazon's package deliveries, a draft document from ICE officials on Wednesday provided never-before-seen details of how the agency plans to do that using massive warehouses repurposed to hold tens of thousands of people.

The Washington Post reported on a draft solicitation document, a version of which ICE plans to send to private detention companies this week.

The proposal calls for contractors to help renovate industrial warehouses across the country, setting each up to hold up to 10,000 people detained by immigration agents at a time — albeit in facilities that will likely have poor ventilation, climate control, plumbing, and sanitation systems.

Warehouses, said physician and journalist Dr. Carolyn Barber, “are built for boxes, not humans.”

🧊 WAREHOUSING HUMANS 😲ICE plans to herd their captives ""into one of seven large-scale warehouses holding 5,000 to 10,000 people each, where they would be staged for deportation."" www.washingtonpost.com/business/202…

ICE aims to modify the warehouses and create separate housing units with showers and bathrooms, dining areas, medical units, recreation areas, and law libraries, according to the document.

The agency's new facilities will “maximize efficiency, minimize costs, shorten processing times, limit lengths of stay, accelerate the removal process, and promote the safety, dignity, and respect for all in ICE custody,” the solicitation said.

But considering acting ICE Director Todd Lyons' comment last April that the administration should treat deportations “like a business … Like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings,” rights advocates said the plan to house people in massive storage facilities was “beyond dehumanizing.”

“It is as if they don't see immigrants as people but just things to be warehoused like Amazon packages,” said Philip Mai, co-director at the Social Media Lab at Toronto Metropolitan University.

ICE and other federal agencies have been transporting detainees around the country this year to whichever detention facilities have space, but under the new plan, seven large warehouses in Louisiana, Virginia, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, and Missouri would be used as deportation “staging” facilities for 5,000-10,000 people each.

Sixteen smaller warehouses would each hold up to 1,500 people, allowing the government to detain 80,000 people in immigration facilities at a time — up from about 68,000 who were in detention in early December.

ICE data shows that about 48% of the people currently being detained have no criminal convictions or current charges, the Post reported.

Jonathan Cohn, political director for the advocacy group Progressive Mass, suggested that ICE's claims that it will build facilities that prioritize detainees' “dignity” ring hollow, considering the plan's details.

“They want to build a network of concentration camps,” he said simply.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

 Why Stronger States Are More Fearful Than Weaker Ones

 Caleb Pomeroy

A basic premise unites most foreign policy thinking: power begets security. Because no global police force can respond in times of trouble, states must accumulate power to ensure their safety. They must build strong militaries to protect their homelands and defend vital international interests. They need to nurture robust economies to fund those militaries and withstand financial pressure. These notions have motivated strategy for centuries, including the policies of the world's two most powerful countries today. U.S. President Donald Trump is pursuing a military buildup and economic self-sufficiency to deter adversaries, a policy his advisers call “peace through strength.” Chinese leader Xi Jinping, meanwhile, is plowing money into the People's Liberation Army and the manufacturing sector to make his country “self-reliant and strong.”

It is true that power can bolster security in purely material terms. But security is a psychological phenomenon, too. Leaders and citizens alike want large militaries in order to feel safe, not simply for their own sakes. Yet almost no psychological research supports the idea that feelings of safety align with objective statistics about material power. In fact, the evidence shows the contrary: power makes people more skeptical of others' intentions and thus heightens anxiety. The strong, it turns out, are far more likely than the weak to skip careful, reasoned analysis when making decisions. Instead, they assess threats from the gut and shoot from the hip. While the weak know they must think critically to navigate their surroundings, the strong imagine they can rely on stereotypes and other mental shortcuts to get by. As a result, the powerful view the world in bleak and oversimplified terms, breeding suspicion and anxiety.

To see whether this psychological finding applies to international relations, I examined how both foreign policy elites and ordinary people think about state power and threat perception. I looked specifically at the thinking of American decision-makers during the Cold War, Russian policymakers before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and contemporary Chinese and American publics. My findings were unambiguous. Stronger countries, like more powerful people, tend to be more insecure than weaker ones. Their leaders and citizens imagine or exaggerate threats. They think impulsively. And they are easy to trigger. As a result, they are more likely to support starting and escalating wars than individuals who feel their state is feeble.

This finding has unfortunate implications. Today, the world is characterized by renewed great-power competition, particularly between the United States and China. Each side is trying to acquire more power than the other, in large part to feel safer. But this strategy is likely to have the opposite of its intended effect. Should Washington grow stronger, it will become more convinced that Beijing is a menace. If Beijing becomes more powerful, it will view Washington's actions in its neighborhood as more threatening. The result could be a vicious cycle: as each country becomes more capable, it will feel more insecure, prompting further military buildups that drive each side's anxiety higher still.

To avoid this outcome, officials in both the United States and China—and, indeed, in any strong country—should try to neutralize the psychological effects of power. That means they should pause before making decisions. They should carefully evaluate all available evidence regarding a potential threat rather than jumping to conclusions. In other words, they should reason as if they run weak governments, not strong ones.

One of the oldest and most dominant ideas in international relations is that power leads to security and weakness to insecurity. This premise anchored Thucydides's analysis of the Peloponnesian War: “The growth of the power of Athens, and the alarm it inspired in Sparta, made war inevitable.” But students of individual psychology have long understood that power may not generate rational views and behaviors. Or as Shakespeare's Henry IV observes, “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.”

Psychologists directly studied the effects of strength in the aftermath of World War II in an effort to understand how supposedly normal individuals could commit acts of great cruelty when they felt powerful. In the infamous 1971 Stanford prison experiment, for example, psychologists assigned study participants to serve either as a hypothetical guard or as a hypothetical prisoner and found that the guards quickly turned abusive. A decade earlier, Stanley Milgram conducted notorious obedience experiments in which participants were instructed to administer electric shocks to another participant. (In reality, that other participant was an actor, simply pretending to get shocked.) Milgram's subjects continued to administer the supposed shocks when told to do so, even in doses that would have been lethal. These controversial studies provided initial indications that power can have corrupting effects on individual behavior—effects so corrupting that they inspired new protocols for research ethics in academia.

In the decades that followed, researchers such as Susan Fiske and Dacher Keltner started testing these intuitions in a rigorous and scientific fashion. Psychologists provided subjects with greater or fewer resources in a laboratory setting and measured their views, observed their interactions in groups, and watched their behaviors. They surveyed and analyzed the views and actions of bosses and subordinates in corporate settings, as well. The findings were striking: a sense of power appeared to activate impulsive and intuitive thinking writ large. People who felt powerful accepted more risk and exhibited more overconfidence, leading to greater financial losses in laboratory games. They were quicker to dehumanize others, engage in hypocrisy, and rely on racial biases when interacting with members of marginalized groups. They were less empathetic and saw others as threatening. In one study, for instance, subjects played a cooperation game involving the division of a communal pot of money. Subjects who were randomly assigned to a powerful ""manager"" position were more likely to view their teammates as untrustworthy and thus more likely to feel that teammates should be punished to deter selfish behavior. The study, the experimenters wrote, suggested that power activates “Hobbesian” thinking marked by a tendency “to distrust others and therefore rely more on deterrence as a punishment motive.”



Fiske, Keltner, and their colleagues, of course, were mostly studying how power affects individual thinking in controlled environments—a far cry from the high-stakes world of foreign policy decision-making. In theory, even the research they did in corporate settings shouldn't neatly apply. States, after all, generally have many institutions and bureaucracies designed to foster deliberation among competing voices. Yet my research found that the psychological literature was in fact highly relevant. Policymakers in powerful states felt more insecure and acted with more aggression than those in weaker ones. One might hope that these effects would be tempered in democracies, where public opinion could constrain a leader's worst impulses. But in my surveys of American (and Chinese and Russian) citizens, I found that ordinary people who feel their country is stronger also have higher threat assessments and are more supportive of hawkish policies than those who feel their country is weaker. Democracies are therefore just as vulnerable to this kind of thinking.

In fact, the United States might provide the clearest case study of how an increase in a country's power drives an uptick in fear. At its founding in the 1780s, the country was materially very weak. Its economy was crippled by war debt. It was surrounded by dozens of capable, sovereign Indian nations. The southeastern Choctaws alone possessed a military force ten times as large as the United States' standing army. Even the U.S. founders were unsure whether their fledgling nation could survive. But rather than panic, they assessed the strategic environment carefully and adopted diplomacy as the primary tool of statecraft. President George Washington regularly hosted and honored Indian delegations, just as he did European dignitaries, and paid these nations for land cessions. Dreams of enjoying “full security,” warned Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, were “too visionary to be a rule for national conduct.”

Yet as the United States ascended to hegemony in the Western Hemisphere over the course of the nineteenth century, its calculus shifted. Decision-makers concluded that Indian nations were not potential partners but intolerable threats. They relied more heavily on racialized stereotypes that portrayed Indians as warlike and irrational. The government therefore decided it had no choice but to attack them. In 1890, a religious movement known as the “Ghost Dance” sought to reunite participants with their ancestor's spirits to resist the United States' westward expansion and cultural assimilation. The Lakota people's practice of this dance so concerned U.S. elites that President Benjamin Harrison dispatched the largest mobilization of military force since the American Civil War to Pine Ridge Reservation. The result was the Wounded Knee Massacre. Rather than feeling safer with strength, the United States literally began chasing ghosts.

Some of this aggression was driven by opportunity, not fear. With growing power, Washington could simply acquire more land than when it was weaker. But decision-makers made clear that the expansion was also driven by the perceived threat of Indian nations. “I don't go so far as to think that the only good Indians are the dead Indians,” the future president Theodore Roosevelt infamously remarked in 1886, “but I believe nine out of every ten are, and I shouldn't like to inquire too closely into the case of the tenth.” To quote the historian Ned Blackhawk, U.S. officials felt that their “emergent racial order” was “under constant threat” from Indians in the West.

The end of World War II brought about another massive increase in American power. Before the war, other governments could at least claim to be Washington's equals. But afterward, the United States had no true peer. France, Germany, and Japan had been torn apart. The United Kingdom avoided invasion, but it had suffered heavy casualties and German bombings had damaged its cities and industrial centers. The Soviet Union was closer in stature, but it, too, was exhausted: it suffered around 27 million military and civilian deaths, compared with fewer than 500,000 for the United States, and a number of its major cities were left devastated by German advances. Its economy and military paled in comparison with the United States's industrial might, blue-water navy, and network of overseas bases.

The United States, however, did not act as if it were the most secure country in the world. Instead, leaders in Washington fretted more than they had before the war. From almost the moment Japan surrendered, U.S. officials began worrying about communist governments. In 1950, the Departments of State and Defense drafted NSC-68, a memorandum that called for a massive increase in peacetime defense spending and the development of the hydrogen bomb. “In the ascendancy of their strength,” the document declared, the United States and its citizens “stand in their deepest peril.”

President Harry Truman quickly made the memo the lodestar of American Cold War strategy. Less than three months after its release, Truman had U.S. troops flood the Korean Peninsula in response to North Korea's invasion of its southern neighbor. Doing so was hardly a security imperative for Washington; the fight was a civil war. But primed for suspicion, American officials interpreted the North's invasion as an attempt by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to start a chain reaction that would transform government after government into communist regimes (or what policymakers would later call “domino theory”), culminating in a world war aimed at the United States. “If South Korea was allowed to fall,” reflected Truman, “communist leaders would be emboldened to override nations closer to our own shores. . . . If this was allowed to go unchallenged it would mean a third world war.” The far weaker British, by contrast, saw things more clearly. In Washington, “there are too many Puritan avenging angels” who want “to get on with punishing the guilty,” the British ambassador to the United States wrote in 1950. The American invasion, in other words, was an act of U.S. aggression—not one of self-defense. The Canadians, who were even weaker, went further in questioning Washington's response. The most urgent threat to international security, they assessed, was not Stalin, but rather an American overreaction in Korea.



When the Soviet Union collapsed, bringing an end to the Cold War, the United States' power became even more unrivaled. It was no longer merely the world's most powerful country. It was the first uncontested global superpower in human history. But even this lofty status failed to ease U.S. fears. “We have slain a large dragon, but we live now in a jungle filled with a bewildering variety of poisonous snakes. And in many ways, the dragon was easier to keep track of,” James Woolsey, the soon-to-be director of the CIA, declared in his 1993 Senate confirmation hearing. Other foreign policy officials issued similar assessments. And as with Korea (and later, Vietnam), they acted on them. A full quarter of all of the United States' military interventions have taken place in the post–Cold War era.

As in the nineteenth century, these adventures resulted in part from Washington's substantial capabilities. A country that can deploy special operations forces around the world in 30 minutes and launch a full-scale ground invasion that topples regimes within days is more willing to start wars than one that can't. The powerful do as they wish.

But these actions are also the unmistakable product of rising anxiety—specifically, the fear of what might result from inaction. Consider the invasion of Iraq. The country's leader, Saddam Hussein, posed no threat to the United States. Washington's intelligence reports suggested that he lacked weapons of mass destruction. But that did not assuage the concerns of the George W. Bush administration. In 2002, Condoleezza Rice, then Bush's national security adviser, warned that the costs of awaiting evidence of an Iraqi nuclear capability far outweighed the costs of acting now. “We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud,” she explained. U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld put a finer point on it: “no terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people and the stability of the world than the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.” Bush's thinking was even less reasoned. “I don't spend a lot of time taking polls around the world to tell me what I think is the right way to act,” the president said in the lead-up to the attack. “I've just got to know how I feel.” He was worried about Hussein, and that was enough. The result was innumerable civilian deaths, the radicalization of populations, the production of future terrorists, and a price tag of over $2 trillion.

The United States is hardly the only country whose power has made it feel less secure. Moscow, too, has a lengthy history of power-induced fear. In the 1970s, the Soviet Union enjoyed an advantageous shift in nuclear and conventional capabilities relative to the United States, which was demobilizing after the Vietnam War. In response, it began to worry more about American influence in Afghanistan and thus embarked on an incredibly costly invasion of the country. Today, Moscow is no longer a superpower, but it remains both strong and insecure. In fact, a 2020 survey of high-ranking Russian elites and government officials—including people in the armed forces and security agencies—found that officials who felt that Russian power was on the rise were the ones most likely to view Ukraine, the United States, and NATO as threats. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not among those surveyed, but he seems to hold similar views. His decision to invade Ukraine was no doubt motivated in part by irredentism. Yet in speeches and treatises justifying the war, he has repeatedly expressed fear that Washington will use Kyiv to threaten Russian security.

And then there is China. Over the last 50 years, it has pulled off nothing short of an economic miracle. Western exploitation in the nineteenth century, Japanese aggression in the early twentieth century, and various reforms under Mao Zedong in the 1950s and 1960s all left the country materially weak and with good reason to feel threatened. Now, it is the world's second-richest country and in possession of a massive and strong military. Yet China's surge to superpower status over the past half century does not seem to have solved Beijing's fundamental security concerns. The country's leader, Xi Jinping, has purged high-ranking officials from the party apparatus, ordered mass arrests of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region out of fear of domestic terrorism, and even restricted elements of Western culture in the Chinese media to quell perceived U.S. influence.

The world, then, might seem as if it is headed in a very dangerous direction. It will, after all, be hard for the leaders of these various strong countries to become less fearful. But they can make better choices by actively trying to think like the weak—which is to say, deliberately, empathetically, and realistically. It is something that a strong United States, at least, has some experience with. Faced with what he saw as rising Soviet expansionism and an incoherent, costly, and increasingly militarized U.S. foreign policy, President Dwight Eisenhower initiated a top-secret review of grand strategy design in 1953. In this exercise, teams of high-ranking officials studied three foreign policy strategies that varied in levels of aggressiveness. After reviewing their analysis, Eisenhower decided that a milder approach would work well and opted for a more cost-effective strategy of containment rather than a more expensive one of actively and aggressively rolling back Moscow's influence.

Eisenhower's exercise did not require a pricey restructuring of bureaucracies and institutions. It simply entailed careful, deliberative thinking. To avoid dangerous entanglements, strong states should do more of this. Such an exercise, for example, might steer Washington away from its current military buildup in the waters around Venezuela. According to Trump, striking boats, seizing oil tankers, and threatening to attack Caracas are all necessary to stop the flow of illegal fentanyl into the United States. But this is based on faulty reasoning. Fentanyl is perhaps the primary cause of American overdose deaths, yet there is no evidence that Venezuela produces fentanyl at any significant level. These operations thus do not bolster U.S. security. Instead, they risk starting a major new conflict that would consume massive amounts of American resources, easily pushing spending beyond what the recently passed, nearly $1 trillion defense budget provides for. And that enormous budget is itself unlikely to bring Washington a sense of peace. To people across party lines, the dollars devoted to the Pentagon are meant to shore up U.S. security. But the psychological math is perverse.

None of this means that governments shouldn't make investments in their armed forces. It certainly doesn't mean that they should abandon efforts to expand their economies. But it does mean that leaders and analysts must abandon the idea that in foreign affairs, power reduces insecurity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Supreme Court's National Guard decision could force new debate over how Trump could use Insurrection Act","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/24/politics/national-guard-trump-insurrection-act-supreme-court","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:00:59 GMT","


            The Supreme Court's decision Tuesday blocking President Donald Trump from sending the National Guard into American cities is likely to raise a politically fraught debate about the president's willingness to invoke a 19th-century law to deploy the regular military on American soil instead.
    


            Throughout his campaign and in the early months of his second term, Trump and his aides repeatedly teased the idea of invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy the military for domestic purposes — a move that, while perhaps politically unpopular, would give him broad discretion to skirt the general prohibition on using the military domestically.
    


            In its order Tuesday, the Supreme Court focused on another federal law Trump tried to use to federalize hundreds of members of the Illinois National Guard. That law allows a president to call up the guard if he is unable to execute the nation's laws with the “regular forces.” Over dissent from three conservative justices, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump had not met that law's requirements.
    


            But the decision on the court's emergency docket did not deal directly with other authorities Trump could attempt to use.
    


            “As I read it, the court's opinion does not address the president's authority under the Insurrection Act,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative who sided with the majority, wrote in a footnote. “One apparent ramification of the court's opinion is that it could cause the president to use the US military more than the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property in the United States.”
    


In major loss for Trump, Supreme Court blocks National Guard deployment to Chicago



            That is a possibility that has lurked in the case at the Supreme Court for months as the administration has attempted to send National Guard troops into Democratic-run cities to help protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and facilities.
    


            Trump has repeatedly flirted with invoking the Insurrection Act, which would give him broad authority to evade the restrictions on using the military domestically imposed by the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.
    


            “I'd do it if it's necessary. So far it hasn't been necessary,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in October. “But we have an Insurrection Act for a reason.”
    


            The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement after the court's order Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that nothing in the Supreme Court's decision detracts from the administration's “core agenda” of ensuring that “rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property.”
    


            The current version of the Insurrection Act was last invoked by President George H.W. Bush during the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the acquittal of four White police officers in the beating of Rodney King. Perhaps the best-known use of the Insurrection Act was in 1957, when President Dwight Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to integrate its schools.
    


            That order followed the Supreme Court's historic decision three years earlier in Brown v. Board of Education that declared segregated schools unconstitutional.
    


            William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and expert on the Insurrection Act, told CNN that such a move would almost certainly be more politically dicey. “Instead of part-time National Guard personnel, the president could send in the 82nd Airborne in heavy armor and gear and gin up some heavy martial images for our screens,” Banks said.
    


            The administration appeared to acknowledge that concern in briefing earlier this fall, telling the Supreme Court that it made sense to rely on the National Guard in Chicago because its members are “civilians temporarily called up to serve with deep experience in deescalating domestic disturbances among their fellow citizens.” That, the administration suggested, might be preferable to relying on the standing army, “whose primary function is to win wars by deploying lethal force” against enemies overseas.
    


            But now that the Supreme Court has ruled against Trump on his first approach, there is the question of whether the administration will continue to pursue some other legal authority with which to justify a military presence in US cities.
    


            “There's only a little bit of daylight between no law and the Posse Comitatus prohibition and the Insurrection Act,” Banks said. “There's no other space for them to work.”
    


            Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program, predicted the administration will “run into similar trouble” if it attempted to invoke the Insurrection Act.
    


            That's partly because of how the Justice Department has for months framed its need to rely on the law at issue in the case before the Supreme Court, known as section 12406(3).
    


            “Trump can't use 12406(3) to deploy the National Guard at this time,” Goitein said. “I think there are also potential ramifications for whether or how he could use the Insurrection Act.”
    


            The court's decision, which landed months after the Trump administration filed its emergency appeal, came as tensions on the ground at an ICE facility west of Chicago appeared to ease. The administration told a federal court in a different case weeks ago that “increased coordination” with local police had “reduced the need for federal officers” to engage with protesters at the building in suburban Broadview.
    


            And defense officials announced in November that they were “rightsizing” planned deployments to Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon. The officials said at that time that only about 300 National Guard units from Illinois would remain ready to deploy. Lower court orders have blocked their ability to conduct operations with the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            Though the situation on the ground in Chicago quieted, the administration argued in court papers in November that the deployments were still needed.
    


            Justice Neil Gorsuch, a conservative who dissented from the court's decision on Tuesday, wrote in a separate opinion that he was “not comfortable venturing an answer” to many of the questions raised by the case, including how or whether the law Trump initially relied on interacts with the Insurrection Act.
    


            “If all those questions were not fraught enough, an even graver one lurks here too: When, if ever, may the federal government deploy the professional military for domestic law enforcement purposes consistent with the Constitution?” Gorsuch wrote.
    


            Those are questions, he said, he would prefer to leave “for another case where they are properly preserved and can receive the full airing they so clearly deserve.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Most Americans don't think Trump or Democratic leaders are listening. Here's what they wish they could tell Washington","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/24/politics/what-voters-would-tell-washington-vis","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:01:00 GMT","


            Most Americans don't have faith that their political leaders care what they have to say.
    


            But if they had the chance to tell Washington something, a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS finds, they'd say plenty, much of it about the economy.
    


            That was the most common response when Americans were asked to share in their own words what they'd tell President Donald Trump to make life in the US better.
    


            Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 40% mentioned economic or cost-of-living concerns.
    


            “My message to him right now would be, ‘Please take care of the economy because it's awful,'” said Betty Glazebrook, a 78-year-old Trump voter from Massachusetts who spoke to CNN after taking the survey. “You know, being out of work now, I wonder down the road, you know, how will I survive? And I just don't know what's gonna happen.”
    


            Nearly 4 in 10 Americans say that neither the president nor Democratic leadership is listening to people like them. Just 34% of US adults say that Trump cares even somewhat what they have to say and just 36% say that the leadership of the Democratic Party does.
    


            Glazebrook said she feels like Trump cares more about himself than people like her, but she's also unconvinced that Democrats have her best interests in mind. “I'm starting to feel like nobody does, honestly,” she said.
    


            While Trump has often downplayed affordability as a concern, the issue remains top of mind for many voters and likely to dominate next year's midterms. Mentions of the economy dwarf other political issues in the survey. Just 5% of Americans said their advice to Trump would touch on immigration with fewer still mentioning foreign policy.
    


            Not all messages have to do with policy. Many simply want a chance to make their feelings about Trump known; 16% say they'd call on him to resign or leave office, while 8% say they'd pay him a compliment. Around 15% say Trump could most help Americans by changing something about his personal conduct, with 6% wanting him to modulate his tone or to be more respectful, thoughtful or presidential. A few say they would refuse to speak with him at all.
    


            Many Americans also have advice for Democrats on how they should deal with Trump. Ten percent say Democratic leaders could most help by standing their ground or fighting harder against Trump or the GOP, while another 10% say they should instead focus more on compromising or working across the aisle.
    


            The sentiment among the Democratic base is more clear-cut: 19% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they'd tell their party's leadership to take more of a stand compared with just 2% who say they'd advocate for greater compromise.
    


            “Stop being gentle and palatable to the opposing side,” one Democratic-leaning independent from New Jersey in their 20s wrote in response to the survey. “They take extreme and aggressive measures to force change backwards, and when laws get broken, even constitutional ones, many remain silent. We should have an equal reaction to balance out the scales of power.”
    


            That desire for increased forcefulness from their party doesn't map as neatly onto a preferred set of political views. Few Democratic-aligned adults said that they'd share a message about the party's ideological direction, and those who did were about equally as likely to suggest that the party should move to the left as they were to say it should become more moderate.
    


            Many Americans, meanwhile, just want to feel like they're being heard: 8% say they'd tell Democratic leaders to help people, listen to people, or put the people over partisan politics; 5% say they'd deliver a similar message to Trump.
    


            “Take a step outside and look in your own neighborhood, your own backyard and see that who's really struggling and who's actually needing the help,” said Kayley Jensen, a 30-year-old single mother from the Bay Area who responded to the survey. “You're throwing all this money on things that don't matter when you could be building shelters.'”
    


The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS online and by phone from December 4 to 7 among a random national sample of 1,032 adults drawn from a probability-based panel. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

            Hot Stocks 





            Data this week showed that the American economy is growing at its fastest pace in two years — and yet polling shows the mood on Main Street is grim.
    


            It's almost hard to believe we're talking about the same economy. But the metrics offer another reminder that two seemingly diverging trends can simultaneously be true. An economy that's growing rapidly doesn't necessarily mean everyone is feeling it.
    


            Yes, gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, heated up this summer to a sizzling annualized pace of 4.3%, far outpacing economists' expectations.
    


            But the booming GDP did not translate to a hiring boom, nor was it accompanied by a return to normal inflation.
    


            “GDP is an abstract concept. But people know jobs. They know they can't find a job if they lose theirs,” Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told CNN in a phone interview on Tuesday. “And they know they are paying more for coffee, beef, electricity, child care and just about everything else.”
    


            GDP is a kind of report card for the economy. But like any report card, it may not paint a full picture of what is happening.
    


            For example, one of the biggest reasons GDP accelerated in the third quarter is that consumer spending heated up. This has been a recurring theme under both the Biden and Trump administrations: Resilient consumer spending in the face of a laundry list of economic headwinds.
    


            However, the report doesn't explain which consumers ramped up spending.
    


This burrito is everything you need to know about America's economy



            Economists say the third-quarter spending increase was likely driven by higher-income consumers, the ones benefiting the most from record-high real estate values and blockbuster stock returns.
    


            Many lower- and middle-income Americans, on the other hand, are struggling to stay afloat. Some of them are cutting back on spending and falling behind on bills.
    


            “Retirees and the top 10% continue to drive the economy. It's still very much a K-shaped economy,” said Mike Reid, senior US economist at RBC Capital Markets.
    


            While people may not feel high GDP, they do feel high prices.
    


            Inflation hasn't gone through the roof this year, as some feared it would because of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.
    


            But inflation also hasn't improved much since Trump took office in January, when prices were rising at a 3% annual rate compared to November's 2.7% rate (according to government data that carries a lot of fine print because of shutdown-related distortions). Still, it's higher than the 1.7% average annual inflation rate Americans experienced in the decade preceding the onset of the pandemic, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
    


            Prices on some essentials have gone down. For instance, eggs in November were 13% cheaper than a year earlier, according to the BLS. Milk was 1% cheaper.
    


            Gasoline has been under control all year, with the national average falling in recent days to $2.86 per gallon, a fresh four-and-a-half-year low. That's a far cry from $5-a-gallon gas in 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine.
    


            However, other essentials have gone up in price.
    


            Consumers are paying on average 7% more for electricity, a hot topic during the November governor races in New Jersey and Virginia.
    


            Natural gas, the most common way to heat homes in America, is 9% more expensive.
    


            Ground beef surged 15% year-over-year in November, the biggest increase since 2020. And consumers are shelling out a lot more for car repair (10%) and coffee (19%), according to the BLS.
    


            It's true that paychecks are also up – but often not by enough to keep up with the cost of living.
    


            Consider that Bank of America deposit data shows that paychecks beat prices in November only for high-income households. Middle-income household wage growth was just 2.3%, while lower-income households inched up by only 1.4%.
    


            If the US economy were truly booming, consumers wouldn't be worried about job security. That's not what we're seeing today.
    


            The share of consumers who believe job openings will be more plentiful over the next six months fell to the lowest level in four years, according to consumer confidence figures The Conference Board published Tuesday. The share of consumers who believe it's harder to get a job also rose.
    


            It comes as the unemployment rate hit a four-year high of 4.6% last month, up from 4% in January. Earlier this year the number of job seekers exceeded the number of jobs available for the first time in four years.
    


            That's driving consumers to be more downbeat about the economy, the overarching consumer confidence data showed.
    


            One reason hiring has slowed is because businesses are learning how to do more with fewer workers, thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence. At the same time, Trump's erratic trade policy changes have left many businesses in a state of paralysis. With little certainty about his next tariff moves, many have paused hiring plans. Additionally, some businesses have resorted to staffing reductions to avoid having to pass along heftier price increases from tariffs to consumers.
    


            Bottom line: GDP, no matter how high, won't make Americans feel better about this economy. Paychecks that stretch further, more certainty about what lies ahead and better job security will.

            The US manoeuvres, part of President Donald Trump's “total and complete blockade” of sanctioned vessels around Venezuela, strike at the economic heart of one of Beijing's closest Latin American partners – and target an industry that has long benefited China, which in recent months took in roughly 80% of Venezuela's oil exports, analysts say.



            Beijing has slammed those interceptions as “seriously violating international law” and assured Caracas of its opposition to “all forms of unilateralism and bullying” in a call between the countries' top diplomats last week.



            But it's also clear that Beijing is primed to use the US aggression to its advantage: playing it as another reason on its list of why the US should not be the world's leading superpower, and a window into how Trump is rolling out his revival of the Monroe Doctrine.
    


            The White House's national security strategy released earlier this month includes a revamp of that centuries-old policy, updating what historically was a warning to European colonial powers not to interfere in the Western hemisphere to a Trump-era vision for a “stable” region “free of hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets.”
    


            The strategy has sparked a deluge of analysis in China's policy circles, where analysts are debating whether the US is therefore signaling a withdrawal from its role as a global-spanning power to focus on its own backyard – leaving more space for Beijing to expand its own influence in Asia and the world.
    


            So far, Beijing is not waiting for an answer to that question to criticize how the US is handling its backyard when it comes to Venezuela, or to signal that it will not step back its own footprint in the region.
    


            The US' “escalating actions against Venezuela” have placed it “in opposition to global moral standards,” the international-facing edition of the state-backed Global Times said in an editorial on Monday focused on the interceptions of the tankers.
    


            An analysis in domestic Chinese state media was more blunt, with a research fellow at government-backed think tank suggesting that if the US advanced its maritime operations to a large-scale invasion, it could trigger a “‘second Vietnam War.'”
    


            Earlier this month, after the US had already been amassing its military might in the Caribbean and carrying out strikes on alleged drug-smuggling vessels in the region, China bolstered its own message: publishing its first new policy paper on Latin America and the Caribbean in nearly a decade.
    


            Dropping roughly a week after the White House National Security Strategy, China's agenda laid out dozens of areas in which it proposed boosting collaboration with the region, from aerospace to law enforcement.
    


            Whether timed alongside Washington's moves or not, the paper reiterated Beijing's core message as it vies to become an alternative leader to the US and reshape a world it sees as unfairly dominated by the West.
    


            “As a developing country and a member of the Global South, China has always stood in solidarity through thick and thin with the Global South, including Latin America and the Caribbean,” it said, using a term to refer to typically emerging economies in the globe's geographic south.
    


            It also signaled that Beijing has no intention of backing away from a region where it's spent recent decades ramping up its diplomacy and unleashing billions in loans for infrastructure and other projects – with Venezuela a major beneficiary.
    


            The “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine appears to take aim at those ties, with the strategy document prioritizing the Americas and saying the US would seek to “deny non-Hemispheric competitors the ability to… own or control strategically vital assets, in our Hemisphere.”
    


            The Trump administration has already launched a campaign to oust a Hong Kong developer from operating ports at the Panama Canal after claiming this means China is “operating” the canal. Security concerns about China and Russia are also fueling Trump's interest in taking control of the Danish territory of Greenland, much to the alarm of Denmark and fellow US allies across Europe.
    


            In his military pressure on Venezuela, Trump has said he's taking aim at the regime of Nicolás Maduro, which he alleges uses oil money to finance “drug terrorism, human trafficking, murder, and kidnapping.” He's suggested that he wants to open up US access to Venezuelan land, oil and assets that he says were “stolen” when the country nationalized its oil fields in the 1970s.
    


            But Trump is also targeting a country with close ties to the countries he appears to see as great powers: China and Russia.
    


            Those two countries have both been staunch diplomatic backers of the Maduro regime, even as Venezuela spiralled into deep economic crisis, and as rights groups and other governments decried political repression, including around the disputed 2024 election that extended Maduro's rule.
    


            Representatives from Moscow and Beijing condemned the US pressure campaign against Venezuela at a meeting on the UN Security Council on Tuesday, with Chinese representative Sun Lei saying China “supports all countries in defending their sovereignty and national dignity” and calling on the US to avoid further escalation.
    


            Beijing has other reasons to pay close attention.
    


            Last month, crude oil from Venezuela accounted for 5% of its total imports, according to data analytics firm Kpler shared with CNN. And one vessel intercepted by the US, the unsanctioned Centuries tanker, is owned by a Hong Kong-registered company.
    


            But China is unlikely to move past rhetoric and flex its military might to back Venezuela or to shore up engagement in Latin America in the face of the US show of force.
    


            It does, however, appear to be closely evaluating how the Trump administration's heightened focus on the region may impact its engagement elsewhere in the world.
    


            International observers have wondered whether China could draw lessons from the American moves for its own region, where it's widely seen as looking to be the dominant power and achieve its goal of taking control of Taiwan –– the self-governing democratic island it claims.
    


            In China, analysts and policy thinkers have been focused on how the Trump's reboot of the Monroe Doctrine will impact the global balance of power.
    


            Some have argued that it shows a re-prioritization of US interests or even Trump's vision for a world divided into “spheres of influence” led by great powers – namely the US and its allies, Russia and China.
    


            That means, the US “is unlikely to interfere excessively in East Asian affairs such as the Taiwan issue and Sino-Japanese relations and instead acknowledges China's dominance in this region of influence,” one such scholar, Mei Yang, associate dean of The Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shenzhen, wrote in a recent analysis.



            But Mei and other Chinese policy thinkers suggest that this is a “temporary strategic retrenchment” by the US, that will not see it give up on looking to ensure military dominance or on its competition with China.
    


            So even if Beijing sees an upside to a US focused on its own backyard, it doesn't change the urgency felt by Chinese officials to gain control of the global narrative. And that's why the US showing military aggression in its regional waters is a convenient talking point for Beijing, which has long been accused by the US and its allies of doing the same in the South China Sea and around Taiwan.
    


            That means, so far, Trump's actions against Venezuela and his evocation of a 19th century policy appear to have given Beijing one more way to defend its own record and frame the US as a power of a bygone era.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area to support its immigration crackdown, a significant defeat for the president's efforts to send troops to U.S. cities.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area to support its immigration crackdown, a significant defeat for the president's efforts to send troops to U.S. cities. 

The justices declined the Republican administration's emergency request to overturn a ruling by U.S. District Judge April Perry that had blocked the deployment of troops. An appeals court also had refused to step in. The Supreme Court took more than two months to act.

Three justices — Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch — publicly dissented.

The high court order is not a final ruling but it could affect other lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump's attempts to deploy the military in other Democratic-led cities.

“At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the high court majority wrote. 

Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he agreed with the decision to keep the Chicago deployment blocked, but would have left the president more latitude to deploy troops in possible future scenarios. 

The outcome is a rare Supreme Court setback for Trump, who had won repeated victories in emergency appeals since he took office again in January. The conservative-dominated court has allowed Trump to ban transgender people from the military, claw back billions of dollars of congressionally approved federal spending, move aggressively against immigrants and fire the Senate-confirmed leaders of independent federal agencies.




Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker applauded Tuesday's decision as a win for the state and country.

“American cities, suburbs, and communities should not have to faced masked federal agents asking for their papers, judging them for how they look or sound, and living in fear that the President can deploy the military to their streets,” he said. 

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, on the other hand, said the president had activated the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property from “violent rioters.” 

“Nothing in today's ruling detracts from that core agenda. The Administration will continue working day in and day out to safeguard the American public,” she said. 

Alito and Thomas said in their dissent that the court had no basis to reject Trump's contention that the administration needed the troops to enforce immigration laws. Gorsuch said he would have narrowly sided with the government based on the declarations of federal law enforcement officials. 

The administration had initially sought the order to allow the deployment of troops from Illinois and Texas, but the Texas contingent of about 200 National Guard troops was later sent home from Chicago.

The Trump administration has argued that the troops are needed “to protect federal personnel and property from violent resistance against the enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

But Perry wrote that she found no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois and no reason to believe the protests there had gotten in the way of Trump's immigration crackdown. 

Perry had initially blocked the deployment for two weeks. But in October, she extended the order indefinitely while the Supreme Court reviewed the case.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the west Chicago suburb of Broadview has been the site of tense protests, where federal agents have previously used tear gas and other chemical agents on protesters and journalists.

Last month, authorities arrested 21 protesters and said four officers were injured outside the Broadview facility. Local authorities made the arrests.

The Illinois case is just one of several legal battles over National Guard deployments.

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb is suing to halt the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen in the nation's capital. Forty-five states have entered filings in federal court in that case, with 23 supporting the administration's actions and 22 supporting the attorney general's lawsuit.

More than 2,200 troops from several Republican-led states remain in Washington, although the crime emergency Trump declared in August ended a month later.

A federal judge in Oregon has permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there, and all 200 troops from California were being sent home from Oregon, an official said.

A state court in Tennessee ruled in favor of Democratic officials who sued to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis, which Trump has called a replica of his crackdown on Washington, D.C.

In California, a judge in September said deployment in the Los Angeles area was illegal. By that point, just 300 of the thousands of troops sent there remained, and the judge did not order them to leave.

The Trump administration has appealed the California and Oregon rulings to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Air traffic controllers lost communication for about 10 minutes with a small Mexican Navy plane carrying a young medical patient and seven others before it crashed off the Texas coast in thick fog, killing at least six people, Mexico's government said Tuesday.

The plane was working with a nonprofit group transporting Mexican children with severe burns to a hospital in Galveston, near Houston, when the plane crashed Monday afternoon. Authorities believed the plane had landed, but the flight had lost contact with air controllers, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday in her morning briefing.

Teams found the dead bodies of five people and pulled two survivors from the plane's wreckage, then set off on a daylong search in the waters near Galveston for 29-year-old Navy Lieutenant Luis Enrique Castillo. Castillo's family back in their rural town in southern Mexico were left scrambling for answers, hoping for the best for their missing son.

“We don't know what to do,” his father Eduardo Castillo said Tuesday. “All we can do is wait. We can't go to the United States, we have no visa.” 

The search came to an end Tuesday night when search teams found Castillo's body. American authorities are investigating the the cause, but the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that it could take a week or more to recover the aircraft.

“What happened is very tragic,” Sheinbaum said in her morning press briefing, noting that sailors were among the dead. 




As the twin turboprop Beech King Air 350i approached Sholes International Airport in Galveston, radar shows it was far too low, said Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration crash investigator.

A navigation system for the runway where the plane was supposed to land had been out of service for about a week, Guzzetti said. The system sends signals to the airplane cockpit that helps pilots navigate in the kind of bad weather that had enveloped the area. The fog was so thick that meteorologists estimated only about a half-mile of visibility.

The pilot should have aborted the landing if the runway wasn't visible at an altitude of 205 feet (62.5 meters), climbing back up before trying again or looking for another airport entirely, Guzzetti said.

Guzzetti said the reported radar track shows that the pilot was descending rapidly below 200 feet (61 meters), a full 2 miles (3 kilometers) away from the runway.

“Maybe there was some sort of mechanical malfunction,” he said. “But just looking at the recorded flight track and comparing it with the weather and the airport equipment outage, seems to me that this landing approach should never have occurred.”

The plane crashed in a bay near the base of the causeway connecting Galveston Island to the mainland. The popular beach destination is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Houston.

Sky Decker, a professional yacht captain who lives near the crash site, said he jumped in his boat to see if he could help. He picked up two police officers who guided him through the thick fog to the nearly submerged plane. Decker jumped into the water and found a badly injured woman trapped beneath chairs and other debris.

“She had maybe 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of air gap to breathe in,” he said. “And there was jet fuel in there mixed with the water, fumes real bad. She was really fighting for her life.”

He said he also pulled out a man seated in front of her who had already died. 

Eduardo Castillo gathered with the rest of his family and friends Tuesday afternoon in their small community of El Pantano in the sweltering southern Mexican state of Veracruz. 

The father, who worked long hours as a carpenter to give his son the opportunities he never had, was desperately refreshing his phone every few minutes, looking for any news of their missing son. Mexico's Marines, he noted, had provided few other details than a call saying their son was missing. 

Framed pictures of Luis Enrique Castillo and his many diplomas coated a wall of their home. He and his wife were expecting a baby due in three months.

On Tuesday night, Castillo heard his phone ring and answered, hearing the words he had dreaded. His son was dead. 

“Now he's never going to meet his unborn child,” Eduard Castillo said as his family hugged and sobbed around him. 

A spokesperson for the NTSB said in an email that investigators will review maintenance records, weather forecasts and air traffic control communications. A preliminary report is expected within 30 days.

Guzzetti said the investigation also will likely look into how serious the young patient's medical condition was and how motivated the pilot was to land.

“There have been previous accidents in the air medical community where pilots try to push their luck in order to save the patient,” he said.

The aircraft had a “very, very proven design,” said aviation safety expert John Cox. He said it's the latest version of a series that has been in use since the 1960s and would have been outfitted with all the modern electronics, avionics and equipment.

Mexico's Navy said the plane was helping with a medical mission in coordination with the Michou and Mau Foundation. 

The charity was founded after a mother died trying to save her kids from a fire. One child died, while another survived after receiving treatment at Shriners Children's Texas in Galveston. Over 23 years, the foundation has helped transfer more than 2,000 patients to that hospital and other medical facilities with burn expertise, according to the charity's website. 

In a social media post, the foundation offered condolences to the families of the crash victims.

Shriners Children's Texas said in a statement that it learned of the crash with “profound sadness” but wasn't able to provide any information about the child's condition.

This latest crash comes amid a year of intense scrutiny on aviation safety after a string of high-profile crashes and the flight disruptions during the government shutdown driven by the shortage of air traffic controllers. 

The January midair collision between an Army helicopter and an airliner near Washington, D.C., was followed by the crash of a medical transport plane in Philadelphia. This fall's fiery UPS plane crash only added to the concerns. Still, the total number of crashes in 2025 was actually down a bit from last year, and experts say flying remains safe overall.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A man accused of shooting two National Guard troops near the White House has been charged in a complaint with federal firearms charges in connection with the ambush on November 26 that fatally wounded one of the West Virginia National Guard members and seriously injured the second.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, has been charged with transporting a firearm in interstate commerce with the intent to commit an offense punishable for more than one year. He has also been charged federally with transporting a stolen firearm in interstate commerce.

“The transfer of this case from Superior Court to District Court ensures that we can undertake the serious, deliberate, and weighty analysis required to determine if the death penalty is appropriate here,” said U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. “Sarah Beckstrom was just 20 years old when she was killed and her parents are now forced to endure the holiday season without their daughter. Andrew Wolfe, by the grace of God, survived but has a long road ahead in his recovery.”

Lakanwal remains charged with first-degree murder, assault with intent to kill and illegal possession of a firearm in the shooting that killed Beckstrom, 20, and wounded Wolfe, 24, in violation of D.C. code. Lakanwal, who was shot during the encounter, has pleaded not guilty to the D.C. charges.

There is no death penalty in D.C. Superior Court.




Beckstrom and Wolfe were deployed with the West Virginia National Guard for President Donald Trump's law-enforcement surge in the nation's capital, which has flooded the city with federal agents and troops since August. Lakanwal is accused of driving from Bellingham, Washington to Washington, D.C. while in possession of a stolen firearm and ambushing the two Guard members outside a subway station three blocks from the White House.

An Afghan national, Laknawal worked with the American government, including the CIA, “as a member of a partner force” in Kandahar, Afghanistan, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said.

Lakanwal, 29, entered the United States in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, officials said. That Biden administration program evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the U.S. withdrawal from the country.

Lakanwal's lawyer was not immediately available for comment.

ATLANTA (AP) — Three inmates who escaped from a jail east of Atlanta, including a murder suspect, commandeered a terrified Lyft driver's car to reach south Florida before she was rescued and they were captured, according to details revealed in court records.

The driver told FBI agents that the men used a fake name to order the ride, put a rope around her neck from behind her, dragged her into the backseat and threatened to kill her, according to a court affidavit filed late Tuesday and obtained by The Associated Press.

The inmates were able to “compromise” a portion of a cell inside the DeKalb County Jail to make their escape, said DeKalb County Chief Deputy Temetris Atkins. He didn't provide more specifics because jailers don't want other inmates to know the facility's weaknesses.

“We repaired the area that was compromised, and we're looking at other areas that are similar to that to fortify them to make sure that they are not compromised in the same manner,” Atkins said at a Tuesday news conference.

DeKalb County Sheriff Melody Maddox described the jail as an “aging facility that's deteriorating right before our eyes.” The jail is in Decatur, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of downtown Atlanta.

The escape was discovered early Monday during a routine security check, authorities said. After jailers realized the three were gone, investigators listened to recordings of conversations they'd had on recorded phone lines. They learned that one of the inmates had contacted people on the outside who helped them evade capture after the escape, U.S. Marshal Thomas Brown said.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




The inmates were picked up by an unnamed man and taken to one of their girlfriends' homes, Brown said. Then, a Lyft ride was ordered using a fake, female name.




Officers tracked the car as it traveled to south Florida with the aid of license plate readers, devices that can alert law enforcement to the locations of wanted vehicles. When they caught up with the car and tried to stop it, one of the inmates jumped out and ran but was arrested along with a second inmate, according to a court affidavit.

Investigators also learned that the men used the Lyft driver's credit card for a short-term rental of a home in Miramar, Florida, where officers apprehended the third inmate and rescued the driver, court records state.

The driver told investigators that she was held in the car for six to 10 hours as they tried to gain access to her phone and online banking records. After trying to escape once, she endured “increased threats of being shot, raped, and tortured,” an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit.

“As you can imagine, the Lyft driver is very traumatized by this,” Brown said.

All three inmates were charged with kidnapping as well as the escape, according to criminal complaints.

A lawyer with the Federal Public Defender's Office in Fort Lauderdale appointed to represent one of the men, 24-year-old Stevenson Charles, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Tuesday evening, nor did a Miami attorney representing a second, Naod Yohannes, 25. There was no lawyer listed in court records for the third, Yusuf Minor, 31.

Charles was being held before the escape on charges including murder and armed robbery. The other two faced charges including armed robbery and arson.

The sheriff's office had warned that the men might be armed and were considered dangerous after their escape.

Before they were captured, federal authorities had issued particularly strong warnings advising the citizens to be wary of Charles, who has had several run-ins with law officers in Georgia and Florida. He had been sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to multiple counts of kidnapping and bank robbery, a federal agent wrote in a Monday affidavit regarding the recent jail escape.

After being sentenced, the agent wrote, Charles was turned over to DeKalb County authorities on Dec. 5 to face the murder charge, details of which were not immediately available.

In one of multiple cases involving Charles in South Florida, he is accused of meeting a man through the Grindr online dating application and then pulling a gun on him when they met in person at a Miami residence in 2022.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela's parliament on Tuesday approved a measure that criminalizes a broad range of activities that can hinder navigation and commerce in the South American country, such as the seizure of oil tankers. 

The bill — introduced, debated and approved within two days in the National Assembly — follows this month's seizures by U.S. forces of two tankers carrying Venezuelan oil in international waters. The seizures are the latest strategy in U.S. President Donald Trump's four-month pressure campaign on Venezuela's leader Nicolás Maduro.

The tankers are part of what the Trump administration has said is a fleet Venezuela uses to evade U.S. economic sanctions.

The unicameral assembly, which is controlled by Venezuela's ruling party, did not publish drafts on Tuesday nor the final version of the measure. But as read on the floor, the bill calls for fines and prison sentences of up to 20 years for anyone who promotes, requests, supports, finances or participates in “acts of piracy, blockades or other international illegal acts” against commercial entities operating with the South American country.

Venezuela's political opposition, including Nobel Peace laureate María Corina Machado, has expressed support for Trump's Venezuela policy, including the seizure of tankers. Machado and Trump have both repeatedly said that Maduro's days in power are numbered.

The bill, which now awaits Maduro's signature, also instructs the executive branch to come up with “incentives and mechanisms for economic, commercial and other protections” for national or foreign entities doing business with Venezuela in the event of piracy activities, a maritime blockade or other unlawful acts.




The U.S. Coast Guard on Saturday seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries that officials said was part of the fleet moving sanctioned cargo. With assistance from the U.S. Navy, it seized a rogue tanker called Skipper on Dec. 10. That ship was registered in Panama.

Trump, after that first seizure, said the U.S. would carry out a “blockade” of Venezuela. He later demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from U.S. oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of the blockade against sanctioned oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country. 

At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by Venezuela, U.S. Ambassador Mike Waltz on Tuesday stressed that sanctioned oil tankers “operate as the primary economic lifeline for Maduro and his illegitimate regime.”

“Maduro's ability to sell Venezuela's oil enables his fraudulent claim to power and his narco-terrorist activities,” Waltz said. “The United States will impose and enforce sanctions to the maximum extent to deprive Maduro of the resources he uses to fund Cartel de los Soles.”

Maduro was indicted in 2020 on narcoterrorism charges in the U.S. and accused of leading the Cartel de los Soles, which the Trump administration designated as a foreign terrorist organization last month. But the entity is not a cartel per se.

Venezuelans began using the term Cartel de los Soles in the 1990s to refer to high-ranking military officers who had grown rich from drug-running. As corruption expanded nationwide, its use loosely expanded to police and government officials as well as activities like illegal mining and fuel trafficking. 

At Tuesday's meeting, Venezuela's U.N. Ambassador Samuel Moncada accused the U.S. of acting “outside international law” and its own domestic laws, by demanding that Venezuelans vacate the country and hand it over to the Trump administration, including all its oil fields. 

“What right does the United States government have to appropriate, to date, almost 4 million barrels of Venezuelan oil?” Moncada asked, referring to the cargo of the two seized tankers. “This alleged naval blockade is essentially a military act aimed at laying siege to the Venezuelan nation, degrading its economic and military apparatus, weakening its social and political cohesion, and causing internal chaos to facilitate aggression by external forces.”

Many countries expressed concern about violations of international maritime law and adhering to the United Nations Charter, which requires all 193 member nations to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every other country. The United States' actions were supported by a few countries, including Panama and Argentina.

A federal judge on Tuesday cleared the way for New York's so-called Green Light Law, ruling against the Trump administration's effort to block the state from giving people driver's licenses without requiring proof that they are in the U.S. legally.

U.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci found that the Justice Department — which sued New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and state Attorney General Letitia James in February — had failed to prove its claims that the state law sought to invalidate federal law or that the measure unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.

""As I said from the start, our laws protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe,"" James said in a statement. ""I will always stand up for New Yorkers and the rule of law.""

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi alleged when announcing the lawsuit that Hochul and James were prioritizing ""illegal aliens over American citizens,"" as the controversial state law blocks federal agents trying to enforce immigration laws from seeing illegal immigrants' criminal driving records during traffic stops.

SANCTUARY STATE'S ‘GREEN LIGHT' LAW IS RED FLAG FOR AMERICANS' SAFETY, NATIONAL SECURITY: EXPERTS

Nardacci wrote in her ruling that her job was not to evaluate the desirability of the law as a policy matter, but to determine whether the Trump administration's arguments prove its claims that the statute violates the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which establishes that federal laws overrule state laws.

The administration has ""failed to state such a claim,"" Nardacci wrote.

The Green Light Law, also known as the Driver's License Access and Privacy Act, was adopted, in part, to improve road safety, as people sometimes drove without a license or without having passed a driving test. Under the measure, it is easier for these license holders to receive auto insurance.

The law states that people who do not have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID, including valid passports and driver's licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still receive a driver's permit and pass a road test to qualify for a ""standard driver's license.""

The legislation does not apply to commercial driver's licenses (CDLs).

BLUE STATE IN THE HOT SEAT AFTER ICE BUSTS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WITH ‘NO NAME GIVEN' ON LICENSE

The DOJ's lawsuit argued that the law was ""a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them,"" citing a provision that requires the state's DMV commissioner to notify people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.

The lawsuit further claimed that it could be easier to enforce the Trump administration's immigration agenda if federal authorities had unrestricted access to New York's driver information.

The Green Light Law took effect in 2019, but came under renewed scrutiny following a fatal shootout in Vermont in January that left a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent dead near the northern border with Canada after a traffic stop involving a German national.

""Any information that can help law enforcement stay safe as they conduct their duties has pretty much been taken away with this Green Light Law,"" Hector Garza, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, told Fox News Digital at the time.

""What [the Green Light Law] does, is that it prevents law enforcement agents from getting any type of information in regards to any registrations that the state has,"" Garza added. ""For example, before we engage in traffic stops, typically law enforcement will always conduct a vehicle registration check to see if there's any warrants to see if that person is considered armed and dangerous.""

But Nardacci, echoing an appeals court ruling in a county clerk's earlier challenge to the law, wrote that the information ""remains available to federal immigration authorities"" through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.

New York is one of a dozen states that allows illegals to drive.

Attorney Donna Rotunno weighs in on the latest developments in the investigation into the death of Florida teen Anna Kepner, who was found dead in her room on a Carnival cruise ship.

Newly released court records shed additional light on how a family responded after the death of 18-year-old Anna Kepner, who was found dead aboard a Carnival cruise ship last month.

According to documents obtained by FOX 35 Orlando, text messages exchanged after Anna's death show the family's concern about limiting information shared publicly and keeping their 16-year-old son's name out of the media.

The messages were submitted as exhibits in an ongoing family court case and include exchanges that began within roughly a day of Anna's body being discovered. The messages also emphasize the family's position that the teen does not remember events surrounding Anna's death.

Anna Kepner was found dead Nov. 7 in her cabin aboard the Carnival Horizon, which returned to Port Miami two days later. Federal authorities boarded the ship upon its return and began collecting evidence.

Officials said she died from mechanical asphyxia, meaning she was deprived of oxygen. No suspect has been publicly named in the case.

Text exchanges between Anna's stepmother, Shauntel Kepner, and her ex-husband show conversations that began the evening of Nov. 8, about a day after Anna's body was discovered.

Court records indicate the discussions focused largely on managing information, limiting social media exposure and addressing concerns involving the teen, who is a minor, rather than on the circumstances of Anna's death. Court documents indicate the teen is being investigated in connection with Anna's death but note he has not been charged.

ANNA KEPNER DIES MYSTERIOUSLY DURING FAMILY VACATION ON CARNIVAL CRUISE SHIP: TIMELINE OF EVENTS

In one message sent around 7:30 p.m. on Nov. 8, Shauntel asked her ex-husband to call her immediately, describing the situation as an emergency. When he later suggested picking up their daughter, Shauntel declined, explaining the girl had only been told that her brother was struggling emotionally and was being evaluated at a hospital.

In a later exchange on Nov. 9, Shauntel described a brief conversation she said she had with her son while he was in a medical facility. She stated he repeatedly said he could not remember anything and that a nurse allowed the short call so she could reassure him that his parents loved him.

The messages also show efforts to prevent information from spreading on social media, including concerns about posts circulating online and the desire to shield the teen from negative attention. Shauntel emphasized that he is a minor and that the family did not want his name released.

FATHER OF CHEERLEADER WHO DIED ON CARNIVAL CRUISE SUBPOENAED TO TESTIFY IN CUSTODY CASE

During a Dec. 5 court appearance, Shauntel's attorney said the teen's father agreed to have him live with a relative after his release from the hospital once the ship docked. The attorney said the decision was made to eliminate any potential risk to other children in the home, according to FOX 35 Orlando.

Shauntel also testified that the teen takes medication for ADHD and insomnia and had not taken his insomnia medication for two nights during the cruise, including the night before Anna's body was found.

Court documents state Anna's body was discovered under a bed in a cabin she was sharing with two siblings, including her 16-year-old stepbrother.

While the FBI has not publicly identified anyone as a suspect and no criminal charges have been filed, records from an ongoing family court dispute between Anna's father and stepmother, Christopher Kepner and Shauntel Kepner, and Shauntel Kepner's ex-husband, Thomas Hudson, indicate the teen is being investigated in Anna's death.

Additional messages referenced the possibility that charges could be filed depending on the results of the autopsy. Shauntel said the family planned to learn more once the autopsy findings were available.

A former sheriff's detective, Jamie Copenhaver, reviewed the messages and told FOX 35 Orlando they raised concerns for him. He said the exchanges appeared focused on controlling public perception rather than addressing the loss of an 18-year-old family member.

Copenhaver described the messages as resembling ""damage control,"" adding that the tone suggested to him that the family knew more than what had been publicly shared.

Messages included in the court records also show both parents expressing emotional support for their son, emphasizing that he was not alone and that his family stood by him.

In one exchange, Hudson told Shauntel that he wanted their son to know ""he isn't just dead to everyone,"" adding that ""regardless of everything at the moment, he needs his parents,"" and that he wanted an opportunity to speak with him as soon as possible.

Kepner, of Titusville, Florida, was a high school senior at Temple Christian School. She was preparing to graduate in the spring of 2026 and hoped to enlist in the U.S. Navy, her family said.

The FBI has not released details about the investigation, and the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner has not publicly released Anna's autopsy or toxicology results. The investigation remains ongoing, and more than six weeks later, no individual has been publicly identified as a suspect.

When the news broke about welfare fraud in Minnesota's Somali community, it was largely confined to abuse surrounding the Agriculture Department's Federal Child Nutrition Program and a Medicaid-funded autism program. However, investigators now believe that over $9 billion was stolen by more than 90 people through 14 Medicaid-funded programs. It is possible that this wave of criminal fraud is isolated to Minnesota, but it is not likely, especially since the waivers at the heart of the scandal have been granted to dozens of other blue states nationwide.

Medicaid and Medicare have always been prone to fraud, which is why the Department of Justice has had a dedicated national task force to identify and prosecute Medicaid and Medicare fraud since 2007. But what is going on in Minnesota is not typical Medicaid fraud. The guilty are not doctors who bill for more expensive services than those actually delivered, then kick money back to patients. Nor are they doctors who order tests or treatments that are not needed, so as to increase reimbursement. No doctors are even involved because Medicaid is being used to pay for nonmedical services.

How did this happen?

The “social determinants of health” movement existed long before the Affordable Care Act expansion of Medicaid. But with federal taxpayers picking up 90% of new spending, the incentive for states to find new ways to spend other people's money was larger than ever before. Proponents of SDOH claim to believe that health outcomes are primarily driven by social and economic conditions, meaning adequate provision of housing, food, education, and even income must be considered part of “healthcare.” With the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion money flowing in, many states began using Section 1115 waivers to use federal Medicaid dollars to fund and expand existing welfare programs or create new ones, all channeled through nongovernmental organizations stocked with Democratic Party community organizers and other activists.

In 2023, the Biden administration released its “Playbook to Address Social Determinants of Health,” embracing the SDOH approach and making it easier for states to use their Medicaid dollars for “nonstandard benefits,” such as housing, utilities, food, and even home remodeling. The additional advantage of tapping Medicaid funds for social welfare spending was that Medicaid is an entitlement program not subject to annual appropriations. Even through a government shutdown, the SDOH money spigot to Democratic nonprofit groups and their fraudulent allies keeps flowing.

This is how Minnesota's “14 Medicaid programs” that have become such a magnet for fraud came into being. According to authorities, the 14 services funded by Medicaid dollars that have been identified as “high-risk for billing irregularities” include: early intensive developmental and behavioral intervention services for autism, integrated community supports (nonrent housing assistance and counseling), nonemergency medical transportation, peer recovery services, adult rehabilitative mental health services, adult day services, personal care assistance (nonmedical bathing/eating assistance), recuperative care, individualized home supports, adult companion services, night supervision, assertive community treatment, intensive residential treatment services, and housing stabilization services.

Importantly, none of these involve a doctor or nurse with medical training. They don't require any training at all, which is part of what makes them so ripe for fraud.

NEWSOM'S UNPAID BILLS ARE COSTING CALIFORNIA JOBS

Blue states have been abusing federal Medicaid dollars to finance non-healthcare social welfare spending for years. They say such spending reduces overall healthcare costs and improves healthcare outcomes, but lack evidence to support these claims. The never-ending spiral of blue state Medicaid spending suggests otherwise.

As Republicans negotiate with Democrats over the extension of the COVID-19 Affordable Care Act bonus subsidies, the elimination of all non-health Medicaid spending should be part of the discussion. These programs do not improve health outcomes and are a magnet for fraud and abuse.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ) on Tuesday advocated in support of the closure of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Newark, New Jersey, where she was arrested and charged in May for assaulting officers.

The congresswoman described revisiting Delaney Hall as “traumatic” and claimed she was the one assaulted, not federal law enforcement.

“We're going to continue to say that this facility should not be open,” she told reporters. “When we left out of there, a detainee told us, ‘This is not the America that we dreamed of.'”

McIver's public appearance outside the detention center comes nearly two weeks after an illegal Haitian immigrant died at Delaney Hall. ICE said the detainee, identified as 41-year-old Jean Wilson Brutus, died of “suspected natural causes” on Dec. 12. He was taken into custody the previous day.

Democratic lawmakers suspect ICE may have played a role in events leading to Brutus's death.

“This tragedy is not an isolated incident, and we have seen neglect, abuse, and cruelty from this administration as they strip people of the rights this country affords everyone, including those in detention,” McIver previously said. “Delaney Hall must be closed immediately and a full, independent, investigation needs to take place.”

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) made a similar statement, calling out the “inhumane conditions” and “mismanagement” at the ICE facility, which, like Mike McIver, called for its closure.

Reps. Rob Menendez (D-NJ) and Yvette Clarke (D-NY) joined McIver on Tuesday's oversight visit.

ICE is investigating the detainee's death, Menendez said after the lawmakers asked about the matter. He accused the Trump administration of taking “advantage of a broken immigration system … for profit.”

Clarke called attention to reports of four deaths in ICE facilities over a four-day period this month, casting blame on the Trump administration. She said it's an “insult” if anyone argues the recent deaths are “isolated.”

Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin defended ICE's treatment of illegal detainees, saying they have “higher standards than most U.S. prisons that hold U.S. citizens.”

“All detainees are provided with meals certified by dietitians and comprehensive medical care — often the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives,” she noted.

NEW JERSEY DEMOCRATS CRY FOUL AFTER ICE DETAINEE DIES OF ‘SUSPECTED NATURAL CAUSES'

McIver has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges, which she alleges were politically motivated. A federal judge denied the defendant's bid to dismiss her case last month. Two of the three charges are now set to proceed.

President Donald Trump will deploy 350 National Guard troops to New Orleans by New Year's Eve, Gov. Jeff Landry (R-LA) announced on Tuesday.

The newly announced deployment to Louisiana's most populous city will last through February 2026. Landry said his state “desperately” needed the action, which fulfills a request he made of the president earlier this year.

“We know how to make cities safe, and the National Guard complements cities that are having high crime problems,” he said on Fox News, citing Washington as an example.

Louisiana was one of the first Republican-led states to send National Guard units to assist the Trump administration's crime crackdown in Washington this year. The state will now benefit from lending a helping hand to the federal government.

The latest National Guard deployment is “going to help us further crack down on the violence here in the city of New Orleans and elsewhere around Louisiana,” Landry said.

The governor then thanked Trump and War Secretary Pete Hegseth for authorizing the deployment.

The president is no longer dominating his party or the country in the way he once did.

Hey, remember April? 



When President Donald Trump marked his 100th day in office at the end of that month, he was on a seemingly unstoppable roll. After taking four years out of office to prepare, he and his team returned to power with a blitz of more than 140 executive orders. He bent the Republican-controlled Congress to his will and dismantled much of the federal bureaucracy. He brought powerful institutions, including prestigious universities and law firms, to heel, demanding that his ring be kissed and his wallet fattened. He upended the nation's economic and diplomatic relations with the world. He hijacked Americans' attention—he was everywhere!—while openly musing about tearing up the Constitution and serving a third term. Moreover, Democrats were in disarray—truly—and their party's future seemed in doubt. Trump stared out from the cover of this very magazine with the accompanying quote “I run the country and the world.” Honestly, it was hard to argue with him.



But as 2025 draws to a close, Trump seems a whole lot smaller. His party has been battered in recent elections. His poll numbers on even his signature issues—the economy, immigration—have tumbled. He's seemingly lost touch with what got him elected, instead focusing on projects both petty and self-aggrandizing. As Americans worry about affordability, Trump and his family have profited wildly from his time in office. Republicans have begun to openly and repeatedly defy him. Democrats have started to outmaneuver him. Today, the Jeffrey Epstein scandal once more erupted with embarrassing revelations and unanswered questions. And every now and then, Trump seems to have a hard time even staying awake.



Every president is inherently a lame duck the moment he takes the oath of office for the second time. But many presidents have been at least able to delay their diminishment until after the midterm elections, at which point—political capital largely exhausted, the political world turning to the race to pick a successor—they tend to focus on things over which they still have control, such as foreign policy and legacy building. Remarkably, Trump, not even a full year into his second term, seems to have already gotten there. Intensely focused on winning a Nobel Peace Prize and on striking lucrative business deals, he's hosted a parade of world leaders at the White House while increasing his foreign travel and cutting back his domestic trips. He's also intent on leaving a physical mark on the nation's capital, slapping his name on the Kennedy Center and commissioning the construction of a massive arch (surely the “Arc de Trump”) while using gold fixtures and a demolition crew to remake the White House itself.



That myopic focus has worried Republicans, who are now sounding the alarm on a possible wipeout during next year's midterm elections. There has been a wave of congressional retirements and rumors of more coming early in the new year. And among some of those who look to outlast Trump in Washington, there has been a growing willingness to defy him. To be clear, the president still enjoys widespread popularity with the MAGA rank and file, and many GOP lawmakers live in fear of a Trump-backed primary challenge. But arguably, one of Trump's greatest political superpowers—one that has been evident since his hostile takeover of the GOP in the 2016 campaign—was an ability to demand absolute fealty from Republican lawmakers. That is now eroding. And the first, most meaningful, fissure has been about a dead man.



Trump really wanted to stop hearing about Epstein. He snapped at aides who tried to bring up Epstein when storylines about the disgraced pedophile financier began to percolate during the late summer, and he grew furious at some MAGA supporters who wouldn't let the matter go. The president himself was never a full-throated Epstein conspiracy theorist, but he repeatedly intimated during last year's campaign that something was nefarious about the government's handling of the case. Yet he never understood why the matter—and questions about Epstein's prison death, which was ruled a suicide—was so meaningful to some of his supporters: It was not a liberal conspiracy theory; it was largely a MAGA one. Trump admitted to a long friendship with Epstein—the two men ran in the same rarefied Manhattan and Palm Beach circles and enjoyed pursuing young women—but, he insisted, he broke off contact with the financier before he ran into legal trouble. (His accounts as to why they had a falling-out have shifted multiple times.)

Yet it was some of MAGA's loudest voices—Marjorie Taylor Greene and Nancy Mace among them—who defied Trump's efforts to bury the story. And it turned out that they were the harbingers of an avalanche; Trump got rolled by Republicans in both the House and the Senate last month when they voted for the publication of all of the Epstein materials. His hand forced, Trump authorized their release. But every time his administration has tried to make the Epstein matter go away, it's only inadvertently turned up the spotlight. Last week's publication of Epstein materials failed to satisfy lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, and that release focused on former President Bill Clinton, making it appear transparently political. Today's batch—quite the news dump, just before the Christmas holiday—yet again reinforced just how close Trump and Epstein were.



The Epstein question spawned the first widespread Republican rebellion against the president and opened the door for GOP defiance on other issues, including the legality of the Venezuelan boat strikes and tossing away the filibuster. Formerly meek Republicans found their voice to scold Trump for his callous social-media post blaming the filmmaker Rob Reiner for his own murder. They urged him to focus on health-care costs and affordability in the new year.



The White House, which did not respond to a request for comment, insists that Trump is listening. His aides have begun organizing events on housing and prescription-drug prices. They touted the fact that the nation's economic growth accelerated to a 4.3 percent annual rate last quarter, blowing past expectations. After months without any domestic travel, Trump went to both Pennsylvania and North Carolina to (at least nominally) discuss affordability. Aides promise that he'll be on the road often next year, ahead of the November midterm elections. Hill Republicans seem willing to try to tackle health care. Although the chances of getting another sweeping legislative program through Congress may be slim, the West Wing is looking into another batch of executive orders—including rolling back more environmental and business regulations—to goose the economy. And conventional political wisdom has rarely applied to Trump, who still has the time, and power, to pull off another comeback.



But Trump himself displays no sign of a course correction. He has defended tariffs that have raised prices on consumers and previewed plans to ratchet up a deportation plan that polls show voters think is too extreme. He shouted his way through an Oval Office address last week meant to be a reset, seemingly trying to browbeat America into believing that he's doing a good job. (He also recently rated the economy “A+++++.”)



And he's eager to show off the designs for the arch that will mark an entrance into Washington and the $400 million ballroom that will be built where the White House's East Wing once stood. Yesterday, he boasted about a new “Trump class” of naval warships that military experts immediately denounced as unnecessary and expensive. He reveled in receiving a “peace prize” from FIFA, the soccer organization, and in hosting the Kennedy Center Honors ceremony. (Next year, he'll surely insist that they be called the Trump-Kennedy Center Honors.) And he proudly showed off the “Walk of Fame” he constructed on the West Wing colonnade, which included insulting assessments of some former presidents (no word yet on what he wrote about Chester A. Arthur) that even some Fox News hosts panned as a childish desecration of a sacred national space.

Trump's preoccupations have only reinforced the perception that he's lost touch (as have the several recent moments in which the 79-year-old president appeared to fall asleep in public). None of this has reassured a Republican Party beginning to eye the midterms with dread. As Trump's poll numbers continue to dip, more Republicans feel that a permission structure has been created for them to occasionally defy the president's wishes. And for the first time, some in the GOP are beginning to consider life after Trump. There are deep divides in the MAGA base—many on full display at the Turning Point USA conference this week—but also a willingness by Vice President J. D. Vance and others to take some (quiet) steps toward inheriting Trump's mantle.

 “No Republican had dared even breathing the word 2028 for fear of triggering Trump,” one close outside adviser told me. “But that's changing. And the quickest way to become a lame duck is to lose your own party.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Claudia Sheinbaum's Impossible Dilemma","https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2025/12/mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-trump/685397/","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

The threat of U.S. strikes on cartels could upend a century of delicate relations with Mexico.

The first 13 recipients of the Pentagon's new Mexican Border Defense Medal squeezed into the Oval Office last week, standing at attention around the Resolute Desk. The awards, issued to soldiers and Marines assisting President Donald Trump's border crackdown, were replicas of military medals given out more than 100 years ago, when American warships shelled the port of Veracruz and General John J. Pershing led U.S. troops into Chihuahua. That was the last time the United States attacked its southern neighbor. The new medals, Trump told the troops, were “a big deal.”

The White House used the ceremony to announce a bigger deal: Trump's designation of the synthetic opioid fentanyl as a “weapon of mass destruction.” The illegal fentanyl tablets sold on American streets are made primarily in clandestine laboratories in Mexico and smuggled across the U.S. border by Mexican trafficking organizations. Now the Trump administration was comparing the drug to a nuclear or chemical threat aimed at the United States.

Fentanyl's record of mass destruction is not in doubt. U.S. health data show that the drug caused about 400,000 fatal overdoses during the past decade, the deadliest mass-addiction crisis in U.S. history. But in calling fentanyl a “weapon,” Trump appeared to further endorse the once-fringe view that Mexico's drug cartels are not profit-seeking Mafias but terrorist organizations, analogous to groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, and therefore worthy of a military response. “There's no doubt that America's adversaries are trafficking fentanyl into the United States in part because they want to kill Americans,” Trump declared. “If this were a war, that would be one of the worst wars.” He has threatened air strikes on cartel sites inside Mexico, labeling its traffickers foreign terrorist organizations.

Trump's invocation of war and his revival of a medal from a long-buried era of American military intervention in Mexico leave Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum in a bind. She has to appease Trump enough to avoid air strikes while firmly standing up for Mexican sovereignty and maintaining her own domestic political support. Now in the second year of her six-year term, she has won widespread praise at home for her coolheaded handling of Trump so far: She has kept trade flowing and tariffs manageable while defusing calls for air strikes on Mexico from MAGA elements who view the country as more of an enemy than an ally. Whether Sheinbaum can hold that balance under increased pressure from the White House will be her key challenge for 2026.

I traveled to Mexico City this month and spoke with members of Sheinbaum's administration, who view the coming year with trepidation. Mexico is preparing to co-host the FIFA World Cup with the United States and Canada at the same time that the three countries are conducting a formal review of the United States–Mexico–Canada trade agreement, reached seven years ago after Trump ripped up its predecessor, NAFTA. Security coordination for the tournament has put more attention on Mexico's crime problems amid the trade negotiations.

“We have a president on the Mexican side who is more interested, much more interested, in cooperating than her predecessor was,” Roberta Jacobson, the former U.S. ambassador to Mexico, told me, referring to former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. “I think she has done an amazing job navigating that minefield.” But treating fentanyl as a terror weapon and traffickers as terrorists converts what has been mostly a public-health and law-enforcement issue into a national-security threat, opening the door to a broader U.S.-military response.

Sheinbaum has drawn a red line at U.S. strikes on Mexican soil and said flatly last month that they “would not happen.” Her government has set other firm limits on what it considers to be nonnegotiable matters, rejecting the possibility of joint operations that would allow armed U.S. forces to embed with Mexican troops, as the United States has done in Colombia and other drug-war theaters. U.S. and Mexican officials I spoke with told me that Sheinbaum has been willing to expand cooperation on almost everything else.

U.S. and Mexican diplomats spent years developing an approach to bilateral relations that sought to compartmentalize traditional sources of tension—trade, migration, water rights, drugs—so that they would not affect other areas. But Trump ditched that framework during his first term, when he threatened to crash the Mexican economy with crippling tariffs as a way to force Mexico to crack down on Central American migrants headed north.

Mexican officials suspect that Trump's talk of terrorism and WMDs is a way to gain leverage in the upcoming trade negotiations. Migration and security are at the top of Trump's agenda, one adviser to Sheinbaum told me, “but the economic issue is always what's really behind it.”

In the trade talks, the United States is seeking to further limit Chinese investment and influence in Mexico, to broaden liberalization of Mexico's energy sector, and to advance a range of other manufacturing-, labor-, and farming-related goals. Mexico surpassed China in 2023 to become the top exporter to the United States, a result of the nearshoring boom led by U.S. manufacturers moving operations out of China. More than 80 percent of Mexico's exports—cars, appliances, fresh produce—now go to the United States, leaving Mexico more dependent than ever on its northern neighbor, and subject to Trump's whims.

Trump threatened Sheinbaum with more tariffs again this month to force Mexico to send more water from its reservoirs to farmers and ranchers in Texas. Sheinbaum moved quickly to appease him. “He's not someone you can confront head-on, because he responds with more force,” the adviser told me. Sheibnaum, he said, “has been very clear about Mexico's position without getting into a conflict.”

The adviser added, “This next year is going to be challenging for Mexico.”

Raúl Benítez Manaut, an expert on U.S.-Mexico security cooperation at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, told me that the CIA, the U.S. military, Homeland Security Investigations, the FBI, and other American agencies have been operating in Mexico with far more latitude than Mexican authorities would like to publicly acknowledge. Polling shows that many Mexicans, especially in the business community, would welcome a more muscular American role in their country, but this remains especially taboo for some members of Sheinbaum's leftist Morena party. “She has to say certain things, for political necessity, to keep her base happy,” Benítez Manaut said. “Not unlike Trump.”

Benítez Manaut said that there would be major risks to air strikes—with or without Mexico's consent—targeting illegal fentanyl production. The cartels have been moving their labs into cities because rural sites can be detected more easily by satellites, sensors, and other tools, he said. They believe that the government would be too worried about collateral damage to carry out a strike in an urban area. And any U.S. operation on Mexican soil would have to be very careful to “avoid hitting civilians,” Benítez Manaut said: “If someone innocent dies—a child, or a cleaning lady—it would be a shitstorm.”

On December 6, a pickup truck packed with explosives blew up outside the police station in Coahuayana, a small town in the state of Michoacán, one of the country's bloodiest cartel battlegrounds. The blast shredded vehicles, knocked down trees, and killed six people, including three officers. Video footage of the site showed a charred blast radius strewn with debris that stretched for a block.

In Mexico, the bomb revived fears that drug-trafficking groups, if squeezed too hard, could begin to act like terrorist organizations in retaliation against the Mexican government. A bombing attack outside a World Cup venue would devastate Mexico and Sheinbaum's government. The senior Mexican officials I spoke with told me that they are eagerly cooperating with the United States to share intelligence to avoid disaster.

Mexico's drug smugglers are under pressure. Trump claims that there has been a huge slowdown in drug trafficking at sea since the U.S. began striking alleged smuggling vessels in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific. The cartels are already contending with the loss of revenue from human smuggling and extortion payments along the U.S.-Mexico border as a result of Trump's border crackdown. In October, handwritten cartel banners known as narcomantas appeared in the tourist resorts of Baja California threatening to kill Americans—signs that suggested a degree of desperation. Fentanyl, which is smuggled mostly by human couriers and vehicles through official crossings along the U.S. border, remains a major profit source for the cartels.

Trump is the first U.S. president to treat drugs as mass-casualty weapons and cartels as terror groups, applying the tools of America's response to the 9/11 terror attacks to the vexing addiction crisis of the past decade. In an effort to draw more attention to soaring drug-overdose rates, public-health advocates calculated that more Americans were dying from opioids than from foreign wars or terror attacks. But the U.S. government had never before used these rhetorical comparisons to create justifications for military attacks.

Trump has said at least 17 times since September that “land strikes” against drug-production sites and other targets will commence “soon,” according to a recent CNN tally. The strikes so far have hit targets at sea near Venezuela. But Trump has said that action will not be limited to Venezuela. “We're going to start hitting them on land, which is a lot easier to do,” the president said during the Oval Office ceremony, calling traffickers “a direct military threat to the United States of America” who are “trying to drug-out our country” in similar fashion to the way China's imperial power was undermined by British-backed opium traders in the 19th century.

Mexico's security cooperation with the United States fell to a low point under López Obrador, who lashed out at the Drug Enforcement Administration after U.S. agents arrested a Mexican general and former defense minister at Los Angeles International Airport and accused him of working with traffickers. López Obrador's denunciations tapped into long-standing resentments toward the DEA as a meddlesome presence that wiretapped whomever it wanted, cut deals with cartel bosses, and interfered in Mexican politics. He ordered Mexico's military to shun the agency.

A senior Mexican official and a senior U.S. official told me separately that cooperation has improved dramatically under Sheinbaum and that U.S. agencies, even the DEA, have regained space. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters in September that “it is the closest security cooperation we have ever had.” Mexico has extradited more than 50 cartel suspects to the United States since February, including Rafael Caro Quintero, one of the DEA's most wanted men. Mexican authorities have worked with the U.S. to seize more of the chemicals used to make fentanyl and other synthetic drugs and to go after the companies, mostly in China, that ship them.

The senior official in Sheinbaum's government told me that “the reality is that there's a lot of cooperation” and that the Trump administration has “been respectful so far about our red lines.”

Sheinbaum and her aides have learned to deal with Trump by separating his political statements and social-media posts from the practical, material matters of what the United States actually wants.

“I don't think they will change their rhetoric, but as long as the actual relationship is good and works between the boundaries on what is acceptable for the two countries, we're fine,” the senior Mexican official told me.

The CIA and the U.S. military are working with Mexico's military, especially its elite marine-commando units, as the United States has done for years, passing along intelligence from informants and wiretaps on the whereabouts of cartel bosses and drug shipments. U.S. drones and surveillance aircraft circle Mexico's skies, hunting drug labs. “The basis of that cooperation is: The U.S. can give us intelligence, but the security forces operating in Mexican territory need to be Mexican forces,” the senior Mexican official said. Officials at the U.S. embassy in Mexico City declined my interview request.

Mexico faces “constant pressure” from Trump officials, the senior Mexican official said: “I don't expect that to change, to be honest. But I do believe that we have found common ground, and I do believe that a lot of people in Washington understand the nuances, the sensitivities, the complexities of the bilateral relation. And they know that doing some sort of strike within Mexican territory, either in the sea, the land, the air, whatever, would cross a line that it would be very difficult to recover from.”

Mexico's navy invited me to visit its command-and-control center in Mexico City, where officials coordinate interdictions with the U.S. Coast Guard and other agencies. The center's commander, Rear Admiral Máximo Rodríguez Villalobos, told me that cooperation between the two countries is “as strong as ever.” Rodríguez Villalobos said that the U.S. Coast Guard asked Mexico to respond to the site in international waters, off Mexico's Pacific Coast, where the U.S. had attacked a suspected drug boat. “We reached the site, but we found no one,” Rodríguez Villalobos said. “There was nothing left.”

In the 1990s, U.S. forces intervened in Colombia, helping its government battle Marxist insurgents and take down drug lords such as Pablo Escobar. I asked the rear admiral if he could envision Mexico embracing a similar approach to Colombia's as a way to avoid U.S. unilateral action, with U.S. agents and troops carrying out joint operations alongside Mexico's security forces. “To arrive at the point Colombia reached at that moment, I don't see it,” he said.

Today, Colombia is producing near-record amounts of cocaine, primarily for the U.S. market. The United States maintains security agreements with Colombia, but in October, the Trump administration decertified the country as a reliable drug-war partner for the first time in nearly 30 years. Trump is now threatening to carry out strikes on suspected drug labs in Colombian territory and trading insults with the leftist President Gustavo Petro.

U.S.-Mexico security cooperation reached a high point in the years after the 2008 Mérida Initiative, when then–Mexican President Felipe Calderón declared war on the country's criminal groups. U.S.-trained Mexican marines worked with the CIA and the DEA to target cartel leaders in daring operations using U.S.-supplied Black Hawk helicopters. The United States spent hundreds of millions of dollars to help reform the Mexican judicial system as part of an effort to prosecute suspected traffickers instead of killing them.

Back then, U.S. officials were the ones encouraging Mexico to gather evidence and build prosecution cases. The work was difficult and often frustrating to both nations, especially when cases were mishandled and cartel suspects went free. Now it's the U.S. government, under Trump, that appears to favor lethal force over prosecution and building institutions that could stand up to the cartels' influence. I asked the rear admiral if Mexico endorsed that approach and if he thought it would be effective.

He considered his words carefully. “Every country has the right to pursue its objectives as it sees fit,” he said.

At the western end of the Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City's stately central artery, the Altar a la Patria, one of the country's most important civic shrines, rises above the tree line of Chapultepec Park. The memorial consists of six white marble columns arranged in a semicircle honoring the Niños Héroes (the “Boy Heroes”)—young cadets killed in 1847 after they refused to surrender to invading American troops. On a recent Sunday morning, bike riders and tourists posed for snapshots under the looming monument while a man on roller skates looped through the crowd, bopping to Shakira songs on his portable speaker.

Mexico's national identity is deeply entwined with this legacy of U.S. conquest and imperial bullying. The United States took half of Mexico's land in the mid-19th century and periodically intervened in the decades that followed to protect American interests. During the past century of mostly good relations, U.S. politicians learned to work with Mexico by navigating this history with tact and respect.

Arturo Sarukhán, who served as Mexico's ambassador to the United States under Calderón and who still lives in Washington, told me that those urging Trump to strike Mexico “really want to send a message” by taking a hammer to those sensitivities. Even a single missile strike on a fentanyl lab could undo a century's worth of diplomacy.

Read: Trump's boat strikes could make the cartel problem worse

Sheinbaum should redouble efforts to prevent such a scenario, Sarukhán said, first by saying definitively that Mexico's cartels—not U.S. imperialism—are the greatest threat to her country's sovereignty. Such a declaration could relaunch security collaboration with the United States along the lines of the Mérida Initiative, he said, including a “boots on the ground” U.S. presence working hand in hand with Mexican forces “under the control of Mexico but in dual coordination with United States authorities.”

“That would be closer to the Colombia model they say they don't want to accept,” Sarukhán said. “But if you really want to defuse the unilateral use of force, the declaration of organized-crime organizations as foreign terrorist organizations, and now fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, I don't see any other way of defanging those in the White House who are itching to drop a missile from a drone onto a lab in Sinaloa.”

The World Cup, Sarukhán said, provides an opportunity for Sheinbaum to manage potential political blowback, especially from her own party, because “what you can do is sort of underscore that you're strengthening border security between Mexico, Canada, and the United States” to protect the games.

That approach, with its emphasis on the regional security of North America, would get the countries back to the framework that has aided decades of economic integration—and to a relationship that most flourishes when it's not too fixated on the past.

The fixation on Greenland once looked eccentric. Now, it seems like the distillation of his whole foreign policy.

2025 is ending much as it began: with President Donald Trump talking about annexing Greenland.

On Sunday, Trump appointed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as a special envoy to Greenland with the goal, as Landry put it, “to make Greenland a part of the US.” Though the territory has been moving gradually toward greater independence, Greenland has been under Danish rule since the 18th century. “We need Greenland for national protection,” Trump told reporters on Monday.

The move provoked a sharp response from the prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland, who said in a joint statement: “National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law. … You cannot annex other countries.” Other European leaders have weighed in, as well, with French President Emmanuel Macron reaffirming that “France's unwavering support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Denmark and Greenland.”

Trump has been talking about either buying or annexing the world's largest island since 2019, during his first term. He brought up the issue again last January, when he raised alarm in European capitals by refusing to rule out using military force to take the territory if necessary. But, while he once described control of Greenland as an “absolute necessity” for US national security, the issue had been on the back burner for most of this year until Landry's appointment, with the exception of occasional flare-ups over alleged US influence operations targeting the island.

Trump's Greenland fixation had once seemed somewhat random. Danish leaders initially hoped it was a joke. But after a year of seeing Trump's second term foreign policy in action — particularly the recent release of his administration's National Security Strategy (NSS) — the Greenland gambit now seems to actually serve his broader goals. It makes a lot more sense in the context of the president's surprisingly activist vision of America's role in the world.

Greenland fits into the administration's heavy focus on the Western Hemisphere and what the NSS calls the “Trump corollary to the Monroe Doctrine” to “deny non-Hemispheric competitors the ability to position forces or other threatening capabilities, or to own or control strategically vital assets, in our Hemisphere.”

Explaining Greenland's security importance on Monday, Trump said, “If you look up and down the coast of Greenland, you can see Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.” It's true that the Arctic is increasingly becoming an area of strategic competition, as melting ice makes it more accessible, and that China and Russia have been building up military and commercial assets in the region, though neither has done so particularly close to Greenland.

But having Greenland under the control of a friendly European government is no comfort to this White House. 

Critics routinely point out that Greenland's strategic importance is not an argument for actually controlling it. The US already has a military base in Greenland, and the Danes have made clear they're not opposed to an expanded US military presence. The Danish government has, in the past, blocked Chinese commercial interests in Greenland, in part out of a desire to maintain good relations with Washington.

But having Greenland under the control of a friendly European government is no comfort to this White House. In the worldview laid out in the NSS, liberal European governments are viewed as a threat to American interests on par with if not greater than China and Russia. In a recent interview, Vice President JD Vance even questioned whether European governments with “destructive moral ideas” could be trusted with nuclear weapons.

The NSS calls for promoting “patriotic” (i.e., right-wing) parties in Europe, and an earlier draft reportedly called for urging countries to pull away from the European Union. An effort to peel away strategically important territory close to North America from European control is very much in keeping with this effort.

As political scientist Abraham Newman recently told Vox, Trump's territorial threats against Greenland and other US neighbors like Canada are very much in keeping with a “neo-royalist” worldview, which rejects the notion that all countries have equal sovereignty. “It's about dominance, about saying [to Canada and Denmark], ‘You are not equal to us,'” Newman said.

The seemingly unusual appointment of Landry — who has little foreign policy experience and is staying in office as governor of Louisiana as he takes on this new role — is also in keeping with a Trump diplomatic approach that is more often conducted through a semi-formal network of allies and loyalists, rather than through the traditional US foreign policy bureaucracy. An old friend of Trump's, the cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, may have been the one who initially planted the idea of controlling Greenland in his head.

Finally, Trump may have said this week that US interest in Greenland is “not for its minerals,” but it's been widely reported that Lauder and other Trump associates have been working to sell him on the potential riches beneath Greenland's soil. Greenland is believed to have large deposits of oil, as well as a variety of minerals, including the rare earth elements that China currently has a near monopoly over. If nothing else, the events of this year have driven home the fact that US options on China policy are limited as long as that monopoly continues.

Again, US companies can exploit these resources (and to some extent, they already are) without Greenland actually being part of the US. But under Trump, the US has taken a stake in foreign chip sales, tied diplomacy in Ukraine to minerals concessions, and made retaking Venezuelan oil fields an explicit aim of the US military build-up targeting that country. The line between commercial interests and security goals is far more porous under this administration than it has been in the past.

The US actually taking control of Greenland still seems like an extreme long shot. There's little indication that Greenlanders want to join this US or will be swayed by Landry's charm offensive.

But, as a campaign to take control of a mineral rich region pushed by his business partners and carried out by his ideological allies while cementing American dominance in the Western Hemisphere and undermining European sovereignty in the process, it feels today less like an eccentric deviation for Trump's foreign policy than a neat distillation of it.

﻿Social media bans don't have to be just for children.

It was the last day of school before winter break, and Aiden and his eighth-grade classmates were playing a game of Mafia. After the first round, though, one of Aiden's friends got bored and quit playing.

Another friend called him a “screenager,” Aiden recalled — “like, your attention span is so short.”

The incident was an example of a larger trend, Aiden, one of several Scholastic Kid Reporters I talked to for this story, told me: “People are less likely to have fun and enjoy being around other people, and they prefer being around technology.”

Five years ago, the national conversation about young people and social media was dominated by worries about cyberbullying, online harassment, and body image. Today, the biggest fear among teens and adults alike is, arguably, brainrot: the idea that social media sites, especially short-form video platforms like TikTok, have eroded young people's ability to pay attention to anything for longer than a few seconds.

But as much as users of all ages seem to agree that the rise of short-form video creates problems for young people and for society, few agree on a solution. Social media bans like the one that took effect in Australia earlier this month have been met with optimism in some quarters, but many are skeptical.

“It's not going to work,” said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and a professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University. “Youth are going to circumvent them.”

If anything, the shift to short-form video is a reminder of how difficult it is for parents and policymakers to keep up with shifts in young people's digital lives, and how hard it can be to solve or even identify problems arising from a technology as ubiquitous and ever-changing as social media.

It's not your imagination: Young people today are spending an increasing amount of time watching short videos on their phones. Among kids ages 0 to 8, viewing on platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts jumped from an average of 1 minute in 2020 to 14 minutes in 2024, according to Common Sense Media, with older kids likely posting higher numbers.

Like any media, these videos vary in quality, but they have elicited special concern from parents and researchers alike. One recent review of research on short-form video found an association between consumption of such content and poorer cognitive performance, especially in the areas of attention and inhibitory control.

Rapid-fire videos get young people “habituated to short content,” said Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at University of California Irvine and author of the book Attention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness, and Productivity. “They don't have the cognitive stamina to be able to spend longer time on material.”

Educators routinely complain that students no longer have the attention span to read a book or listen to a lecture. “I've had to adjust how I cover material across, let's say, a three-hour class,” Hinduja said.

These complaints are largely anecdotal, but they're echoed by young people themselves. “Attention span has decreased so much with the short-form content,” Evy, 13, told me. “If you don't like the video, then you just scroll until you get another one.”

While most people agree that the proliferation of little videos is a problem, few agree on a solution. Australia's new law, which supporters hope will combat loss of attention span as well as bullying and other issues, requires platforms like YouTube and TikTok to screen out users under 16. But teens quickly fled to platforms like Yope and Lemon8 that weren't covered by the initial ban, leading some to fear an endless game of “whack-a-mole” as new options pop up to replace banned ones.

School cellphone bans, which have gotten a lot of positive press in the US, have generated their own version of whack-a-mole, young people told me. Aiden's school in Los Angeles instituted a ban last year, and now he notices more students playing sports at lunch, he said.

But when deprived of their phones, kids also started spending more time on their laptops, Aiden said. “They would find their way back to technology.”

Experts are also concerned that bans like the one in Australia will keep kids from marginalized groups, like LGBTQ+ youth, from connecting with one another or finding resources. “It's going to keep youth from access to certain information that could benefit them,” Hinduja said.

Every adult with a smartphone knows that scrolling often feels bad — but translating that feeling into clear and actionable policy, and especially targeting that policy at young people, has proved extraordinarily difficult. There's not even conclusive research showing that social media is bad for mental health, Mark said, in part because it's so hard to separate social media's effects from the impacts of every other aspect of modern life.

But talking to kids about their phones did drive one point home to me: Their relationships with social media aren't all that different from ours. They derive some pleasure from watching videos they like; Aiden mentioned sports highlights, for example. But they spend more time on their phones than they want to, and they're looking for ways to cut down.

“When you first start out, you're happy,” Xander, 13, told me. “But when you get off, you're, like, drained, because you think, I could have been doing so many better things than scrolling on my phone.”

The most effective reforms, then, might be those that apply to us all of us — not just teens or children. Instead of age-based bans, some experts recommend more across-the-board reforms of social media platforms, like stronger harassment-reporting mechanisms or restrictions on targeted ads.

Leyla, 12, offered an even more radical solution: banning infinite scroll. “I would definitely hate if scrolling got taken away, because I do like to scroll, but it's definitely going to get people less addicted,” she said. In fact, just such a ban has been proposed in the past, by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley.

Such across-the-board changes would be harder for teens to circumvent than age restrictions, and would also benefit all of us. After all, little videos mess with our brains too.

In the absence of legislation, kids, like adults, have tried various tricks to wean themselves off their phones. When Aiden and fellow Kid Reporter Sara asked their classmates about strategies for curbing phone use, one said, “I set a 15-minute restraint on YouTube and Instagram each day to keep me in check.” Another added, “Before I watched YouTube while doing homework. Now I give my phone to my parents while I do my work.”

Xander had advice any psychologist would approve of: “Take a walk, go to the gym, go to the library, do something productive,” he said. “The main reason why most people get on their phones is because they have nothing to do.”

And when asked how parents could help, Aiden offered a hard truth: “It's important for them to not use social media as much. For them to not always be on their phone to set an example for their kids.”

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The U.S. economy expanded more than economists expected, the Commerce Department said in a government shutdown-delayed report.

Here's what to know:

Stock futures and Treasury yields were little changed Wednesday morning after the S&P 500 hit another record as investors shook off concerns that stronger-than-expected GDP growth would chill the Fed's plans to lower interest rates. Tech stocks like Alphabet, Nvidia, Broadcom and Amazon buoyed the market.

Precious metals held onto their luster, continuing a record rally. Across the pond, BP agreed to sell a 65% stake in its lubricants business Castrol to Stonepeak for $6 billion, months after the oil giant sought a buyer for the unit.

U.S. stock markets will close at 1 p.m. ET for Christmas Eve, while bond markets are set to close at 2 p.m.

The Trump administration said it will start garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers in default in early January. It would mark the first time student borrowers' paychecks have been at risk since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, when collections were halted.

Starting the week of Jan. 7, the Education Department expects around 1,000 defaulted student loan borrowers to receive notices of administrative wage garnishment, a spokesperson said. More than 5 million student loan borrowers are currently in default, the Education Department said earlier this year.

The U.S. plans to increase tariffs on Chinese semiconductor imports in June 2027, the Trump administration said in a Federal Register filing. Until then, the initial tariff rate on semiconductor imports from China will be zero for 18 months, according to the filing from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

The agency said in an investigation that started a year ago that China is engaging in unfair trade practices in the industry. The decision to delay new tariffs for at least 18 months signals that the Trump administration is seeking to cool any trade hostilities between the U.S. and China.

Enterprise software giant ServiceNow will acquire cybersecurity startup Armis in a cash deal valued at $7.75 billion, part of a plan to boost its cybersecurity capabilities in the age of artificial intelligence.

""ServiceNow will have the only AI control tower that drives workflow, action and business outcomes across all of these environments,"" CEO Bill McDermott told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""

Self-driving in the dark? We're getting there. Alphabet-owned Waymo said it's updating its fleet so its vehicles are better prepared to respond during future outages, days after a blackout in San Francisco caused Waymo to pause its driverless car service.

European leaders on Wednesday condemned a move by the U.S. to ban visas for five individuals — including a former EU commissioner — for alleged censorship.

The Trump administration imposed visa bans on Thierry Breton, a former European Union commissioner behind the Digital Services Act (DSA), and four anti-disinformation campaigners, accusing them of censoring U.S. social media platforms.

""The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.

The DSA forces tech giants like Google and Meta to police illegal content more aggressively, or face hefty fines.

Rubio added that ""these radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states—in each case targeting American speakers and American companies."" 

As such, their entry to the U.S. has ""potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences,"" he said. 

""Based on these determinations, the Department has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on agents of the global censorship-industrial complex who, as a result, will be generally barred from entering the United States."" 

Breton, who served as EU commissioner between 2019 and 2024, wrote on X: ""Is McCarthy's witch hunt back?""

He added: ""As a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA."" 

""To our American friends: ""Censorship isn't where you think it is."" 

The European Commission ""strongly condemned"" the move on Wednesday. 

""Freedom of expression is a fundamental right in Europe and a shared core value with the United States across the democratic world,"" it said in a statement, adding that ""the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.""

""Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination."" 

The Commission has asked for clarifications from U.S. authorities, it said. 

""Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy,"" said current EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on X. ""We are proud of it. We will protect it.""

French President Emmanuel Macron said that his country condemns the visa restrictions. ""These measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,"" he said in a statement on X. 

""The European Union's digital regulations were adopted following a democratic and sovereign process by the European Parliament and the Council.""

He also said that the DSA does not target any specific third country but is designed ""to ensure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online.""

It comes as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors and criticizes Europe. 

Rubio did not identify who his department had taken action against, however Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers later did so on X. 

Josephine Ballon, the co-leader of HateAid who serves on Germany's Advisory Council of the Digital Services, was among those working on anti-disinformation campaigns to receive sanctions. Her co-leader Anna-Lena von Hodenberg was also affected. CNBC has reached out to Ballon and Von Hodenberg for comment.

The bans are part of efforts to enforce what Rogers refers to as a ""red line"" for the U.S. and the ""extraterritorial censorship of Americans."" 

In an interview with GB news on Dec. 4, Rogers took aim at the U.K.'s Online Safety Act (OSA), saying the law was being applied extraterritorially, accounting for U.S. citizens' speech about U.S. politics on U.S.-based platforms.

Europe's DSA and the U.K.'s OSA are among only a handful of pieces of legislation designed to keep the power of Big Tech in check and improve safety for children online. OSA law requires age verification on adult sites and a number of other platforms.

Britain's BP has agreed to sell a 65% shareholding in lubricants business Castrol to Stonepeak for $6 billion, months on from the oil giant seeking a buyer for the unit.

The deal comes as the company looks to launch a strategic reset, including a green strategy U-turn and the divestment of $20 billion of assets by the end of 2027. The sale values Castrol at $10.1 billion.

Energy companies, including India's Reliance Industries and Saudi Arabia's oil behemoth Aramco, as well as private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Lone Star Funds, had all been touted as suitors for BP's Castrol unit in May, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.

""With this, we have now completed or announced over half of our targeted $20bn divestment programme, with proceeds to significantly strengthen bp's balance sheet,"" interim CEO Carol Howle said in a statement.

""The sale marks an important milestone in the ongoing delivery of our reset strategy. We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses, and accelerating delivery of our plan.""

BP has the option to sell its remaining 35% stake in Castrol after a two-year lock-up period.

The Castrol majority stake sale comes days on from the oil giant announcing it was appointing a new CEO — it's fourth in six years.

Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill will take up the role on April 1, replacing Murray Auchincloss, who lasted less than two years in the role.

Stephen Isaacs, strategic advisor at Alvine Capital, which holds a position in BP, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" last week that while BP has been ""a very poor performer for a long, long time,"" the CEO change could be ""the last piece of the jigsaw"" in getting its house in order.

""I think there'll be further stake sales of different parts of BP"" going forward, Dan Boardman-Weston, CEO at BRI Wealth Management, told CNBC on Wednesday. The shift will see the company ""getting back to their bread and butter of focusing on oil and gas exploration and development.""

The London-listed company has underperformed compared with its peers in recent times, having reported declining annual profits in both 2023 and 2024.

BP's shares opened at 1.3% on Wednesday before paring gains slightly to last trade 0.9% higher. Its share price is up around 9% so far this year, following a 15.7% drop in 2024. Pressure on the stock eased in 2025 following a leadership shakeup, a cost-cutting program, and a string of oil discoveries.

In this article

Japan's Sapporo Holdings will sell its real estate business to global private equity firm KKR and Asia-based alternative investment firm PAG, the companies said in joint statement on Wednesday.

Sapporo said the enterprise value of the deal, which includes debt, was 477 billion yen (about $3 billion).

The company's real estate holdings include the Yebisu Garden Place in Tokyo, a popular tourist destination that consists of the Yebisu Brewery as well as fine dining and shopping options. 

Known for its beer brewing business, Sapporo is looking to concentrate management resources on its core operations, and plans to use the funds generated from the sale to invest in its beer business and other areas. 

""Sapporo Holdings will focus on and further strengthen its alcoholic beverages business, where it has competitive advantages,"" the statement said. Proceeds from the sale will also be reinvested into initiatives to strengthen customer touchpoints and expand offerings such as healthier beverage choices

The company's shares closed 3.7% higher following the announcement, while KKR stock was slightly lower in after-hours trading.

""We are pleased to collaborate with PAG to support the Company's next stage of growth, and look forward to sharing our global network, investment experience and deep operational expertise in development, operations, and hospitality across KKR's global platform,"" said Hiro Hirano, CEO of KKR Japan.

Back in October, Nikkei reported that the company had granted preferential negotiating rights to KKR and PAG, only to end exclusive talks the next month. 

The report said the two sides were unable to agree on the sale price of the real estate business, as the properties in the portfolio ""required significant and costly repairs due to aging facilities and the necessary implementation of safety measures.""

At that time, Sapporo had opened the sale to other buyers and was reportedly approaching a consortium made up of private equity funds Lone Star Funds and real estate fund manager Kenedix.

Three days after a blackout in San Francisco caused Waymo to pause its driverless car service, the Alphabet-owned company said it's updating its fleet so its vehicles are better prepared to respond during future outages. 

""We've always focused on developing the Waymo Driver for the world as it is, including when infrastructure fails,"" the company said in a blog post late Tuesday. 

Power outages began early afternoon on Saturday in San Francisco and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power. PG&E said a fire at a substation resulted in ""significant and   extensive"" damage.

With stoplights and traffic signals not functioning, the city was hit with widespread gridlock. Videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in various neighborhoods. 

""We directed our fleet to pull over and park appropriately so we could return vehicles to our depots in waves,"" Waymo said in Tuesday's blog post. ""This ensured we did not further add to the congestion or obstruct emergency vehicles during the peak of the recovery effort.""

San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in an update on X Saturday evening that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods.

Waymo said that it's analyzing the event, and is taking three ""immediate steps."" 

The first involves ""fleet-wide updates"" to give vehicles ""more context about regional outages,"" so cars can take more decisive actions at intersections. The company said it's also improving its ""emergency response protocols,"" and is coordinating with Mayor Lurie's team in San Francisco to better collaborate in emergency preparedness. Finally, Waymo said it's updating its first responder training ""as we discover learnings from this and other widespread events."" 

In addition to the Bay Area, Waymo currently serves paid rides to the public in and around Austin, Texas, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles. The company recently crossed an estimated 450,000 weekly paid rides, and said in December it had served 14 million trips in 2025, putting it on pace to end the year at more than 20 million trips total since launching in 2020.

""Backed by 100M+ miles of fully autonomous driving experience and a record of improving road safety, we are undaunted by the opportunity to challenge the status quo of our roads, and we're proud to continue serving San Franciscan residents and visitors,"" the company said in Tuesday's blog.

The S&P 500 rose to a new all-time high on Wednesday after notching a record close in the prior trading day.

The broad market index was last up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 289 points, or 0.6%. 

Nike was among the day's winners, advancing 4% after Apple CEO Tim Cook disclosed he bought shares in the apparel maker. Micron Technology and Citigroup were other standouts, with shares up 3% and almost 2%, respectively, and both hitting fresh highs during the session.

Stocks were coming off a winning session, led by tech names including Google parent Alphabet, Nvidia, Broadcom and Amazon. The S&P 500 posted a fresh record close of 6,909.79 on Tuesday.

Those moves came after the Commerce Department issued its a third-quarter reading of the U.S. gross domestic product that came in at 4.3%, surpassing the Dow Jones consensus estimate of 3.2%.The report, which had been delayed by the government shutdown, initially led traders to lower their expectations of interest rate cuts early next year. However, fed funds futures trading still indicates two rate cuts by the end of 2026, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

Investors continue to hope for the coveted Santa Claus rally, a year-end stock market surge that occurs between the last five trading days of the year and the first two of the new year. This year, that's from the opening bell on Dec. 24 until Jan. 5.

Thomas Martin of Globalt Investments anticipates a ""quiet"" period through the end of the year due to lower trading volume. As of 12:55 p.m., ET the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust had traded just 27.9 million shares — the 30-day average volume stands above 86 million, according to FactSet. However, Martin believes there's still some bias to the upside — enough for the S&P 500 to reach the 7,000 level.

""Could it be up 1% or 2% before the end of the year? Sure, that's sort of standard,"" the senior portfolio manager said to CNBC, noting that the market is already at record levels. ""Do I expect an eye-popping kind of rally? No, because I don't really think we're going to get any news that's going to do that.""

The New York Stock Exchange will close early on Wednesday at 1 p.m. ET on Christmas Eve and will be closed Thursday for Christmas Day.

The artificial intelligence trade got tougher in 2025.

While a significant capital expenditure cycle and earnings growth from the world's biggest tech companies supported the market's rally to record heights — with the S&P 500 to jumping more than 17% and the Nasdaq Composite gaining 22% year to date — the easy gains are over.

A bifurcation emerged in the latter half of the year as fears of elevated valuations, macroeconomic headwinds and an emerging AI bubble took the reins, leading to volatile trading periods. Along with this came several new investment areas, with some new winners and surprising laggards.

Among the ""Magnificent Seven,"" Alphabet and Nvidia came out on top, while Amazon and Apple underperformed. Investors paid more attention to companies supporting the buildout of AI infrastructure and are looking to see more tangible results from the technology in the year ahead.

Jeremy Siegel, Wharton professor emeritus and WisdomTree chief economist, expects tempered gains for the S&P 500 next year, potentially ranging between 5% and 10%.

""Although the S&P 500 might not do as well the last two or three years, an equal-weighted or median stock performance might do better in 2026 than we've seen in a long time,"" he said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street,"" adding that smaller companies are trading at valuations he considers ""cheap in today's world.""

— Pia Singh

Nvidia has been the biggest infrastructure winner in the artificial intelligence boom, soaring in value by almost thirteenfold since the end of 2022 to a market cap of $4.6 trillion.

While Nvidia's rally continued in 2025, investors betting on other AI data center plays made a lot more money over the past 12 months.

With four of the biggest technology companies projecting collective expenditures of $380 billion on data center and infrastructure build-outs this year, followed by an expected increase in the coming years, Wall Street has poured money into an assortment of vendors that are poised to reap the rewards.

Makers of memory, storage, fiber-optic cables, central processors and other types of enterprise hardware have rocketed in valued this year, driven by excitement around the AI craze. Read more.

The S&P 500 rose about 0.2% on Wednesday morning to reach 6,921.42, a new all-time intraday high.

If the index were to score a record close, that would be its 39th of the year.

Wednesday's move puts the index's week-to-date and month-to-date gains at roughly 1%. It has also surged more than 17% in 2025.

— Sean Conlon, Nick Wells

Gold and silver prices hit yet another all-time intraday high, doing so for the third time this week on Wednesday.

Gold futures scored a new intraday high of $4,555.1 per ounce, pacing for their 54th record close this year. Silver futures notched a new intraday high of $72.75 per ounce and was on track for their 17th record close year to date.

— Sean Conlon, Gina Francolla

The three major averages began Wednesday's shortened trading session little changed.

The S&P 500 traded just below the flatline shortly after 9:30 a.m. ET. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 53 points, or 0.1%.

— Sean Conlon

The S&P 500 was just inches away from its record intraday high heading into the opening bell on Wednesday.

The broad-based index was 0.15% below its record of 6,920.34. This comes as the index has risen 1.1% week to date, putting its year-to-date gains at about 17.5%.

— Sean Conlon

Jobless claims for the prior weekly period were less than anticipated.

Initial filings for the week ended Dec. 20 totaled 214,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. That's down 10,000 from the previous week's 224,000 and below the 225,000 that economists polled by Dow Jones had forecast.

Citi's list of stocks that could show impressive returns — while maintaining low volatility — in the next year includes Cboe Global Markets, Micron Technology and First Solar.

In a recent note to clients, a team of Citi analysts led by Drew Pettit shared their positive return on equity trend basket. Pettit noted that stocks in this basket have a superior Sharpe ratio, which measures a stock's risk-adjusted return. He added that this outperformance has persisted despite influences from global events and macro changes.

""Forward earnings multiples indicate that Good ROE is trading at a discount to Bad ROE. This discount, combined with expectations for greater margin expansion and top-line acceleration, keeps us constructive on Good ROE,"" Pettit wrote. ""Investors should consider Good versus Bad ROE as a fundamental momentum trade that is not directly correlated to Growth or AI.""

There's one reason why the Federal Reserve cut its overnight benchmark rate this month even though economic growth remains strong, according to Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. 

""They've done so because they've become increasingly concerned about the weakness in payroll employment growth,"" he said in a note. ""We aren't convinced that lowering interest rates can address weak employment growth, given the underlying reasons. One is a skills mismatch in the labor market, particularly for young entrants, so employers aren't finding all the folks they'd like to hire. Additionally, AI is exacerbating the problem by enabling employers to increase the productivity of their current employees.""

Alphabet-backed fleet management software company Motive on Tuesday filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""MTVE.""

The move puts Motive, which previously operated under the name Keep Truckin, among a fast-growing group of tech companies looking to go public in 2026. Anthropic, OpenAI and SpaceX have all reportedly considered making their shares widely available for trading next year.

Motive is smaller, reporting a $62.7 million net loss on $115.8 million in revenue in the third quarter. The loss widened from $41.3 million in the same quarter of 2024, while revenue grew about 23% year over year. The company is backed by Alphabet's GV, Base10 Partners, Greenoaks, Index Ventures, Kleiner Perkins and Scale Venture Partners. More here.

LONDON — European markets closed mixed on Wednesday as investors took stock of the volatile year during Christmas Eve's shortened trading session. 

The pan-European Stoxx 600 finished just below the flatline, with major bourses mixed before Wednesday's early close at 12.30 p.m. in London (7:30 a.m. ET).

The benchmark reached a new record closing high on Tuesday, buoyed by Copenhagen-listed Novo Nordisk's booming share price after it gained FDA approval for the first-ever GLP-1 pill. Novo Nordisk's share price continued to climb on Wednesday, closing the session 9.2% higher.

French pharmaceutical company Sanofi on Tuesday announced it will acquire U.S. company Dynavax in a deal worth $2.2 billion. Dynavax has a marketed adult hepatitis B vaccine and a shingles vaccine candidate in the works. Sanofi shares finished 0.3% lower.

Sportswear brand Puma was among Wednesday's movers as its share price fell 1.6%. The German firm announced a 500-million-euro bridge loan and 108 million euros in credit on Dec. 18, and was the subject of takeover rumors earlier this month. Its stock is down over 50% year-to-date.

Gold and silver futures were on a tear this week, having hit fresh highs during both Monday and Tuesday's trading sessions. On Wednesday, they were last seen trading at $4,521.90 per ounce and $72.365 per ounce, respectively.

Thierry Breton, a former European Union commissioner behind the Digital Services Act, and anti-disinformation campaigners received visa bans from the U.S. for allegedly censoring U.S. social media platforms. It comes as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors and criticizes Europe. 

""For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose. The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X, though he did not identify anyone. Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers later identified the five people affected.

Elsewhere, Asia-Pacific markets traded mostly higher as several indexes are set to close early because of the Christmas Eve holiday. U.S. stock futures traded near the flatline overnight despite the S&P 500 also notching a record close.

Gold ⁠prices edged lower on Wednesday, taking a breather after surging past the key $4,500-an-ounce mark earlier ‍in the session, while ‍silver and platinum ‍trimmed some gains following their record-breaking rally.

Spot gold was down 0.4% at $4,468.96 per ounce, after marking a record high ‌of $4,525.18 ‌earlier in the session.

U.S. gold futures for ​February delivery fell 0.2% to $4,497.90.

The gold market is seeing some chart consolidation and mild profit-taking after record highs, said senior analyst at Kitco Metals Jim Wyckoff.

Gold tends to do ⁠well in a low-interest-rate environment and thrives during periods of uncertainty.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he wants the next Federal Reserve chair to lower interest rates if markets are doing well. The U.S. central bank has cut rates three times this year and currently traders are pricing two rate cuts next year.

On the geopolitical front, the U.S. Coast Guard is waiting for additional forces to arrive before potentially attempting to board and seize a Venezuela-linked oil tanker it has been pursuing since Sunday, a U.S. official told Reuters.

Silver hit an all-time high of $72.70 but was last down 0.8% ‍at $70.86 an ounce.

""The next upside target for gold market is $4,600/oz and ‌for silver is $75/oz by the end of the year. ⁠The technicals remain bullish,"" Wyckoff added.

Silver prices have surged 147% year-to-date on strong fundamentals, outpacing bullion's gain of over 70% ‍during the same period.

Platinum peaked at $2,377.50 before paring gains to stand 3.3% lower at $2,198.30. Palladium was down 9% at $1,692.43 an ounce, retreating after touching its highest in three years earlier.

Platinum and palladium, primarily used in automotive catalytic converters to reduce emissions, are up about 160% ⁠and more than 100%, respectively, year-to-date, on ‌tight mine supply, tariff uncertainty, and a rotation from gold investment demand.

In this article

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy could see how dramatically artificial intelligence was altering e-commerce.

In June, he told employees that AI agents will start to infiltrate aspects of everyday life, ""from shopping to travel to daily chores and tasks.""

Four months later, Jassy said on an earnings call that Amazon expects to partner with third-party agents, and has engaged in conversations with some providers, though he didn't offer names.

Now, Amazon is looking to hire a leader in corporate development to help forge strategic partnerships in areas including ""agentic commerce,"" according to a recent job posting.

Amazon's rapid evolution in its view of AI-powered commerce underscores how quickly online retail is changing, and the risks the company faces if it doesn't act aggressively to maintain control over its future.

The company has watched as OpenAI, Google, Perplexity and Microsoft have released a flurry of e-commerce agents in recent months that aim to change how people shop. Instead of visiting Amazon, Walmart or Nike directly, consumers could rely on AI agents to do the hard work of scanning the web for the best deal or perfect product, then buy the item without exiting a chatbot window. 

The first shopping agents from AI leaders were released about a year ago. Consulting firm McKinsey projected that agentic commerce could generate $1 trillion in U.S. retail revenue by 2030. 

It's a trend that poses a threat to Amazon's margins and relationships with customers. When a consumer uses ChatGPT to initiate a purchase, for example, OpenAI collects ""a small fee"" from each transaction. 

""With an agent on ChatGPT, retailers risk relinquishing transactions on their site to pay a toll on someone else's highway for the same transaction,"" Sucharita Kodali, a retail analyst at Forrester, said in an interview. 

Some companies are trying to find a middle ground between working with agent providers and competing against them. Walmart, Shopify and others have adopted a frenemy strategy, announcing partnerships with AI companies while continuing to develop their own tools and setting guardrails around how agents can access their sites.

Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke wrote in a post on X on Tuesday that his company is ""building all the layers of infrastructure to power a new cambrian explosion of creativity in shopping.""

""I'm really really excited about Agentic Commerce,"" Lutke wrote. ""There is so much amazing stuff being built. Everything I test just feels delightful and right.""

Amazon has so far been playing defense. 

The company recently updated the code underpinning its website to block external AI agents from crawling it, part of an effort to wall off its valuable training data from rivals. As of Tuesday, Amazon had blocked 47 bots, including those from all the major AI companies, according to its website. 

Amazon has even taken the matter to court. In November, Amazon sued Perplexity over an agent in the startup's Comet browser that allows it to make purchases on a user's behalf. The company alleged Perplexity took steps to ""conceal"" its agents so they could continue to scrape Amazon's website without its approval. 

Perplexity called the lawsuit a ""bully tactic."" 

Meanwhile, Amazon is investing heavily in its own AI products. The company released a shopping chatbot called Rufus last February, and has been testing an agent called Buy For Me, which can purchase products from other sites directly in Amazon's e-commerce app.

Morgan Stanley expects that by 2030, nearly half of American shoppers will use AI agents and the technology could add up to $115 billion in U.S. e-commerce spending. 

""We believe agentic commerce — in effect the ability to have a personal digital interactive shopper — is set to be the best next substantial GenAI-enabled unlock,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a report in November. 

They noted that a mid-single-digit percentage of consumers currently start their ""purchase journey"" through AI, but that could increase over time as roughly 40% to 50% of Americans currently use AI for product research. 

Traffic from AI chatbots to U.S. retail sites has surged in recent months, especially during the holiday season, but research suggests Google search still performs better in terms of conversion rate and revenue per session.

AI-powered shopping remains a nascent market. 

OpenAI's Instant Checkout tool, launched in ChatGPT in September, is only available for some products sold by Walmart, Shopify, Target and Etsy. Users can only purchase one item at a time, and they can't connect loyalty memberships like Walmart+. 

Agents are also prone to glitches. 

Scot Wingo, founder of e-commerce software startup ReFiBuy, recently tested Perplexity's Instant Buy tool that lets users purchase items directly in its search engine. 

Wingo tried to purchase a cable-knit sweater from Abercrombie & Fitch, but Perplexity's agent repeatedly spit out error messages, even though both products were in stock on the retailer's website. He eventually gave up.

Earlier this month, Wingo was searching for a coffee machine on ChatGPT when it suggested a Breville espresso maker. When he clicked on the product, he was surprised to see an image of a garden rake.  

""These crawlers go out, they pull in this data and you never know exactly what they're going to get,"" Wingo said. 

As Amazon contemplates its next move with shopping agents, it's quietly allowing them to access some of its properties.   

Subsidiaries like shoe seller Zappos, fashion site Shopbop and deals site Woot don't appear to have any language blocking agents in their robots.txt files, which dictate how crawlers can access specific webpages.

""A lot of times they'll use the subsidiaries to experiment,"" Wingo said. ""Zappos has its own experience and database, so it's not like they're letting all the horses out of the barn."" 

The company could ultimately take a page from its rivals if it decides to let agents access its primary e-commerce platform. Shopify and Walmart have set boundaries around what external shopping agents can and can't do on their sites. 

Amazon may be willing to let agents access its catalog, but it likely wants to protect more valuable data from its competitors, Wingo said, such as its vast trove of customer reviews and sales rankings, both of which indicate a product's quality and can help improve an AI chatbot's answers. 

""Those are probably the two most proprietary data points that if I'm Amazon, I want to protect,"" Wingo said.

Amazon isn't giving up on its homegrown tools. 

Rufus' capabilities have improved since Amazon first launched it last year, and the company has been surfacing the chatbot across more areas of its site to drive user adoption. 

Amazon recently added a feature where Rufus can auto-buy items on a Prime shopper's behalf once they hit a certain price. The chatbot now also suggests products from sites across the web, not just on Amazon.

Amazon also began testing a feature in recent weeks that allows Rufus to create custom shopping guides, similar to OpenAI's ""shopping research"" tool launched last month.

""Instead of the innovator's dilemma, I would say Amazon is in what I would call the leader's dilemma,"" said Jordan Berke, founder and CEO of retail consulting firm Tomorrow. ""Their market share is so significant that they have the most to lose.""

Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) moved roughly 2,000 bitcoin BTC$87,328.09, worth about $174 million, through a series of wallets a day after it was reported to have increased its holdings to 11,542 BTC.

The transfers routed the bitcoin across multiple addresses, with around $12 million ultimately reaching Coinbase Prime Custody, according to blockchain data tracked by CoinDesk on Arkham.

The remainder is held in other wallets that appear to be linked to the same entity, suggesting a reshuffle of reserves rather than a one-way move toward an exchange.

The activity does not, on its own, signal a sale. Coinbase Prime Custody is a storage product designed for institutions, and custody transfers can reflect treasury operations like reorganizing cold storage or consolidating wallets. Assets in custody can remain parked there for long periods without being traded.

The timing is notable, coming one day after blockchain tracker Lookonchain said the company bought 451 BTC, implying Trump Media, the owner of the Truth Social social-media platform, is actively managing its bitcoin position rather than leaving it static.

Corporate holders often move assets between wallets for operational reasons, particularly after new purchases, internal policy changes, or custodial transitions.

Bitcoin's price showed little immediate reaction to the movement. The token traded near $86,000 to $87,000 in the past 24 hours, a range that has held even as broader crypto sentiment has softened into year-end.

Traders have been watching flows and positioning closely, with recent market action showing bitcoin struggling to hold key psychological levels above $90,000.

The onchain transfers also come as Trump Media's equity has rallied. The shares are up more than 30% over the past five trading days, according to Google Finance, trading around $14. The move has coincided with renewed attention on the company's strategy beyond social media, including its push into financial products and digital assets.

Bitcoin BTC$87,328.09 has spent virtually all of December locked between $85,000 and $90,000, while U.S. equities rallied and gold hit all-time highs. That's left bitcoin investors frustrated, and the explanation lies in derivatives mechanics.

Now, those same mechanics indicate that the largest cryptocurrency could be making a break toward the high end of the range. The more likely outcome after expiry is an upside resolution toward the mid $90,000s rather than a sustained break below $85,000. 

The key driver has been a heavy concentration of options around current prices. Options are contracts that give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell bitcoin at a set price. Call option holders benefit if price rises, while put options benefit if price falls. 

On the other side of these trades are the options writers, who have to honor the contracts if the holders choose to exercise them. They hedge their risk dynamically in the spot and futures markets, and that behavior is controlled by what's known as gamma and delta. 

Delta measures how much an option's value changes for a $1 move in the bitcoin price. Gamma measures how quickly that delta changes as price moves. When gamma is high and close to spot, dealers are forced to buy and sell frequently, suppressing volatility.

According to X account, David, in December, large put gamma near $85,000 acted as a floor, forcing dealers to buy bitcoin as the price dips. At the same time, heavy call gamma near $90,000 capped rallies, with dealers selling into strength. This created a self-reinforcing range driven by hedging necessity rather than conviction.

With $27 billion of options approaching expiry on Dec. 26, this stabilizing effect weakens as gamma and delta decay. 

This expiry is extremely large and has a bullish tint towards it. More than half of Deribit open interest rolls off, with a put-call ratio of just 0.38 (that is, there are almost three times as many call options as puts) and most open interest concentrated in upside strike prices between $100,000 and $116,000. 

The max pain point, which refers to the price level at which options buyers would lose the most money at expiry and the sellers, typically dealers, would make the most, is at $96,000, which reinforces the upside skew. 

In addition, implied volatility measures the market's expectation of how much bitcoin's price may fluctuate in the future, and the Bitcoin Volmex implied volatility index hovering near one month lows around 45 suggests traders are not pricing in elevated near-term risk.

Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $3,000 and dipped. ETH is now showing bearish signs and might slide further below $2,880.

Ethereum Price Faces Rejection

Ethereum price failed to stay above the $3,000 pivot level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin. ETH price dipped below $2,980 to enter a bearish zone.

The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,775 swing low to the $3,075 high. Besides, there was a break below a rising channel with support at $2,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

Ethereum price is now trading below $2,980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls are able to protect more losses below $2,880, the price could start a fresh recovery.

Immediate resistance is seen near the $2,980 level. The first key resistance is near the $3,000 level. The next major resistance is near the $3,050 level. A clear move above the $3,050 resistance might send the price toward the $3,120 resistance. An upside break above the $3,120 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,200 resistance zone or even $3,220 in the near term.

More Losses In ETH?

If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,000 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,880 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,775 swing low to the $3,075 high.

The first major support sits near the $2,845 zone. A clear move below the $2,845 support might push the price toward the $2,800 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,775 region. The next key support sits at $2,720.

Technical Indicators

Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.

Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

Major Support Level – $2,880

Ethereum price prediction is in sharp focus as ETH trades at $2,926.60, down 1.13% over the past 24 hours. While the coin holds above key support levels, market sentiment remains bearish with the Fear & Greed Index at just 24. 

Traders are watching closely as ETH hovers near psychological levels, and many are now turning attention to early-stage alternatives like Bitcoin Hyper, a presale token nearing a key funding milestone.

Ethereum is currently trading at $2,923.97, with a market cap of $352.91 billion and 24-hour trading volume of $33.63 billion. Volatility sits at 3.90%, considered medium. 



In the last 24 hours, ETH ranged between $2,911.68 and $2,979.57, with a daily drop of 1.14%. This puts Ethereum in a tight sideways zone, and sentiment metrics indicate growing indecision. 

The price remains above the cycle low of $2,631.93, offering some near-term reassurance for holders. However, without a strong catalyst, the sideways structure could break down if volume declines further.

The technical sentiment for Ethereum is currently rated bearish. The $2,900 level continues to act as a fragile support zone, and any decisive break below it could trigger further downside toward $2,830 or even the $2,631 low. 



On the upside, resistance is forming around $2,980 and $3,050. Despite the current bearish momentum, the broader market hasn't seen a significant rise in selling volume, which means the dip may reflect macro-level caution rather than a breakdown in fundamentals. 

The 12.05% market dominance of ETH has held steady, reinforcing its role as the top altcoin in the ecosystem. Still, short-term investors are reacting to fear, not fundamentals.

Compared to this time last year, Ethereum is down 14.07%, falling from $3,405.84 on December 24, 2024. However, on a 1-month basis, ETH has risen from $2,833.00, marking a 3.31% gain. 

This contrast shows a pattern of slow accumulation after a broader correction, and may hint at an early accumulation phase going into 2026. The coin has managed to hold relatively flat week-over-week, with a 0.08% increase, confirming the narrow consolidation structure traders are now watching closely.



Despite short-term bearishness, long-term forecasts for Ethereum price prediction remain optimistic. The current projected trajectory puts ETH at $3,181.09 in 2026, gradually increasing to $4,059.97 by 2031. 



These predictions factor in low supply inflation (0.20%), continued staking growth, and sustained Layer 2 development. 

Ethereum's supply remains stable, with 120.69 million ETH in circulation and no hard cap. While projections show steady growth, they also depend on broader market recovery and improved risk appetite across institutional and retail segments.



With Ethereum consolidating and volatility staying muted, many retail traders are shifting focus toward early-stage tokens like Bitcoin Hyper. Currently priced at $0.013475, Bitcoin Hyper has already raised $29.73 million out of a $30.14 million target. 

Only one day remains until the next automatic price increase, which has fueled increased investor attention. While Ethereum remains a strong long-term asset, smaller cap tokens with momentum narratives are becoming increasingly attractive to short-term risk-tolerant buyers. 

The Ethereum price prediction still supports a recovery scenario, but timing remains uncertain, and alternative presale assets are gaining traction in the meantime.

HashKey Capital, a subsidiary of HashKey Holdings, said it closed the first round of fundraising for its fourth crypto fund, locking in $250 million from a mix of institutional investors, family offices and high-net-worth individuals.

The fund, HashKey Fintech Multi-Strategy Fund IV, is targeting a final close of $500 million. It will invest in both public and private markets, backing blockchain infrastructure and applications that support real-world and scalable use cases, the company said.

The strategy includes crossover investments to capture value where traditional and blockchain finance intersect.

Based in Singapore, HashKey has emerged as one of Asia's largest digital asset fund managers and now has over $1 billion in assets under management. It operates under licenses in Hong Kong and played a role in launching the city's first spot bitcoin and ether ETFs.

The firm was an early institutional backer of Ethereum and has managed over $1 billion across more than 400 crypto projects. Its parent, Hashkey Holdings, made its public debut in Hong Kong this month.

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology. They represent unique digital assets that prove ownership of items like artwork, music, collectibles, or even membership access. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are interchangeable and mainly used as money or value storage, NFTs focus on individuality and authenticity. For those who want a solid introduction to the world of digital assets, blockchain technology courses can explain how NFTs and cryptocurrencies differ at the technical and practical level.

The defining feature of NFTs is non-fungibility. Each NFT is distinct and cannot be swapped on a one-to-one basis with another. Owning an NFT is more like owning a rare collectible card or a piece of art—it carries value because it is unique. The blockchain ensures proof of ownership and records the history of the asset, making it secure and verifiable.

Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, are fungible. Every coin of the same type has the same value and can be exchanged without any difference. They act as money in the digital economy, supporting payments, trading, and in some cases, governance. They are divisible into smaller units, which makes them liquid and easy to trade.

Although both run on blockchain, their purposes and mechanics diverge.

NFTs are evolving far beyond art. They now serve as digital memberships, access passes, and gateways to virtual experiences. Businesses use them for customer engagement, gaming platforms issue them as in-game items, and creators use them to share exclusive content. These trends reflect a shift toward “NFT 2.0,” where tokens carry real utility rather than being just speculative assets.

The difference between NFTs and cryptocurrencies matters because it highlights the two major directions blockchain is taking: one toward money and finance, the other toward ownership and digital identity. NFTs are creating new ways to engage with art, gaming, and membership communities, while cryptocurrencies continue to underpin decentralized finance and payments.

Understanding NFTs and cryptocurrencies is becoming a valuable skill in itself. Analysts and data professionals can leverage blockchain activity with the help of a Data Science Certification, while leaders interested in driving adoption through branding and digital engagement can gain insights from a Marketing and Business Certification.

NFTs and cryptocurrencies may share blockchain as their foundation, but they serve very different purposes. cryptocurrencies are designed for value exchange, while NFTs are about uniqueness and ownership. In 2025, both continue to grow but in separate directions: one as digital money, the other as a digital certificate of authenticity and access. Together, they illustrate the versatility of blockchain and its ability to reshape industries far beyond finance.

Nine banks are taking part of a blockchain trial process to see if it speeds up financial services.

CNBC reports that IBM has released a blockchain platform that is intended for financial services. Banks are starting to look toward the technology to help their processes of issuing loans and settling trades.

IBM and CLS, a foreign exchange market infrastructure firm, partnered together to create LedgerConnect, CNBC reports. The DLT platform is designed for financial services companies and will apply blockchain technology to areas such as know-your-customer processes, sanctions screening, collateral management, derivatives post-trade processing and reconciliation and market data, according to CNBC.

LedgerConnect is hosted on a single network and will be a one-stop shop for financial institutions to create blockchain applications. 

IBM isn't the only company that is offering the technology to banks, R3 specifically has blockchain products aimed at the industry. Some banks are also working with their own technology, potentially causing harm since different blockchains won't  work with each other. If a company is working with DLT created by one firm and another is using a different blockchain, the two institutions may not be able to transact with each other, CNBC reports. 

Blockchain is expected to speed up processes within the financial industry, making it more efficient and cheaper, CNBC reports. However, the industry hasn't fully adopted the technology and are starting to experiment with DLT instead.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","California crypto company accused of illegally inflating Katy Perry NFTs and fraud","https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-12-24/california-crypto-firm-accused-of-inflating-katy-perry-nfts-fraud","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

 This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here. 

Four years ago, California startup Theta Labs' cryptocurrency was soaring, and its future appeared bright when it landed a partnership with pop star Katy Perry. 

The Bay Area company had built a marketplace for digital collectibles known as nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, and had teamed up with Perry to launch NFTs tied to her Las Vegas concert residency. Its THETA token jumped by more than 500% in early 2021, reaching a peak of more than $15, making it one of the world's most valuable cryptocurrencies. Later in the year, the spotlight shone on the company when it announced the Perry partnership. 

“I can't wait to dive in with the Theta team on all the exciting and memorable creative pieces, so my fans can own a special moment of my residency,” Perry said in a June 2021 news release. 

Today, like many cryptocurrencies, THETA is 95% off its 2021 peak. It took a hit this week  after former executives accused it of manipulating markets to dupe consumers into buying its products. On Tuesday, it was trading at less than  30 cents.

Two former executives from Theta Labs sued the startup, alleging in separate lawsuits that the company and its chief executive, Mitch Liu, engaged in fraud and manipulated the cryptocurrency market for his benefit. Liu retaliated against them after the employees refused to engage in deceptive business practices and raised concerns, the lawsuits say.

Some of the alleged misconduct involved placing fake bids on Perry's NFTs, engaging in token “pump and dump” schemes and using celebrity endorsements and “misleading” partnerships with high-profile companies such as Google to deceive the public, according to the December lawsuits filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.

Perry is not accused of any wrongdoing in the suit, and Theta denies the charges. 

The lawsuits against Theta Labs are the latest controversy to rattle an industry beset by scandals. 

Cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed, and its founder, Samuel Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2024 after being found guilty of multiple fraud charges. Binance founder and former Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao also got prison time after he pleaded guilty to violating money laundering laws, but President Trump pardoned him this year. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission previously charged celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul and Ne-Yo for promoting crypto without disclosing they were paid to do so.

Theta Labs created a network that rewarded people with cryptocurrency for contributing spare bandwidth and computing power to enhance video streaming and lower content delivery costs. The company describes Theta Network as a “blockchain-powered decentralized cloud for AI, media and entertainment.” The network has two tokens: THETA, used to secure the network, and TFUEL, used to pay users for services and power operations.

The whistleblowers suing Theta Labs are Jerry Kowal, its former head of content, and Andrea Berry,  previously the company's head of business development.

“Liu used Theta Labs as his personal trading vehicle, perpetrating fraud, self-dealing, and market manipulation,” said Mark Mermelstein, Kowal's attorney, in a statement. “His calculated ‘pump-and-dump' schemes repeatedly wiped out employee and investor value. This suit is about demanding accountability and proving no one is above the law.”

Theta, Liu and its parent company, Sliver VR Technologies, deny the allegations and “intend to prove with evidence the fallacy of the stories being told in the lawsuits,” according to Kronenberger Rosenfeld, the law firm representing the defendants. The lawsuits are an attempt to paint the company in a negative light in hopes of securing a settlement, a lawyer for the firm said.

Kowal has sued his former employers before. In 2014, he accused Netflix of spreading false claims that he stole confidential information and Amazon of wrongful termination. 

The latest lawsuits allege that Liu profited from buying and selling THETA tokens using insider knowledge about partnerships with celebrities, studios and others in the entertainment industry.

“Liu's true motive in pursuing such partnerships was not to develop a sustainable content business but to generate publicity that could be used to artificially inflate token prices for Liu's personal gain,” Kowal's lawsuit says.  

Kowal worked for Theta from 2020 to 2025. 

In 2020, Liu traded and sold tokens knowing that the company would close a content licensing deal with MGM Studios, according to the lawsuit. After the deal's announcement, THETA token's market capitalization increased by more than $50 million in just 24 hours, the lawsuit says. 

When NFTs started to take off in 2021, Kowal closed deals with high-profile partners such as Perry, Fremantle Media and Resorts World Las Vegas for the startup's NFT marketplace.

As part of the deal with Perry, the singer received $8.5 million and additional warrants for the right to license her image and likeness for the NFTs.

To inflate the price and demand for these digital collectibles, Liu allegedly made bids on NFTs and directed employees to do the same. This led to people overpaying for the Perry NFTs.

Representatives for Perry didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Multiple examples of alleged manipulation are outlined in the lawsuits. In one instance from 2022, the startup launched a new token called TDROP that employees also received as part of a bonus. 

Liu gained control of 43% of the supply of the cryptocurrency, according to Kowal's lawsuit. When the TDROP token reached a high, he then sold the token, and its price collapsed by more than 90% within months.

Berry's lawsuit also alleges that Theta Labs announced “misleading” or fake partnerships with high-profile companies such as Google and entities including NASA to pump up the value of the THETA token. Theta paid for Google Cloud products but claimed it was a partner when it was a Google customer, according to the lawsuit.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Crypto News: Monad Coinbase ICO Fallout Leaves Retail Investors Underwater","https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/monad-coinbase-ico-fallout-leaves-retail-investors-underwater/","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:45:02 GMT","

Monad launched with $400M backing and a rare Coinbase ICO, but retail investors now sit on losses as valuation pressure weighs on price.

Monad entered the market with rare hype. It had big funding rounds, speed claims and a historic Coinbase ICO that all fueled attention. 

Many expected fast gains and entered massively. However, reality moved another way. 

Price action after launch has hurt retail buyers while early backers remain well funded. Here's how Monad reached this point and why the launch became a warning sign for everyday traders.

Monad started as an idea. Former Jump Trading engineers wanted to build a faster Ethereum-style chain and spent three years on development. 

Venture firms noticed early and early last year, Monad Labs closed a $225 million Series A round with Paradigm leading the raise. Electric Capital and Greenoaks joined and the deal valued the company at $3 billion before mainnet activity began.

Monad:

> 3 years of building> $225M raised at $3B> VCs have a few years lock-up> raised $187M more though ICO

It was the first ICO on Coinbase with US users eligible to participate, and the chart looks like this

Below ICO price ($0.025) and down 60% from ATH pic.twitter.com/aYBO7zT5lg

— jussy (@jussy_world) December 23, 2025



This massive number changed everything that followed as venture firms saw long-term infrastructure value and entered lockup agreements of three to five years. 

On the other hand, Retail traders saw a token that was already priced in success and that difference in time horizon mattered.

Coinbase opened a rare door in November of this year and allowed United States retail users to join the primary token sale. It even performed identity checks and provided clear rules that framed the event as safe.

At the end of the sale, Monad raised $187.5 million as each token sold for $0.025, with over 85,000 verified users joining.

Coinbase promoted fairness and its marketing focused on trust and compliance. Many buyers also viewed this ICO as a chance to join early without shady risks.

The Monad mainnet went live on November 24, and trading started soon after. The MON token reached nearly $0.06 and early buyers doubled their money on paper. Social media buzz grew fast and screenshots spread.

However, that rally did not last long.

Market conditions changed in mid-December as a wider pullback hit many assets. Monad felt extra pressure due to its supply size and trader behavior.

Price soon dropped below the ICO level and trading settled between $0.016 and $0.021 by December 24.

As of writing, every Coinbase ICO buyer now holds a loss. The token also fell more than 60% from its peak and technical charts showed a death cross, which added fear.

Total supply explains much of the struggle. Monad has 100 billion tokens, which means that a $0.025 price equals a $2.5 billion fully diluted valuation.

At $0.06, the valuation reached $6 billion and that placed Monad near established chains like Near Protocol and Aptos. Such pricing also left little room for upside.

Through it all, technology continues to be Monad's strength. The network claims up to 10,000 transactions per second and some of its early testing supports that figure.

More than 200 decentralised apps are already deployed on the chain and eevelopers continue building.

In all, this story shows that regulation alone does not protect returns and legal access does not mean fair pricing.","{'href': 'https://www.livebitcoinnews.com', 'title': 'Live Bitcoin News'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","December Online Safety Roundup: Ofcom Issues Fines And Guidance, ICO Targets Childrens' Games","https://www.mondaq.com/uk/social-media/1723098/december-online-safety-roundup-ofcom-issues-fines-and-guidance-ico-targets-childrens-games","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 06:34:54 GMT","

December has been another busy month for online safety
developments, with both Ofcom and the ICO being active.

Ofcom has imposed a penalty of £20,000 on the
provider of the Im.ge service regarding its failure to comply with
two statutory information requests. Ofcom said that the fine has
been set with its Penalty Guidelines in mind. In addition it is
requiring the Im.ge Service to take immediate steps to comply with
section 102(8) of the Online Safety Act by providing the
information requested in two statutory information requests, which
included a copy of the record of the Illegal Content Risk
Assessment for the service; and information about its qualifying
worldwide revenue. If it still doesn't comply, Ofcom will
impose a daily rate penalty of £100 per day. Ofcom is
continuing to investigate the Im.ge Service's compliance with
its duties to complete, and keep a record of, a suitable and
sufficient illegal content risk assessment and its compliance with
the illegal content duties in respect of child sexual abuse
material remain ongoing. It will provide updates on these matters
in due course.

Ofcom also confirmed that AVS Group Ltd, which it
recently fined £1 million for not having robust
age checks in place on 18 adult websites, has now introduced a new
age assurance process on all sites that were the subject of
Ofcom's investigation.

In accordance with its Roadmap, Ofcom is seeking views on proposed
industry guidance relating to how tech firms respond to
requests from bereaved parents about their child's use of a
service in the event of their death. Ofcom has spoken to bereaved
parents about the significant barriers they've faced when
seeking answers from tech firms about their children's use of
their sites and apps before their death. The Online Safety Act
places requirements on tech firms about how they can increase
transparency and reduce uncertainty for bereaved parents making
requests in difficult circumstances. To help services to comply
with these duties, the Act also requires Ofcom to produce industry
guidance. The draft guidance expects services, among other things,
to provide clear and accessible information in their terms of
service about their information disclosure policy, including how
bereaved parents can make requests and the evidence required; make
sure that they respond to bereaved parents in a timely manner;
offer a support function, which might be a helpline, to bereaved
parents; and operate a simple to use, easy to access and
transparent complaints function, with a nominated team or
individual responsible for handling concerns, and a clear response
timeframe. The consultation ends on 23 March 2026.

Separately, Ofcom has issued its final Guidance for online platforms that sets out
what information they are required to retain about a child's
online activity when Ofcom issues a Data Preservation Notice. Ofcom
issues Data Preservation Notices at the request of a coroner
investigating the death of a child. They require the recipient to
retain information relating to a child's online activity from
the point they receive the notice, making sure that the information
is available to the coroner if requested. It has already issued a
number of these notices since the provisions came into force on 30
September. Some online platforms automatically delete a user's
data if their account is inactive for a certain period. To enable
swift action after a child's death, Ofcom has set out the types
of information coroners may wish to provide to Ofcom about the
child if known at the time, and the types of information it will
generally require platforms to preserve. It has also updated its
guidance about its information gathering powers to reflect
this.

Earlier this month, the ICO announced that it would be scrutinising how
popular mobile games played by children in the UK protect their
online privacy. It highlighted that around 90% of UK children play
games on digital devices, so it is launching a monitoring programme
targeting ten popular mobile games. The review will assess the
games' compliance with default privacy settings, their
geolocation controls, and their targeted advertising practices. It
will also consider any other privacy issues identified during the
review process. The ICO says that the new focus on mobile games
follows significant progress in improving children's privacy
standards across social media and video-sharing platforms through
its Children's code strategy. We will be writing more about
this topic in the new year.

As part of its strategy to reduce violence against women and
girls, the UK government has highlighted the rise of nudification apps. It has said that it will
ban nudification apps and other tools designed to create synthetic
non-consensual intimate images to stop women and girls' images
being tampered with and exploited without their consent. This aims
to target the firms and individuals providing and supplying such
tools. We are waiting for more detail on when and how this will be
done.

Ofcom has received some criticism for its slow implementation of
the Act, but it is getting into its stride now with more fines,
facilitating platforms to change their practices, and issuing new
guidance. Platforms and service providers should note that the ICO
is monitoring them as well.

The European Council has published a 157-page paper outlining its negotiating position for digital euro legislation. As the body representing EU member state governments, the Council must approve any legislation passed by the European Parliament. The European Central Bank targets 2029 for launch, though legislative passage is no longer a foregone conclusion. In November, Rapporteur Fernando Navarrete presented a proposal suggesting that only an offline digital euro should be pursued, giving the private sector room to expand existing European retail payment solutions such as WERO. The offline approach would also help to address privacy concerns, one of the key objections to the CBDC.

This offline only path has been rejected by the European Council, which is insisting on both an offline and online digital euro. While the European Council announcement also highlighted holding limits for the CBDC and compensation for payment providers, the document showed hints of early feature creep.

In its first iteration, the digital euro is primarily intended to support P2P payments and retail payments. The European Central Bank argues that this is needed to address the dependence on Visa and Mastercard, whereas the European Council envisions a broader role for the digital euro in general payments. 

It mentions the ability to “fulfil future payments needs, and in particular machine to machine payment in the context of Industry 4.0 and payments in the decentralised internet (web3).” Additionally, it asserts that the solution should be “designed from the outset” to support business to business conditional payments. This functionality overlaps with private sector initiatives, including Germany's Commercial Bank Money Token project, which could launch within a year, subject to regulatory approval.

Bitcoin has become a reference point in discussions about the future of money, especially as central banks transition toward issuing digital currencies. Governments are upgrading financial infrastructure while crypto assets push back against centralized monetary authority. Are these systems designed to compete or are they solving very different problems in parallel?

This article analyzes the relationship between decentralized crypto and state issued digital money, focusing on structure, intent, and long term interaction.

• Central bank digital currencies aim to upgrade state issued money, not eliminate crypto markets.

• Bitcoin operates independently of governments and monetary authorities.

• CBDCs prioritize control, compliance, and financial stability.

• Each system addresses distinct user needs and economic functions.

• Coexistence appears more likely than direct competition in the near term.

Central bank digital currencies, commonly referred to as CBDCs, are digital representations of a country's official fiat currency. They are issued and controlled by central banks and carry the same legal status as physical cash. Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs do not rely on blockchains and decentralized governance models. In many regions, CBDCs are also seen as a response to the decline of cash usage and the rise of private digital payment platforms.

From a technical perspective, most CBDCs use permissioned infrastructure. This means access is restricted and transactions can be monitored or reversed when required. These features align closely with existing financial regulations and anti money laundering frameworks. In short, CBDCs are simply an extension of the current financial system.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, was created with a fundamentally different philosophy. It is not issued by any government, cannot be altered by central banks, and operates on a decentralized network that anyone can access. Its monetary policy is encoded, featuring a capped supply and a consistent issuance schedule. This structure makes it resistant to inflationary manipulation and political interference. For many users, this stability is the primary appeal. It also enables permissionless value transfer across borders without reliance on intermediaries.

Most importantly, Bitcoin does not aim to replace national currencies in their role as legal tender but functions as a parallel system. Some view it as digital gold, others as a settlement layer, and some as a protection against monetary instability. These roles place it outside the objectives of CBDCs rather than directly against them.

At first it seems Bitcoin and central bank digital currencies compete, but they operate in distinct ways. Their design, purpose, and user appeal point toward different roles in the financial ecosystem. CBDCs are engineered to streamline payments, enhance policy oversight, and maintain stability within traditional financial systems.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, prioritizes decentralization, autonomy, and resistance to censorship, offering an alternative financial framework that operates independently of governments and central banks.

Instances of apparent competition may emerge in areas such as international payments or digital savings. CBDCs attract people seeking reliable, government-backed financial tools with regulations while Bitcoin appeals to those who value transparency, stable supply, and the ability to transfer value without intermediaries. This divergence suggests that rather than competing with each other, they serve complementary purposes. Regulation will influence how Bitcoin and CBDCs interact, with governments positioning CBDCs as a controlled option for mainstream payments. At the same time, CBDC infrastructure like digital wallets and payments could make digital finance more accessible, indirectly supporting Bitcoin adoption. This makes coexistence more likely than direct competition, with each system serving different needs within the financial ecosystem.

So will Bitcoin compete with CBDCs?

No, it is unlikely.

Both can coexist and fulfill different roles within the global financial system. The future of money will be more diverse and flexible, allowing people and institutions to choose the digital tools that suit their needs, values, and priorities across different regions and economic contexts.

The Middlesex Sheriff Peter J. Koutoujian is warning residents about scams involving fake judicial documents, “Preemptive Bail” and digital currency, officials said. 

Residents have reported calls from scammers posing as law enforcement members, Koutoujian's office said in a statement.  

Scammers tried to convince residents to pay fines of up to $5,000 by telling residents they had warrants for their arrest for failing to appear in court, the statement said.  

In at least three cases, residents were sent fake arrest warrants through text, officials said. 

In one case, the scammer sent a document that said a resident could post a “preemptive bail,” which would allow them to “avert apprehension and secure a timely release.”

The document stated that bail involving cash deposits could be made at locally available kiosks in grocery stores and fuel stations, the statement said.

Another document stated that the “White House Administration has approved Digital Currency as a method for posting eligible appearance bonds.” 

“We want to be clear: no legitimate court or law enforcement agency will ever carry out its responsibilities this way,” Koutoujian said in the statement. 

 “There is no such thing as preemptive bail, we will never ask you to pay a fine at a gas station or grocery store, and the courts do not accept digital currency.  These are all tell-tale signs of a scam.”



Residents who have been targeted by one of these scams are encouraged to report it by contacting local law enforcement or the agency the alleged warrant is from. 

Any scam that claims to be from the Middlesex Sherriff's Office can call 781-960-2800 or 978-667-1711.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed charges against multiple companies for their alleged involvement in an elaborate cryptocurrency scam that swindled more than $14 million from retail investors.

The complaint charged crypto asset trading platforms Morocoin Tech Corp., Berge Blockchain Technology Co., Ltd., and Cirkor Inc., as well as investment clubs AI Wealth Inc., Lane Wealth Inc., AI Investment Education Foundation (AIIEF) Ltd., and Zenith Asset Tech Foundation, in connection with the operation.

The SEC said the scam unfolded as a multi-step fraud that enticed unsuspecting users with ads on social media and built trust with them through group chats in which the scammers posed as financial professionals and promised returns from artificial intelligence (AI)-generated investment tips.

The fraudsters then convinced the victims to invest their funds into fake cryptocurrency asset trading platforms, only to defraud them later.

According to the SEC, AI Wealth, Lane Wealth, AIIEF, and Zenith operated investment clubs on messaging apps like WhatsApp to which retail investors were lured into joining via ads on social media. While AI Wealth and Lane Wealth operated their WhatsApp groups from at least January 2024 to June 2024, AIIEF and Zenith ran from at least July 2024 to January 2025.

The complaint alleges an unnamed individual based in Beijing, China, paid for the registrations of AI Wealth, Lane Wealth, and Zenith. The details of the cryptocurrency platforms are as follows -

Each of these clubs included a ""professor"" who sent updates to investors via WhatsApp on macroeconomic conditions or commentary on stocks and an ""assistant"" who handled day-to-day interactions with participants. These personas also send trade recommendations that they falsely claimed were based on AI-generated ""signals.""

""The clubs gained investors' confidence with supposedly AI-generated investment tips before luring investors to open and fund accounts on purported crypto asset trading platforms Morocoin, Berge, and Cirkor, which falsely claimed to have government licenses, as alleged,"" the SEC said.

""The investment clubs and platforms then allegedly offered 'Security Token Offerings' that were purportedly issued by legitimate businesses. In reality, no trading took place on the trading platforms, which were fake, and the Security Token Offerings and their purported issuing companies did not exist.""

The AI Wealth and Lane Wealth WhatsApp groups are said to have promoted an STO of a cryptocurrency asset called SCT, purportedly issued by the company SatCommTech. Likewise, the AIIEF and Zenith WhatsApp groups advertised an STO of another crypto asset called HMB that was issued by HumanBlock. Both SatCommTech and HumanBlock have been identified as fictitious.

To make matters worse, when investors attempted to withdraw their funds, the bogus platforms defrauded them a second time by demanding that they pay advance fees to gain access to money in their accounts. In the end, the platforms cut off investors' access to their services.

The ill-gotten proceeds, totaling at least $14 million, were moved overseas through a web of bank accounts and crypto asset wallets, in some cases through accounts held by Chinese or Burmese individuals located in Southeast Asia. Of the total misappropriated funds, cryptocurrency assets account for at least $7.4 million, and fiat currency accounts for $6.6 million.

In one case, a Morocoin investor made seven separate wires amounting to more than $1 million to accounts in China and Hong Kong. In another, a Cirkor investor wired over $1.4 million to a bank in Indonesia. There have also been multiple reports on Reddit about individuals losing their money to the scam, with the AIIEF using names like ""Richard Dill"" and ""Daisy Akemi"" for professors and assistants. 

The defendants have been charged with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition, the SEC is seeking permanent injunctions and civil penalties, along with the repayment of the money with prejudgment interest.

""This matter highlights an all-too-common form of investment scam that is being used to target U.S. retail investors with devastating consequences,"" said Laura D'Allaird, Chief of the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit. ""Fraud is fraud, and we will vigorously pursue securities fraud that harms retail investors.""

One of the first modern coworking spaces, C-Base in Berlin, was launched 30 years ago by a group of computer engineers as a “hacker space” in which to share their tech and techniques. Similarly, many of the people we first encountered in our anthropological research into the emerging world of digital nomadism in the mid-2010s were hackers and computer coders.

Nearly a decade later, we returned to Chiang Mai to see what had happened to these pioneers of the borderless, desk-free life. We wondered if they had been put off by the throngs of travellers who have followed in their sandal-clad footsteps, attracted by glamorous – if often inaccurate – images of the digital nomad lifestyle.

One of the city's nomad hotspots is Yellow Coworking, which launched in 2020 as a blockchain-oriented, collaborative escape zone from the COVID pandemic. The later stages of the pandemic were an interesting time to be in Chiang Mai: Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was followed by mass layoffs in Silicon Valley when Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Microsoft all made significant cuts.

Yellow Coworking saw an influx of former Silicon Valley workers, Russian and Ukrainian coders, and crypto enthusiasts. “Some ex-Silicon Valley employees are here playing around with startups,” one Yellow staff member explained. “It makes sense for them to come here if they are trying to create an MVP” (that's “minimum viable product” – startup jargon for a basic prototype that, with luck, will become the next technological success story).

“With its lower costs,” the staff member added, “Chiang Mai gives them a longer runway” (the amount of time the startup can remain solvent without raising additional funds).

People walking into Yellow Coworking's modernist, European-style building simply raise their hands to sign themselves in via biometric fingerprint scanners. Many are computer coders or IT specialists in their 20s, taking advantage of fast broadband and (mostly western) passports to disconnect their lives from any particular location. They view technology and code as a global language, with no need to stay rooted to a single country or location.

Vitalik Buterin, creator of ethereum – the decentralised blockchain behind the world's second biggest cryptocurrency, Ether – was often a focus of discussion at Yellow's regular meet-ups. Buterin has identified as a digital nomad for most of the past decade, claiming to live out of a 40-litre backpack. Like many crypto folk, he views this borderless lifestyle as making perfect ideological sense.

In Chiang Mai, cryptocurrency usage has spread to the local population. During one meet-up held in a local bar, the owner took payment for shots of Thai rum in bitcoin. She too talked about the borderless revolution that was coming, and crypto being part of her financial future.

One of the western “crypto nomads” present was trying to launch his own cryptocoin (built on Buterin's ethereum ecosystem) and get others to invest in it. A few tables away, another who had invested – and lost – a fortune in cryptocurrency explained he was now living in Chiang Mai because of the city's relatively low cost of living.

For every success story, there were tales of loss and potential scams. Some told outlandish stories of crypto startups and other projects that were hard to validate. One person who wrote eBooks on how to invest successfully in crypto was selling courses on how to get involved. Another was writing code to improve the security of the ethereum blockchain system, to ensure it would be safe from hackers.

Digital nomad hotspots, which also include European cities such as Lisbon in Portugal, show how the worlds of cryptocurrency, blockchain and digital nomadism are colliding – and evolving beyond mere workspace provision.

A collaborative, incubator-like atmosphere is at the core of The Block Lisboa, where you can pay in cryptocurrency and which hosts weekly Crypto Fridays for networking, collaboration and ideas sharing. In 2023, it held the first Ethereum Block Summit, which promised to “delve into the future of finance” by exploring “groundbreaking advancements in the ethereum ecosystem”.

Meanwhile, CV Labs is building a blockchain ecosystem of its own, comprising coworking spaces, events and summits in Lisbon and four other cities including Vaduz in Liechtenstein and Zug – part of Switzerland's “Crypto Valley”. These spaces are open to cryptocurrency professionals and enthusiasts with professional exchange in mind. 

Digital nomads are becoming a valuable asset for states to compete for – as Tsugio Makimoto and David Manners predicted they would in their 1997 book, Digital Nomad. “Just as we are already seeing governments competing with each other to attract industrial investment,” they wrote, “we may see governments competing with each other for citizens.”

Malaysia's digital nomad visa initially targeted only nomads from IT and digital professions such as cybersecurity and software development. Estonia launched a digital nomad visa along with its e-residency programme to target high-skilled digital workers. While these visas typically restrict local employment, many allow nomads to bring family members and offer a path to residency, such as in Spain and Portugal. 

Coworking spaces started off as techno-utopian, hacker spaces. Thirty years later, they are an increasingly important aspect of some cities' tourism calculations – having been given further allure by the rise of the niche group of crypto nomads.

Chainlink faces a multitude of regulatory challenges when it comes to integrating crypto payroll into traditional finance systems. The most immediate and significant hurdles are:

Fragmented Regulatory Landscape: Different countries and regions impose varying regulations on cryptocurrencies. This discrepancy complicates compliance for payroll providers. Companies must navigate a confusing array of laws, potentially leading to inconsistent applications. 

KYC/AML Compliance: For on-chain payroll implementations, the enforcement of Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering laws is crucial. Chainlink's Automated Compliance Engine seeks to solve this by embedding compliance in smart contracts, thus not sacrificing user privacy.

Identity and Auditing Needs: Institutional partners typically require strong identity verification and auditing processes. Chainlink must ensure that transactions for payroll are verifiable and in line with current regulations, which is a significant barrier to broader adoption.

Centralized Oversight Requirements: There is a conflict between the decentralized nature of blockchain and the imposed need for centralized controls by regulators. Balancing these two will present challenges.

Operational Risks: Custody management, finality of settlements, and the need for interoperability with stablecoins and CBDCs consist of several complex risks that must be carefully addressed.

Chainlink's oracle technology could dramatically improve crypto payroll solutions, especially for unbanked individuals. Here's how:

Secure External Data Access: Chainlink ensures on-chain access to off-chain data like effective fiat exchange rates and payroll schedules. This becomes vital to ensure that payments remain accurate and prompt, particularly in regions with unstable currency values.

Automated Payment Execution: Chainlink can execute payroll payments automatically and on time, which is especially beneficial for unbanked laborers in need of timely wages.

Cross-Chain Messaging Capabilities: Its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol allows swift cross-chain transfers, making payments feasible in local currencies or stablecoins. This adaptability is key for those without access to standard banking systems.

Increased Transparency and Auditability: The transparency of Chainlink's decentralized structure allows for easier verification of payroll transactions. This transparency builds trust with workers who may already be wary of conventional financial systems.

Cost and Delay Reduction: Chainlink minimizes reliance on middlemen, which can significantly cut down on both transaction costs and delays associated with conventional payroll systems, benefiting businesses with a multi-country presence.

Adopting stablecoins into payroll systems could drastically affect Chainlink's price trajectory. Here's how:

Enhanced Demand for Oracle Services: Businesses will increasingly demand Chainlink's oracle services as they turn to stablecoins for payroll. Accurate off-chain data like fiat exchange rates and compliance triggers will be essential for secure, programmable payroll.

Improved Cross-Border Efficiency: Stablecoins facilitate quicker settlements, reducing forex risks and fees for global workforces. Chainlink's oracles provide necessary liquidity data and conversions, making it a key player in these payroll systems.

Institutional Integration: With more financial institutions exploring stablecoin usage, Chainlink's established presence as a trusted oracle network could serve it well. This increased transaction volume could translate into higher LINK token utilization and value.

Changing Market Perception: As stablecoins become an accepted part of the financial landscape, Chainlink's narrative will shift from a speculative asset to the backbone of real-world finance. This shift could draw institutional investments and improve its overall market perception.

Significant Price Catalysts: The integration of stablecoins in payroll could spark a notable price surge for LINK if Chainlink manages to capture a considerable market share in this growing industry.

Though Chainlink is currently the leader in oracles, emerging competitors present new challenges. Here are the factors:

Latency Issues: Competitors like Pyth Network, which provide near-instant updates, hold an advantage for financial applications. Chainlink must match their performance or risk losing ground in high-speed trading environments.

Cost-Effectiveness: Projects like Chronicle and Band Protocol are slashing oracle gas fees, appealing to projects with tighter budgets. If Chainlink can't lower its validation costs, it may struggle to attract new users.

Scalability Solutions: Band Protocol's use of Cosmos SDK allows for faster processing and high scalability, possibly alleviating congestion problems for Chainlink. Competitors able to provide better scalability might capture more users.

Focused Applications: Some competitors have chosen specific niches, such as first-party oracles for particular industries. This specialization could redirect users away from Chainlink's general service.

Cross-Chain Efficiency: New projects like RedStone and Flare Network are building gas-efficient, cross-chain feeds that could challenge Chainlink's CCIP. If they can provide superior cross-chain solutions, they could undermine Chainlink's market hold.

Chainlink occupies a crucial and increasingly significant space within the blockchain ecosystem. As an essential link between smart contracts and real-world data, its value is key to the growth of decentralized applications. While reaching the $100 milestone might be an uphill battle, it remains a realistic target for the 2026-2030 timeframe, provided circumstances align favorably.

Investors should keep a close eye on regulatory changes, technological innovations, and shifting competitive landscapes. The pathway to $100 will undoubtedly be challenging, but Chainlink has consistently shown its ability to rise to the occasion.

Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) moved roughly 2,000 bitcoin BTC$87,123.65, worth about $174 million, through a series of wallets a day after it was reported to have increased its holdings to 11,542 BTC.

The transfers routed the bitcoin across multiple addresses, with around $12 million ultimately reaching Coinbase Prime Custody, according to blockchain data tracked by CoinDesk on Arkham.

The remainder is held in other wallets that appear to be linked to the same entity, suggesting a reshuffle of reserves rather than a one-way move toward an exchange.

The activity does not, on its own, signal a sale. Coinbase Prime Custody is a storage product designed for institutions, and custody transfers can reflect treasury operations like reorganizing cold storage or consolidating wallets. Assets in custody can remain parked there for long periods without being traded.

The timing is notable, coming one day after blockchain tracker Lookonchain said the company bought 451 BTC, implying Trump Media, the owner of the Truth Social social-media platform, is actively managing its bitcoin position rather than leaving it static.

Corporate holders often move assets between wallets for operational reasons, particularly after new purchases, internal policy changes, or custodial transitions.

Bitcoin's price showed little immediate reaction to the movement. The token traded near $86,000 to $87,000 in the past 24 hours, a range that has held even as broader crypto sentiment has softened into year-end.

Traders have been watching flows and positioning closely, with recent market action showing bitcoin struggling to hold key psychological levels above $90,000.

The onchain transfers also come as Trump Media's equity has rallied. The shares are up more than 30% over the past five trading days, according to Google Finance, trading around $14. The move has coincided with renewed attention on the company's strategy beyond social media, including its push into financial products and digital assets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","BTC set for a volatility shift from the $85k to $90k range as options expiry looms","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/24/bitcoin-nears-breakout-from-the-usd85-000-usd90-000-range-as-options-expiry-looms","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:02:40 GMT","

Bitcoin BTC$87,123.65 has spent virtually all of December locked between $85,000 and $90,000, while U.S. equities rallied and gold hit all-time highs. That's left bitcoin investors frustrated, and the explanation lies in derivatives mechanics.

Now, those same mechanics indicate that the largest cryptocurrency could be making a break toward the high end of the range. The more likely outcome after expiry is an upside resolution toward the mid $90,000s rather than a sustained break below $85,000. 

The key driver has been a heavy concentration of options around current prices. Options are contracts that give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell bitcoin at a set price. Call option holders benefit if price rises, while put options benefit if price falls. 

On the other side of these trades are the options writers, who have to honor the contracts if the holders choose to exercise them. They hedge their risk dynamically in the spot and futures markets, and that behavior is controlled by what's known as gamma and delta. 

Delta measures how much an option's value changes for a $1 move in the bitcoin price. Gamma measures how quickly that delta changes as price moves. When gamma is high and close to spot, dealers are forced to buy and sell frequently, suppressing volatility.

According to X account, David, in December, large put gamma near $85,000 acted as a floor, forcing dealers to buy bitcoin as the price dips. At the same time, heavy call gamma near $90,000 capped rallies, with dealers selling into strength. This created a self-reinforcing range driven by hedging necessity rather than conviction.

With $27 billion of options approaching expiry on Dec. 26, this stabilizing effect weakens as gamma and delta decay. 

This expiry is extremely large and has a bullish tint towards it. More than half of Deribit open interest rolls off, with a put-call ratio of just 0.38 (that is, there are almost three times as many call options as puts) and most open interest concentrated in upside strike prices between $100,000 and $116,000. 

The max pain point, which refers to the price level at which options buyers would lose the most money at expiry and the sellers, typically dealers, would make the most, is at $96,000, which reinforces the upside skew. 

In addition, implied volatility measures the market's expectation of how much bitcoin's price may fluctuate in the future, and the Bitcoin Volmex implied volatility index hovering near one month lows around 45 suggests traders are not pricing in elevated near-term risk.

Gold is making fresh highs while bitcoin is struggling to hold key levels, reopening a debate crypto investors never fully settled. If bitcoin is supposed to be digital gold, this is the kind of tape it is meant to win. Right now, it is not.

The question is getting louder because gold is rallying on rate cut expectations and geopolitical risk, while bitcoin has struggled to hold key psychological levels and remains sensitive to the same forces that tend to hit equities and other risk assets.

Gold is up more than 70% this year, with others precious metal silver has rallied about 150%, putting both on track for their strongest annual gains since 1979. 

Platinum also pushed to record levels, extending a broader surge across precious metals as investors return to the category as a hedge against geopolitical volatility and long-run currency risk.

Part of what is holding bitcoin back is positioning. The market is still digesting a long stretch of leverage-led trading, and each rebound has been met by quick profit-taking over the past week.

Macro is another drag. Even when traders expect rate cuts, bitcoin tends to need clear conditions for risk-taking, not just a softer path for policy. Bond yields have been volatile, the dollar has whipsawed, and markets have repeatedly shifted into a “preserve capital” mood. That usually helps gold first.

David Miller, chief investment officer at Catalyst Funds and portfolio manager of the Strategy Shares Gold Enhanced Yield ETF, said the divergence is hard to ignore.

“Gold has had a record year, up over 60%. But bitcoin too. You still have this situation where it's clearly not digital gold,” Miller said, adding that “gold can have a record year while bitcoin is down in the same year.”

Miller said bitcoin can still make sense in portfolios over the long run, especially as a hedge against fiscal expansion and currency debasement. But he argued gold still plays a different role because it is already treated as a reserve asset by central banks.

“What gold does that bitcoin definitely can't is serve as an actual alternative reserve asset to a currency,” Miller said. “Bitcoin is really a retail play, whereas gold is very much institutional.”

World Gold Council data shows holdings in gold-backed ETFs rose in every month this year except May, pointing to consistent accumulation rather than a short-lived trading burst. Holdings in State Street's SPDR Gold Trust, the largest gold ETF, have increased by more than 20% in 2025.

Several Wall Street banks have also carried bullish views into next year. Goldman Sachs has forecast prices could rise toward $4,900 an ounce in 2026 under its base case, with risks skewed higher.

One of the most talked about stories of the year explored the limits of human perception. Scientists successfully stimulated the experience of a brand-new color, called “olo,” by firing lasers into participants' retinas to activate only “green” cone cells. The result is a teal-like hue that exists outside the visible spectrum.

We also took viewers deep into the field—literally. Chief multimedia editor Jeffery DelViscio traveled to Greenland for a feature story. There he filmed a tour of an underground lab where researchers drill down into the ice to extract cores that, layer by layer, record thousands of years of climate history.

This year also marked the start of our collaboration with science communicator Tom Lum, who covered the Ig Nobel Prizes. a parody of the Nobel Prizes that honors discoveries that “make people LAUGH, then THINK.”

We also broke down each of this year's three actual Nobel Prizes in science. For the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, senior multimedia editor Kelso Harper explained the prizewinning discovery of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), materials with enormous implications for energy, storage and environmental science. (Fun fact: Harper worked in a MOF lab in college!)

Science news continues to surprise us daily. Whether it's the discovery of a brand-new blood type or the realization that the total number of known blood types has now grown to 48!

In a more macabre vein, associate editor for mind and brain Allison Parshall explored the eerie story of a deceased composer is still making music via brain cells grown from his blood.

Not all of our science coverage was so serious. We leaned into the delightfully absurd in some of our most watched videos, such as this deep dive into how to cook the most scientifically perfect egg. It's tedious work, but the results are delightfully tasty.

A languid spiral galaxy appears draped against deep space in a stunning new image from the European Space Agency's Euclid telescope.

Euclid launched in 2023 on a six-year mission to map the cosmos at scale, observing billions of galaxies stretching as far away as 10 billion light-years from Earth. The effort could reveal how galaxies form and evolve and how the universe has expanded over its 13.8-billion-or-so-year history.

In turn, astronomers hope Euclid will shed light on dark matter, which we know tugs at normal matter but is utterly invisible to us, and dark energy, the force that is responsible for accelerating the speed at which the universe expands.

That effort will begin in earnest next year, when Euclid releases its first formal batch of data, which will account for about 14 percent of its final survey area.

Until then, the Euclid team has offered the occasional teaser for the telescope's power, including a festive new image of the galaxy NGC 646. This elegant spiral galaxy, filled with stars, is about 392 million light-years away from Earth—some 4 percent of the distance of Euclid's farthest targets—and is retreating at more than 5,000 miles per second.

Appearing at the left tip of NGC 646 is a second galaxy, known as PGC 6014—but their apparent closeness is merely an optical illusion; in truth, PGC 6014 is nearly 45 million light-years closer to Earth.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Discovered a Creature That Breaks a Fundamental Rule of Biology","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69648898/dna-copy/","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

A new study finds that at least one Archaea has surprisingly flexibility when interpreting genetic code, which goes against a long-held rule of biology.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The building blocks of life are formed from a simple process: DNA is transcribed into RNA, which then becomes proteins. And all life follows the same instructions for how those proteins form—instructions based on 61 codons made of three nucleotides, all of which are combinations of the four nucleic acids named adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U). 

These codons are typically assigned either to one of the 20 canonical amino acids or to what's known as a stop codon (usually UAA, UAG, or UGA), the latter of which sends a signal to terminate protein-building and release the polypeptide chain. For decades, scientists have assumed that this process needs to be exact to avoid an imprecise genetic code. However, a new study—published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) and led by scientists at the University of California (UC) Berkeley—discovered that at least one archaea, a methane-producing microbe named Methanosarcina acetivorans, survives by utilizing a more “loosey-goosey” translation method. 

“Objectively, ambiguity in the genetic code should be deleterious; you end up generating a random pool of proteins,” Dipti Nayak, senior author of the paper from UC Berkeley, said in a press statement. “But biological systems are more ambiguous than we give them credit to be and that ambiguity is actually a feature—it's not a bug.”

The scientists theorize that this “ambiquity” allowed the microbe to introduce the uncommon amino acid, pyrrolysine, to create enzymes that break down certain foods. Although life varies when it comes to the number of amino acids and what codons code which ones (with some even being redundant), one thing is usually certain: A codon has only one meaning. That is, until now. 

Pyrrolysine is widespread in methanogenic archaea, and lead study author Katie Shalvarjian (now a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) noticed while studying these methanogenic organisms that, strangely enough, the UAG codon in M. acetivorans wasn't always being interpreted as pyrrolysine. 

“The UAG codon is like a fork in the road, where it can be interpreted either as a stop codon or as a pyrrolysine residue,” Shalvarjian said in a press statement.

“They're flip-flopping back and forth between whether they should call this a stop or whether they should keep going by adding this new amino acid,” Nayak added. “They cannot decide. They just do both and they seem to be fine by making this random choice.”

Preliminary findings suggest that the archaea's choice isn't completely random. When the amino acid is flooding the cell, the microbe tends to interpret UAG as integrated pyrrolysine and turn it into the appropriate protein. However, when less of it was around, UAG often acted as a stop codon, which yields a different protein entirely. 

This research connects to the future of human health in surprising ways. For example, the human body relies on archaea to remove methylamines and keep the liver healthy, so it's important to understand this ambiguity in its molecular machinery. Additionally, scientists could experiment with introducing a similar level of imprecision into gene therapies, which could address maladies caused by premature stop codons (such as cystic fibrosis). 

“This really opens the door to finding interesting ways to control how cells interpret stop codons,” Nayak said.

Researchers led by RMIT University have developed extremely small particles called nanodots that can destroy cancer cells while largely leaving healthy cells unharmed. The particles are made from a metal-based compound and represent a possible new direction for cancer treatment research.

The work is still in its early stages and has only been tested in laboratory-grown cells. It has not yet been studied in animals or humans. Even so, the findings suggest a promising strategy that takes advantage of vulnerabilities already present in cancer cells.

A Metal Compound With Unusual Properties

The nanodots are created from molybdenum oxide, a compound derived from molybdenum. This rare metal is commonly used in electronics and industrial alloys.

According to the study's lead researcher Professor Jian Zhen Ou and Dr. Baoyue Zhang from RMIT's School of Engineering, small changes to the chemical structure of the particles caused them to release reactive oxygen molecules. These unstable oxygen forms can damage vital cell components and ultimately trigger cell death.

Lab Tests Show Strong Cancer Selectivity

In laboratory experiments, the nanodots killed cervical cancer cells at three times the rate seen in healthy cells over a 24-hour period. Notably, the particles worked without requiring light activation, which is uncommon for similar technologies.

""Cancer cells already live under higher stress than healthy ones,"" Zhang said.

""Our particles push that stress a little further -- enough to trigger self-destruction in cancer cells, while healthy cells cope just fine.""

International Collaboration Behind the Research

The research involved scientists from multiple institutions. Contributors included Dr. Shwathy Ramesan from The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Melbourne, as well as researchers from Southeast University, Hong Kong Baptist University, and Xidian University in China. The work was supported by the ARC Centre of Excellence in Optical Microcombs (COMBS).

""The result was particles that generate oxidative stress selectively in cancer cells under lab conditions,"" she said.

How the Nanodots Trigger Cell Death

To create the effect, the team carefully adjusted the composition of the metal oxide by adding very small amounts of hydrogen and ammonium.

This precise tuning altered how the particles managed electrons, allowing them to produce higher levels of reactive oxygen molecules. These molecules push cancer cells into apoptosis -- the body's natural process for safely removing damaged or malfunctioning cells.

In a separate experiment, the same nanodots broke down a blue dye by 90 percent in just 20 minutes, demonstrating how powerful their chemical reactions can be even in complete darkness.

A Path Toward Gentler Cancer Treatments

Many existing cancer therapies damage healthy tissue along with tumors. Technologies that can selectively increase stress inside cancer cells may lead to treatments that are more targeted and less harmful.

Because the nanodots are made from a widely used metal oxide rather than costly or toxic noble metals such as gold or silver, they may also be more affordable and safer to manufacture.

Next Steps Toward Real-World Use

The COMBS research team at RMIT is continuing to advance the technology. Planned next steps include:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists reverse Alzheimer's in mice and restore memory","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251224032354.htm","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:15:25 GMT","

A study reveals that restoring the brain's energy balance may not just slow Alzheimer's -- but actually reverse it.

A Longstanding View of Alzheimer's Is Being Questioned

For more than 100 years, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been widely viewed as a condition that cannot be undone. Because of this belief, most scientific efforts have focused on preventing the disease or slowing its progression, rather than attempting to restore lost brain function. Even after decades of research and billions of dollars in investment, no drug trial for Alzheimer's has ever been designed with the goal of reversing the disease and recovering cognitive abilities.

That long-held assumption is now being challenged by researchers from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center. Their work set out to answer a bold question: can brains already damaged by advanced Alzheimer's recover?

New Study Targets Brain Energy Failure

The research was led by Kalyani Chaubey, PhD, of the Pieper Laboratory and published on December 22 in Cell Reports Medicine. By examining both human Alzheimer's brain tissue and multiple preclinical mouse models, the team identified a key biological failure at the center of the disease. They found that the brain's inability to maintain normal levels of a critical cellular energy molecule called NAD+ plays a major role in driving Alzheimer's. Importantly, maintaining proper NAD+ balance was shown to not only prevent the disease but also reverse it in experimental models.

NAD+ levels naturally decline throughout the body, including the brain, as people age. When NAD+ drops too low, cells lose the ability to carry out essential processes needed for normal function and survival. The researchers discovered that this decline is far more severe in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. The same pattern was seen in mouse models of the disease.

How Alzheimer's Was Modeled in the Lab

Although Alzheimer's occurs only in humans, scientists study it using specially engineered mice that carry genetic mutations known to cause the disease in people. In this study, researchers used two such models. One group of mice carried multiple human mutations affecting amyloid processing, while the other carried a human mutation in the tau protein.

Amyloid and tau abnormalities are among the earliest and most significant features of Alzheimer's. In both mouse models, these mutations led to widespread brain damage that closely mirrors the human disease. This included breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, damage to nerve fibers, chronic inflammation, reduced formation of new neurons in the hippocampus, weakened communication between brain cells, and extensive oxidative damage. The mice also developed severe memory and cognitive problems similar to those seen in people with Alzheimer's.

Testing Whether Alzheimer's Damage Could Be Reversed

After confirming that NAD+ levels dropped sharply in both human and mouse Alzheimer's brains, the team explored two possibilities. They tested whether maintaining NAD+ balance before symptoms appeared could prevent Alzheimer's, and whether restoring that balance after the disease had already progressed could reverse it.

This approach built on the group's earlier work published in Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA, which showed that restoring NAD+ balance led to both structural and functional recovery after severe, long-lasting traumatic brain injury. In the current study, the researchers used a well-characterized pharmacologic compound called P7C3-A20, developed in the Pieper laboratory, to restore NAD+ balance.

Full Cognitive Recovery Observed in Advanced Disease

The results were striking. Preserving NAD+ balance protected mice from developing Alzheimer's, but even more surprising was what happened when treatment began after the disease was already advanced. In those cases, restoring NAD+ balance allowed the brain to repair the major pathological damage caused by the genetic mutations.

Both mouse models showed complete recovery of cognitive function. This recovery was also reflected in blood tests, which showed normalized levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a recently approved clinical biomarker used to diagnose Alzheimer's in people. These findings provided strong evidence of disease reversal and highlighted a potential biomarker for future human trials.

Researchers Express Cautious Optimism

""We were very excited and encouraged by our results,"" said Andrew A. Pieper, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH. ""Restoring the brain's energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer's. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain's NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer's.""

Dr. Pieper also holds the Morley-Mather Chair in Neuropsychiatry at UH and the CWRU Rebecca E. Barchas, MD, DLFAPA, University Professorship in Translational Psychiatry. He serves as Psychiatrist and Investigator in the Louis Stokes VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC).

A Shift in How Alzheimer's Is Viewed

The findings suggest a fundamental change in how Alzheimer's could be approached in the future. ""The key takeaway is a message of hope -- the effects of Alzheimer's disease may not be inevitably permanent,"" said Dr. Pieper. ""The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.""

Dr. Chaubey added, ""Through our study, we demonstrated one drug-based way to accomplish this in animal models, and also identified candidate proteins in the human AD brain that may relate to the ability to reverse AD.""

Why This Approach Differs From Supplements

Dr. Pieper cautioned against confusing this strategy with over the counter NAD+-precursors. He noted that such supplements have been shown in animal studies to raise NAD+ to dangerously high levels that promote cancer The method used in this research relies instead on P7C3-A20, a pharmacologic agent that helps cells maintain healthy NAD+ balance during extreme stress, without pushing levels beyond their normal range.

""This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery,"" said Dr. Pieper.

Next Steps Toward Human Trials

The research also opens the door to additional studies and eventual testing in people. The technology is currently being commercialized by Glengary Brain Health, a Cleveland-based company co-founded by Dr. Pieper.

""This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients,"" Dr. Pieper explained. ""Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer's reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Your roommate's genes may be shaping your gut bacteria","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251223043938.htm","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 04:33:17 GMT","

The genes of your roommate may be shaping the bacteria in your gut, and your genes may be influencing theirs, according to a rat study published on December 18 in Nature Communications.

By examining more than four thousand rats, researchers found that the makeup of the gut microbiome is affected not only by an individual's own genetic makeup but also by the genes of the animals they share their living space with.

The findings point to a new way genetics and social interactions are connected. Certain commensal gut microbes can move between individuals through close contact. While genes themselves stay put, microbes do not. The study showed that some genes promote the growth of specific gut bacteria, and those bacteria can spread socially.

""This is not magic, but rather the result of genetic influences spilling over to others through social contact. Genes shape the gut microbiome and we found that it is not just our own genes that matter,"" says Dr. Amelie Baud, a researcher at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona and senior author of the study.

Three new gene microbe links identified in rats

The gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms living in the digestive tract, where they play important roles in digestion and overall health. Diet and medications are known to strongly influence these microbial communities, but understanding how genetics contributes has been far more challenging.

In humans, researchers have reliably linked only two genes to gut bacteria. The lactase gene determines whether adults can digest milk and affects milk digesting microbes. The ABO blood group gene also influences gut bacteria, though the exact mechanisms remain unclear.

Scientists believe additional gene microbe links likely exist, but proving them is difficult because genetic and environmental factors overlap in everyday life. Genes can shape diet and lifestyle choices, which then influence the gut microbiome. At the same time, families and friends often share food, living spaces, and microbes, making it hard to separate nature from nurture.

To overcome these challenges, researchers at the Centre for Genomic Regulation and the University of California San Diego turned to rats. Rats share many key aspects of mammalian biology and can be raised under tightly controlled conditions, including identical diets.

Each rat in the study was genetically unique and belonged to one of four separate cohorts. These cohorts were housed at different facilities across the United States and followed different care routines, allowing researchers to test whether genetic effects remained consistent across environments.

By combining genetic data with microbiome profiles from all 4,000 rats, the team identified three genetic regions that consistently influenced gut bacteria across all four cohorts.

The strongest association involved the gene St6galnac1, which adds sugar molecules to the mucus lining of the gut. This gene was linked to higher levels of Paraprevotella, a bacterium believed to feed on these sugars. This connection appeared in every cohort.

A second genetic region included several mucin genes that help form the gut's protective mucus layer and was associated with bacteria from the Firmicutes group. A third region contained the Pip gene, which produces an antibacterial molecule, and was linked to bacteria from the Muribaculaceae family. These bacteria are common in rodents and are also found in humans.

Genes can have social effects

The large size of the study allowed researchers, for the first time, to estimate how much of a rat's microbiome was shaped by its own genes versus the genes of the rats it lived with.

A familiar example of this concept, known as indirect genetic effects, occurs when a mother's genes influence her offspring's growth or immune system through the environment she provides.

In this study, controlled living conditions made it possible to examine indirect genetic effects in a new context. The researchers developed a computational model to separate the influence of a rat's own genes on its gut microbes from the influence of its social partners.

They found that the abundance of some Muribaculaceae bacteria was shaped by both direct and indirect genetic influences. This indicates that certain genetic effects can spread socially through the exchange of microbes.

When these social effects were added to a statistical model, the overall genetic influence on the three newly identified gene microbe links increased by four to eight times. The researchers caution that this may still underestimate the true extent of genetic influence.

""We've probably only uncovered the tip of the iceberg,"" says Dr. Baud. ""These are the bacteria where the signal is strongest, but many more microbes could be affected once we have better microbiome profiling methods.""

The findings describe a mechanism in which genetic effects from one individual can spread through social groups by way of gut microbes, changing the biology of others without altering their DNA.

If similar processes occur in humans, and given growing evidence that the gut microbiome plays an important role in health, genetic influences on human health may be underestimated in large population studies. Genes may shape not only an individual's disease risk, but also the disease risk of people around them.

What the findings could mean for human health

According to Dr. Baud, the microbiome has been linked to immune function, metabolism, and behavior. However, many reported associations do not necessarily reflect cause and effect, and the biological mechanisms are often unclear. Genetic studies using animal models in controlled environments can help move beyond correlations to testable explanations of how genes and gut microbes interact in health.

The researchers note that the rat gene St6galnac1 is functionally related to the human gene ST6GAL1, which has also been linked to Paraprevotella in previous studies. This suggests that the way animals coat their gut mucus with sugars may help determine which microbes thrive in the digestive system, potentially representing a shared mechanism across species.

The team also explored how this mechanism might influence infectious diseases such as COVID-19.

Other studies have linked ST6GAL1 to breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections, in which vaccinated individuals still become infected. Paraprevotella has also been shown to trigger the breakdown of digestive enzymes that the virus uses to enter host cells. Based on this, the researchers hypothesize that genetic variation in ST6GAL1 could affect Paraprevotella levels and, in turn, susceptibility to viral infection.

They also suggest a possible link to IgA nephropathy, an autoimmune kidney disease. Paraprevotella may alter IgA, an antibody that normally protects the gut. When altered, IgA can leak into the bloodstream and form clumps that damage the kidneys, which is a defining feature of IgA nephropathy.

Next, the researchers plan to closely examine how St6galnac1 affects Paraprevotella in rats and what chain reactions this relationship triggers in the gut and throughout the body.

""I am obsessed with this bacterium now. Our results are supported by data from four independent facilities, which means we can do follow up studies in any new setting. They're also remarkably strong compared with most host-microbiome links. It's a unique opportunity,"" Dr. Baud concludes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This new 3D chip could break AI's biggest bottleneck","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251223084857.htm","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 06:23:17 GMT","

Engineers from Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pennsylvania, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology worked with SkyWater Technology, the largest exclusively U.S. based pure play semiconductor foundry, to create a new multilayer computer chip. The team says its architecture could mark a major shift in AI hardware and strengthen domestic semiconductor innovation.

Unlike most of today's chips, which are mostly flat and 2D, this prototype is built to rise upward. Ultra thin parts are stacked like floors in a tall building, and vertical wiring works like many fast elevators that move huge amounts of data quickly. With a record setting number of vertical connections and a tightly woven layout that places memory and computing units close together, the design avoids slowdowns that have limited progress in flat chips. In hardware tests and simulations, the 3D chip beats 2D chips by roughly an order of magnitude.

Researchers have made experimental 3D chips in academic labs before, but the team says this is the first time one has delivered clear performance improvements and been produced in a commercial foundry. ""This opens the door to a new era of chip production and innovation,"" said Subhasish Mitra, the William E. Ayer Professor in Electrical Engineering and professor of computer science at Stanford University, and principal investigator of a new paper describing the chip presented at the 71st Annual IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM). ""Breakthroughs like this are how we get to the 1,000-fold hardware performance improvements future AI systems will demand.""

Why Flat Chips Struggle With Modern AI

Large AI models such as ChatGPT and Claude constantly shuttle enormous volumes of data between memory, which holds information, and the computing units that process it.

On conventional 2D chips, everything sits on one surface and memory is limited and spread out, so data is forced through a small number of long, crowded paths. The computing parts can run far faster than data can be delivered, and the chip cannot keep enough memory nearby. The result is frequent waiting. Engineers call this problem the ""memory wall,"" where processing speed outruns the chip's ability to feed it data.

For years, chipmakers pushed back against the memory wall by shrinking transistors, the tiny switches that handle computations and store data, and packing more of them onto each chip. But researchers say that approach is nearing hard physical limits, known as the ""miniaturization wall.""

The new design aims to get past both limits by building upward. ""By integrating memory and computation vertically, we can move a lot more information much quicker, just as the elevator banks in a high-rise let many residents travel between floors at once,"" said Tathagata Srimani, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, the paper's senior author, who began the work as a postdoctoral fellow advised by Mitra.

""The memory wall and the miniaturization wall form a deadly combination,"" said Robert M. Radway, assistant professor of electrical and systems engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the study. ""We attacked it head-on by tightly integrating memory and logic and then building upward at extremely high density. It's like the Manhattan of computing -- we can fit more people in less space.""

How the Monolithic 3D Chip Is Manufactured

Many earlier 3D chip efforts have taken a simpler route by stacking separate chips. That can help, but the links between layers are often relatively rough, limited in number, and can become bottlenecks.

This team used a different approach. Instead of making separate chips and bonding them together, they build each new layer directly on top of the previous one in a single continuous flow. This method, known as ""monolithic"" 3D integration, uses temperatures low enough to avoid harming the circuitry already built below. That makes it possible to pack layers more tightly and create far more dense connections between them.

A key point, the researchers say, is that the entire process was carried out in a domestic commercial silicon foundry. ""Turning a cutting-edge academic concept into something a commercial fab can build is an enormous challenge,"" said co-author Mark Nelson, vice president of technology development operations at SkyWater Technology. ""This shows that these advanced architectures aren't just possible in the lab -- they can be produced domestically, at scale, which is what America needs to stay at the forefront of semiconductor innovation.""

Performance Gains and What Comes Next for AI Hardware

In early hardware tests, the prototype outperformed comparable 2D chips by about four times. The team's simulations suggest even bigger gains as the design grows taller with more stacked layers of memory and compute. With additional tiers, the models show up to a twelve fold improvement on real AI workloads, including workloads derived from Meta's open source LLaMA model.

The researchers also highlight a longer range payoff. They say the architecture offers a practical route to 100 to 1,000 fold improvements in energy delay product (EDP), a metric that combines speed and energy efficiency. By shortening how far data needs to travel and adding many more vertical routes for movement, the chip can increase throughput while reducing energy per operation, a combination that has been difficult to achieve with conventional flat designs.

The team says the importance of the work is not only about speed. By demonstrating that monolithic 3D chips can be made in the United States, they argue it provides a blueprint for a new period of domestic hardware innovation where the most advanced chips can be designed and manufactured on U.S. soil.

They also say the shift to vertical, monolithic 3D integration will require a new generation of engineers trained in these methods, similar to how the integrated circuit boom of the 1980s was fueled by students learning chip design and fabrication in U.S. labs. Through collaborations and funding efforts including the Microelectronics Commons California-Pacific-Northwest AI Hardware Hub (Northwest-AI-Hub), students and researchers are already being prepared to push American semiconductor innovation forward.

""Breakthroughs like this are of course about performance,"" said H.-S. Philip Wong, the Willard R. and Inez Kerr Bell Professor in the Stanford School of Engineering and principal investigator of the Northwest-AI-Hub. ""But they're also about capability. If we can build advanced 3D chips, we can innovate faster, respond faster, and shape the future of AI hardware.""

This study took place at Stanford University School of Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University College of Engineering, the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and all fabrications were completed at SkyWater Technology's Bloomington, Minnesota, Foundry. Support came from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the U.S. National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, Samsung, the Stanford Precourt Institute for Energy, the Stanford SystemX Alliance, the Department of War's Microelectronics Commons AI Hardware Hub, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation's Future of Semiconductors Program (2425218).

Additional Stanford co-authors include Suhyeong Choi, Samuel Dayo, Andrew Bechdolt, Shengman Li, Dennis T. Rich, and R.H. Yang. Additional authors are from CMU and MIT.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This tiny peptide could help stop brain damage after injury","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251223084538.htm","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:45:21 GMT","

A global research team led by the company Aivocode, working with scientists from the Institute for Advanced Chemistry of Catalonia (IQAC) of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), reports that a small compound has a strong protective effect in mouse models of traumatic brain injury. The compound is a peptide made from four amino acids called CAQK.

In animal tests (mice and pigs), researchers gave CAQK through an IV soon after injury. The peptide was drawn to damaged parts of the brain because it is attracted to a protein that becomes unusually abundant in injured tissue after trauma. CAQK built up where this protein was concentrated and helped reduce inflammation, cell death, and harm to brain tissue. In mice, the treatment also improved functional recovery and showed no obvious toxicity.

Study details and plans for human trials

The findings were published in EMBO Molecular Medicine and point to new ways to treat injured brain regions. The work was led by Aivocode (a spin-off of the Sanford Burnham Prebys Institute) in San Diego, California, in partnership with IQAC-CSIC and the University of California, Davis.

Aivocode was founded by researchers Aman P. Mann, Sazid Hussain, and Erkki Ruoslahti (authors of the study). The company says it plans to seek permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin Phase I clinical trials in humans. No timeline has been announced, but CAQK's small size matters because it is a short peptide that is easier to manufacture and can penetrate tissue well, making it a promising drug candidate.

Traumatic brain injury and the lack of approved drugs

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) usually happens after a blow to the head, including injuries from traffic crashes, workplace accidents, or falls. It is estimated to affect around 200 people per 100,000 inhabitants each year. Today's care focuses on keeping patients stable by lowering intracranial pressure and preserving blood flow, yet there are no approved medicines that stop the brain damage itself or the secondary cascade that follows, including inflammation and cell death. Some experimental approaches also require direct injections into the brain, which is invasive and can lead to complications.

""The current interventions for treating acute brain injury aim to stabilize the patient by reducing intracranial pressure and maintaining blood flow, but there are no approved drugs to stop the damage and secondary effects of these injuries,"" explains Dr. Pablo Scodeller, researcher at IQAC-CSIC and co-author of the study.

A non-invasive approach and a key link to earlier research

Developing a non-invasive treatment for an injured brain remains one of neurology's biggest challenges. This study builds on earlier research from 2016 that was published in Nature Communications.

In that earlier work, researcher Aman P. Mann and Pablo Scodeller, working in Dr. Ruoslahti's lab at Sanford Burnham Prebys (senior author of both studies), identified a peptide that could home in on injured areas of the mouse brain. The peptide, CAQK, was found using peptide-phage display, a large-scale screening method that helps researchers select molecules that bind to specific tissues. At the time, CAQK served mainly as a ""vehicle"" to carry drugs directly to the injured region. The new study shows something more, that CAQK itself can have therapeutic effects.

How CAQK targets damaged tissue in mice and pigs

To test whether CAQK could work as a treatment, the team administered it intravenously soon after a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury. They then saw the peptide accumulate in injured brain tissue in both mice and pigs (the latter having brains more similar to humans than mice). The researchers also found that CAQK binds to glycoproteins (proteins attached to sugars), which increase after injury and are part of the extracellular matrix -- a supportive structure that surrounds brain cells.

When mice with traumatic brain injury received CAQK, their lesion sizes were smaller than those in control mice. ""We observed less cell death and lower expression of inflammatory markers in the injured area, indicating that CAQK alleviated neuroinflammation and its secondary effects. Behavioral and memory tests conducted after treatment also showed improvement in functional deficits, with no evident toxicity,"" explains the study's first author, Dr. Mann.

The results suggest that CAQK can support repair in damaged brain tissue and may have therapeutic value after trauma. ""What's exciting is that, in addition to proving highly effective, it's a very simple compound -- a short peptide that is easy to synthesize safely at large scale. Peptides with these characteristics show good tissue penetration and are non-immunogenic,"" concludes Scodeller.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","AI supercharges scientific output while quality slips","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251224032347.htm","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:55:22 GMT","

After ChatGPT became widely available in late 2022, many researchers started telling colleagues they could get more done with these new artificial intelligence tools. At the same time, journal editors reported a surge of smoothly written submissions that did not seem to add much scientific value.

A new Cornell study suggests those informal reports point to a broader change in how scientists are preparing manuscripts. The researchers found that large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can increase paper output, with especially strong benefits for scientists who are not native English speakers. But the growing volume of AI written text is also making it harder for key decision makers to tell meaningful work apart from low value content.

""It is a very widespread pattern, across different fields of science -- from physical and computer sciences to biological and social sciences,"" said Yian Yin, assistant professor of information science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. ""There's a big shift in our current ecosystem that warrants a very serious look, especially for those who make decisions about what science we should support and fund.""

The findings appear in a paper titled ""Scientific Production in the Era of Large Language Models,"" published Dec. 18 in Science.

How the Cornell Team Measured AI Use in Research Papers

To examine how LLMs are influencing scientific publishing, Yin's team compiled more than 2 million papers posted from January 2018 through June 2024 across three major preprint platforms. Those sites are arXiv, bioRxiv and Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Together, they represent the physical sciences, life sciences and social sciences, and they host studies that have not yet been through peer review.

The researchers used papers posted before 2023 that were presumed to be written by humans and compared them with AI generated text. From that comparison, they built a model designed to flag papers that were likely written with help from LLMs. Using this detector, they estimated which authors were probably using LLMs for writing, tracked how many papers those scientists posted before and after adopting the tools, and then checked whether the papers were later accepted by scientific journals.

Big Productivity Gains, Especially for Non Native English Speakers

The results showed a clear productivity jump linked to apparent LLM use. On arXiv, scientists flagged as using LLMs posted roughly one third more papers than those who did not appear to use AI. On bioRxiv and SSRN, the increase exceeded 50%.

The boost was largest for scientists who write in English as a second language and face extra hurdles when communicating technical work in a foreign language. For example, researchers affiliated with Asian institutions posted between 43.0% and 89.3% more papers after the detector suggested they began using LLMs, compared with similar researchers who did not appear to adopt the technology, depending on the preprint site. Yin expects the advantage could eventually shift global patterns of scientific productivity toward regions that have been held back by the language barrier.

AI Search May Broaden What Scientists Cite

The study also pointed to a potential benefit during literature searches and citation building. When researchers look for related work to cite, Bing Chat -- described as the first widely adopted AI powered search tool -- performed better at surfacing newer papers and relevant books than traditional search tools. Traditional tools, by contrast, were more likely to return older and more heavily cited sources.

""People using LLMs are connecting to more diverse knowledge, which might be driving more creative ideas,"" said first author Keigo Kusumegi, a doctoral student in the field of information science. He plans future research to test whether AI use is associated with more innovative and interdisciplinary science.

A New Problem for Peer Review and Research Evaluation

Even as LLMs help individuals produce more manuscripts, the same tools can make it harder for others to judge what is truly strong science. In human written papers, clearer yet more complex writing, including longer sentences and bigger words, has often been a useful signal of higher quality research. Across arXiv, bioRxiv and SSRN, papers likely written by humans that scored highly on a writing complexity test were also the most likely to be accepted by journals.

That pattern looked different for papers likely written with LLM assistance. Even when those AI flagged papers scored high on writing complexity, they were less likely to be accepted by journals. The researchers interpret this as a sign that polished language may no longer reliably reflect scientific value, and that reviewers may be rejecting some of these papers despite strong sounding writing.

Yin said this gap between writing quality and research quality could have serious consequences. Editors and reviewers may struggle more to identify the most valuable submissions, while universities and funding agencies may find that raw publication counts no longer reflect scientific contribution.

What Comes Next for Research on Generative AI

The researchers emphasize that these findings are observational. As a next step, they hope to test cause and effect using approaches such as controlled experiments, including designs where some scientists are randomly assigned to use LLMs and others are not.

Yin is also organizing a symposium on the Ithaca campus scheduled for March 3-5, 2026. The event will explore how generative AI is changing research and how scientists and policymakers can guide those changes.

As AI becomes more common for writing, coding and even generating ideas, Yin expects its influence to expand, effectively turning these systems into a kind of co scientist. He argues that policymakers should update rules to keep pace with the fast moving technology.

""Already now, the question is not, have you used AI? The question is, how exactly have you used AI and whether it's helpful or not.""

Study Authors and Funding

Co authors include Xinyu Yang, a doctoral student in the field of computer science; Paul Ginsparg, professor of information science in Cornell Bowers and of physics in the College of Arts and Sciences, and founder of arXiv; and Mathijs de Vaan and Toby Stuart of the University of California, Berkeley.

The research was supported by the National Science Foundation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","We are living in a golden age of species discovery","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251224032345.htm","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:08:54 GMT","

Roughly three centuries ago, Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus set out to catalog and name every living organism he could find. He is now widely regarded as the founder of modern taxonomy after introducing the binomial naming system and formally describing more than 10,000 species of plants and animals. Scientists have continued that mission ever since, steadily expanding humanity's understanding of Earth's biodiversity.

A new study led by researchers at the University of Arizona and published in Science Advances shows that the pace of discovery is accelerating. Today, scientists are identifying more than 16,000 new species each year, the highest rate ever recorded. The researchers say this trend is not slowing and suggest that groups such as plants, fungi, arachnids, fishes and amphibians are far more diverse than previously believed.

""Some scientists have suggested that the pace of new species descriptions has slowed down and that this indicates that we are running out of new species to discover, but our results show the opposite,"" said John Wiens, a professor in the University of Arizona Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, in the College of Science, and senior author of the paper. ""In fact, we're finding new species at a faster rate than ever before.""

What the Data Reveal About Global Biodiversity

To reach their conclusions, the team examined the taxonomic records of roughly 2 million species from across all major forms of life. Looking at the most recent period with comprehensive data, between 2015 and 2020, they found that researchers documented an average of more than 16,000 new species per year. These discoveries included more than 10,000 animals (dominated by arthropods and insects), about 2,500 plants, and roughly 2,000 fungi.

""Our good news is that this rate of new species discovery far outpaces the rate of species extinctions, which we calculated to about 10 per year,"" said Wiens, referring to another study he led that was published in October. ""These thousands of newly found species each year are not just microscopic organisms, but include insects, plants, fungi and even hundreds of new vertebrates.""

More Species Than Ever and Many Still Undiscovered

Wiens and his co-authors found that scientists are describing more species annually than at any other time in history. They also used long-term trends in discovery rates to estimate how many species may exist overall. Their projections suggest there could be as many as 115,000 fish species and 41,000 amphibian species, compared with about 42,000 fish and 9,000 amphibians currently described. The researchers also estimate that the total number of plant species could exceed half a million.

""As the famous ecologist Robert May said, if visiting aliens asked us how many species live on our planet, we would have no definitive answer,"" said Wiens. ""Right now, we know of about 2.5 million species, but the true number may be in the tens or hundreds of millions or even the low billions.""

The team expects the discovery rate to keep rising. For instance, scientists have formally identified around 1.1 million insect species, but many researchers estimate the real number is closer to 6 million. In earlier work, Wiens suggested the total could even approach 20 million.

""Right now, most new species are identified by visible traits,"" said Wiens. He explained that advances in molecular techniques are making it possible to detect species that look similar on the surface but differ genetically. This approach is especially promising for uncovering previously unrecognized bacteria and fungi.

Why Discovering New Species Matters

""Discovering new species is important because these species can't be protected until they're scientifically described,"" Wiens added. ""Documentation is the first step in conservation -- we can't safeguard a species from extinction if we don't know it exists.""

New discoveries also play a role in improving human health and technology. Many natural products come from living organisms, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, popular weight-loss drugs inspired by a hormone found in Gila monsters. Compounds from spider and snake venoms, along with substances produced by plants and fungi, are being studied for their potential to treat pain, cancer, and other conditions.

Beyond medicine, nature often inspires innovation. Some species have physical traits that serve as models for new materials and technologies, such as surfaces designed to mimic the ""super-clinging"" feet that allow geckos to scale vertical walls.

""We're still just scratching the surface of what these species can do for humanity,"" Wiens said.

Mapping the Future of Discovery

Looking ahead, the researchers plan to chart where new species are most frequently found to pinpoint regions rich in undiscovered life. They are also examining who is making these discoveries to see whether the field has shifted from being dominated by European scientists to researchers documenting species in their own home countries.

""Even though Linnaeus' quest to identify species began 300 years ago, 15% of all known species have been discovered in just the past 20 years,"" Wiens said. ""So much remains unknown, and each new discovery brings us closer to understanding and protecting the incredible biodiversity of life on our planet.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Apple's App Course Runs $20,000 a Student. Is It Really Worth It?","https://www.wired.com/story/apple-app-making-course-michigan-state-university/","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Two years ago, Lizmary Fernandez took a detour from studying to be an immigration attorney to join a free Apple course for making iPhone apps. The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit launched as part of the company's $200 million response to the Black Lives Matter protests and aims to expand opportunities for people of color in the country's poorest big city.

But Fernandez found the program's cost-of-living stipend lacking—“A lot of us got on food stamps,” she says—and the coursework insufficient for landing a coding job. “I didn't have the experience or portfolio,” says the 25-year-old, who is now a flight attendant and preparing to apply to law school. “Coding is not something I got back to.”

Since 2021, the academy has welcomed over 1,700 students, a racially diverse mix with varying levels of tech literacy and financial flexibility. About 600 students, including Fernandez, have completed its 10-month course of half-days at Michigan State University, which cosponsors the Apple-branded and Apple-focused program.

WIRED reviewed contracts and budgets and spoke with officials and graduates for the first in-depth examination of the nearly $30 million invested in the academy over the past four years—almost 30 percent of which came from Michigan taxpayers and the university's regular students. As tech giants begin pouring billions of dollars into AI-related job training courses across the country, the Apple academy offers lessons on the challenges of uplifting diverse communities.

Seven graduates who spoke with WIRED said they had good experiences at the academy, citing benefits such as receiving mentorship from past students. Fernandez says she was impressed by a focus on developing inclusive apps and a series of speakers from Apple who were genuinely willing to help and share frank lessons. “Their heart was in the right place,” she says.

The program does expose people of color to new possibilities. “It changed my life,” says Min Thu Khine, who's now mentoring coding students and working at an Apple Store Genius Bar. “My dream is to be a software engineer at Apple.”

The academy also draws positive grades from some researchers who study tech education, such as Quinn Burke. He says its fully subsidized in-person instruction surpasses the quality of many coding bootcamps, which proliferated over the past decade and sometimes left students in debt and with narrow skills.

But the academy being open to all can complicate instruction and how to measure success. One entire family attended together, and at least two mothers have come with their daughters. Students on average are in their 30s, ranging from 18-year-olds to, for example, a grandfather in his 70s who wanted to develop a photo app for his grandchild, according to Sarah Gretter, the academy leader for Michigan State.

On the other end are students such as Joey Brinker, a 20-year-old also taking a full course load at University of Michigan-Dearborn. “I found my grades improved,” he says, crediting the academy.

The program gives out iPhones and MacBooks and spends an estimated $20,000 per student, nearly twice as much as state and local governments budget for community colleges. Even so, Fernandez says, she leaned on waitressing shifts and government food aid to supplement the provided stipend and make it through the tuition-free academy.

Gordon Shukwit, a senior director at Apple overseeing the program in Detroit and 17 other Apple academies abroad that have been opened since 2013, says increasing student aid is a constant focus. The university declined to comment on cost per student estimates and comparisons to community college spending, saying that the academy offers an unparalleled experience.

About 70 percent of students graduate, which Gretter describes as higher than typical for adult education. She says the goal is for them to take “a next step,” whether a job or more courses.

Roughly a third of participants are under 25, and virtually all of them pursue further schooling. “I went in with zero coding experience or knowledge,” says Dayan Abdulla, 22, who graduated from the main program in June and works in quality assurance at a software startup while studying computer science at Henry Ford College. “I'm on a good trajectory,” he says.

About 71 percent of graduates from the last two years went onto full-time jobs across a variety of industries, according to academy officials. Amy J. Ko, a University of Washington computer scientist who researches computing education, calls under 80 percent typical for the coding schools she has studied but notes that one of her department's own undergraduate programs has a 95 percent job placement rate.

The academy also takes credit for spawning 62 apps and 13 businesses, such as an animation workshop for kids and a captioning tool for conferences. But Apple, the university, and another major funder—the Gilbert Family Foundation—declined to disclose the graduate-by-graduate employment data that the foundation requires the program to collect and share.

In response to a public records request, the university told WIRED in July that no such reports exist. On Tuesday, the university provided reports for some years, but they did not allow for a comprehensive analysis.

Susan Prescott, Apple's vice president of worldwide developer relations, says most graduates take on roles that involve coding, design, project management, and marketing skills honed at the academy. In the company's view, alumni success isn't fully captured in statistics. “We're excited to continue our partnership with Michigan State University and partners across the state to build on this success,” Prescott says.

Shukwit adds that the academy's primary goal is teaching teamwork, research, and technology skills relevant to any career students choose to pursue in the future. But the academy still carries risks for students. The emphasis is on learning Apple operating systems like iOS, and two graduates said their limited proficiency in competing platforms such as Android hurt their ability to find jobs.

The broader reality facing students is the global mobile app economy is growing more slowly than in the past and generative AI coding tools are threatening to wipe out some entry-level software engineering jobs. Underwriting a program built around iOS development may no longer be sensible in the years to come.

“The job market for junior developers and graduating computer science majors is certainly the worst it's been in some time,” says Ashley Rea Maharaj, an assistant professor in technical communication at University of North Texas.

Businesses have long funded and shaped training programs in fields like nursing and construction in the hopes of creating a workforce that benefits them. Last year, industry accounted for about $7.6 billion of voluntary support for US higher education, a small percentage of overall college and university budgets, according to the nonprofit Council for Advancement and Support of Education.

But now, tech companies are spending big on education, betting that the rise of AI will muddy traditional career paths. This year, Google committed to spending $1 billion over the next three years on AI education and job training programs in the US. Microsoft plans to outlay $4 billion in the next five years worldwide. A few months ago, Apple and Michigan State began putting millions of dollars a year into a separate program, the Apple Manufacturing Academy, to train small businesses on using AI in their factories.

The question looming over the developer academy and the other initiatives is whether they can keep pace with technologies that are evolving every few months and equip students with the resilience to navigate a rapidly shifting job market.

The Detroit academy, Apple's first and only in the US, was founded after CEO Tim Cook said the company must play a role in advancing racial equity. Michigan State was a natural partner because Apple had already agreed to support a separate undergraduate app design program at the university.

Public records show Apple signed a 3-year “scientific and technological cooperation agreement” with Michigan State in May 2021—several months after the initial announcement of the academy.

That announcement said Apple expected to help about 1,000 students each year “cultivate the skills necessary for jobs in the rapidly growing iOS app economy.” Though thousands now apply annually, the academy averages just a few hundred attendees each year across a four-week introductory program and a months-long intensive course.

Under the agreement, Apple provides the curriculum, devices, and some funding, while Michigan State handles instructors, classrooms, and recruitment. Use of any non-Apple software requires Apple's approval, the agreement states. In practice, officials say students are free to use and explore competing systems.

The contract allows for up to 200 students annually in the longer program, in which teams of students develop apps for Apple's App Store. About 50 graduates are invited for a second year, during which teams learn about client relations by developing apps for local organizations, such as the Detroit Historical Museum and the Michigan Black Business Alliance.

Funding is largely split between the university, Apple, and the Gilbert Family Foundation, the philanthropic organization of Michigan billionaire Dan Gilbert of Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage. The foundation committed to $11 million over five years.

Darnell Adams, a foundation vice president, says the Gilberts wanted to build ties to the Detroit community that Apple or the university—based 90 miles away in Lansing—could not as easily forge. “We needed to make sure Detroiters were equipped with the right skills to compete for tech jobs,” he says. The university's Gretter adds the funding arrangement has worked well.

Pete Lasher, a principal at management consultancy Huron who advises higher education institutions on fundraising, says he's encouraged by the university's “skin” in the deal because it typically leads to healthy alignment.

Previously unreported funding records for the academy's first four years show Apple contributed about $11.6 million. Gifts from the foundation and the university's credit union accounted for over $9.4 million. Nearly $2.6 million came from the state and non-academy students' tuition.

An additional $6 million from the state, effectively from taxpayers, helped cover the cost of living checks. The agreement between Apple and Michigan State requires the university to offer stipends “to ensure equal opportunities.”

Several graduates say they received about $800 to $1,500 a month, and while Fernandez found it insufficient, some viewed the money as transformative. “It helped me get out of debt, get my first car, and move out of my parents',” says Tyson Walker II, who acknowledges that making coding “his main thing” remains a distant dream.

Some current students are receiving less financial support than they expected, which Shukwit attributed to an unspecified new Michigan rule that he claims restricted access to state funding.

A current second-year student in their 20s, who declined to be named out of fear of retaliation, says the stipend for second-year students was cut to $800 from $1,500, amounting to about $9 an hour and forcing them to hold three side jobs. In addition, they say free parking passes, sick days, remote working, and collaboration spaces were also limited. “It makes it hard to just focus on school,” they say.

But they allege the biggest challenge is that many current second-year projects are for small businesses that are unclear about their goals for an app and seem unlikely to hire the students when they finish. “I was feeling hopeful about moving into the tech world, and it just feels like that isn't really going to be possible because I am not getting the experience,” the student says. “It creates a big uncertainty for us.”

By the time Fernandez graduated, she had been inspired: Coding was no longer “rocket science” to her. The politics undergrad was eager to break into software development, but she recognized that she wasn't the best coder.

Her team's final project, which was a drawing app, wasn't functional and never made it onto the App Store. Upon leaving, Fernandez wanted to develop a diet tracking app. She also hoped to take on freelance projects. None of it materialized. She never felt equipped and secure enough to fully abandon her dream of going to law school.

Fernandez wishes everyone could attend for two years, which is the case at some academies. “It was only halfway through that I started understanding concepts,” she says.

Apple's Shukwit says he loves that students want more, and adjustments are possible. The academy reworks its curriculum every few weeks. For example, when students wanted to develop apps for Apple Vision Pro headsets and Apple TV boxes, the academy added relevant workshops.

More recently, students have been using AI to auto-generate code, but they must be able to explain it all. AI can't be a shortcut to avoid learning, Shukwit says. Alumni can also access virtual lessons on generative AI.

Four years in, the academy has made a small dent in a big problem. The tech industry still has a massive lack of diversity and, in some cases, it has become less transparent about it. Apple's own data shows that its US tech workforce went from 6 percent Black before the Detroit academy opened to about 3 percent this year.

For some alums, their experiences at the academy and their unfulfilled dreams are constantly at their fingertips. “I use the MacBook all the time,” Fernandez says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Pinterest Users Are Tired of All the AI Slop","https://www.wired.com/story/pinterst-ai-slop-content/","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

For five years, Caitlyn Jones has used Pinterest on a weekly basis to find recipes for her son. In September, Jones spotted a creamy chicken and broccoli slow-cooker recipe, sprinkled with golden cheddar and a pop of parsley. She quickly looked at the ingredients and added them to her grocery list. But just as she was about to start cooking, having already bought everything, one thing stood out: The recipe told her to start by “logging” the chicken into the slow cooker.

Confused, she clicked on the recipe blog's “About” page. An uncannily perfect-looking woman beamed back at her, golden light bouncing off her apron and tousled hair. Jones realized instantly what appeared to be going on: The woman was AI-generated.

“Hi there, I'm Souzan Thorne!” the page read. “I grew up in a home where the kitchen was the heart of everything.” The accompanying images were flawless but odd, the biography vague and generic.

“It seems dumb I didn't catch this sooner, but being in my normal grocery shop rush, I didn't even think this would be an issue,” says Jones, who lives in California. Backed into a culinary corner, she made the dubious dish, and it wasn't good: The watery, bland chicken left a bad taste in her mouth.

Needing to vent, she turned to the subreddit r/Pinterest, which has become a town square for disgruntled users. “Pinterest is losing everything people loved, which was authentic Pins and authentic people,” she wrote. She says that she's since sworn off the app entirely.

“AI slop” is a term for low-quality, mass-produced, AI-generated content clogging up the internet, from videos to books to posts on Medium. And Pinterest users say the site is rife with it.

It's an “unappetizing gruel being forcefully fed to us,” Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, wrote in his recently published taxonomy of AI slop. And “Souzan”—for whom a Google search doesn't turn up a single result—is only the tip of the iceberg.

“All platforms have decided this is part of the new normal,” Mantzarlis tells WIRED. “It is a huge part of the content being produced across the board.”

Pinterest launched in 2010 and marketed itself as a “visual discovery engine for finding ideas.” The site remained ad-free for years, building a loyal community of creatives. It has since grown to over half a billion active users. But, according to some unhappy users, their feeds have begun to reflect a very different world in recently.

Pinterest's feed is mostly images, which means it's more susceptible to AI slop than video-led sites, says Mantzarlis, as realistic images are typically easier for models to generate than videos. The platform also funnels users toward outside sites, and those outbound clicks are easier for content farms to monetize than on-site followers.

An influx of ads may also be partly to blame. Pinterest has rebranded itself as an “AI-powered shopping assistant.” To do this, it began showering feeds with more targeted ads in late 2022, which can be “great content” for users, CEO Bill Ready told investors at the time. When WIRED searched for “ballet pumps” on a new Pinterest account using a browser in incognito mode, over 40 percent of the first 73 Pins shown were ads.

Last year, Pinterest also launched a generative AI tool for advertisers. Synthetic content enhances users' ability “to discover and act on their inspiration,” the company wrote in an April blog.

AI slop has proliferated on every social media site in recent years. But Pinterest users say this content betrays the site's function as a marketplace for trading real-world inspiration.

“It is the antithesis of the platform it once was, unabashedly prioritizing consumerism, ad revenue, and non-human slop over the content that carries the entire premise of the site on its shoulders,” says college student Sophia Swatling. Growing up in a rural upstate New York, she struggled to find likeminded creatives who shared her hobbies. Pinterest was a lifeline.

“The greed and exploitation has become steadily more obtrusive, and has now reached a point where the user experience is entirely marred,” says Swatling.

The issues Pinterest users raise would fall into a category that Cory Doctorow, the Canadian activist, journalist and sci-fi author, calls “enshittification,” which refers to the gradual decay of internet platforms people rely on due to relentless profit-seeking at the expense of user experience.

While Pinterest's user count may be growing, that doesn't mean they like the slop, Doctorow says. New arrivals may feel there's no alternative, while old ones may hate slop less than they love the Pins and boards they've shared and saved over the years, he explains.

Companies know that people's digital trails are a “powerful force,” Doctorow tells WIRED, allowing them to act without penalty. “To me, that's where enshittification lies, right?”

If Pinterest hoped that leaning into AI would be enough to accelerate its fortunes, it hasn't worked out that way. The company's shares tanked 20 percent last month after its third quarter earnings and revenue outlook fell short of analysts' expectations.

Clicking on Pins containing what appeared to be AI-generated images on Pinterest took WIRED to blogs featuring generically-worded listicles offering vague advice, paired with pictures that have the eerily polished hallmarks of AI. They were also littered with banner ads and pop-ups.

""It's like endless window shopping but there is no store, no door, no sign. It's just really nice-looking windows,” says Janet Katz, 60, a long-term Pinterest user from Austin, Texas. When redesigning her living room this year, she kept noticing images where the furniture dimensions didn't add up–chairs defying physics, coffee tables balanced precariously on two legs.

“It's the décor equivalent of the uncanny valley,” Katz says. “It looks close to real, but there's something not quite right.”

WIRED tried clicking on 25 ads for the search term “ballet pumps” on Pinterest, which led to ecommerce sites that followed a pattern: steeply discounted apparel, no physical address, and often featuring a glossy, synthetic-seeming picture of the boutique's owner paired with an origin story. “I grew up in a family full of love for art, craftsmanship, and tradition,” one such site declares. On two near-identical sites, retired couples announce they're closing their doors after “26 unforgettable years” in New York City.

The boutiques have several hallmarks of a phenomenon known as “ghost stores,” an online scam whereby fake websites are created, claiming to sell high-quality products at significant discounts due to closing down.

“The whole means of production around these sorts of campaigns has radically changed,” Henry Ajder, a generative AI expert and co-founder of the University of Cambridge's AI in Business Program, tells WIRED. “It's more realistic, it's less expensive, and it's more accessible. That all comes together to make a compelling package for saturating platforms with synthetic spam,” he says.

The websites did not respond to WIRED's request for comment. When WIRED shared these sites with Pinterest, they deactivated 15 of them for violating policies that prohibit Pins that link to deceptive, untrustworthy or unoriginal websites.

“While many people enjoy GenAI content on Pinterest, we know some want to see less of it,” a Pinterest spokesperson told WIRED, referencing tools for users to limit AI-generated content. They added that Pinterest prohibits “harmful ads and content, including spam—whether it's GenAI or not.”

The influx of AI-generated content has made some users paranoid that content from humans is being lost amid the rising tide.

A common complaint on r/Pinterest is from users who say their impressions have rapidly dropped for reasons unbeknownst to them, but they suspect that AI is drowning them out. Software engineer Moreno Dizdarevic, who also runs a YouTube channel investigating ecommerce scams, has worked with small businesses who share those complaints.

One of his clients, a stay-at-home mom and jewelry maker, no longer receives comments or likes on her Pins, and garners less than 5,000 page views each month. She's found much more success when posting on Instagram or TikTok, says Dizdarevic, because there's “still a bit more of a human connection,” which offers her an edge.

In April, citing complaints from users, Pinterest introduced “Gen AI Labels” that disclose when content is “AI modified.” Then, in October, it rolled out tools allowing users to customize how much AI-generated content they see.

But the labels only appear once a user clicks on a Pin, not in the feed itself, and they aren't applied to ads. WIRED found several AI-generated Pins that weren't labeled as such.

The sea of AI-generated user content and ads has created a paradox for tech firms, Ajder says: “How on earth do you prove that the eyeballs you're selling are actually eyeballs?” he asks.

Companies may shift toward tools that verify human-made content, says Ajder. The French music-streaming service Deezer, for example, pledged to remove fully AI-generated tracks from its algorithmic recommendations, after disclosing in September that such uploads now make up 28 percent of daily submissions, equivalent to 30,000 songs per day.

For Jones, though, the transformation on Pinterest already feels complete. What was once a place of authentic inspiration has become, in her words, “depressing.”

For years, the cost of using “free” services from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other Big Tech firms has been handing over your data. Uploading your life into the cloud and using free tech brings conveniences, but it puts personal information in the hands of giant corporations that will often be looking to monetize it. Now, the next wave of generative AI systems are likely to want more access to your data than ever before.

Over the past two years, generative AI tools—such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini—have moved beyond the relatively straightforward, text-only chatbots that the companies initially released. Instead, Big AI is increasingly building and pushing toward the adoption of agents and “assistants” that promise they can take actions and complete tasks on your behalf. The problem? To get the most out of them, you'll need to grant them access to your systems and data. While much of the initial controversy over large language models (LLMs) was the flagrant copying of copyrighted data online, AI agents' access to your personal data will likely cause a new host of problems.

“AI agents, in order to have their full functionality, in order to be able to access applications, often need to access the operating system or the OS level of the device on which you're running them,” says Harry Farmer, a senior researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, whose work has included studying the impact of AI assistants and found that they may cause “profound threat” to cybersecurity and privacy. For personalization of chatbots or assistants, Farmer says, there can be data trade-offs. “All those things, in order to work, need quite a lot of information about you,” he says.

While there's no strict definition of what an AI agent actually is, they're often best thought of as a generative AI system or LLM that has been given some level of autonomy. At the moment, agents or assistants, including AI web browsers, can take control of your device and browse the web for you, booking flights, conducting research, or adding items to shopping carts. Some can complete tasks that include dozens of individual steps.

While current AI agents are glitchy and often can't complete the tasks they've been set out to do, tech companies are betting the systems will fundamentally change millions of people's jobs as they become more capable. A key part of their utility likely comes from access to data. So, if you want a system that can provide you with your schedule and tasks, it'll need access to your calendar, messages, emails, and more.

Some more advanced AI products and features provide a glimpse into how much access agents and systems could be given. Certain agents being developed for businesses can read code, emails, databases, Slack messages, files stored in Google Drive, and more. Microsoft's controversial Recall product takes screenshots of your desktop every few seconds, so that you can search everything you've done on your device. Tinder has created an AI feature that can search through photos on your phone “to better understand” users' “interests and personality.”

Carissa Véliz, an author and associate professor at the University of Oxford, says most of the time consumers have no real way to check if AI or tech companies are handling their data in the ways they claim to. “These companies are very promiscuous with data,” Véliz says. “They have shown to not be very respectful of privacy.”

The modern AI industry has never really been respectful of data rights. After the machine-learning and deep-learning breakthroughs of the early 2010s showed that the systems could produce better results when they are trained on more data, the race to hoover up as much information as possible intensified. Face recognition firms, such as Clearview, scraped millions of photos of people from across the web. Google paid people just $5 for facial scans; official government agencies allegedly used images of exploited children, visa applicants, and dead people to test their systems.

Fast forward a few years, and data-hungry AI firms scraped huge swaths of the web and copied millions of books—often without permission or payment—to build the LLMs and generative AI systems they're currently expanding into agents. Having exhausted much of the web, many companies made it their default position to train AI systems on user data, making people opt out instead of opt in.

While some privacy-focused AI systems are being developed, and some privacy protections are in place, much of the data processing by agents will take place in the cloud, and data moving from one system to another could cause problems. One study, commissioned by European data regulators, outlined a host of privacy risks linked to agents, including: how sensitive data could be leaked, misused, or intercepted; how systems could transmit sensitive information to external systems without safeguards in place; and how data handling could rub up against privacy regulations.

“Even if, let's say, you genuinely consent and you genuinely are informed about how your data is used, the people with whom you interact might not be consenting,” Véliz, the Oxford associate professor, says. “If the system has access to all of your contacts and your emails and your calendar and you're calling me and you have my contact, they're accessing my data too, and I don't want them to.”

The behavior of agents can also threaten existing security practices. So-called prompt-injection attacks, where malicious instructions are fed to an LLM in text it reads or ingests, can lead to leaks. And if agents are given deep access to devices, they pose a threat to all data included on them.

“The future of total infiltration and privacy nullification via agents on the operating system is not here yet, but that is what is being pushed by these companies without the ability for developers to opt out,” Meredith Whittaker, the president of the Signal Foundation, which runs the encrypted Signal messaging app, told WIRED earlier this year. Agents that can access everything on your device or operating system pose an “existential threat” to Signal and application-level privacy, Whittaker said. “What we're calling for is very clear developer-level opt-outs to say, ‘Do not fucking touch us if you're an agent.'”

For individuals, Farmer from the Ada Lovelace Institute says many people have already built up intense relationships with existing chatbots and may have shared huge volumes of sensitive data with them during the process, making them different from other systems that have come before. “Be very careful about the quid pro quo when it comes to your personal data with these sorts of systems,” Farmer says. “The business model these systems are operating on currently may well not be the business model that they adopt in the future.”

Craighill

Resketch

Amazon

Ergonofis

I have never had a bare desk in my life. Those minimalist setups you see online? My workspace is the complete opposite, overflowing with gizmos, tchotchkes from my travels, and an overabundance of gear. If you're looking to spruce up your home office desktop (or maybe gift a friend who works from home), I've got several fun options for you, from functional stationery to gorgeous paperweights.

Be sure to check out our other home office guides, including the Best WFH Gear, Best Standing Desks, Best Office Chairs, and Best Computer Monitors.

Craighill

Craighill

It took me embarrassingly longer than expected to complete Craighill's Jack Puzzle. It comes fully assembled, but I regretfully pulled the six metal bars apart seconds after I unboxed it, and then spent more than 40 minutes trying to figure out how to put it back together. It's not just about which piece goes where—the whole thing can be a little tricky to hold as you assemble it, which adds to the difficulty. Thankfully, I completed it, and this hefty brass amalgamation of rods now proudly sits as a paperweight on my desk. It also comes in stainless steel.

Resketch

Resketch

Why buy the usual stack of Post-Its when you can get Resketch's Notepad and save the environment a bit? Each stack has 175 3x3 sheets, and it's important to know that, unlike Post-Its, there's no adhesive—don't buy these if you plan to stick notes all over your desk or wall. Instead, the entire stack is made from reclaimed paper sourced in the US; you can easily tear off a piece to write on it. As you flip through the pad, you'll notice some sheets are lined, and some are colorful—each stack is unique.

If the Notepad isn't for you, but you like Resketch's ethos, you can opt for standard notebooks, reporter-style handbooks, and even journals. I also quite like the company's Hex Pencil, if you prefer a pencil over a pen.

Novium

Amazon

Novium

It feels like something you'd find on Agent Zed's desk in Men in Black—the Novium Hoverpen is a ballpoint pen that hovers in place on its dock thanks to a bevy of magnets. The best part is you can spin the top, and the pen will rotate in place—fun! Getting it back on the dock perfectly will take a few attempts as you have to angle it just the right way, but it gets easier over time.

The ballpoint writes nicely, and you can refill the Schmidt cartridges (Novium also sells a kit). There's an included pincer tool to pull out the ink cartridge from the pen.

Ergonofis

Ergonofis

Ergonofis sells this solid porcelain Desk Accessories Set as a bundle, but you can also buy each item individually. I don't care for the Catch-All Tray much, but I really like the Vertical Laptop Dock, Pencil Holder, and Headphone Stand, especially in the blush color. There's a cork underpad on these to keep your desktop scuff-free. I've stored my 16-inch MacBook Pro on the laptop stand with no issues, and my headphones are neatly rocking just fine.

I wouldn't have minded a little more heft to the pencil holder, because if you put a heavy item in there (like a nice pair of scissors), it doesn't take much to tip over. Outside of this, this set is an elegant way to get some matching accessories for all your desk gear. I also like Ergonofis' Leather Desk Pad, though at that price, I prefer Harber London's option (see below).

Harber London

Harber London

I have tried numerous desk mats now, but I keep coming to this one from Harber London. I don't like mats that are too stiff, but this supple leather pad is soft, flexible, and does a remarkable job of staying put. After a year of use, it still looks great (it's very easy to clean), and the “Medium” size option is perfect for my keyboard and mouse, plus a little extra. (You can also go for a Large or XL size, if you have a large enough desk.)

Craighill

Craighill

I don't think I've ever used a pair of scissors as impressive as the Chroma from Craighill. They cut smoothly and precisely, with vinyl-dipped handles that are nice and grippy. It comes in Blue, Stainless Steel, Black, and Primary, but the latter is my favorite, and apparently everyone else's, considering it's often sold out. Whichever color you buy, the Chroma will proudly stand out in your pencil case.

Native Union

Native Union

It's no landline, but this playful accessory from Native Union can give you a blast from the past. Plug the Pop Phone into your smartphone (via the USB-C plug), and you can take your calls just like we all used to on a rotary phone or phone booth. There's something about the shape, size, and heft that makes it so much nicer for phone calls than today's smartphones. There's even a button right in the middle to answer or end a call. My family and friends on the other end didn't seem to have any issues with my microphone quality, and I could hear them loud and clear.

Keep it on your desk, ready for when someone calls. I only wish there were a dedicated dock I could place it on, to emulate slamming the phone down to hang up.

Genki

Genki

Most power strips are designed to be out of sight and out of mind; hulking, ugly black, white, or grey strips stowed under the desk, never to be seen again. Not the Moonbase. If you're frequently plugging in various gadgets, you'll want to pop this power strip on your desk for everyone to see, and it'll handle the job in style. The three AC chargers at the top subtly glow—you can press a button on the side to change the colors!—and there are four USB-C ports at the end: two 30W, one 100W, and one 140W. It comes with a nice, color-matching braided 1.5-meter power cable.

It's not all style either. Genki claims several features that keep your devices protected, including surge protection, overcurrent protection, temperature control, and safety door shutters, not to mention support for multiple fast charging standards, from Power Delivery 3.1 to Qualcomm's Quick Charge.

Gingko Design

Amazon

MoMA Design Store

Gingko Design

I've got a few substantial task light options further below, but look at this adorable little table lamp! It's a fun little gizmo for any desk, though you can also buy it in a large size. Tap the top for the light to turn it on, and tap it again to change from a warm white to a range of colors (you can tap and hold to cycle through the color spectrum). It operates off a USB-C rechargeable battery, which should last 15 hours on a single charge, but you can also keep it running via the cable. If you prefer working with a minimal amount of light, the Sylva can help maintain that ambiance.

MoMA Design Store

MoMA Design Store

My home is a funhouse of colors, so it makes sense that my pencil case is too. Functional and affordable, this acrylic Colorplay Pen & Pencil Cup Holder from the MoMA Design Store is striking on a desk with a fun mix of amber and pink or blue and green. The top part can hold your pens, pencils, and scissors, while the bottom cup is good for paperclips and other bits and pieces. As WIRED's smartphone reviewer, I've tossed various SIM ejection pins in there, ready whenever I need to swap devices.

Speks

Amazon

Speks

I have played around with a variation of these magnetic, er, balls from Speks for a few years now, ranging from the very loud Supers 33-mm Magnet Balls to these silicone-clad Odds, which are virtually silent when you fidget them around in your hand. The magnetic strength isn't as strong as the Supers, but they're not going to annoy everyone else in the house (or office), and the silicone feels quite soft. You can get them in different shapes or textures. They're great for those meetings that tend to run long—the sort that could have been an email.

Gantri

Gantri

Lumens

2Modern

Gantri's lights are 3D printed from plant-based polymers, and it uses a water-based paint. (You can read more about the company here.) I've tried a handful of its lamps, and they're all uniquely designed statement pieces that are also functional. There's a dizzying number of table lamps to choose from, but I like the Analog Task Light. Gantri even lets you customize the colors of the lamp itself. You can rotate the light cube to position the light on your workspace, and the E12 bulb doesn't get glaringly bright (around 600 lumens at 2700K color temperature). And yes, you can replace the bulb.

Smartish

Amazon

I've tried so many cable organizers, but Smartish's Cable Wrangler is still by far the best. This wedge comes with two magnetic straps for each of your charging cables, allowing the wires to stay neatly in one place, tethered to the Wrangler. Separate the cable and the wedge when you need to charge a device, and put it back when you're done. It's simple, effective, and affordable.

Craighill

Craighill

Don't just toss your specs on the desk when you need a second to rub your eyes after that painful hour-long company meeting. Pop ‘em on this eyewear stand from Craighill instead. The cast-metal construction is hefty, keeping it in one place on your desk, and it looks gorgeous in brass (stainless steel is also an option). Placing the glasses in the groove is easy, and I've tried several pairs without fail—they all fit. And hey, it's heavy enough to use as a paperweight when you're not using it to carry your glasses.

Nomad

Nomad

I've long liked the look of Nomad's Stand One wireless charger—a mix of metal and glass blended beautifully. This fourth-gen model is the latest, now finally with Qi2 25W compatibility, meaning the latest smartphones that support this charging standard will be able to charge super fast. (That includes the iPhone 16 and 17 range, plus the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL.) It's also a good way to future-proof your wireless charger, as more and more phones will support Qi2 25W, even if yours doesn't right now. And as long as you have a MagSafe or Qi2 smartphone, you'll still be able to wirelessly charge your device on the Stand One.

The only catch you need to know is that Nomad doesn't include a charging adapter in the box, just a USB-C cable. You'll need at least a 40-watt adapter to get the most out of it.

Why take up valuable desk space when you can mount your desk lamp over your monitor? I've raved about BenQ's ScreenBar lights before, and now I've finally had a chance to try the ScreenBar Halo 2. This version doesn't have any of the controls on top of the light, but instead uses a wireless, USB-C rechargeable remote. You can smoothly rotate this remote to cycle through color temperature and brightness, and there's a backlight on the Halo you can turn on for even more illumination. The best part is presence detection, meaning the light boots up your workspace when you sit down, and turns off automatically when you're AFK.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Stop Treating Your Monitor Like a Printer. Here's How to Buy One You'll Actually Like","https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-choose-a-computer-monitor/","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

Most people treat their monitor like a printer. They just want it to work without having to think about it. But if you work from home or spend hours gaming every night, it's worth an upgrade. And that's where things can get complicated. Do you pay extra for more ports? Or for a large display? How about something with smart features so it can double as a television—or springing for one of those flashy OLED monitors? Those are all worthwhile features, but don't splurge for the latest thing before you know what you're getting into.

If you're looking to upgrade from a basic 1080p monitor you've been using for a decade, I recommend buying the Dell 27 Plus 4K. It's sharp, has good colors, and is shockingly affordable. I knew right when I tested it that it would be unbeatable at its price, and I promise: I won't be offended if you skip all my words and buy that immediately. But if you're shopping around, I have advice ranging from panel types to refresh rate. Let's dive in.

For our full recommendations, check out our Best Monitors and Best Gaming Monitors guides.

For more information on panel types, read our in-depth look at the tech that distinguishes these panel types from each other.

The standard type of monitor panel these days is still LED (light-emitting diodes), which refers to the way the screen is backlit. This isn't the brightest or most color-accurate type of panel, but it's grown into the cheapest and most widely accessible option. Within the category of LED backlighting, there are also a variety of LCD (liquid crystal display) types. IPS (in-plane switching) is the most common, while VA (vertical alignment) is still used in some cheaper creator-focused monitors, and TN (twisted nematic) is available in some lower-end gaming monitors. But IPS has become the standard.

Fortunately, there has been some development on IPS over the years, which improves various elements of the image quality. You'll see “IPS Black” in various LG or Dell monitors, which improves the contrast to closer to 2,000:1. There's even a second version of IPS Black (known as IPS Black 2.0 or Enhanced IPS Black) that claims to push contrast up to 3,000:1. I've also tested Nano IPS, another advanced version of IPS from LG that improves the color gamut. I've tested a 6K monitor that uses Nano IPS Black, combining them all together to produce one of the best IPS displays possible. As good as these are, though, they can't achieve the highs of more advanced forms of backlighting.

OLED (organic light-emitting diodes) is the other primary option these days. For so long, it had been kept away from PC monitors and only used in televisions and smartphones. But over the past couple of years, OLED has become a popular high-end option, especially in the world of gaming monitors. As opposed to LED, OLED uses individually-backlit pixels, meaning each can be turned on and off entirely.

This is why it's able to achieve what is sometimes called “infinite” contrast. If you can get to complete black, the only thing holding back your dynamic range is brightness. The crop of OLED panels, whether manufactured by LG (known as W-OLED) or Samsung (known as QD-OLED), typically range up to a claimed 1,000 nits of peak HDR (high dynamic range) brightness. That means in HDR content, some portion of the screen hits 1,000 nits, giving the image brighter highlights. Some OLED monitors don't get very bright in SDR (standard dynamic range), which is important to consider, as that's how you will use the screen most of the time.

Contrast and brightness aren't the only benefits. Viewing angles are significantly better, there's a shorter response time (more on that later), and you don't have light bleed to deal with along the edges of the screen. Most OLED monitors also have great color performance as well, though it differs panel-to-panel. The only thing holding back adoption was price, and that has come down drastically in just the past year or so. When OLED gaming monitors first launched in 2022, there was nothing under $1,000. These days, you can get one for as low as $500. We've also seen OLED now supported at different screen sizes, resolutions, and refresh rates. A few nongaming OLED monitors for creators even launched this year, including the Dell 32 Plus QD-OLED and Samsung Smart Monitor M90SF.

Other than price, the risk of burn-in has been the other hurdle to overcome in the wide adoption of OLED in monitors—that's when you'll see the afterimage of static elements of the screen. With so many static elements on a computer monitor, such as the menus and taskbars, you might think the risk of burn-in isn't worth it. These days, manufacturers use various techniques to prevent burn-in, such as automated pixel refreshes and pixel shifting. Most manufacturers also offer longer warranties, sometimes up to three years. Long-term testing in the industry has shown that while burn-in is possible, it's not something most people have to worry about anymore.

This third option is a bit more uncommon, but it still pops up from time to time. Like OLED, mini-LED refers to a form of monitor backlighting that is somewhere between traditional LED and OLED. Mini-LED displays use various zones of lighting to improve contrast and brightness. These are known as dimming zones, and the more a screen has, the better.

On current monitors, mini-LED displays can get brighter than OLED, both in SDR and HDR. But again, it's all about the ratio of dimming zones to the screen size. You do not want to buy a cheap mini-LED gaming monitor like this one with only 337 dimming zones across its 27-inch screen, while a monitor like the KTC M27T6 has 1,152 zones for only $30 more. The difference in contrast between these two screens is massive.

The number of dimming zones isn't the only important spec in a mini-LED display, as Apple's 32-inch Pro Display XDR has just 576 dimming zones, yet has exceptional contrast and brightness. The fine-tuning of the dimming zone algorithm matters here too, which is why quality varies in mini-LED panels. That said, mini-LED hasn't enjoyed the adoption that OLED has, and outside of Apple, there aren't many nongaming options out there. As outlined in a white paper on the matter, Apple chose it for very specific reasons, including for its “better uniformity, sustained thermal and brightness performance, off-axis viewing characteristics, and resistance to permanent burn-in.” While OLED might be the future of monitors, mini-LED is going to continue to play a role in the near future as the brighter and more efficient option.

Monitors have seen an explosion of experimental new shapes and sizes over the past few years. Overall, they've gotten bigger, but we've also seen different trends, such as curves or wider aspect ratios. The standard aspect ratio is still 16:9, with sizes ranging from 25 inches up to 43 inches. Just remember that if you're getting into television sizes, you'll need a desk big enough to handle it.

But 16:9 is hardly the only option these days. Ultrawide monitors, with their 21:9 aspect ratio, have become a popular shape, especially for PC gamers. This gives you a wider view in games, but it's also a solid alternative to using dual screens for multitasking. The 34-inch size has become the go-to form factor, but there are also larger versions of 21:9 that measure 38 or 40 inches across.

If you really want to go big, though, there are some insane 32:9 aspect-ratio monitors out there, also known as super ultrawide. These monstrosities are sold in either the 45-inch or 49-inch size. In general, I wouldn't recommend them unless you have a specific use case in mind.

Whether it's standard ultrawide or super ultrawide, these monitors almost always come with a curve, immersing you a bit more in the center of the screen. This is measured and marketed as the radius of the curve in millimeters. For example, this 49-inch super ultrawide monitor has a 3800R curve, which is a very gentle curvature, slightly pulling the sides in. On the other hand, an 800R curve is the most aggressive curve you'll find on a monitor, which isn't great for work but really doubles down on in-game immersion. For my money, the 1800R curve on the 34-inch Alienware 34 QD-OLED feels just right.

There's nothing more important than the sharpness of your monitor. We tend to only think of that in terms of resolution, but the real measure is pixel density, or pixels per inch (ppi). 1080p might look OK on your 13-inch laptop screen, but stretched out on your 27-inch monitor, you'll be able to see those pixels. That's why I always recommend considering both the resolution and size hand-in-hand. Below, you'll see them listed out in terms ppi, depending on what size or resolution monitor you're considering. The more ppi, the sharper the image will be. And for reference, a 13-inch MacBook Air has a pixel density of 221 ppi, while a 14-inch MacBook Pro clocks in at 254 ppi.

5K and 6K monitors are finally getting closer to the sharpness of high-end laptops. We typically sit farther back from monitors since they are larger, though, so that increase in sharpness may not be as easily perceived. For remote office work and content creators, I recommend getting a monitor with over 100 ppi to attain a sharpness you'll be satisfied with over the long haul. Increasingly, you can get 4K 27-inch monitors for well under $300.

This equation is different for gaming monitors, which tend to lean more toward lower resolutions. For gaming, you're looking for the right balance of resolution and refresh rate.

The refresh rate is what affects the smoothness of motion and animation on the screen. Measured in hertz (Hz), it's the speed at which the display can refresh itself to show new information. For the longest time, it was assumed that all monitors and screens had a 60-Hz refresh rate. But as PC performance increased, gaming monitors were quick to begin offering higher frame rates, and the ceiling only continues to rise.

The refresh rate is only as useful as the frames per second (fps) of the game you're playing. A 240-Hz refresh rate won't do you much good if you can only get Cyberpunk 2077 to 80 fps. That's why anything over 240 Hz is only noticeable and beneficial for competitive esports gamers looking to get an edge over their opponents.

A higher refresh rate has also become a more common mainstay in mainstream or professional monitors. 120-Hz makes everything on your monitor feel smoother, including animations on websites and even the drag of the cursor across the screen. It's not even a particularly premium feature anymore, showing up in monitors like the Dell Plus 27 4K.

This is a point of confusion for PC gamers, as the terms often get thrown around interchangeably. Input lag and response time might feel like a similar problem, but they have very different causes. Input lag is a system-wide measurement, while response time is specific to monitor technology. Input lag measures the second you click on your mouse or keyboard and when something triggers on your screen. This total measurement includes many factors, including the signal transmission from your mouse, the processing of your PC, and more. The response time of the monitor is also one of the important factors in the equation that can create more input lag.

Response time is how fast a pixel on your monitor can change from one color to another. In particular, it's how fast a pixel can change from a certain percentage of gray to another, also known as gray-to-gray (GtG). This is often measured in milliseconds. The reason it's been talked about more recently is due to OLED, which has a drastically faster response time than LED. Monitor manufacturers often make exaggerated claims about this, selling an OLED display for its 0.5 millisecond GtG response time. I wouldn't take any specific response time claims too seriously, except to know that OLED is a huge step forward in response time. So as long as there are no other weak links in the chain of your input delay, overall responsiveness in games should feel noticeably improved.

Monitors have up to four types of adjustability: height, swivel, tilt, and rotate. Budget monitors may not have any of these, while more expensive options may offer a wide range of motion in all four adjustments. Height is the most important of the four for ergonomics. Unless you plan to use a monitor arm, being able to position your monitor at eye level is crucial for keeping a healthy posture.

Tilt is less important, though swivel can be important for dual-monitor setups. Lastly, there's rotate. Rotating a monitor around in horizontal mode as a secondary monitor has become a popular option, often used for messaging or other idle apps. Just be careful: Some monitors with rotate adjustability can't fully flip 90 degrees into horizontal mode. Sometimes it's a limitation due to the lack of proper height adjustment, for example.

Speaking of monitor arms, you'll want to make sure your monitor comes with a standard VESA mount. Almost all monitors have one these days, but you'll still occasionally come across some budget-tier displays that don't.

All monitors have HDMI and DisplayPort to connect to a PC (or even VGA if it's a really old one). Those are the basics. If you want the latest of these port standards in monitors, you're looking for HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1.

More and more monitors nowadays include a built-in USB hub, which can sometimes include USB-A ports, an Ethernet jack, and more. Once you connect over the upstream USB-C (or USB-B if the monitor's a bit older), you can plug accessories and peripherals directly into the monitor. That's particularly useful if your laptop doesn't have many ports, or if you frequently move your laptop and like to keep it as cable-free as possible. Many monitors also include Power Delivery over USB-C, letting you connect and charge your laptop through a single cable.

Some workstation-level monitors take this a step further and also include a KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) switch, which allows you to switch between multiple laptops or PCs, all plugged into the same monitor. Most people don't need this, but if you run multiple PCs for any reason, it's a must.

The placement of these ports is also important. Ideally, you won't have to reach the back of your monitor too often, because let's be real, it's a huge pain. Down-firing ports are the hardest to reach and see, but give you the cleanest look. Back-facing ports, meanwhile, are easier to plug in. Some of the new Dell monitors even include a pop-down, forward-facing port module for quick access to USB-C or a headphone jack. Some monitor stands include some built-in cable management to route your cords, which is a helpful feature.

There's a huge range of pricing for monitors, ranging from under $100 to $5,000 for the Apple Pro Display XDR. Most people will likely be shopping in the sub-$300 range, which is what makes options like the Dell 27 Plus 4K so impressive. It's not a perfect monitor by any means, but in my own testing, it hits the sweet spot in price and quality.

But I love the diversity in the monitor space right now. You'll have to pay extra for it, but as a product category, it has matured to a point where you'll always be able to find what you're looking for, whether it's a port-filled workstation, a super-fast gaming monitor, a display with smart features that doubles as a television, or maybe even an oversized ultrawide monitor that replaces dual monitors.

Seattle startup Ambassador raised $7 million to fuel growth of its software that helps companies  track and act on customer feedback.

Marketing and revenue teams use Ambassador to manage customer referrals, surveys, loyalty programs, email outreach, and other engagement tools from a single platform. The company says it works with more than 200 customers globally, including large enterprises in telecom, fintech, and B2B software.

The funding coincides with the launch of HiroAI, the company's new AI layer designed to analyze customer engagement data across different systems and recommend actions to improve retention and revenue. 

Ambassador says HiroAI is designed to support marketing teams by surfacing insights and guiding next steps — but not completely automate decisions. The company is betting that businesses want fewer disconnected tools and more automation as teams shrink and budgets tighten. 

“We're actually building the most connected AI feedback network on the planet,” said CEO Geoff McDonald.

McDonald said Ambassador is using AI itself to replace some manual internal work such as lead scoring and customer outreach. The company has 22 employees. 

Ambassador was acquired from Intrado in 2021. McDonald previously co-founded and led Seattle startup Element Data.

The latest funding round includes investment from former Zipwhip executives and employees, including Zipwhip co-founder John Larson, who is chief strategy officer and co-founder at Ambassador. “This is my personal biggest bet I've made as an investor,” Larson said.

Other backers include Archibald Cox Jr., former chairman of Barclays; VentureUs; former Zipwhip exec James Lapic; and Seattle-based investors Cliff Monlux and Paul Stahura. Total funding to date is $11 million.

Waymo is shipping a software update to help its robotaxis navigate disabled traffic lights during power outages “more decisively,” the company said Tuesday in a blog post that explains why its self-driving vehicles got stuck at intersections during a blackout in San Francisco this past weekend.

Waymo said the self-driving system in its robotaxis treats dead stop lights as four-way stops, just like humans are supposed to. That should have allowed the robotaxis to operate normally in spite of the massive outage.

Instead, many of the vehicles requested a “confirmation check” from Waymo's fleet response team to make sure what they were doing was correct. All Waymo robotaxis have the ability to make these confirmation checks. With such a widespread outage on Saturday, there was a “concentrated spike” in these confirmation requests, Waymo said, which helped create all the congestion caught on video.

Waymo said it built this confirmation request system “out of an abundance of caution during our early deployment” but that it is now refining it to “match our current scale.” 

“While this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the [self-driving software] with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively,” the company wrote.

The software update will add “even more context about regional outages” to the company's self-driving software. Waymo also said it will improve its emergency response protocols by “incorporating lessons from this event.” 

While a lot of focus has been placed on the instances where Waymo's robotaxis got stuck during the power outage, the company shared that its vehicles “successfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday.” 

“Navigating an event of this magnitude presented a unique challenge for autonomous technology,” the company wrote. 

Saturday's mess is the latest example of how Waymo is still uncovering unforeseen issues with its software and its approach to designing a reliable fleet of self-driving vehicles. The company already had to ship multiple software updates to make its robotaxis wait for stopped school buses, which prompted a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation and led to a recall.

Mill may have started with households, but co-founder and CEO Matt Rogers says the food waste startup has long aspired to expand to commercial customers. 

“This has been part of our plan since our Series A deck,” Rogers told TechCrunch.

Now, with an official deal locked in with Amazon and Whole Foods the company's plan to profit from handling other people's food waste is a bit more public. 

Whole Foods will deploy a commercial-scale version of Mill's food waste bin in each of its grocery stores beginning in 2027. The bins will grind and dehydrate waste from the produce department, reducing costly landfill fees while also providing feed for the company's egg producers. Both trim the company's overhead.

At the same time, Mill's bins will collect data to help Whole Foods understand what gets wasted and why, helping the grocer further control costs. “Ultimately, our goal is not just to make their waste operations more efficient, but also to move upstream so they actually waste less food,” Rogers said.

The company started selling food waste bins to households a few years ago. As can be expected from a team that made the Nest thermostat, the devices are well designed and — to lean on a Silicon Valley cliché — they can be a delight to use. My kids got a kick out of the bins while testing the first and second generations.

“Starting in consumer was very intentional because you build the proof points, you build the data, the brand, loyalty,” Rogers said. Many members of the Whole Foods team were already using Mill in their homes when the two companies started talking.

“It's actually kind of our enterprise sales strategy,” Rogers continued. “We have conversations with senior leadership at our various ideal customers, and if they haven't had Mill at home yet, we say, ‘Hey, try Mill at home, see what your family thinks.' It is a surefire way of getting folks excited.”

The startup began having conversations with Whole Foods about a year ago, Rogers said. In the ensuing months, Whole Foods trialed the consumer version in some of its stores. Mill used feedback from Whole Foods to refine its commercial model. 

But what helped seal the deal was Mill's ability to pinpoint food waste before it was wasted. Mill has developed an AI that uses a range of sensors to determine whether food that enters the bin should still be on the shelf. Minimizing “shrink” — the industry's term for sales lost through waste or theft — can give grocers an edge in a cutthroat market.

Advances in large language models have been key, Rogers said. When he and Mill co-founder Harry Tannenbaum were at Nest, it took dozens of engineers and a “Google budget” more than a year to train Nest Cameras to recognize people and packages. With new LLMs, Mill only needed a handful of engineers and far less time to deliver superior results, according to Rogers, who said “AI is a huge enabler.”

The use of AI allowed Mill to deliver a commercial version faster, diversifying its customer base and source of revenue. 

“If you are a single channel, single customer business, you're fragile,” Rogers said. “I grew up at Apple during the iPod era,” he said. “Apple at the time was a single leg business. iPod was like 70% of company revenue. This was why we did the iPhone. Steve [Jobs] pushed us really hard on the iPhone because he was worried that folks like Motorola — who were working on smartphones at the time — would start to eat our lunch on the iPod business and that that would crush us. We needed to build another leg of the stool.” 

And it seems that Mill isn't finished adding legs to its figurative stool. Rogers said it's working on building out a municipal business as well.

“We're continuing to add more legs to the stool and adding more diversity to the business,” he said.

After a federal judge on Tuesday blocked Texas from implementing a new age-verification law for app stores, Apple announced it will pause previously announced plans for the state as it continues to monitor the “ongoing legal process.”

Apple said its previously announced developer tools for age assurance would remain available for testing and use.

The law, SB 2420, or the App Store Accountability Act, would have required app stores, like those run by Apple and Google, to verify user ages and require parental consent for those under 18 to download apps or make purchases. In addition, it would have required the age data be shared with developers.

A judge, citing First Amendment concerns, blocked the law's enforcement that was set to take effect in January. The ruling was a win for tech giants and a setback to Texas lawmakers, who said the legal fight will continue. The Texas attorney general's office noted in a court filing that it plans to appeal the decision, a report from Reuters noted.

To comply with the coming law, Apple had announced in October a series of new requirements for apps in Texas, which included all users under the age of 18 would have to join a Family Sharing group, where parents or guardians would provide consent for all App Store downloads, app purchases, and in-app transactions. Parents would be able to revoke their consent for an app at any time.

Apple also said its Declared Age Range API, a technology the company debuted to help it comply with the growing number of age-assurance laws worldwide, would be updated in the months ahead to provide the required age categories for new account users in Texas. Apple had planned to launch new APIs for developers to request parental consent again if their app was significantly updated.

Apple had objected to this law, and similar laws arriving next year in Utah and Louisiana, on the grounds of privacy, not kids' protection. 

“While we share the goal of strengthening kids' online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores,” Apple explained in a developer announcement earlier this year.

Apple on Thursday announced other developer tools for complying with new age-assurance laws will remain available for testing, including its Declared Age Range API, Significant Change API under PermissionKit, New age rating property type in StoreKit, and App Store Server Notifications. In addition, the Declared Age Range API is still available worldwide across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26, and later.

Italy has ordered Meta to suspend its policy that bans companies from using WhatsApp's business tools to offer their own AI chatbots on the popular chat app.

The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) on Wednesday said it had found enough cause in its ongoing investigation into whether Meta was abusing its dominant position in the market to offer its Meta AI chatbot within WhatsApp to order the suspension of the policy.

“Meta's conduct appears to constitute an abuse, since it may limit production, market access, or technical developments in the AI Chatbot services market, to the detriment of consumers,” the Authority wrote. “Moreover, while the investigation is ongoing, Meta's conduct may cause serious and irreparable harm to competition in the affected market, undermining contestability.”

The AGCM in November had broadened the scope of an existing investigation into Meta, after the company changed its business API policy in October to ban general-purpose chatbots from being offered on the chat app via the API.

Meta has argued that its API isn't designed to be a platform for the distribution of chatbots and that people have more avenues beyond WhatsApp to use AI bots from other companies. The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app.

The policy doesn't affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won't be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude are prohibited from being distributed via the API.

The European Commission this month also launched an investigation into the new policy, raising concerns that it may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA').”

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

State resolution is just a total mess.  On the best of days it's a hideously complicated system that sucks crazy resources, and on the worst of days rooms get blown up and bricked.  Supposedly it's not as bad as before, but the fact that rooms can get bricked in the first place is bonkers.  Just computing the member list of a room is a disaster due to the complex resolution algorithm - I spoke to a homeserver admin once who found that the DB storage space of just the member list can easily reach multiple gigabytes for larger rooms.Also years later, we still don't have custom emojis, user statuses, user bios, invite links etc. - very basic things that literally every messaging platform has. https://github.com/element-hq/element-meta/issues/339 https://github.com/element-hq/element-meta/issues/573 https://github.com/element-hq/element-meta/issues/426I'm interested in hearing if anyone has used simplex and what kind of experience it is.  It seems like simplex is going for a similar audience as signal but using a very different approach.  I don't think they've really had a breakout though and haven't heard it talked about much.

Matrix is completely busted,  for the article's aforementioned reasons, and others.My complaints is that ive seen child sexual assault imagery on your primary servers, hours later (and thousands of CSAM images) finally the user banned. And still does it cause some federated server they are connected to still allows them to be half-joined to a room.The only safer way to federate is to disable image caching and preloading, and ideally defed from matrix.org.And combined are the laughable moderation tools. I'm sure for some gov deployment, they're not going to spread child sex images. But on the public internet, even basic tooling is a joke.I recommend all Matrix admins to discontinue. Its frankly too legally dangerous to run it, given all the various failure modes and E2EE failures.Its 1 size doesnt fit at all. And it being gone would allow others to potentially succeed.

Not since https://matrix.org/blog/2025/08/project-hydra-improving-stat...> I spoke to a homeserver admin once who found that the DB storage space of just the member list can easily reach multiple gigabytes for larger rooms.This is nothing to do with state resolution; it's due to Synapse's implementation deliberately cutting corners on storage efficiency while trading off for speed.  I showed how it could be fixed a few months ago here: https://youtu.be/D5zAgVYBuGk?t=1853, but we prioritised fixing state resets instead.> Also years later, we still don't have custom emojis, user statuses, user bios, invite links etcThere are MSCs for all of these now, and implementations are starting to filter through.  The reality is that the project has been in a funding crunch since 2023 and we've had to focus on survival by prioritising stuff people pay for (i.e. big servers for govtech deployments) rather than custom emoji.

No, it's specifically to increase the speed of state retrieval.  One of the uses for that is state resolution, but it could equally well just be calling the /messages API or any other point you need to know historical state.  But what do I know :)

You probably would do that even if there was no state resolution at all> Simply fixes some of the many ways that rooms can explode or be bricked.How many other ways are there? Afaik none is known

If speed is a concern, why did you all stick with Synapse (essentially single-threaded due to the GIL) over moving to Dendrite? As far as I can tell, Dendrite is, for all intents and purposes, abandoned.

reply

The hope was always that we would then get back to Dendrite and be able to invest in it and migrate over, but the cash situation got worse in 2022 due to Matrix being more and more successful (causing the available $ in the industry to be flow to integrators rather than the upstream project), and instead we had to essentially park Dendrite dev in 2023 other than for critical fixes.Meanwhile, to try to fix the $ situation, we added Rust workers to Synapse as ""Synapse Pro"" to give customers a reason to actually route money to us as the upstream project, and nowadays Element is actually on a more economically sustainable path.  However, at this point the likelihood is that rather than progressing Dendrite we'll instead look to add more Rust to Synapse and fix its resource usage.  That said, others are of course very welcome to continue progressing Dendrite forwards, and I personally find it super depressing that we failed to progress both servers at the same time.

Lies by omission. SimpleX doesn't mask your IP-address by default. It leaks to the server. The ENTIRE public SimpleX network is hosted by two companies, Akamai and Runonflux. Metadata of two conversing users running on the same VPS can be detected with end-to-end correlation attacks, so pray that the two are not PRISM partners or whatever has replaced that program.I'd be fine with SimpleX if they1) bundled Tor and had a toggle switch during initial setup.2) were transparent about what the toggle switch does (lag/bandwidth vs IP masking)This is crucial as they already have Tor Onion Service server infra set up, but they're not making it easy for a layperson to use those. Instead they lie by omission. Their""SimpleX has no identifiers""only means""SimpleX does not add additional identifiers""They don't give a damn about your router gluing your IP address, that's increasingly becoming a unique IPv6 address, to every TCP packet header.

These two statements are identical. IP addresses are Internet user identifiers, not SimpleX identifiers. All other application-level networks have identifiers of their own, in addition to IP addresses.The goal of the design is:
- to prevent correlation of which IP address communicates with which,
- to prevent IP address from servers not chosen by the users.It is not supposed to protect IP addresses from all servers, and Tor does not achieve that either, as Tor relays are servers too.The reasons not to embed Tor are listed here: https://simplex.chat/faq/#why-dont-you-embed-tor-in-simplex-...Disclaimer: I designed SimpleX network, and the founder of SimpleX Chat.

It may not be good enough for your grandma, but certainly can support your software dev team, and there are countless of those active most probably. I really like Matrix as a daily driver. Also using Discord and Slack, and to me these look like a UX Christmas trees full of blinking lights, and far from anything you can call 'calm technology'.Update: Seeing who I respond to, taking opportunity to mention these recent UX musings.. there used to be 'favorites' in one click in Element, now it is in a drop-down of filters not shown by default (I make distinction of 3 groups 'favorites', 'people', and 'rooms' for all/other. Not using spaces at all (except for the record)). And then there's paragraph spacing between replies given one after the other, is to small. Setting margin to 10px (think its 4px now) makes a world of improved reading already. Element web UI in firefox. Oh, I might add very long UI (re)loading times of a browser tab refresh of Element, as somewhat annoying and to avoid.

One user Janne made an alternative implementation that worked within the new constraints but it was also very bluntly rejected by the devs.I was really appalled by this decision. I need those sections to see everything new without constantly having to switch tabs or categories. It was working fine as it was and they shouldn't have removed it until they were ready with the replacement.I still believe in matrix but not so much in element.

Thanks - the Favourites roomlist section will be back shortly; we just hadn't re-added sections to the rewritten roomlist (and in retrospect, probably shouldn't have launched without it).

I disagree so much. Yes Federation is hard and it brings lots of new challenges. But with things like Chatcontrol it's the only way we can continue to communicate securely in the EU. Everything that is not federated has a single entity managing it which can be threatened with punitive actions. With federation everyone can run their own server meaning too many people to go after.I understand these guys don't want it and they have good reason but federation in general should not die.

For what it's worth, we've been working on improving Matrix's metadata footprint this year: MSC4362 (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/kay...) got implemented on matrix-js-sdk for encrypting room state (currently behind a labs flag on Element Web: https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/blob/develop/docs/...).  Meanwhile more radical proposals like MSC4256 (https://github.com/dklimpel/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/mls-R...) go and remove senders entirely and encrypt room state via MLS.The reason Matrix hasn't prioritised metadata protection earlier is:* If you're particularly concerned about metadata footprint, you can run your own servers in whatever network environment you feel like - you are NOT surrendering metadata to some central or 3rd party server as you would in a centralised platform.* We've had to focus on getting decentralised encryption stable, which turns out to be hard enough without also throwing in metadata protection - it's only this year that we've turned that corner.* Unless you're using a mixnet, network traffic gives away a significant amount of metadata anyway.Anyway, yes: Matrix can do better on obfuscating metadata on servers, and we'll continue improving it in 2026.Meanwhile, if anyone's feeling nostalgic you can see a presentation I wrote preempting the challenge of metadata protection back in 2016 (on the day we first turned on E2EE in Matrix, ironically): https://matrix.org/~matthew/2015-06-26%20Matrix%20Jardin%20E....  In some other world perhaps we would have got to this point sooner, but better late than never.EDIT: I can't face going through all the other points in this post, but it's worth noting that some of it is just entirely false - e.g. the hackea claims of ""an impressive collection of private data being sent to Matrix central servers, even when you use your own instance"", or the fact that media isn't authed (it has been since Jun 2024).  Meanwhile the abuse situation has evolved significantly in 2025, with stuff like https://matrix.org/blog/2025/02/building-a-safer-matrix/ and https://matrix.org/blog/2025/12/policyserv as well as hiring up a larger trust & safety team at the Matrix Foundation.

But I really do wish we had doubled down on XMPP. It was nearly everywhere in the late-00's early-10's. If we could have just solved the mobile case (which, was solved, just not in popular server versions) then we would have been in a better place today.Hatred of XML has cost us so many wonderful things, the one that hurts me most is SMF (the solaris init system) which obviated the major issues people have with systemd. Except because it's using XML people would rather carve off a limb over seriously considering porting it.

Your experience seems to mirror my own. I still use matrix very little, but have defaulted to use xmpp. Well, really returned to it after so many, many years away from xmpp. I tried prosody, but then after a multi-server cleanup killed it off. I think it was fine. Up next, i'd like to try either self-hosting my own ejabberd server, or if i don't want manage yet another host might consider the paid option of Snikket...or maybe go through jmp.chat which if i recall correctly includes xmpp hosting with some jmp chat paid plan, etc.

reply

That's the way Matrix goes, but that's not an inherent property of federation (XMPP doesn't leak nearly as much metadata as Matrix does, for instance)Also, there is no free lunch in this space: p2p is slow and inefficient (bandwidth as much as battery) for modern mobile usecases, the workarounds generally consist of having edge servers to act as caches or preferred routing points, and that brings us back to the exact same set of tradeoffs found in the federation model, except with less control.In short, I agree with the premise that Matrix is terrible,  but not that federation is necessarily bad, nor that P2P is clearly superior.

Their arguments against the middle ground (federation) made no sense.  Yes, some current implementations are flawed in that you can poison caches with spam and csam, but that's not inherent to federation.  In fact, it looked more like they were upset that you can't censor federated communities sufficiently to their liking (nuke them out of existence on a whim?).  Their main, and really only, argument against Lemmy was group think but...it's a consensus platform, that's its purpose.  There is a time and place for communities to build group consensus organically and it's a viral part of society, so while I can understand chafing at that from time to time, I wouldn't call it a protocol failure.

Ronald Deibert and his research group, the Citizen Lab, have rigorously worked to unveil alarming digital threats for the past two decades. Now, he warns, this kind of work is under threat.

In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he took a taxi to a mall and headed directly to the Apple Store to purchase a new laptop and iPhone. He'd wanted to keep the risk of having his personal devices confiscated to a minimum, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I'm traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, the lab operates independently of governments or corporate interests, relying instead on research grants and private philanthropy for financial support. It's one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that's changing, he says: “The pillars of democracy are under assault in the United States. For many decades, in spite of its flaws, it has upheld norms about what constitutional democracy looks like or should aspire to. [That] is now at risk.”

Even as some of his fellow Canadians avoided US travel after Donald Trump's second election, Deibert relished the opportunity to visit. Alongside his meetings with human rights defenders, he also documented active surveillance at Columbia University during the height of its student protests. Deibert snapped photos of drones above campus and noted the exceptionally strict security protocols. “It was unorthodox to go to the United States,” he says. “But I really gravitate toward problems in the world.”

Deibert, 61, grew up in East Vancouver, British Columbia, a gritty area with a boisterous countercultural presence. In the '70s, Vancouver brimmed with draft dodgers and hippies, but Deibert points to American investigative journalism—exposing the COINTELPRO surveillance program, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate—as the seed of his respect for antiestablishment sentiment. He didn't imagine that this fascination would translate into a career, however.

“My horizons were pretty low because I came from a working-class family, and there weren't many people in my family—in fact, none—who went on to university,” he says.

Deibert eventually entered a graduate program in international relations at the University of British Columbia. His doctoral research brought him to a field of inquiry that would soon explode: the geopolitical implications of the nascent internet.

“In my field, there were a handful of people beginning to talk about the internet, but it was very shallow, and that frustrated me,” he says. “And meanwhile, computer science was very technical, but not political—[politics] was almost like a dirty word.”

Deibert continued to explore these topics at the University of Toronto when he was appointed to a tenure-track professorship, but it wasn't until after he founded the Citizen Lab in 2001 that his work rose to global prominence. 

What put the lab on the map, Deibert says, was its 2009 report “Tracking GhostNet,” which uncovered a digital espionage network in China that had breached offices of foreign embassies and diplomats in more than 100 countries, including the office of the Dalai Lama. The report and its follow-up in 2010 were among the first to publicly expose cybersurveillance in real time. In the years since, the lab has published over 180 such analyses, garnering praise from human rights advocates ranging from Margaret Atwood to Edward Snowden.

The lab has rigorously investigated authoritarian regimes around the world (Deibert says both Russia and China have his name on a “list” barring his entry). The group was the first to uncover the use of commercial spyware to surveil people close to the Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi prior to his assassination, and its research has directly informed G7 and UN resolutions on digital repression and led to sanctions on spyware vendors. Even so, in 2025 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement reactivated a $2 million contract with the spyware vendor Paragon. The contract, which the Biden administration had previously placed under a stop-work order, resembles steps taken by governments in Europe and Israel that have also deployed domestic spyware to address security concerns. 

“It saves lives, quite literally,” Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says of the lab's work. “The Citizen Lab [researchers] were the first to really focus on technical attacks on human rights activists and democracy activists all around the world. And they're still the best at it.”

When recruiting new Citizen Lab employees (or “Labbers,” as they refer to one another), Deibert forgoes stuffy, pencil-pushing academics in favor of brilliant, colorful personalities, many of whom personally experienced repression from some of the same regimes the lab now investigates.

Noura Aljizawi, a researcher on digital repression who survived torture at the hands of the al-Assad regime in Syria, researches the distinct threat that digital technologies pose to women and queer people, particularly when deployed against exiled nationals. She helped create Security Planner, a tool that gives personalized, expert-reviewed guidance to people looking to improve their digital hygiene, for which the University of Toronto awarded her an Excellence Through Innovation Award. 

Work for the lab is not without risk. Citizen Lab fellow Elies Campo, for example, was followed and photographed after the lab published a 2022 report that exposed the digital surveillance of dozens of Catalonian citizens and members of parliament, including four Catalonian presidents who were targeted during or after their terms.

Still, the lab's reputation and mission make recruitment fairly easy, Deibert says. “This good work attracts a certain type of person,” he says. “But they're usually also drawn to the sleuthing. It's detective work, and that can be highly intoxicating—even addictive.”

Deibert frequently deflects the spotlight to his fellow Labbers. He rarely discusses the group's accomplishments without referencing two senior researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton, alongside other staffers. And on the occasion that someone decides to leave the Citizen Lab to pursue another position, this appreciation remains.

“We have a saying: Once a Labber, always a Labber,” Deibert says.

While in the US, Deibert taught a seminar on the Citizen Lab's work to Northwestern University undergraduates and delivered talks on digital authoritarianism at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Universities in the US had been subjected to funding cuts and heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, and Deibert wanted to be “in the mix” at such institutions to respond to what he sees as encroaching authoritarian practices by the US government. 

Since Deibert's return to Canada, the lab has continued its work unearthing digital threats to civil society worldwide, but now Deibert must also contend with the US—a country that was once his benchmark for democracy but has become another subject of his scrutiny. “I do not believe that an institution like the Citizen Lab could exist right now in the United States,” he says. “The type of research that we pioneered is under threat like never before.”

He is particularly alarmed by the increasing pressures facing federal oversight bodies and academic institutions in the US. In September, for example, the Trump administration defunded the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, a government organization dedicated to preventing waste, fraud, and abuse within federal agencies, citing partisanship concerns. The White House has also threatened to freeze federal funding to universities that do not comply with administration directives related to gender, DEI, and campus speech. These sorts of actions, Deibert says, undermine the independence of watchdogs and research groups like the Citizen Lab. 

Cohn, the director of the EFF, says the lab's location in Canada allows it to avoid many of these attacks on institutions that provide accountability. “Having the Citizen Lab based in Toronto and able to continue to do its work largely free of the things we're seeing in the US,” she says, “could end up being tremendously important if we're going to return to a place of the rule of law and protection of human rights and liberties.”

A postmortem from Waymo on Tuesday is offering at least some clarity about what the hell happened to its poor, benighted San Francisco operation after much of the power across the city went out on Saturday.Waymo behavior at dark stoplights forced the Alphabet-owned company to call all its San Francisco robotaxis back home, a logistical catastrophe. But in fairness, social media posts probably made Waymo's ad-hoc solution look even more haphazard than it actually was, giving the impression that all the Waymos in San Francisco had been zapped at the same time by whatever caused the outage, causing them to halt in place, including in busy intersections, as if their robot drivers had been raptured to robo-heaven.

There were certainly choked streets and blocked intersections, but below is how Waymo prefers to frame the way the problem arose. Note that in its comms, Waymo refers to the self-driving software in its cars as “the Waymo Driver.”

“While the Waymo Driver is designed to handle dark traffic signals as four-way stops, it may occasionally request a confirmation check to ensure it makes the safest choice. While we successfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday, the outage created a concentrated spike in these requests. This created a backlog that, in some cases, led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets.”

It seems very important to Waymo's brand to not ever allow the impression that Waymos are ever remotely driven. What Waymo has instead of “remote drivers” or “teleoperators” is called “fleet response,” a Waymo blog post says. When the Waymo Driver encounters a truly heterogeneous driving situation, it sends out for human feedback, which we're not supposed to think of as a bailout. It might want confirmation about, say, what it suspects is a completely impassable intersection, and a human operator sends back signals directing it where it might want to go. “Fleet response can influence the Waymo Driver's path, whether indirectly through indicating lane closures, explicitly requesting the AV use a particular lane, or, in the most complex scenarios, explicitly proposing a path for the vehicle to consider,” the Waymo blog post about Fleet Response says. You might or might not consider this the input of a “remote driver” or a “teleoperator.” Waymo clearly doesn't.At any rate, all these furtive Waymos at blacked-out stoplights in San Francisco on Saturday created a logjam of these requests for human feedback, and Waymo's postmortem acknowledges that the logjam caused even worse traffic. So what Waymo says happened next seems like a reasonable course of action in response to causing traffic during a blackout: “We directed our fleet to pull over and park appropriately so we could return vehicles to our depots in waves. This ensured we did not further add to the congestion or obstruct emergency vehicles during the peak of the recovery effort.”From the outside, and especially on social media, this is the part that looked worse than it really was. Posts showing Waymos in intersections could be seen next to posts showing Waymos stopped at the side of the road. This made it look like San Francisco was a post-apocalypic wasteland strewn with dead robotaxis. It's reasonable to ask: if they weren't dead, why didn't the company send them home? But it's also reasonable for Waymo to want to avoid a critical mass of Waymos disrupting San Francisco like a herd of stampeding Wildebeasts, and thus making the vehicles just wait on the side of the road until their group is called.

This created a further bad look for Waymo: alongside the Waymos that did become obstructions, there were at least some crowds of safely parked Waymos, not glitching out, but simply waiting for the signal to go back to their depots in an orderly fashion.

There are no future plans mentioned in the postmortem about introducing remote drivers. What future plans are included, rather puzzlingly, don't include anything—at least so far—about changing the Waymo Driver's fundamental driving software at all. The three bullets about Waymo's “path forward” all focus on emergencies: “Integrating more information about outages,” “Updating our emergency preparedness and response,” and “Expanding our first responder engagement.”

Robotaxis are programmed to drive conservatively, and thus have boy scout-like behavior records in aggregate, but this postmortem doesn't show Waymo reflecting at all about the fact that these are aliens on our roads who will misbehave and fail in totally novel ways that can't be predicted. In fact, it ends on a note of defiance, saying “we are undaunted by the opportunity to challenge the status quo of our roads, and we're proud to continue serving San Franciscan residents and visitors.”

Say the words “Ai Pin” to any tech geek within earshot, and they'll most likely regale you with tales of AI gadget infamy. The Humane wearable was (past tense) nothing short of a disaster. Not only was the pin an eye-watering $700 when it was released, but it also required a $24 monthly subscription for LTE. To top it all off, it, uh… barely did anything that its founders promised.

The state of AI gadgets since the rise and fall of the Ai Pin hasn't gotten much better. While Humane has been unceremoniously junked and sold off to HP, similar names in the AI gadget space, like Rabbit, which makes the R1, have been shouting into an audience-less void. If an AI gadget falls in the forest and there's no one there to misguidedly buy it, does it really kill the smartphone? The answer? Unequivocally no.

And yes, Sam Altman and Jony Ive are readying themselves for a stab at the ol' AI lottery, but as far as we know, they can't quite seem to figure out how to get their AI computer to, well… compute. With OpenAI money.

That's a lot of bad stuff, but what if I told you that no matter how bad things are in the world of AI gadgets, there are entrants in this faltering field that are far, far worse? So bad, in fact, that they make Humane and its defunct Ai Pin look like the second coming of the iPhone. You'd probably believe me. And you should, not just because of past disasters, but because of what I'm about to tell you.

Every once in a while, as a tech reviewer, you run into some red flags—signs that a gadget or a service might not be everything it's cracked up to be. Those warnings can come in many flavors, like a company kicking the can down the road by promising refined functionality at an unspecified future date, or one that fails to nail the basics right out of the gate.

These things happen; sometimes a product does improve, but other times companies (especially new ones) struggle to fully iron things out. This is just the way of the consumer tech world, and it's our job as part of Gizmodo's consumer tech team to review these gadgets as we find them, no matter what their state may be.

Sometimes, though, those aforementioned red flags are so red and so voluminous that I have no choice but to give you, dear reader, a different kind of recommendation, and in the case of InnAIO's T10, that would be a simple and direct one: run in the other direction.

Let me start by saying we were asked by a representative for InnAIO, an AI hardware company out of China, not to write this review. Here's what a communications rep for InnAIO wrote to Gizmodo in an email after I inquired about issues with the device:

Regarding the product review, if your experience isn't positive, we completely understand and kindly ask that it not be published. Thank you for your time and understanding.

A representative also added that they've “paused collaboration with InnAIO for now.”

As you may have gathered, I am totally, 100% writing this review anyway, and here's why: this thing might actually be total bullshit. Let's start from the top.

The $190 InnAIO T10 is (allegedly) a magnetic puck that attaches to your phone and is capable of translating other languages. To start a translation, you simply press the button on the puck to initiate a recording, pull open an app, and then speak or have someone else speak. The translated text will both appear in text form on the app and also be played out loud via your phone in the language of your choosing.

Yes, I just described pretty much every AI translator, but there's a fun twist to the T10, which is that the puck also has a feature that deepfakes your voice, allowing you to play translated speech in a tone similar to yours. If that sounds oddly familiar to a feature launched on Google's Pixel 10 this year, that's because it's basically the same thing.

The thing about the T10 is that it actually appears to work—at least on the surface. The speech I translated, both in the live translation feature and one-offs, came out correct, and the voice cloning feature did an alright job of mimicking my voice and the voices of other people in my office. So everything is gravy, right? There's just one problem, and that's the fact that I'm not sure the T10 is actually doing anything at all.

There are obviously plenty of devices that you need to connect to your phone to use properly, but in the case of the T10, this caveat feels extra strange. While InnAIO claims to be using a combination of OpenAI's GPT-5 and Meta's Llama models to translate, it does not say anywhere on its site that the processing is happening on the device. And because you cannot effectively use the T10 in any sort of standalone capacity—you can't even use it without having the app open—there is no way to verify what the puck is doing.

Obviously, I could answer this question by simply asking InnAIO what the device does and doesn't do, which is exactly what I did. Here's the response I got from a third-party representative for the company: “As the product isn't fully ready and needs further improvements, we've paused collaboration with InnAIO for now.”

A second representative offered a little clarification on this front, but not much.

“Its primary strength lies in enabling cross-application translation, which is initiated directly through the device and works seamlessly with its supported app,” they told Gizmodo, though they did not explicitly state that any processing is happening on-device, only that translation is “initiated” by the T10.

Not exactly the answer I was looking for, and unfortunately, the weird quirks don't stop there.

I was highly skeptical that the T10 has a microphone and it turns out I was right.

One thing that I noticed is that the device only picks up voices if my phone is nearby. If I hold down the button for the puck and walk away from my phone (still in Bluetooth range, mind you), it can't hear a single word that I say. If I speak directly into my phone, however, it picks the whole thing up.

I even tried moving my phone and the T10 close together and speaking into the device while my phone's microphone was covered up, because maybe the Bluetooth is just really bad, right? Wrong. The only time the puck seemed to hear me was when I uncovered my phone mic. As a final test, I revoked the T10's mic permissions in iOS and tried to use the puck to translate, but was met with a pop-up in the app stating that I needed to turn mic permissions back on in order to use any features. Hmm.

The T10, according to a representative for InnAIO doesn't even have a microphone. The odd part is that, in marketing materials, InnAIO shows the T10 resting on the table between speakers as though it were positioned in an ideal place to capture everyone's words with a microphone. Promotional images also show people holding the device to their mouths as though they should be speaking directly into it.

So, to recap, the company is selling a $190 “AI translator” that may not even do what's advertised, and hasn't paused sales. If your alarms aren't going off, they really should. A representative told me that there are plans to expand the offline capabilities of the T10, but that update has yet to materialize.

“An update rolling out at the end of December will expand offline translation capabilities, allowing users to translate directly within the app even when an internet connection is unavailable,” said a representative.

Okay, so what have we (kind of) established? One: I cannot verify if any processing is happening on-device. The T10 does not work without an app or internet connection via your phone's Bluetooth, and it does not state anywhere how or when computing is done. Yes, the translation works, but that's only  through an app, which could be processing via the cloud. InnAIO has stopped short of saying explicitly that processing is happening on-device.

Two: The T10 cannot actually hear anything you say. As I explained before, my hunch about the lack of mic turned out to be true, which means that the T10 is completely reliant on your phone for the whole hearing part and pretty much everything else.

Three: Messaging about what the T10 actually does has been confusing at best and misleading at the worst.

While AI translators are a thing that exists, others offer standalone capabilities. Timekettle's X1 AI Interpreter, for example, can be used offline, which is a pretty big indicator that it's doing something. There's also the fact that Timkettle's device is notably much bigger than the T10, which is another red flag.

The fact is, I cannot in good faith tell you that this isn't just a $190 button that activates an app on your phone. Even Plaud, however you feel about AI recorders, has a microphone on it that can record things independently and send them to the cloud for transcriptions. Is it silly? Yes. But it's something. And I don't even want to think this way. I'd like to believe you could take AI gadgets at face value, and if InnAIO is out here suggesting they're offering a way to run on-device translation in a tiny little puck, then that's what they're doing.

But we've seen the pantheon of bad AI, and with that context, all I'm left with is wondering if this tiny little expensive puck even has a f*cking mic (it doesn't). I'll let you make your own decision on the T10, but for now, I would leave you with one recommendation if you need to translate something in a pinch. Pick up your phone and use Google Translate.

What if there were an ad on TV, and it wasn't made with AI?

For plenty of people on the internet, that's apparently an exciting and praiseworthy prospect. Here, for instance, is the 2025 Porsche Christmas ad:

 

I like this ad. It has a certain high-class elegance, but it's also as gentle and frictionless as an episode of Cocomelon. If you're considering being in the market for a Porsche, it might build some nice brand associations. I will never have enough money for a Porsche, so to me it's just nice colors and music.

In the ad, the seasons change. A car gets driven around. There are little details about Porsche history and culture that reward multiple watches by Porsche aficionados. Most importantly, it has a classic 2D animated feel that comes from a mix of hand-drawings and CGI, according to a Porsche Instagram post.

What's getting people excited, however, is the assumption that no AI was used to make it. After all, this year's McDonald's Christmas ad made with AI would rank high on any list of the worst ads of all time.

“Very good to see non ai stuff these days,” the top comment on the version of the ad posted by Parallel Studio, the studio that created it, says.

Porsche reportedly created their new ad without using any AI.

— Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yasharali.bsky.social) December 23, 2025 at 7:21 AM



The advertising blog 80 Level praises the ad's lack of AI, saying “Let's see if the trend of promoting things as AI-free continues and how brands will approach their ads next holiday season.”

Gizmodo reached out to Parallel Studio to confirm that the ad was really made without AI, and will update if we hear back. In the meantime, YouTube uploads and social media posts from Porsche and Parallel studio don't mention AI. It's not clear at this juncture where this impression is even coming from.

The Porsche ad doesn't seem, to be clear, like it was made with AI, but that's the case with most ads. Here's a recent ad from Taco Bell, that, much like the good Porsche ad and the bad McDonald's one, is a dreamy montage of disparate scenes that share a theme.

It's the kind of thing that certainly could be AI, but no one seems to be under the impression that it is, as far as I can tell. It's also not being praised for not using AI, again, as far as I can tell.

Nevertheless, in a world where we all have to watch ads, fewer AI duds hurting our eyes would be a welcome trend. If the Porsche ad really is meant to be an anti-AI statement, that's terrific.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","Samsung to delay its planned DDR4 end-of-life due to signing a long-term 'non-cancellable, non-returnable' contract with key customer — agreement will not alleviate consumer shortage, supply earmarked for server clients","https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ddr4/samsung-to-delay-its-planned-ddr4-end-of-life-due-to-signing-a-long-term-non-cancellable-non-returnable-contract-with-key-customer-agreement-will-not-alleviate-consumer-shortage-supply-earmarked-for-server-clients","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:57:34 GMT","

This move will allow Samsung to squeeze more out of its aging DDR4 production line.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Samsung has reportedly delayed the shutdown of its DDR4 production line, which it initially announced earlier this year. According to DigiTimes [machine translated], the South Korean chipmaker is doing this as 16GB DDR4 modules hit a record of $60 in the spot market. This pricing made the DDR4 market lucrative enough for Samsung to delay the shutdown of its existing DDR4 production line. However, it will not set up new ones to accommodate increasing consumer demand. In line with this, reports indicate that one customer has already signed an “NCNR contract” with the company to secure its DDR4 supply.

NCNR (non-cancellable, non-returnable) contracts mean a client will receive a fixed number of memory modules at a fixed price, and that the price or volume cannot be modified in the future. In other words, the customer is contractually obliged to buy the product regardless of any other factors.

This type of agreement ensures stability in both volume and cost for the customer so that they won't be affected by the current volatility in the memory market driven by the AI rush. On the other hand, this helps Samsung insulate itself from uncertainty in the memory market. Even if the AI bubble bursts and there is an oversupply of HBM and DDR5 memory modules, causing their prices to drop, this ensures that its DDR4 production line remains profitable.

Sources say the NCNR's price is expected to exceed $20 per 16GB DDR4 module, but Samsung is still evaluating the market and may increase it further. Still, this is only a third of prevailing spot market prices for short-term contracts. Unfortunately, the client said to be gunning for the NCNR contract mainly focuses on server applications, and no consumer-facing company has signaled its intent to secure a long-term contract for DDR4 chips. This means that end-users should not expect any relief from the ongoing memory shortage.

Samsung originally planned to end DDR4 production to focus on HBM and DDR5, but it seems that the booming AI demand for HBM has caused DDR5 memory pricing to skyrocket. This led to higher demand and prices for older DDR4 memory, causing the big three memory makers to delay their planned shutdown of DDR4 production lines. However, these are expected to serve industry clients, not consumers, so PC builders and enthusiasts should not expect any form of relief from the RAM shortage in 2026.

15 years ago, the first Bitcoin mining pool was introduced by coder Slush. This was the birth of Bitcoin CZ, which would become Slush Pool, and is still operating today under the moniker of Braiins Pool. The group claims to have mined 1,311,339 bitcoins over the last 15 years, which would be worth $115 billion at today's valuation, or $162 billion at Bitcoin's peak valuation earlier this year.

The first and original mining pool started with 60,000 KH/s of power. In 2025, this pool goes brrr-kerching at 13.56 EH/s. Thus, it wields about 225 billion times more computing power than its original incarnation.

15 years ago today, the first Bitcoin mining pool was invented, ending the era of pure solo mining. It allowed many miners to work together on the same block and split rewards more consistently.

By 2010, Bitcoin cryptomining rewards were simply becoming too variable for most solo participants to feel comfortable in their high-wattage pursuit. The difficulty of finding a block had reached the point where the mass of home enthusiasts could still mine BTC, but the painful gaps between striking crypto gold gave birth to the idea of pooling resources for a more steady, reliable, flow of income.

Mining collaborations don't always have the desired outcome. ‘Gold' can make men mad with desire, as seen in John Huston's 1948 classic neo-Western, the Treasure of the Sierra Madre. However, history shows Slush and the community have put together a collaboration that would last.

The Bitcoin CZ originator noted that the mining pool server was based on an equitable sharing of rewards principle, and it worked with major CPU/GPU miners of the time. In contrast with mining solo, Bitcoin CZ would save blocks of crypto to the server wallet, and individual miners could get BTC sent to their own wallets based upon a personal customizable threshold.

 




From its humble forum-discussion beginnings to today, the world's longest running cryptomining pool has grown at an astonishing rate. In the intro, we highlighted that the pool had grown from a combined 60,000 KH/s to 13.56 EH/s of hashing power. This represents a 225 billion times increase in computing power.

At the time the first Bitcoin pool was set up, on December 16, 2010, the value of 1 BTC was 22 cents. Along its spiky history, we saw the first astonishingly rapid BTC inflation in June 2011, with its value passing $26. The next great spike was in Nov/Dec 2013, with BTC breaking the $1,000 milestone. In 2017, it almost hit $20,000. Another milestone spike was when BTC rose above $67,000 in late 2021.

It has garnered many headlines along the way, marking numerous peaks and troughs in its valuation trajectory. Today, a single BTC is valued at approximately $86,000, but it rose above $125,000 for a period just a few weeks ago.

 




Braiins Pool claims it has been responsible for mining 1,311,339 BTC since it was set up, 15 years ago. Perhaps by the time you check the link, that figure will have risen somewhat.

If you are interested, Braiins Pool is still looking for new members to join up. It currently has nearly 13,000 active users, with a whole ecosystem boasting custom hardware, ASIC firmware, the mining pool, management software, and more. We'd encourage those with only a passing interest to still bookmark the site, and revisit in 15 years' time.

A big shift in panel tech ahead of CES 2026.

Ahead of CES 2026, LG Display has just announced a seemingly revolutionary development in the OLED world, at least as far as its own panels are concerned. The company has achieved a striped, true RGB subpixel layout in one of its upcoming monitors — in particular, a 27-inch 4K display with a 240 Hz native refresh rate, doubled by dual-mode capabilities.

To understand why this is such a big deal, we first have to look at how subpixel structures inform the image quality that you see. Every display has pixels, and each of those pixels are made up of tiny red, green, and blue (RGB) subpixels. However, LG's panels also add a fourth white subpixel in the equation to boost brightness.

See, OLED panels are inherently weak when it comes to being bright because driving those sweet organic pixels as hard as possible will wear them out quickly, leading to burn-in. Therefore, you need ingenuity to tackle this issue, and so far, LG has relied on that white subpixel for the most part, but that comes with a downside.

 




Even though the inherent luminance of the image is boosted, the color volume is hurt as a byproduct of what white subpixel essentially bleeding over the other colors. This is why Samsung's QD-OLED panels are touted for their superior color performance, since they don't have a white subpixel and instead emit blue light that passes through quantum dots to filter colors.

Now, getting rid of that white subpixel and reverting back to a true RGB structure does hurt brightness outright, at least in the first-gen implementation, but it could be a worthwhile tradeoff. That's why LG is quoting just 1,000 nits of peak brightness, with 250 nits full-screen APL, noticeably decreased from the 1,500 nits max their latest Tandem OLED panels can achieve.

That's one part of the equation; the other is that striped layout, which is just as important. Instead of putting the subpixels in a triangular or rectangular structure — or really any other pattern — LG places the red, green and blue subpixels right next to each other in a straight line, forming a ""stripe."" But, again, they've always had that white subpixel in the middle, creating a RGWB pattern instead.

Therefore, this is the first time a high refresh OLED panel has had a true RGB stripe subpixel layout. This leads to reduced fringing and distortion in text, since the font engines rendering that expect a more conventional layout. LCDs and such have striped subpixel arrangements for ages, but OLEDs have suffered either because of the white subpixel or just a differently shaped layout altogether, such as in QD-OLED panels.

To be clear, OLEDs with this kind of a layout have existed before, but they're niche and limited to just 60Hz, as LG points out in its own press release, so achieving a 240 Hz refresh rate is quite impressive and nicely brings the tech into the modern day. Keep in mind that LG Display is a separate company from LG. This is just one gaming monitor, so it doesn't represent a broader shift away from WOLED from LG as a whole.

Speaking of, TFT Central reports that this monitor will be part of LG Display's 4th gen family, using a Tandem WOLED panel. The branding is a bit confusing, because the ""W"" in that WOLED doesn't mean it has a white subpixel; rather, the multi-stack method used by LG emits near-white light that is converted by color filters, which is what forms those RGB subpixels eventually.

 




Just to clarify, the other ""Tandem OLED"" designation is reserved for smaller format displays meant for phones, tablets, laptops and cars, and it's similar to LG's RGB OLED where each subpixel produces its own light instead of being filtered through a white base layer. That's what powers the new iPad Pros, but it's not meant for TVs or monitors.

All in all, combining 4K resolution at 27 inches with a 240 Hz refresh rate, on a panel with a striped true RGB subpixel layout that's powered by LG's Tandem WOLED tech — well, that's one heck of a combo and certainly fit for a next-gen flagship. We should learn more about pricing and availability as CES rolls around. Until then, you can check out Samsung's new monitors announcement  as well.

Orange juice delivers a full menu of good things for the heart, according to a new look at the popular beverage from a molecular point of view.

A recent study published in Molecular Nutrition & Food Research found that orange juice broadly affected genes involved in physiological activity related to heart health, inhibiting unwanted processes and promoting beneficial ones.

Orange juice dampened — or downregulated — hypertension (high blood pressure) genes. Hypertension can lead to stroke, heart attacks, and heart failure.

It did the same for inflammatory genes. Inflammation can lead to cardiac events by constricting and damaging blood vessels, as well as promoting the formation of dangerous plaque buildup.

At the same time, orange juice upregulated – promoted – the activity of genes responsible for metabolizing fat, helping the body process and store it more efficiently.

The study also found two body-type-dependent effects. Fat metabolism was particularly optimized by orange juice in people with overweight. People of normal weight saw a greater reduction in systemic inflammation.

The study's first author, Layanne Nascimento Fraga, PhD, of the Food Research Center and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo in Brazil, explained the study's novel perspective on orange juice to Medical News Today.

“What's unique about our study,” said Nascimento Fraga, “is that we used the transcriptomic approach to evaluate the effects of orange juice on the entire metabolic system, allowing us to see how multiple pathways are modulated simultaneously.”

“We found that orange juice improves key cardiometabolic markers, including inflammation, oxidative stress, blood pressure, and lipid metabolism, showing that several mechanisms act together to produce its health benefits.”

After factoring for duplicates, the researchers found 1,705 differentially expressed genes affected by orange juice in this study, 98% of which were downregulated, according to Fraga.

Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, a preventive cardiology dietitian at Entirely Nourished, who was not involved in this research, told MNT that, prior to this study, “other clinical trials and meta-analyses showed modest reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, particularly in adults with pre- or stage 1 hypertension.“

“This is because orange juice, especially after meals, increases plasma hesperetin, which is a flavonoid that may improve endothelial function and microvascular reactivity,” Routhenstein explained.

Jayne Morgan, MD, cardiologist and Vice President of Medical Affairs at Hello Heart, likewise not involved in this study, said that other foods hold promise for cardiovascular health, as well.

Morgan advised that “anti-inflammatory spices and herbs — such as turmeric and garlic — chia, hemp seeds, beets, and beet juice” might also benefit from similar molecular investigations.

And Cheng-Han Chen, MD, an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, also not involved in this research, commented on the study's investigative approach.

“It's interesting, but I'm more interested in how this connects to outcomes,” Chen told us.

He expressed some doubt regarding the meaning of orange juice's heart-health benefits when viewed from a molecular angle, since, “from a clinician's perspective, it's easy enough to measure blood pressure.“

“We can also measure lipids easily enough” in a clinical trial, he said.

“Everything in moderation, including orange juice,” Morgan advised people who may now feel tempted to up their orange juice intake.

“Orange juice likely has a U-shaped curve, wherein small–moderate amounts are likely helpful for improved endothelial function, decreased arterial stiffness, and mild-anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects from the citrus flavonoid. And blood pressure health from the potassium. Most Americans are actually potassium-deficient, so orange juice is helpful.”

– Jayne Morgan, MD

Morgan cautioned, however, that “larger amounts [of vitamin C] drive increased sugar loads and all of the risks inherent, such as insulin spikes, weight gain, and visceral fat, especially in perimenopausal and menopausal women.”

“I always recommend to my patients that they eat lots of fruit, including oranges, though I don't say they should drink juices so much. When you extract juices, you leave behind things like fiber. Fiber helps even out the sudden release of sugar from juices,” Chen also advised.

“I haven't recommended orange juice specifically,” he added.

Routhenstein suggested “further studying whole fruits, including the fiber-rich membranes and the white, spongy albedo, which is high in fiber and flavonoids, could clarify how the fruit matrix influences bioavailability and gene responses compared with juice alone.”

Morgan also cited the study's report “that perhaps body weight impacts how well the positive and nutrigenomic benefits of orange juice consumption can be realized.”

Fraga hypothesized that:

“The variation in response according to body type suggests that individual metabolic characteristics, including the gut microbiota and genetic background, may modulate the absorption, distribution, and biological activity of orange juice bioactive compounds. We need to further investigate how these physiological differences influence the observed outcomes.”

“Many whole foods,” said Routhenstein, “provide similar multi-target cardiovascular support because they, too, deliver synergistic combinations of nutrients and bioactive compounds.”

“This would include chocolate,” noted Morgan, “as milk chocolate is actually the processed form of dark chocolate.”

“Leafy greens supply nitrate, magnesium, and carotenoids that improve endothelial function and support healthy blood pressure,” added Routhenstein. “Legumes provide viscous fiber, plant protein, potassium, and polyphenols that reduce LDL cholesterol, stabilize blood sugar, and lower inflammation.”

Foods high in potassium, said Morgan, “help keep your blood vessels and blood pressure healthy, such as oranges, bananas, spinach, beans, and potatoes.”

“Berries,” according to Routhenstein, “offer anthocyanins that enhance endothelial function and decrease oxidative stress, while nuts combine unsaturated fats, arginine, and polyphenols to improve lipid profiles and vascular tone.”

“Make plants the majority of your palate and use extra virgin olive oil, and foods rich in omega 3s,” said Morgan.”

She also recommended lean protein, especially in perimenopause and menopause, limiting both salt and alcohol, and avoiding canned soups, sauces, and deli meats when possible.”

Finally, Routhenstein said grapefruit, mandarins, tangerines, and lemons are good for the heart. However, she cautioned that grapefruit can interact unfavorably with certain medications, “including statins, calcium channel blockers, and some anticoagulants.”

The FDA has granted accelerated approval for a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of mosunetuzumab (Lunsumio VELO, Roche) for the treatment of certain adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.

Specifically, the CD20 × CD3 bispecific antibody — which was initially approved as an intravenous (IV) formulation and was the first of its kind approved for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after at least 2 prior lines of therapy — is now approved for SC administration in the same setting, according to a Roche press release.

SC delivery reduces treatment time to about 1 minute compared with the 2-4 hours required with IV infusion. Like the IV formulation, the SC version can be administered in the outpatient setting and is a fixed-duration treatment given for a defined period, Roche noted, adding that “[b]y contrast, treat-to-progression treatment options are designed to be given to patients indefinitely until disease progression or until treatment can no longer be tolerated.”

Full approval, which may be contingent on verification of benefit in a confirmatory trial, was based on findings from the phase 1/2 G029781 study of both IV and SC formulations in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including follicular lymphoma.

The objective response rate and complete response rate with SC formulation were 75% and 59%, respectively. The median duration of response was 22.4 months.

Adverse reactions occurring in at least 20% of patients were injection site reactions, fatigue, rash, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), SARS-CoV-2 infection, musculoskeletal pain, and diarrhea. CRS occurred in 30% of patients. Most of those events were low-grade, and all resolved after a median of 2 days.

“This approval is a significant step in broadening access to effective treatments for people living with follicular lymphoma,” stated Ian Flinn, MD, PhD, of Tennessee Oncology and OneOncology. “With its manageable cytokine release syndrome profile and reduced administration time, Lunsumio VELO enables oncologists to deliver advanced care in community practice settings.”

Sheena Meredith, MBBS, MPhil

 December 24, 2025  

A new monitoring report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has found that most EU and European Economic Area (EEA) countries are ill-prepared to respond effectively to rising sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with major gaps in prevention, testing, treatment, and surveillance. It added that many national strategies are outdated, key data are missing, and progress toward 2025 STI targets is being undermined by uneven access to services and inconsistent policies across Europe.

Drawing on responses from 29 of 30 EU/EEA countries to the first ECDC online STI monitoring questionnaire conducted in 2024, the report found that although most countries do have national STI strategies, many are no longer fit-for-purpose and cannot adequately address rapidly changing behavioral and epidemiologic trends.

The report revealed that notification rates for gonorrhea rose nearly 300% between 2014 and 2023 among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), with recent surges also seen among young women. Syphilis notifications also increased by 90% and chlamydia by 180%.

The ECDC noted that while increased testing may partly explain these trends, reduced condom use and higher numbers of sexual partners are also likely contributing factors. A World Health Organization (WHO) report released last year found that condom use was declining among younger age groups: among 15-year-olds who reported being sexually active, 30% did not use contraception.

The ECDC report also raised concerns about antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and noted the spread of extensively drug-resistant Shigella among MSM, prompting the organization to urge immediate action to contain drug-resistant strains.

Lina Nerlander, MBBS, PhD, ECDC principal expert on sexually transmitted infections, told Medscape News Europe that it is essential for clinicians to follow local guidelines for offering vaccination, testing, and treatment. Clinicians are a key source of accurate information on sexual health and should ask questions in ways that signal openness to discussion, while providing information and counseling when STIs are suspected or prevention measures are needed.

She also urged clinicians to report detected cases promptly to public health authorities, providing as complete information as possible. Reporting data on factors such as the likely route of transmission gives public health authorities critical insight for planning and targeting interventions.

Clinicians can further contribute by working together to highlight gaps in prevention and care for specific populations and by collaborating with public health authorities to address those gaps, Nerlander said.

The WHO European Regional Action Plan 2022-2030 had set interim STI targets for 2025. But the ECDC said that “critical gaps in testing and prevention policies” remain.

STIs continue to be a major public health challenge. Left untreated, they can lead to “long-term irreversible and potentially fatal outcomes,” including chronic pelvic pain, cancers, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, adverse pregnancy outcomes, neonatal death, and congenital abnormalities. Some STIs also increase the risk for HIV infection. Because many STIs remain asymptomatic for long periods, silent transmission can occur both sexually and during pregnancy.

The ECDC said interpretation of national notification data is complicated by wide variation in testing policies, access to services, populations screened, approaches to asymptomatic testing, and diagnostic technologies. These limitations are compounded by scarce data on symptoms at the time of diagnosis.

Although the current STI monitoring system was developed last year to align with the WHO Global Health Sector Strategy, only 10 countries have updated their national STI plans in the past 5 years. As a result, many national strategies are lagging behind prevention needs, while access to treatment remains uneven.

Nerlander said “the monitoring system itself works to measure the presence of different policies and the extent of implementation of various public health interventions in EU/EEA counties.” However, “gaps in data availability for many measures” make it difficult to assess how effectively interventions are being implemented.

Only four countries, for example, were able to report data on the proportion of pregnant women tested for syphilis. This represents “a critical knowledge gap,” Nerlander said, while “rates of congenital syphilis are rising.”

Beyond improving surveillance and prevention programs, the ECDC recommends stronger collaboration among public health authorities, laboratories, clinical bodies, and civil society and community-based organizations.

Nerlander said the level of collaboration varies widely across countries. Some, such as Ireland, have standing working groups that bring together public health authorities and civil society organizations on an ongoing basis, supporting both prevention efforts and coordinated outbreak responses.

She added that the ECDC's experience with HIV has shown that simply convening representatives from public health authorities and clinical societies at the national level to share data and coordinate efforts “can be highly productive and mutually beneficial.”","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Ask any medical student, and they'll tell you that a hidden stressor in their life is often rooted in dealing with constant calls from family members who reach out to report a rash or a troubling symptom and want free answers — immediately.

Being the 24/7 medical help desk for the family is something Alex R. Rich, a fourth-year medical student at the Frank H. Netter MD School of Medicine at Quinnipiac University in North Haven, Connecticut, experiences quite often.

“Sometimes it's a relative asking for help interpreting blood tests or radiology reports,” Rich told Medscape Medical News. “Other times, relatives call me to talk about a drug they're taking, and then they ask if they can take it with the other medications they're on. This puts me in a very awkward position.”

It's even more challenging when health information about a relative is delivered thirdhand, like a bad game of telephone.

“When my grandma was sick, I was getting updates from my dad, who was getting information from my uncle, who heard it from her doctor,” Rich said. “That's a big stressor — you know you don't have all the information, and it's frustrating when I don't have the answers. At times like that, I have to remind myself that I'm still in the process of learning everything.”

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, the Medical School Stressors Report 2025 found

Alexandria Lange, a second-year medical student at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia, credits her program for helping navigate these tricky interactions — in a lecture that took place during the first week of orientation.

“The speakers addressed it right away and said that people would be coming up to us, every family member, friend, and neighbor,” Lange said. “They explained how to set boundaries since this issue will be with us throughout our careers as physicians.”

Some of the helpful phrasing and tools learned in that lecture are ones that Lange uses to this day.

“One of the things we learned was that it's very important to clarify where we are in our training and that while we are a doctor, we're not their doctor,” she said. “This way we're not tempted to blur some of those lines and do things that make us uncomfortable or, worse, provide bad care.”

Directing friends and family to other sources has worked well for DeAnthoni Wilkins, a fourth-year medical student at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago.

“When someone asks me a question about their personal health concerns, I do my best to point them in the right direction,” he says. “I always say that it's hard to do a complete medical assessment of someone in their home, so I try to help them navigate the healthcare field without giving them information I can't possibly know about their situation.”

This will always be a delicate issue, agreed Jose Barrera, a third-year medical student at Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine in Pasadena, California. “I'm always very honest and tell loved ones that I can't answer their questions, but I always let them know that it's not like I'm gatekeeping information,” he said. “Instead, it's that I don't want to give them the wrong answer or false hope. For their own good, I always urge them to speak to their own doctor about their concerns.”

While medical students are learning to exercise extreme caution when sharing advice among friends and family and preparing some rote responses, there's actually an interesting twist to the story.

Turns out, if there's a health professional in the family, health outcomes tend to improve, according to a 2019 Swedish study. In it, researchers found that people with healthcare providers in the family were more likely to “engage in preventive healthcare, live longer, and are less likely to suffer from chronic conditions.”

In the end, the medical students we interviewed agreed that the most important role they can play with family members is to help translate doctor-speak into words that are easy to understand.

“I was recently talking to a family member, and she asked me a general question about the difference between arthritis and osteoporosis because she had read online that she could be at risk for one or both,” Barrera said. “Being able to break something like that down and explain the difference between two diseases is a way for us to use what we've learned and mitigate someone's stress and perhaps even put them at ease.”

Bridging that gap remains one of the most helpful things medical students can do for their loved ones.

“At the end of the day, the word ‘doctor' means teacher,” Barrera added. “So being able to teach friends and family about health issues that may come up is a gift any medical student can give.” However, leave any specific medical advice to their doctor.

Synthetic phenols and parabens found in everyday consumer products are under scrutiny for their potential effects on child neurodevelopment. New research suggests that prenatal exposure to methylparaben and bisphenol S during the third trimester of pregnancy may be associated with behavioural difficulties in young children.

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are known to interfere with hormonal signalling and may adversely affect growth, brain development, reproduction, and metabolism. Against the backdrop of increasing neurodevelopmental disorders in children, their potential role as environmental risk factors has become an increasing focus in public health research.

Although causal links remain difficult to establish and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear, clarification is critical. In Europe, endocrine disruptors are classified on the basis of mechanistic data and evidence of their adverse health effects.

A recent study was coordinated by an environmental epidemiology research team from the Inserm (National Institute of Health and Medical Research) and the University of Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France.

This research project was carried out with numerous partners, including the Grenoble Alpes University Hospital, Grenoble, France, and the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, and provides new insights into the potential effects of these contaminants during pregnancy.

Researchers have assessed prenatal exposure to 12 substances during pregnancy, including phenolic compounds, bisphenols, parabens, and triclosan. Health authorities have classified these substances as endocrine disruptors.

Many common consumer products contain phenolic compounds, particularly bisphenols and parabens such as methylparaben. These sources include plastic packaging, cosmetics, food products, and textiles.

The endocrine-disrupting properties of bisphenol S have been well documented, leading to restrictions in its use. However, substitute compounds, such as bisphenol S, may pose health risks. Methylparaben is suspected to have endocrine-disrupting activity because of its oestrogenic effects and interference with hormonal regulation.

The study drew on data from two complementary mother-child cohorts: the Barcelona Life Study Cohort (BiSC), which enrolled 1080 mother-child pairs in Barcelona, Spain, between 2018 and 2021, and the Assessment of Air Pollution Exposure during Pregnancy and Effect on Health cohort, in which 484 pregnant women were recruited in the area of Grenoble, France, between 2014 and 2017.

Compared with earlier studies, this study differs in its more intensive exposure assessment, with up to 42 urine samples collected during pregnancy than approximately three samples in most previous studies.

When children were 18-24 months of age, one parent completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a screening tool used to identify behavioural problems such as attention difficulties, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and aggressive behaviour.

Analyses were performed to examine whether prenatal exposure to confirmed or suspected endocrine disruptors was associated with the CBCL scores.

The study highlighted two associations:

No evidence of a cocktail effect or an amplified biological response due to the combined exposure to multiple phenolic compounds was detected.

Researchers have examined potential biological mechanisms, focusing on the disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, a central regulator of stress responses. Stress-related hormones, including cortisol and cortisone, were measured in maternal hair samples collected at the end of pregnancy. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

Other biological pathways, including the thyroid and other oestrogenic axes, warrant further investigation.

The authors emphasised the need for further research, particularly because bisphenol S remains relatively understudied despite its increasing use, and methylparaben is currently classified only as a suspected endocrine disruptor. Larger studies are required to better document these potential risks.

Hi, everyone. Dr Chandrasekaran here. Today we're going to talk about pulmonary embolism. 

This is a blood clot that can travel from certain areas of the body into the lungs. When this happens, it can cause shortness of breath, hemoptysis, high heart rate, syncope, and various other symptoms. This can be diagnosed based off a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPE) or echocardiogram.

Pulmonary embolisms can occur from recent surgeries; prolonged travel, meaning in an airplane or even a car ride, usually greater than 3 hours; if a patient is on estrogen or some type of hormonal therapy; or if they have any type of malignancy. It's important to remember these risk factors, as they can predispose one to pulmonary embolisms.

They can be categorized as massive or submassive. If massive, you'll see hemodynamic changes with decreased blood pressure or changes in vital signs, which may trigger the thought for a massive pulmonary embolism. 

It is diagnosed on the basis of CTPE. You'll see right heart strain, with the right heart being bigger than the left heart or the main pulmonary artery being bigger than normal. An echocardiogram can show the same findings. 

Pulmonary thrombectomy can help to treat this, along with anticoagulant blood thinners.

In young children, foreign body aspiration (FBA) has remained a leading emergency. Although caregivers demonstrated overall good knowledge, critical gaps were identified in recognising an effective or ineffective cough and appropriate actions for infants with an ineffective cough. Formal medical education and structured first-aid training emerged as the strongest predictors of higher knowledge scores.

""The results highlight a need to systematize pediatric airway safety education across societal levels. Integrating standardized first-aid training into pregnancy programs, parental schools, and early childhood institutions could ensure coverage during key developmental periods,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Maciej Szczukocki, Collegium Medicum, Jan Kochanowski University, Kielce, Poland. It was published online on December 12, 2025, in BMC Pediatrics.

An investigational antibody could reduce the toxicity associated with immune suppression in islet cell transplantation for type 1 diabetes (T1D), according to new preliminary data. 

Six people with T1D who received intravenous infusions of the investigational anti-CD40 ligand antibody tegoprubart every 3 weeks, as part of their immunosuppressive regimen following cadaveric islet transplants, achieved insulin independence. The first three patients have remained off insulin for over a year, including one with an A1c of 4.7% at 15 months. Only one patient required a second transplant and has since maintained an A1c of 5.3% without insulin. None of the patients experienced the severe toxicities often associated with traditional immunosuppressive regimens. 

The findings were presented at the Rachmiel Levine-Arthur Riggs Diabetes Research Symposium in Los Angeles, California.

Currently, islet transplantation for T1D — whether using cadaveric donor islets or stem cell-derived islets — is limited to patients with frequent severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness. A major barrier to broader use is the toxicity of standard immunosuppressive regimens used for most organ transplants, which typically include a calcineurin inhibitor (now tacrolimus, previously cyclosporine), an antiproliferative agent (such as mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid), and a corticosteroid (such as prednisone or methylprednisolone).

Replacing tacrolimus with tegoprubart reduces overall immunosuppressive toxicity, said investigator Piotr Witkowski, MD, PhD, director of the Pancreas and Islet Transplant Program at UChicago Medicine in Chicago.

Tacrolimus is the strongest and best medication to prevent rejection and the standard of care in organ transplantation, Witkowski told Medscape Medical News. “However, at the dose needed to protect organs from rejection, it's toxic to the kidney and the islets. It causes hand tremors, headaches, high blood pressure, and also diabetes.”

In contrast, none of the six patients receiving tegoprubart experienced severe hypoglycemia, serious infections, thromboembolic events, rejection, or kidney or neurologic toxicity following transplantation.

“We have six patients doing so well,” Witkowski said. “The islets are working better because there is less toxicity from tacrolimus.”

He added that managing patients on tacrolimus requires frequent check-ins and laboratory monitoring, with dose adjustments to balance side effects and islet function. 

“Here, there is nothing to adjust, and patients feel great,” he said. “It's like night and day.”

Although the current study uses cadaveric donor islets, Witkowski said that tegoprubart could be used in the future with islets derived from stem cells, provided ongoing studies in that area are successful. 

Commenting on the findings, Jordan Wright, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolism at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, said broader use of islet transplantation remains constrained by the need for ongoing immunosuppression.

“An ideal regimen would be targeted, have minimal effect on other immune functions, and would not be toxic to the transplanted cells or other cell types,” Wright told Medscape Medical News. “These early results in humans are an exciting step in that direction."" 

However, Wright cautioned that the findings are preliminary and based on a small number of patients.

“It will be critical to see whether these results hold up over longer-term follow-up, and whether the encouraging safety and efficacy results are seen in larger, diverse patient populations,” he said.

Another expert, Kevan Herold, MD, C.N.H. Long Professor of Immunobiology and Medicine (Endocrinology) at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, expressed support for the approach.

“I have been very enthusiastic about anti-CD40L antibodies since the first studies in islet transplantation,” Herold told Medscape Medical News. “I do think it would be a better alternative than tacrolimus, mostly because it's specific in the immune pathway that is targeted.”

This ongoing current phase 1/2 study is funded by Breakthrough T1D. Since Witkowski presented the data on the first six patients at the November conference, a seventh patient has undergone transplantation, with the next five additional procedures planned. 

Breakthrough T1D has also funded a second study of tegoprubart at the University of Chicago and the University of Miami. The trial will enroll patients with T1D and severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness who also have kidney dysfunction but not failure. Currently, such patients are ineligible for transplantation due to tacrolimus-related nephrotoxicity.

Wright noted that other innovative approaches, including genetic modification of transplanted cells, are also showing promise.

“It's a very exciting time in islet transplantation,” he said. “We're seeing accelerating successes on multiple fronts in these studies.”

Eledon Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures tegoprubart, is currently sponsoring trials in kidney transplantation, but not in islet transplantation. Meanwhile, other companies are developing CD40 ligand inhibitors. Sanofi, for example, is conducting trials of frexalimab in several immune-mediated conditions, including multiple sclerosis (in phase 3) and systemic lupus erythematosus (phase 2), as well as a phase 2 trial in new-onset T1D for islet cell preservation.

Witkowski is a consultant for Dompé, Vertex, Sernova, and Eledon. Wright reported no disclosures. Herold is a consultant for Sanofi.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be more common than previously thought in some demographic groups, according to the first population-based study to use a blood test to gauge AD-related neuropathological changes (ADNCs).

The study found a higher prevalence of AD dementia in older individuals and a lower prevalence of preclinical AD in younger age groups, compared with previous studies with smaller, less representative cohorts, investigators said.

Notably, more than 1 in 10 adults older than 70 met the criteria for monoclonal antibody therapy that could potentially slow cognitive decline. 

A “major advance” of this study is the use of blood-based biomarkers as a way to generate more accurate, population-level estimates of AD pathology, Nicholas Ashton, PhD, senior director of the Banner Fluid Biomarker Program, Banner Sun Health Research Institute in Sun City, Arizona, told Medscape Medical News.

“It's really kind of taking a step away from the clinic and saying we can use these blood tests to better inform us about population-level prevalence of Alzheimer's disease pathology across the board,” Ashton explained. 

The study was published online on December 17 in Nature.

The researchers measured pTau217, a highly accurate blood biomarker for early AD pathology, in blood samples from 11,486 adults aged 58 or older enrolled in the HUNT study in Norway.

Participants were classified as having AD pathology, no AD pathology, or an intermediate result using validated cutoffs. All participants aged 70 or older underwent cognitive assessments to link blood biomarker findings to clinical diagnoses such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.

There was a stepwise increase in the prevalence of ADNCs with age — from less than 8% in adults aged 58-69, to 18% in those aged 70-74, 58% in those aged 85-89, and 65% in those aged 90 or older.

Among adults aged 70 or older who underwent cognitive assessment, 10% had preclinical AD (brain pathology without cognitive symptoms), 10.4% had prodromal disease (pathology plus MCI), and 9.8% had AD dementia.

In this 70+ age group, ADNCs were found in 60% of individuals with dementia, in 33% of those with MCI, and in 23.5% of those with no cognitive impairment.

“Our study used a simple blood test to establish changes that contribute to cognitive impairment in those with dementia. In doing so, we found that around 11% of participants over the age of 70 meet the eligibility criteria for monoclonal antibody treatments that can potentially slow the impact of cognitive decline in these individuals,” co-lead author Dag Aarsland, MD, PhD, professor of old-age psychiatry at King's College London in London, England, said in a statement.

“If we are to meet this global challenge, it is vital that we are able to detect signs of Alzheimer's disease at the earliest possible stages. This blood test looks to be an effective means of providing that clarity at scale,” Aarsland added.

Notably, the researchers said that based on plasma pTau217 concentrations below the lower cutoff, ADNCs were ruled out in 41% of the MCI group and 19.4% of the dementia group. Thus, in these groups, cognitive impairment is probably due to causes other than AD.

ADNCs were more common in people with lower educational attainment, especially in the older age groups, and among carriers of the APOE epsilon 4 gene variant, a known genetic risk factor. Men and women had similar rates of ADNCs across age groups.

The researchers cautioned that these findings are relevant to a mainly white Norwegian population. Because dementia varies across different ethnic groups, the prevalence of ADNCs may also differ in other populations, they noted.

Two outside experts shared their perspectives on this analysis with the UK nonprofit Science Media Center.

Louise Serpell, DPhil, emerita professor of biochemistry at the University of Sussex in Brighton and Hove, England, said it provides “some interesting and some surprising results.”

The fact that a number of individuals diagnosed with “dementia” were negative for pTau217 was “notable,” raising “important questions about the specific diagnosis and the reach of the marker,” Serpell commented.

Another notable finding was the lack of any significant difference in prevalence of ADNCs between sexes, “which raises questions about the popular belief that women are at a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease,” Serpell said. 

Also weighing in, Tara Spires-Jones, PhD, director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, said the study adds to other data suggesting that AD prevalence is rising as the population ages.

She noted, however, that the prevalence figures are not that different from two other recent reports.

The observation in this study from Norway that around 60% of people over age 85 had ADNCs is “similar to a large review of data from around the world published in 2023, which found that 55%-59% of people over age 85 exhibited these changes,” Spires-Jones noted.

In addition, the finding in the Norway study that about 25% of people aged 85-89 had dementia is in line with data from the Alzheimer's Association in 2025, which found that over 30% of people over age 85 have AD.

For these reasons, these new data are “not a surprise,” Spires-Jones noted.

She agreed with the authors that a key limitation was the relatively homogenous population in Norway with few people from diverse genetic backgrounds — an “important” caveat given that AD prevalence is known to be different in people from different ethnicities.

The study had no commercial funding. Ashton reported having given lectures, produced educational materials, and participated in educational programs for Eli-Lilly, BioArctic, and Quanterix, which markets a pTau217 test. A complete list of author disclosures is available with the original article. Serpell is the founder of Serpell-Science, a consultancy that advises on communication and research strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. Spires-Jones reported no relevant disclosures.

For over a century, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been considered irreversible. Consequently, research has focused on disease prevention or slowing, rather than recovery. Despite billions of dollars spent on decades of research, there has never been a clinical trial of a drug for AD with an outcome goal of reversing disease and recovering function.

Now, a research team from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center has challenged this long-held dogma in the field. They tested whether brains already badly afflicted with advanced AD could recover.

The study, led by Kalyani Chaubey, PhD, from the Pieper Laboratory, published today in Cell Reports Medicine. Through studying diverse preclinical mouse models and human AD brains, the team showed that the brain's failure to maintain normal levels of a central cellular energy molecule, NAD+, is a major driver of AD, and that maintaining proper NAD+ balance can prevent and even reverse the disease.

NAD+ levels decline naturally across the body, including the brain, as people age. Without proper NAD+ balance, cells eventually become unable to execute critical processes required for proper functioning and survival. In this study, the team showed that the decline in NAD+ is even more severe in the brains of people with AD, and that this also occurs in mouse models of the disease.

While AD is a uniquely human condition, it can be studied in the laboratory with mice that have been engineered to express genetic mutations that cause AD in people. The researchers used two of these models. One line of mice carried multiple human mutations in amyloid processing, and the other mouse line carried a human mutation in the tau protein. Amyloid and tau pathology are two of the major early events in AD, and both lines of mice develop brain pathology resembling AD, including blood-brain barrier deterioration, axonal degeneration, neuroinflammation, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, reduced synaptic transmission, and widespread accumulation of oxidative damage. These mice also develop severe cognitive impairments that resemble what is seen in people with AD.

After finding that NAD+ levels in the brain declined precipitously in both human and mouse AD, the research team tested whether preventing the loss of brain NAD+ balance before disease onset, or restoring brain NAD+ balance after significant disease progression, could prevent or reverse AD, respectively. The study was based on their previous work, published in Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA, showing that restoring the brain's NAD+ balance achieved pathological and functional recovery after severe, long-lasting traumatic brain injury. They restored NAD+ balance by administering a now well-characterized pharmacologic agent known as P7C3-A20, developed in the Pieper lab.

Remarkably, not only did preserving NAD+ balance protect mice from developing AD, but delayed treatment in mice with advanced disease also enabled the brain to fix the major pathological events caused by the genetic mutations. Moreover, both lines of mice fully recovered cognitive function. This was accompanied by normalized blood levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a recently approved clinical biomarker of AD in people, providing confirmation of disease reversal and highlighting a potential biomarker for future clinical trials.

""We were very excited and encouraged by our results,"" said Andrew A. Pieper, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH. ""Restoring the brain's energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer's. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain's NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer's.""

Dr. Pieper also holds the Morley-Mather Chair in Neuropsychiatry at UH and the CWRU Rebecca E. Barchas, MD, DLFAPA, University Professorship in Translational Psychiatry. He serves as Psychiatrist and Investigator in the Louis Stokes VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC).

The results prompt a paradigm shift in how researchers, clinicians, and patients can think about treating AD in the future. ""The key takeaway is a message of hope – the effects of Alzheimer's disease may not be inevitably permanent,"" said Dr. Pieper. ""The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.""

Dr. Chaubey further explained, ""Through our study, we demonstrated one drug-based way to accomplish this in animal models, and also identified candidate proteins in the human AD brain that may relate to the ability to reverse AD.""

Dr. Pieper emphasized that currently available over the counter NAD+-precursors have been shown in animal models to raise cellular NAD+ to dangerously high levels that promote cancer The approach in this study, however, uses a pharmacologic agent (P7C3-A20) that enables cells to maintain their proper balance of NAD+ under conditions of otherwise overwhelming stress, without elevating NAD+ to supraphysiologic levels.

""This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery,"" said Dr. Pieper.

This work also encourages new research into complementary approaches and eventual testing in patients, and the technology is being commercialized by Cleveland-based company Glengary Brain Health, co-founded by Dr. Pieper.

""This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients,"" Dr. Pieper explained. ""Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer's reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease.""

By engineering a system replicating the womb lining with high biological accuracy, researchers at the Babraham Institute and Stanford University have been able to study the implantation of human embryos, opening up this enigmatic process to investigation. This now allows scientists to study interactions between the womb and embryo, and look for the causes behind implantation failure, a main reason for early pregnancy loss, and the origins of pregnancy complications.

""Understanding embryo implantation and embryo development just after implantation has significant clinical relevance as these stages are particularly prone to failure,"" said Dr Peter Rugg-Gunn, senior group leader at the Babraham Institute who led the study. ""In particular, the high rate of implantation failure represents one of the main limiting factors for IVF success.""

About one week after fertilisation, the developing embryo embeds into the womb lining (endometrium). This stage in development is one of the least understood due to the difficulty of observing the embryo during and after implantation.

The new 3D model system looks to replicate the complex physiological properties and cellular composition of the endometrium. The model is built in a step-by-step process by bringing together the different components of endometrial tissue. The team isolated two essential cell types that form endometrial tissue – epithelial cells and stromal cells – from tissue donated by healthy people who had endometrial biopsies.

As well as the cell types, the researchers sought to recreate the structure of the womb lining. Information from donated endometrial tissue was used to identify the tissue components that give the womb lining its structure. The researchers were able to incorporate these components together with the stromal cells into a special type of gel to support the growth of the cells in a thick layer. On top of this, they added the epithelial cells, which spread out over the surface of the stromal cells.

Once assembled, this formed an advanced replica of the womb lining, matching a biopsy of endometrial tissue in terms of cellular architecture, and showing responses to hormone stimulation that indicate the engineered womb lining's receptivity for embryo implantation.

The team tested their model using donated early-stage human embryos from IVF procedures, and found that the embryo – at this point a compact ball of cells – underwent the expected stages expected of adhesion and invasion into the endometrial scaffold. Following implantation, the embryos increased secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a biochemical marker used in pregnancy tests to confirm pregnancy, and other pregnancy-associated proteins.

Dr Rugg-Gunn said: ""We were really excited to see that our system released essential factors that are needed to nourish the embryo in the first few weeks of pregnancy. Previous models haven't been able to achieve this, so this represented a breakthrough for us.""

Furthermore, the system supported post-implantation development of the embryo, enabling the analysis of embryo stages (12-14 days post fertilisation) that have been largely unexplored. The researchers observed that implanted embryos reached several developmental milestones, such as the appearance of specialist cell types in the embryo and also the establishment of precursor cell types important for the development of the placenta.

Using single cell analysis of implantation sites, the researchers were able to profile cells at the interface between the embryo and endometrium model, effectively listening in to the molecular communication between the tissues. Their results provide new insight into the complex interactions between the embryo and endometrial environment that underpin embryo development immediately after implantation.

Dr Irene Zorzan, co-first author of the study and postdoctoral fellow, explained the impact of the model to this field of research: ""Embryo implantation and post-implantation development are crucial events normally hidden from view, and this has limited our ability to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this critical phase.

""Now, we can witness the unexplored aspects of the earliest moments of development and uncover new insight into how the foundations of a successful pregnancy are laid"".

In addition to extending our textbook understanding of development at this crucial stage, the team's model could be used to detect differences in the endometrial response in the embryo-womb lining communication for individuals experiencing infertility issues and also to test treatments that may increase reception of the embryo by the endometrium.

Dr Sarah Elderkin, co-first author of the study and senior research scientist, concluded: ""The synchronised communications between the embryo and womb lining are essential for a healthy baby and a healthy mother. Our model provides the ability for us to understand how this connection is established at implantation with implications for infertility, improving pregnancy success and early identification of pregnancy disorders. We are hugely grateful to people who donate surplus embryos to enable research like ours, without whom it wouldn't be possible.""

A team led by investigators at Mass General Brigham and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has developed and validated an artificial intelligence (AI)–based noninvasive tool that can predict the likelihood that a patient's oropharyngeal cancer-a type of head and neck cancer that develops in the throat-will spread, thereby signaling which patients should receive aggressive treatment. The research is published in Journal of Clinical Oncology.

""Our tool may help identify which patients should receive multiple interventions or would be ideal candidates for clinical trials of intensive strategies such as immunotherapy or additional chemotherapy,"" said senior author Benjamin Kann, MD, of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) Program at Mass General Brigham and a radiation oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Our tool can also help identify which patients should undergo de-intensification of treatment, such as surgery alone.""

Treatments for oropharyngeal cancer, including combinations of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, can be difficult to tolerate and may have lasting negative effects. Therefore, it's important to identify subgroups of patients who may benefit from less or more intensive treatment approaches. One way to accomplish this involves assessing whether the patient has pathologic extranodal extension (ENE), which occurs when cancer cells invade beyond the lymph node into surrounding tissue. Currently, ENE can only be definitively diagnosed by surgically removing and examining lymph nodes.

To provide a method to assess ENE before treatment decisions are made, Kann and colleagues developed an AI-based tool that can take imaging data from computed tomography scans and predict the number of lymph nodes with ENE, an indicator of a patient's prognosis and likelihood of benefiting from intensified therapy. When the tool was applied to imaging scans from 1,733 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma, the tool was able to predict uncontrolled cancer spread and worse patient survival. Integrating the AI's assessment into established clinical risk predictors improved risk stratification, leading to more accurate predictions of survival and cancer spread in individual patients.

""The AI tool enables the prediction of number of lymph nodes with ENE, which could not be done before, and shows that it is a powerful, novel prognostic biomarker for oropharyngeal cancer that could be used to improve the current staging scheme and treatment planning,"" said Kann.

The licensed Optimer® functions as a reversible, temperature-dependent inhibitor in hot-start DNA amplification protocols. The synthetic binder maintains DNA polymerase in an inactive state at ambient temperatures, preventing non-specific primer extension and primer-dimer formation during reaction assembly. Upon thermal activation, the binder-enzyme complex dissociates, restoring full enzymatic activity. This mechanism enhances assay specificity and sensitivity in applications including clinical diagnostics, genomic analysis, and library preparation for next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflows.

Under the agreement, Aptamer Group grants Alphazyme non-exclusive worldwide rights to incorporate the enzyme-modulating Optimer® into hot-start PCR and NGS product formulations. The commercial framework encompasses:

This integrated supply arrangement ensures quality control and supply chain continuity while generating contract manufacturing revenue for Aptamer Group.

The parties initiated a development agreement in June 2024, with final candidate molecules delivered in December 2024. Alphazyme's internal validation studies confirmed temperature-dependent modulation of both exonuclease and polymerase activities. Notably, the single Optimer® binder replicates functionality typically requiring two distinct antibody reagents, offering potential advantages in manufacturing economics and formulation complexity.

Following this success, a second Optimer® development programme for enzyme modulation has been initiated with Alphazyme to broaden the customer's product portfolio. This project has recently completed the development phase, with candidate molecules having been delivered to Alphazyme for internal testing with positive results in the customer's hands.

We are delighted to announce the signing of this licensing agreement with Alphazyme. This second enzyme modulation licensing agreement validates both the technical performance and commercial appeal of Optimer® technology in the molecular biology market. One of the standout features is the ability of our product to replace two antibodies with a single product, offering significant performance and manufacturing advantages, which will drive further licensing opportunities on successful technical validation of the second project.  

We look forward to building on the relationship with Alphazyme through our ongoing development programmes, which will provide the opportunity for further licensing of our Optimer® technology.”

A new research paper was published in Volume 12 of Oncoscience on October 14, 2025, titled ""Bridging clinical insight and laboratory model in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) using DNA sequencing-based profiling of TP53.""

In this study, Faisal Iqbal from the University of Illinois Chicago used genetic sequencing and cell death analysis to demonstrate that the OVCAR3 cell line accurately reflects the biological characteristics of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), the most lethal form of ovarian cancer. The findings validate OVCAR3 as a reliable model for HGSOC and provide researchers with a valuable laboratory tool for developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

HGSOC is responsible for the majority of ovarian cancer-related deaths, largely due to its late diagnosis and resistance to standard therapies. To determine whether OVCAR3 can effectively represent clinical cases, the researchers compared its genetic profile to that of clinical ovarian cancer samples. Using Sanger sequencing, a widely used and cost-effective genetic analysis method, they found that both the lab and clinical samples shared the same non-mutated form of the TP53 gene, a key marker often altered in ovarian cancer. This result supports the relevance of OVCAR3 in modeling disease behavior.

""The most prevalent and aggressive subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer is high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) – approximately 70% of all ovarian cancer cases.""

The study also explored how two repurposed drugs-metformin and chlorpromazine (CPZ)-affect ovarian cancer cells. These drugs were tested individually and in combination. Cell death measurements and colony formation assays showed that while each drug had moderate effects alone, the combination significantly reduced cancer cell survival. These results were consistent across both clinical and laboratory samples, further validating the model's accuracy in predicting therapeutic responses.

Overall, the study highlights the continued importance of Sanger sequencing in cancer research and emphasizes the need for genetically validated models like OVCAR3. By aligning laboratory experiments with clinical data, the research strengthens the foundation for more accurate preclinical testing, an essential step toward personalized medicine and more effective cancer treatments.

Older adults who live in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods spend significantly fewer days at home in the year after a fall-related hip fracture than those living in more affluent areas, according to a large national study published today in JAMA Network Open.

The study analyzed Medicare data from more than 52,000 older adults who experienced a hip fracture. Researchers found that people living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods spent about 23 fewer days at home during the year after their injury compared with those in the least disadvantaged areas after considering individual factors such as age or chronic illnesses. 

""Neighborhood context is a critical determinant of health, but it's often overlooked in hip fracture research,"" said study senior author Jason R. Falvey, DPT, PhD, Associate Professor of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. ""Older adults in neighborhoods like West Baltimore face compounded challenges-limited ability to get to rehabilitation services, fewer supports for caregivers, and neighborhood factors like broken sidewalks that impede mobility. These realities make it harder to regain independence after a hip fracture.""

Using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI)-a national measure capturing factors such as income, education, employment, and housing quality-the researchers categorized patients' neighborhoods by level of economic deprivation. Those in the most deprived neighborhoods were also more likely to identify as members of racial or ethnic minority groups and to be dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.

""These findings point to the urgent need for community-tailored recovery programs and policy interventions that go beyond hospital walls,"" added Dr. Falvey, who is also Director of the School's Center for Disability Justice. ""By investing in community-level resources, caregiver supports, and safe neighborhood infrastructure, we can help more older adults recover and age in place no matter where they live""

Why is this study important?

Because it shows that recovery after a serious injury isn't just about medical care - it's also about where someone lives. Two people with the same injury and surgery can have very different recoveries depending on their neighborhood resources and supports.

What does ""days at home"" actually mean?

It's the number of days a person is alive and not in a hospital, nursing home, or other care facility. It's a simple way to measure independence and quality of life after a major health event.

What are the implications for health care providers?

Clinicians should consider neighborhood and social factors when planning recovery after a hip fracture. That could include earlier referrals to community resources, better coordination of post-hospital care, and tailored rehabilitation plans.

What does this mean for health systems and policymakers?

The findings suggest that improving recovery after hip fracture will require more than medical treatment alone. Investments in community-based supports, transportation, home health services, and neighborhood infrastructure could help more older adults recover at home.

What's next?

The researchers say future work should focus on designing care models that account for neighborhood conditions and address barriers that prevent older adults from safely aging in place after injury.

Researchers have used a cutting-edge robotic system capable of synthesizing hundreds of metal complexes to develop a possible antibiotic candidate - offering fresh hope in the global fight against drug-resistant infections.

In a study published in Nature Communications, the researchers synthesised over 700 complex metal compounds in just one week. This rapid screening process identified a promising new iridium-based antibiotic candidate that kills bacteria while remaining non-toxic to human cells.

As bacteria become increasingly resistant to existing treatments, the world faces a silent pandemic. Over one million people die annually from preventable drug-resistant infections. Without new drugs, routine procedures such as hip replacements, chemotherapy and organ transplants could soon become life-threateningly dangerous due to the risk of untreatable infection.

In response to this crisis, a team led by Dr Angelo Frei at the University of York's Department of Chemistry turned to an often-overlooked area of medicine: metal-based compounds.

While most modern antibiotics are carbon-based ""flat"" molecules, metal complexes are three-dimensional. This unique geometry allows them to interact with bacteria in completely different ways, potentially overcoming the resistance mechanisms that defeat current drugs.

Traditionally, discovering a new drug is a slow process. However, the Frei Lab utilized robotics and ""click"" chemistry – a method where two molecular components are ""bolted"" together efficiently – to supercharge the process.

Postdoctoral researcher Dr David Husbands used this automated platform to combine almost 200 different ""ligands"" (molecules that surround a metal centre) with five different metals. The result was the synthesis of over 700 new metal complexes in just under a week – a task that would typically take months of manual labour.

Following synthesis, the team screened the 700 compounds for antibacterial activity and toxicity against healthy human cells. The study identified six potential new lead compounds.

One compound in particular – a complex based on the metal iridium – stood out. It demonstrated high effectiveness against bacteria, including strains similar to the deadly MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), while displaying low toxicity to human cells. This suggests it has a high ""therapeutic index"" and is a strong candidate for further drug development.

The pipeline for new antibiotics has been running dry for decades. Traditional screening methods are slow and the pharmaceutical industry has largely withdrawn from this space due to low returns on investment. We have to think differently.""

By combining smart 'click' chemistry with automation, we have demonstrated that we can explore vast, untapped areas of chemical space at unprecedented speed. We aren't just looking for one drug; we are proving a methodology that can help us find the 'needle in the haystack' much faster. The iridium compound we discovered is exciting, but the real breakthrough is the speed at which we found it. This approach could be the key to avoiding a future where routine infections become fatal again.""

Dr. Angelo Frei, lead author of the study

Historically, there has been a misconception that metal-based drugs are inherently toxic. However, data from the Community for Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery (CO-ADD) suggests that metal complexes actually have a higher ""hit rate"" for being antibacterial without being toxic compared to standard organic molecules.

The University of York team hopes that this new methodology will encourage the wider scientific community and pharmaceutical companies to revisit metal complexes. The team is now working to understand exactly how their new iridium compound attacks bacteria and is expanding their robotic platform to test other metals.

The research also demonstrated that this rapid-synthesis method could be applied to other fields, such as discovering new catalysts for industrial processes.

Using detailed geographic data and open-source routing tools, researchers reveal stark regional differences in how easily Australians can reach hospitals, GPs, and pharmacies, creating a powerful new resource to study healthcare access nationwide.



Study: Travel times and distances to health services in Australia. Image Credit: BJP7images / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Data, researchers generated a national dataset describing patterns of healthcare accessibility in Australia based on road-based car travel.

Geographic accessibility is an important aspect of healthcare delivery, referring to the ease with which people can physically reach healthcare services. It is commonly assessed by analyzing factors such as the availability of healthcare facilities (supply), population distribution (demand), and transportation networks.

A 2020 report revealed that more than 42,000 people living in inner regional, outer regional, remote, or very remote areas of Australia lacked access to any primary healthcare service within a one-hour drive. In addition, approximately 65,000 individuals lacked access to a general practice (GP) within one hour. Limited geographic access has been associated with lower healthcare utilization and poorer health outcomes.

In the present study, researchers estimated modeled driving distances and travel times to the nearest healthcare services in Australia using only car-based routing.

Health service locations were sourced from Healthdirect and included public and private hospitals, emergency departments (EDs), GPs, pharmacies, and bulk-billing GPs. Health service coordinates were indexed using k-d trees to efficiently retrieve the ten nearest candidate providers to each mesh block centroid.



Map of Australia divided into Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2s), color-coded based on the shortest travel time to each type of health service.Map of Australia divided into Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2s), color-coded based on the shortest travel time to each type of health service.

Data on mesh blocks (MBs), the smallest geographic units defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), were used. Centroids were calculated using a geographic information system (GIS), specifically QGIS.

Each centroid record was linked to higher-level geographic classifications, including Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2), and the corresponding state or territory.

The dataset was further linked to population counts, postal areas, and Modified Monash Model (MMM) classifications. MMM categorizes areas by population size and remoteness, while postal areas represent ABS mesh block approximations of postcode boundaries.

OpenStreetMap data for Australia was used to initialize an Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) server. The OSRM table service computed modeled driving distances and travel times from each mesh block centroid to the nearest private and public hospitals, GPs, EDs, bulk-billing GPs, and pharmacies.

Population-weighted mean distances and travel times to the nearest health service were then calculated for postal areas, MMM categories, and SA2 regions within each state and territory.

The higher density of pharmacies and GPs meant that most residents could access these services within a ten-minute drive. In contrast, residents of the Australian Capital Territory exhibited relatively long travel times to emergency departments and public hospitals, likely reflecting the limited number of such facilities despite the territory's small geographic size. The Northern Territory showed relatively flat travel-time distributions, reflecting sparse health facility coverage and wide variability in travel distances.

This study describes a nationally consistent dataset capturing car-based healthcare accessibility across Australia. The use of OSRM provided routing results comparable to commercial navigation services, although travel times may be underestimated where road routes are unavailable.

The public release of this dataset supports research into healthcare access, utilization, and outcomes, promotes methodological consistency across studies, and offers a framework that can be adapted to other countries.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Alcohol consumption plays a major role in India's mouth cancer burden","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251223/Alcohol-consumption-plays-a-major-role-in-Indiae28099s-mouth-cancer-burden.aspx","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 02:02:00 GMT","

Even a low daily intake of alcohol--just 9 g or around one standard drink-is linked to a 50% heightened risk of mouth (buccal mucosa) cancer in India, with the greatest risk associated with locally brewed alcohol, finds a large comparative study, published online in the open access journal BMJ Global Health.

And when combined with chewing tobacco, it likely accounts for 62% of all such cases in India, the findings suggest.

Mouth cancer is the second most common malignancy in India, with an estimated 143,759 new cases and 79,979 deaths every year. Rates of the disease have risen steadily, and now stand at just under 15 for every 100,000 Indian men, note the researchers.

The primary form of mouth cancer in India is that of the soft pink lining of the cheeks and lips (buccal mucosa). Less than half (43%) of those affected survive 5 or more years, they point out.

As alcohol consumption and tobacco use often go hand in hand, it's not clear how much each factor individually contributes to mouth cancer risk, especially in India, where the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use is high, point out the researchers. Nor have the potential effects of locally brewed alcohol, which is particularly popular in rural communities, been assessed, they add.

To find out more, the researchers compared 1803 people with confirmed buccal mucosa cancer and 1903 randomly selected people free of the disease (controls) from five different study centres between 2010 and 2021. Most of the participants were aged between 35 and 54; nearly half (around 46%) of cases were among 25 to 45 year olds.

Each of the participants provided information on the duration, frequency, and type of alcohol they drank from among 11 internationally recognised drinks, including beer, whisky, vodka, rum and breezers (flavoured alcoholic drinks); and 30 locally brewed drinks, including apong, bangla, chulli, desi daru, and mahua.

Participants were also asked about the duration and type of tobacco use so that the extent of the interaction between alcohol and tobacco on mouth cancer risk could be assessed.

Among the cases, 1019 said they didn't drink alcohol compared with 1420 among the controls; 781 of the cases said they did drink alcohol compared with 481 of the controls.

The average length of tobacco use was higher for cases (around 21 years) than for the control group (around 18 years). Cases were also more likely to live in rural areas and to drink more alcohol every day: nearly 37 g compared with around 29 g.

Frequent alcohol consumption was associated with a heightened risk of buccal mucosa cancer, with locally brewed drinks associated with the greatest risk.

Compared with those who didn't drink alcohol, the risk was 68% higher for those who did, rising to 72% for those favouring internationally recognised alcohol types, and to 87% for those opting for locally brewed drinks.

As little as under 2 g a day of beer was associated with a heightened risk of buccal mucosa cancer. And just 9 g a day of alcohol-equivalent to around one standard drink--was associated with an approximately 50% increased risk.

Concurrent alcohol and tobacco use was associated with a more than quadrupling in risk, such that 62% of all buccal mucosa cancer cases in India are likely attributable to the interaction between alcohol and chewing tobacco, calculate the researchers.

But alcohol was a contributory factor to the heightened risk of mouth cancer irrespective of how long tobacco had been used. Ethanol might alter the fat content of the inner lining of the mouth, increasing its permeability and therefore its susceptibility to other potential carcinogens in chewing tobacco products, explain the researchers.

The findings suggest that more than 1 in 10 cases (nearly 11.5%) of all buccal mucosa cancers in India are attributable to alcohol, rising to 14% in some of the states with a high prevalence of the disease, such as Meghalaya, Assam, and Madhya Pradesh, say the researchers. 

Possible contamination with toxins, such as methanol and acetaldehyde, in locally brewed alcohol, might help explain the higher risk associated with these drinks, the manufacture of which is largely unregulated, they suggest.

""The current legal framework for alcohol control in India is complex and involves both central and state laws. Central legislation provides protection of citizens where alcohol is included in the State List under the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution, giving states the power to regulate and control alcohol production, distribution and sale. However, the locally-brewed liquor market is unregulated, with some forms used by participants containing up to 90% alcohol content,"" they point out.

They conclude: ""In summary, our study demonstrates that there is no safe limit of alcohol consumption for [buccal mucosa cancer] risk…Our findings suggest that public health action towards prevention of alcohol and tobacco use could largely eliminate [buccal mucosa cancer] from India.""

Scientists have engineered a protein able to record the incoming chemical signals of brain cells (as opposed to just their outgoing signals). These whisper-quiet incoming messages are the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate, which plays a critical role in how brain cells communicate with one another but until now has been extremely difficult to capture.

The special protein that researchers at the Allen Institute and HHMI's Janelia Research Campus have engineered is a molecular ""glutamate indicator"" called iGluSnFR4 (pronounced 'glue sniffer'). It's sensitive enough to detect the faintest incoming signals between neurons in the brain, offering a new way to decipher and interpret their complex cascade of electrical activity that underpins learning, memory, and emotion. iGluSnFR4 could help decode the hidden language of the brain and deepen our understanding of how its complex circuitry works. This discovery allows researchers to watch neurons in the brain communicate in real time. The findings have just been published in Nature Methods and could transform how neuroscience research is done as it pertains to measuring and analyzing neural activity.

To understand the significance of this discovery, it helps to understand how the brain works: billions of neurons ""talk"" to each other by sending pulses of electricity down their branch-like axons. When the electrical signals reach the end of the axons, they can't jump the gap to the next brain cell, known as a synapse. Instead, they trigger the release of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters (glutamate being the most common and critical for memory, learning, and emotion) into the synapse that causes the next brain cell to fire in sequence.

It's like a row of falling dominos, but vastly more complex: Each neuron receives inputs from thousands of other neurons, and specific patterns and combinations of those input neurons firing is what makes the next (receiving) neuron fire. With this new discovery, scientists can now identify the critical patterns and combinations of input neuron activity that cause the next neurons to fire. Until now, detecting these incoming signals in living brain tissue was nearly impossible. Older technologies were either too slow or not sensitive enough to pick up the action at the single-synapse level. Now researchers can hear the entire conversation rather than fragments of it.

It's like reading a book with all the words scrambled and not understanding the order of the words or how they're arranged. I feel like what we're doing here is adding the connections between those neurons and by doing that, we now understand the order of the words on the pages, and what they mean.""

Kaspar Podgorski, Ph.D., lead author on the study and senior scientist at the Allen Institute

Before these protein sensors existed, researchers could only record the outgoing signals from brain cells, leaving half of the communications equation (the cells' inputs) a mystery. The incoming signals were always too faint and fast to capture, until now.

""Neuroscientists have pretty good ways of measuring structural connections between neurons, and in separate experiments, we can measure what some of the neurons in the brain are saying, but we haven't been good at combining these two kinds of information. It's hard to measure what neurons are saying to which other neurons,"" said Podgorski. ""What we have invented here is a way of measuring information that comes into neurons from different sources, and that's been a critical part missing from neuroscience research.""

""The success of iGluSnFR4 stems from our close collaboration started at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus between the GENIE Project team and Kaspar's lab. That research has extended to the phenomenal in vivo characterization work done by the Allen Institute's Neural Dynamics group,"" said Jeremy Hasseman, Ph.D., a scientist with HHMI's Janelia Research Campus. ""This was a great example of collaboration across labs and institutes to enable new discoveries in neuroscience.""

This discovery removes a significant barrier in modern neuroscience: the inability to clearly monitor and make sense of how brain cells receive information. With this powerful new tool available to researchers through Addgene, some of the brain's deepest mysteries may soon be revealed.

The High Impact Player rule reflects the player-driven nature of American sports culture Elsa/NWSL via Getty Images

The new High Impact Player rule, introduced Tuesday by the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), allows teams to spend as much as $1 million above the salary cap on players who meet certain criteria.

A player needs to only satisfy one of eight metrics outlined by the rule, with each geared toward quantifying their skill set and commercial marketability.

Advertisement

They need to have landed on one of three different lists intended to honor the best in the world: the top 30 in the Ballon d'Or, top 40 among The Guardian's top 100 footballers, or the top 40 of ESPN FC's top 50 football players in the world in the two years before the current league season. The player can also have made SportsPro Media's list of the 150 most marketable athletes within a year of the current league season.

A player can also qualify if they rank among the top 11 U.S. women's national team players with the most minutes in the last two calendar years. A goalkeeper, meanwhile, would need to have played the most minutes in that position with the USWNT. Or a high-impact player, as defined by the league, could include anyone who was selected as a league MVP finalist or was named to the year-end Best XI first team within the last two seasons.

Ironically, this new roster mechanism risks pulling that decision-making power away from NWSL teams and placing it with the entities doing the ranking, some of which are directly tied to the league through its $240 million broadcast deal or have selection processes that are questionable at best.

Players themselves are critical of the new rule. NWSL Players Association executive director Meghann Burke relayed their concerns in an email to The Athletic on Tuesday, saying players “feel that this is a rushed decision to solve a short-term problem that will have long-term consequences” and sharing their belief that it “circumvents the collective bargaining process” and “unilaterally establishes criteria that relies on third party publications to drive player compensation.” They added that it “privileges a biased voting system that heavily favors European players” and does not account “for the high impact that Brazilian, African, and Japanese Players (sic) have had and will continue to have on NWSL.”

The disparity in the Ballon d'Or between the organization of voting in the women's award (or lack thereof) and the demands of the women's game is obvious. Those gaps were exposed when the organizers of the award, run by France Football magazine, published its voting breakdown. Of the 50 voters invited to participate in the Ballon d'Or (which is already half of those invited to vote in the men's award), 29 were based in Europe. Nigeria was the only African country to vote, and no players from the continent of Asia landed in the top 30.

The Guardian appears more intentional about curating a globally diverse set of voters and publishes that list, and how they voted, alongside that of the players. While ESPN FC has created top 50 player lists from 2021-2024, it has not yet released its 2025 ranking. ESPN is a media partner of the NWSL.

Spanish forward Alexia Putellas is the highest-ranking women's football player on the 2025 SportsPro Most Marketable list, at number 36; female athletes above her include Simone Biles (2), Ilona Maher (3), Caitlin Clark (7), Coco Gauff (10), and A'ja Wilson (31). The media and events company says it compiles its yearly list based on an athlete's brand strength, addressable market, and economics.

The other women's football players on this year's list are Beth Mead (46); Aitana Bonmati (63); Lucy Bronze and Mary Earps (70 and 71); Millie Bright (79); Trinity Rodman (120); Mapi Leon (123); Lindsey Horan (127); Lauren James, Sophia Wilson (who is listed as Sophia Smith, despite having married and changed her name nine months before the release of the list), and Marta (137-139); Pernille Harder (141); Patri Guijarro (146); Keira Walsh and Salma Paralluelo (149-150).

Once again, African and Asian players are missing, as are South American players outside of Marta. Most of those same players also cannot qualify as high impact with USWNT minutes, leaving only the still-Eurocentric Ballon d'Or, the Guardian, ESPN FC rankings, and NWSL awards as realistic pathways right now for that group of players.

There is at least an ability to adjust the rules as the league continues to progress. That offers some solace, because at present, the league has narrowed the scope of that future for some players by skewing their chances of being considered high impact.

Take these current NWSL players who do not meet the league's criteria but would otherwise be considered high impact, for example: Leicy Santos, Rosemonde Kouassi, Rebeca Bernal, and Gift Monday at the Spirit; Dudinha and Gia Corley of the San Diego Wave; Hina Sugita of Angel City; Claudia Dickey of Seattle Reign, or Taylor Flint of Racing Louisville. Or, even more worrying, the players who have yet to be discovered. Those players are automatically excluded because the rules require them to have proven their worth in some way, whether through their accomplishments on the field or their marketability off of it.

This clash between the NWSL's new rule and its players' opposition illustrates the tension between the superstar-driven nature of American sports culture with that of the team ethos, which has historically shaped football outside the U.S.

A person at the NWSL reiterated to The Athletic on Tuesday that the rule was not crafted for any specific player, although it came eight days before the international transfer window opens and European clubs are likely to up their offers to free agent Trinity Rodman. It does not take effect until July 2026, but teams are able to sign players from the beginning of the new year, provided their contracts do not engage the rule until July.

The NWSL is the only premier women's soccer league in the world that abides by a hard salary cap, which it argues ensures an even distribution of competition, and thus higher numbers of entertaining matches each season to draw in fans and broadcast ratings. It has positioned NWSL clubs to be outbid by teams from other leagues, particularly in Europe, that aren't limited in how much they can spend on a player.

In January, center back Naomi Girma left the San Diego Wave to join Chelsea on what was then a record-breaking transfer fee, and, nine months later, winger Alyssa Thompson left Angel City, her hometown club, to join Girma in London to play with Brazilian-American and fellow U.S. teammate Catarina Macario. That trio is part of a growing contingent of top U.S. players in Europe, which also includes Emily Fox at Arsenal; Phallon Tullis-Joyce at Manchester United; Lindsey Heaps, Lily Yohannes, and Korbin Shrader at OL Lyonnes; and Crystal Dunn and Eva Gaetino at Paris Saint-Germain.

According to NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman, the High Impact Player rule “allows teams to invest strategically in top talent, strengthens our ability to retain star players, and demonstrates our commitment to building world-class rosters for fans across the league.”

The league's apparent disinterest in raising the salary cap by $1 million without restrictions, as the NWSLPA has suggested, is a doubling down on its desire to attract and retain a specific type of talent: one they feel confident can return their investment through their commercial appeal.

Dec. 24 (UPI) -- United States Men's National Team defender Chris Richards was stretchered off during a Crystal Palace loss to Arsenal, leaving his status clouded.
Richards left the field in the 75th minute of the setback Tuesday in London. Crystal Palace coach Oliver Glasner later told reporters that Richards sustained a foot injury. He was unsure when the defender will return to the Eagles' lineup.

""He got a knock on his foot, a stamp on his foot, and it had to be stitched,"" Glasner said. ""I don't know how many stitches, but a few.
""The doctor told me it doesn't look so bad. I'm always hopeful. We have to be hopeful. I don't know if he will be OK for the Tottenham game, but I'm still hoping that he will be back against Fulham.""

The Eagles (7-5-5) sit in eighth place in the Premier League Standings. They will take on 14th place Tottenham Hotspur (6-7-4) on Sunday in London. The Eagles will meet 13th place Fulham (7-8-2) on Jan. 1 in London.

Richards is the second United States Men's National Team player in as many weeks to sustain an injury less than six months before the World Cup. American midfielder Tyler Adams tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee during Bournemouth's 4-4 draw with Manchester United on Dec. 15 in Manchester, England.
He is expected to miss two or three months of action due to that injury. The final U.S. roster for the 2026 World Cup is expected to be announced in May.
Richards, 25, joined Crystal Palace in 2022. He previous played for Bayern Munich and on loan with TSG Hoffenheim. Richards made 35 appearances for the U.S. senior team since 2020.

Officials have contended that the 2026 FIFA World Cup will bring millions of visitors to North Texas, and some of that tourism traffic is already starting to pick up. 

It's an event that has been so big, so hyped and so far-off for so long, it doesn't feel real that we are now only six months away from hosting nine matches of the Beautiful Game in Arlington. The hype started to materialize earlier this month, when Dallas won the match schedule lottery. 

Reigning World Cup champion Argentina will play two games in Dallas, and England, Croatia, Japan and the Netherlands were other big-name pulls that have helped build the buzz. 

Since the group-stage match schedules were announced on Dec. 5, Dallas has seen a 102% spike in hotel and short-term rental bookings, according to data from the short-term rental (STR) management firm PriceLabs. Hotel room bookings around the England vs. Croatia game, which will be played on June 17, doubled in the 24 hours after the match was announced. As of Dec. 7, the average hotel room was going for $457 a night, a 500% increase from the same dates in 2025.

Booking.com data shows a similar influx of international interest. Travel search inquiries made by Austrian travelers between Dec. 5 and Dec. 9, looking to visit Dallas next summer, increased 384,233% year over year. Austria will face off against Argentina on June 22. 

(That number may sound shocking, but is it really that surprising that there wasn't a major Austria-to-Dallas summer pipeline prior to the World Cup? The lower areas of Austria experience daytime highs in the low 80s in June, while the mountainous regions are noticeably cooler. We'd take that over a sweltering summer any day.) 

“The good news is that the DFW region has over 1,200 hotels with over 140,000 hotel rooms, not counting short-term rentals,” Craig Davis, president and CEO of Visit Dallas, told The Dallas Morning News this summer. “So, in terms of capacity, we're not worried at all.”

One factor that could complicate matters is North Texas' inconsistent stance on short-term rentals booked through websites like Airbnb and VRBO. AirDNA, a company that tracks short-term rental analytics, has seen a 300% to 500% increase in Dallas bookings for next June compared to this year. That increase is even higher for Fort Worth STRs. This increase in traffic comes as the state Supreme Court considers whether the block on Dallas' short-term rental ban can continue.  

“[T]ime is of the essence,” an October filing from the city's legal team that asks the court to allow the ban to go into effect states. “The world will soon converge upon Dallas for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. STRs will be in high demand. And with the ordinances erroneously enjoined, it will be more difficult for the city to proactively ensure the health, safety and quality of life for residents and visitors alike.”

That layer of “regulatory uncertainty” could throw a last-minute wrench into North Texas' rental market ahead of the games, the PriceLabs report found. Perhaps the most significant effect would be that interested local homeowners would be unable to list their homes for rent — a hustle that short-term rental operators in Dallas have promised to be a lucrative opportunity.  

“If the injunction is lifted, Dallas would be able to restrict unregulated short-term rentals, limiting how much new, often part-time supply can come online ahead of the tournament,” PriceLabs found. “If supply tightens while demand continues to build, pricing pressure could increase further. If not, additional inventory may still temper rates. Either way, Dallas remains a market where early signals look strong, but outcomes are still very much in motion.”

The debate around Spain's goalkeeping situation ahead of the next FIFA World Cup is slowly gathering momentum, and one name that continues to generate discussion is Barcelona goalkeeper Joan Garcia. 

After another commanding display in Barcelona's clean-sheet win over Villarreal, the shot-stopper once again showed why many consider him among the best goalkeepers currently playing in Spain.

Time and again this season, he has stepped up in key moments, producing saves that have directly influenced results. 

Yet despite his growing reputation and consistent performances for Barça, his place in the Spanish national team setup remains far from guaranteed.

In a preview of an interview with AS (h/t Mundo Deportivo), Spain head coach Luis de la Fuente was asked directly about the goalkeeping situation for the Spain national football team and whether Garcia could force his way into the squad. 

Rather than offering a clear answer, the coach chose to stress the depth of quality currently available to him.

De la Fuente provided context by highlighting his satisfaction with the goalkeepers who have formed the backbone of La Roja in recent competitions. 

He pointed to the performances of Unai Simon, David Raya, and Alex Remiro, making it clear that continuity also plays a role in his thinking.

“We have five or six of the best goalkeepers in the world, but no one talks about Robert Sanchez or Leo Roman either. And Joan Garcia, of course. 

“We have fantastic goalkeepers in Spain, fantastic. It is true that we are currently betting on these three, and we are delighted with Unai, David, and Alex. 

“But we will see what happens between now and March or between now and June, God only knows. Calm down. At that point, we'll have to make the decision that needs to be made. 

“Some people will like it more than others. I will be convinced that the decision I make is the best one,” said Luis de la Fuente.

While Garcia has done everything possible to put himself in the conversation, the national team door is not yet fully open. 

With months still to go before final decisions are made, consistency will be key. If he continues to deliver at the highest level for Barcelona, the pressure on De la Fuente to reconsider his options will only grow.

Gennaro Gattuso confirmed during his latest interview that Marcello Lippi is his role model as Italy's head coach: ‘I copy and paste what he did.'

Lippi was Italy's head coach in 2006 when the Azzurri won the World Cup. Gattuso was part of that legendary team, and Lippi remains a role model for the former midfielder.

“Since I've been the Italy coach, I've done a copy and paste of what he had done,” Gattuso told Vivo Azzurro via TMW.

“Being true and coherent, there's just one way if you want to create a group. Give that extra trust to a player when he's struggling a bit and try to help. Giving a sense of belonging. He was a master at this.”

Gattuso also spoke about what the Azzurri will need in March next year to avoid another World Cup disappointment, as La Nazionale will be facing Northern Ireland in the play-off semifinal.

As the countdown to the 2026 FIFA World Cup begins, soccer fans aren't the only ones preparing for the world's biggest sporting event.

Homeowners across the U.S. are positioning themselves to capitalize on a massive lodging shortfall, with Airbnb hosts expected to rake in nearly $156 million in total earnings, according to an analysis by consulting firm Deloitte.

The average host could see a windfall of about $4,000 during the tournament, which runs from June 11 to July 19. With nightly rates projected to average $262, the event is a significant opportunity for homeowners to offset rising mortgage payments and property taxes.

""An international event like the 2026 World Cup creates a short-term surge in lodging demand that allows homeowners to earn significantly more than during a typical rental period,"" said Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com.

The tournament will be spread across 11 U.S. host cities, but the destination for the final in East Rutherford, New Jersey, is proving to be the most lucrative. Hosts in the New York-New Jersey region are expected to see earnings of $5,700.

The top five most profitable markets for hosts are:

New York-New Jersey: $5,700

Boston: $5,200

Los Angeles: $5,100

Miami: $5,000

Dallas: $4,400

Real estate agents are already seeing a ""gold rush"" mentality. In Dallas, agents report that residents near AT&T Stadium are planning to rent out single rooms, while in Miami, some owners are scheduling their own vacations during the tournament specifically to vacate their homes and maximize rental income, according to Realtor.com.

However, experts advise homeowners to be cautious of local red tape. In markets like New York City, strict short-term rental regulations and building-specific subleasing rules could catch unprepared hosts off guard.

The World Cup's impact is leaking into the broader real estate market. Investors are increasingly seeking ""event-ready"" condos in cities like Atlanta and Miami in buildings that allow short-term stays.

""I have Atlanta buyers wanting to purchase homes just to rent out during the event,"" Ailion told Realtor.com. ""It's a big deal not just for real estate but for the whole economy.""

Antoine Semenyo is good enough to play for either Real Madrid or Barcelona, at least that's according to the Bournemouth star's personal coach. The Ghanaian winger is in the midst of a transfer tug of war with a number of Premier League sides hoping to lure the Cherries ace away from the Vitality Stadium when the January transfer window opens next week.

Semenyo was wanted by Premier League pair Manchester United and Tottenham over the summer, but the duo opted to follow up their respective interest in Bryan Mbeumo and Mohammed Kudus. The 25-year-old Bournemouth forward, meanwhile, signed a five-year deal on the south coast side to tie him down to the Cherries until 2030.

However, the contract contained a £65m release that is active next month until January 10th to give Bournemouth time to secure a replacement for their prized asset in the New Year. Semenyo has made a fine start to the Premier League season having scored eight goals and laid on an additional three assists for Andoni Iraola's side.

That form attracted interest from Premier League giants Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea, while United and Spurs were also briefly in the running for the Ghanaian. It does look as though City will win the £65m race for Semenyo, with the Cityzens expected to firm up their interest in the Bournemouth sensation in the coming days.

Semenyo's personal coach, Saul Isaksson-Hurst, believes the player 'could play for any team in the world' as he gears up to secure a high-profile January switch.

Isaksson-Hurst singled out Real Madrid and Barcelona as the calibre of teams that Semenyo could play for as he lavished praise upon the Premier League star. ""Antoine could play wherever he likes,"" Isaksson-Hurst said, per Hayters.

""He could play for Real Madrid, he could play for Barcelona, he could play for any team in the world. He's that good, he's sensational. He's ready to take on the world. He could play for literally any one of the top clubs, wherever he wants to go. Everyone would want him as well. He's a sensational player with a great mentality. He's got everything.""

Ghana's failure to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations means Semenyo is free to play for across the festive period. And despite a blistering start to the season, Isaksson-Hurst believes Semenyo's campaign is just getting started.

""It's a big year for him, you know, there's been a lot of talk about maybe moving and stuff like that. He's not going to take his hand off the brake, you know, he's going to go full throttle, because he wants to obviously help Bournemouth and be one of the best players in the league. That's a priority.""

City boss Pep Guardiola is a confirmed fan of Semenyo having praised the player earlier in the season before transfer talk intensified. ""He's an extraordinary, extraordinary, extraordinary player,"" the Spaniard said of the winger.

""His energy, his confidence, his movement - unbelievable. He doesn't stop running, he attacks space so well, and when he has the ball, you feel something will happen. He's improving every game. Players like him make this league special - always hungry, always brave.""

Former goalkeeper Rob Green also looked into why City want Semenyo, telling BBC 5 Live: ""He can drive forward with the ball vertically, rather than Doku who comes in and out.

""He can do that something different Pep is looking for. Short term they have their own injury problems, with Oscar Bobb out, Doku out, Marmoush away [at the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt], so he can help short term and long term.""

Green did raise concerns over Savinho's future at the Etihad Stadium, however, adding: ""It does raise the question what future someone like Savinho has though.""

City will have to wait until the transfer window opens next week before they can register Semenyo should they, as expected, sign the winger from Bournemouth. The Cityzens return to league duties at home against Nottingham Forest this weekend before a trip to Sunderland to ring in the New Year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Marc Guehi scares Barcelona away with wage demands as La Liga champions cool interest in Liverpool & Bayern Munich target","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/marc-guehi-scares-barcelona-wage-demands-la-liga-champions-liverpool-bayern-munich-target/blt94e2629f4f1fb968","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:11:50 GMT","

Marc Guehi's future appears to be drifting further away from Barcelona after reports in Spain suggested the reigning champions have cooled their interest in the Crystal Palace captain due to his wage demands. The England international, long admired across Europe, has become one of the most sought-after defenders on the market, but the financial gap between Guehi's expectations and Barcelona's limits is now considered too wide to bridge.

Guehi, 25, is under contract at Palace until the summer of 2026 and has already informed the club he will not sign an extension. That decision has effectively guaranteed his departure, setting the stage for a fierce battle among Europe's elite while simultaneously placing Palace in a difficult strategic position. Liverpool came close to securing Guehi's signature last summer, only for the move to collapse dramatically on deadline day when Palace failed to line up a replacement. Barcelona had earmarked central defence as a priority area for 2026, with sporting director Deco and head coach Hansi Flick aligned on the need for an experienced left-sided centre-back to partner teenage prodigy Pau Cubarsí. Guehi was viewed internally as the ideal profile, but enthusiasm has now waned.

According to Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona had been monitoring Guehi closely and were in contact with his representatives, aware that he could sign a pre-contract agreement as early as next week. However, once the latest salary expectations became clear, discussions stalled and have not resumed in recent weeks. The Catalan club reportedly concluded that the difference was simply too great to overcome. The situation mirrors that of Real Madrid, who were also linked with the defender earlier in the season but are said to have been similarly deterred by the cost of any deal.

With Guehi drifting out of reach, Barcelona have been linked with other elite defenders, though none represent an easy solution. Alessandro Bastoni and Josko Gvardiol have been cited as preferred options, while Nico Schlotterbeck and Pau Torres are also admired. Each, however, would command a substantial transfer fee, and Barcelona's eventual budget remains unclear. What is certain is that any genuine upgrade to their current defensive options will come at a high financial cost.

While Barcelona hesitate, others are moving more decisively. Bayern Munich's interest has been publicly acknowledged, with sporting director Max Eberl confirming the club is actively surveying the market. Speaking to DAZN, Eberl stressed Bayern's priority is extending Dayot Upamecano's contract, but admitted alternatives must be considered if talks fail.

Eberl said: ""It's absolutely clear that we as Bayern Munich are exploring the market. Our clear goal is to extend Upa's [Dayot Upamecano] contract. That's our ultimate goal. If that doesn't work out, we have to be prepared. We would be foolish not to. That's the reason. I've not confirmed anything, but we are active in the market.""

Liverpool, meanwhile, continue to view Guehi as a potential long-term successor to Virgil van Dijk, who will turn 35 next season. The sense of urgency at Anfield has been heightened by Ibrahima Konate's contract situation, with his deal also due to expire in 2026 and rival clubs circling, including Real Madrid.

Despite the uncertainty, Guehi has insisted that last summer's failed move to Liverpool did not unsettle him. Speaking to Sky Sports, he played down the emotional impact, revealing he leaned heavily on his faith and the support of teammates, including Palace colleague Maxence Lacroix.

He said: ""I think everyone has this perception that it was difficult. Actually, it wasn't difficult. It wasn't difficult at all. Because when you're focused on what's the most important thing, it becomes easy. I know that God has a plan for me, and whatever that plan will be, will come into fruition at some point. But, the goal and the focus has always been playing football and trying to do the best I can. And fortunately for me, I get to do it with people like Max.""

For now, his immediate focus remains on Palace, including Sunday's Premier League clash with Tottenham. Yet with Barcelona stepping back and Liverpool and Bayern pushing forward, the next chapter of his career could be written within the next few weeks.

Jadon Sancho has dropped a cryptic message on Instagram as the winger continues to struggle to reignite his stalling career. Sancho joined Aston Villa on loan from Manchester United over the summer with the hopes of returning to his best form having failed to make his mark following his £73m move to Old Trafford from German side Borussia Dortmund back in 2021.

Sancho struggled to transfer his impressive Bundesliga performances to the Premier League following his big-money move to United four-and-a-half years ago. The England international briefly returned to Borussia Dortmund on loan in 2024 having been excluded from the United squad by then-boss Erik ten Hag.

Dortmund had looked into re-signing Sancho but were unable to agree a fee with the Premier League side for the 25-year-old. Instead, Sancho joined Chelsea on a season-long loan and while the Blues had an obligation to make the switch permanent for £25m, the west London outfit opted against exercising their option to sign the forward, paying a £5m penalty in the process.

The English wideman, who is out of contract at Old Trafford at the end of the season, joined Villa on loan over the summer as he sought to reignite his stuttering career, but has struggled for game time at Villa Park this season under head coach Unai Emery. Indeed, Sancho is yet to start a league match for the Villans, with all seven outings coming from the bench, though he has featured prominently in the Europa League, starting four of Villa's six European games so far.

And Sancho has since made a rare Instagram post, featuring a series of 11 photos and messages. ""You gotta serve a purpose to be around me in my new season. It's real personal,"" one message read.

""Distance. Silence. Peace,"" another outlined, while a third simply read: ""On a mission.""

Despite a lack of game time at Villa Park, however, Emery has hinted that Sancho could play a significant role in the second half of the season. Emery's Villa side are flying high in the Premier League, and currently sit third, just three points off top spot, despite a five-game winless run to kick off the campaign.

Yet with the games coming thick and fast, Emery is set to call upon every player in his squad as Villa look to enjoy another memorable season under the Spaniard. And the former Arsenal boss stated that 'in the second part of the season, I believe in him' earlier this week.

Emery admitted that Sancho needs to recapture his best form, and last week said of the on-loan star: ""Jadon is still being young, he has had an amazing career and is now in a moment where he needs help to recover his best performance. I have this challenge with him, he has this challenge with me as well.

""Of course, he is not playing all the minutes I think he has to. But in the second part of the season, I believe in him. He is really being demanding [of] himself to try to get his best moment this season with us. He has that challenge with me and himself, and with the club as well. I believe in him and hopefully we can get it.""

Sancho isn't the only on-loan player struggling for game time at Villa Park, with Harvey Elliott unable to force his way into Emery's plans. Elliott, like Sancho, moved to Villa for the rest of the season over the summer with regular minutes at Liverpool hard to come by.

The 22-year-old's move included a clause that meant Villa would make the switch permanent for £35m if Elliott made 10 appearances for Emery's side.

Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting

However, Elliot has made just five appearances for Villa since joining from Liverpool, and ahead of the Europa League win over FC Basel earlier this month, Emery confirmed that the club won't be signing the England U21 Euros winner permanently.

""We are speaking with him and about his situation. He is not here with us,"" Emery said of Elliott in the build up to the 2-1 victory over the Swiss side. ""First, my decision and also the situation. He is on loan playing with us, but he is not definitely adding to us with a permanent contract.

""Hopefully we can get the best for him and the best for us. I respect him as a player and as a person. He is training well, but we have one circumstance with him. Hopefully we can get a solution for him to try to play consistently and try to continue in his career with us or not.""

Elliott, however, is hampered by FIFA rules that means a player can only play for two clubs in a football season. The youngster made two appearances for parent side Liverpool prior to securing his move to Villa, which means Elliott's options are limited to remaining at Villa Park or returning to Anfield for the second half of the campaign.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Bayern Munich linked with shock move for League One starlet after Vincent Kompany given tip-off from former team-mate Craig Bellamy","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/bayern-munich-league-one-starlet-vincent-kompany-craig-bellamy/blt747be9a0a6ba8684","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:54:13 GMT","

Bayern Munich are closely monitoring Cardiff City teenager Dylan Lawlor, with the Bundesliga giants alerted to the defender's rapid rise by Wales manager Craig Bellamy. talkSPORT have reported that the German champions have taken a serious interest in the 19-year-old, whose development in League One has not gone unnoticed across Europe.

Lawlor, who turns 20 on New Year's Day, has already established himself as one of the most promising young defenders in the British game. Despite operating outside the Premier League spotlight, his composure, intelligence and maturity have attracted scouts from England's top flight, while Bayern now appear to be positioning themselves at the front of a growing queue. Bellamy's relationship with Bayern head coach Vincent Kompany stretches back more than a decade, built first as teammates and later as colleagues on the coaching staff. Bellamy is believed to have highlighted Lawlor's potential directly to Kompany, offering an endorsement that carries considerable weight.

The pair played together 36 times for Manchester City between 2009 and 2011, before reuniting years later in management. Bellamy served as Kompany's assistant at Anderlecht and later followed him to Burnley, cementing a professional bond based on trust and shared footballing values. Bellamy's presence at Cardiff's recent EFL Cup quarter-final defeat to Chelsea further underlined his hands-on approach. Despite a 3-1 loss, Lawlor again caught the eye, reinforcing why his name continues to circulate at the highest levels.

Lawlor's journey is rooted deeply in Cardiff. He joined the Bluebirds' academy at the age of seven and has risen through every level of the club. His senior debut arrived in February, when he featured in an FA Cup tie against Aston Villa. Since the appointment of Brian Barry-Murphy last summer, Lawlor has become a central figure in the side. The teenager has featured in 16 of Cardiff's 20 League One matches this season, helping to anchor a defence that has driven the club to the top of the table. In total, Lawlor has made 23 first-team appearances this year, each performance adding to the sense that he is developing at an accelerated pace. Those close to the club speak of a player growing in authority with every outing.

Lawlor's progress has been mirrored on the international stage. His first call-up to the Wales senior squad came in June for World Cup 2026 qualifiers, a clear signal of Bellamy's faith in his ability. That trust was quickly repaid. In September, Bellamy handed Lawlor his first international start against Kazakhstan. The teenager played the full 90 minutes in a narrow 1-0 victory and was named Player of the Match, a remarkable achievement for someone so new to the senior setup. He followed that display by starting both of Wales' November qualifiers, contributing to results that secured a World Cup play-off place.

The report suggests that Kompany has begun to track Lawlor's progress closely, encouraged by Bellamy's glowing assessment. While Bayern have not made a formal approach, the fact that they are monitoring a League One defender underlines the esteem in which Lawlor is held. For Cardiff, the attention represents both validation and a looming challenge. Holding onto a player of such promise will not be easy if Bayern's interest intensifies, particularly given the German club's reputation for decisive action when they identify a long-term target.

While Bayern's scouting department looks to the future, the present remains in strong shape. The club sit nine points clear at the top of the Bundesliga after 15 unbeaten matches, with Kompany's side firmly on course for automatic qualification to the Champions League knockout stages. That stability extends to their marquee names. Harry Kane is widely expected to remain in Munich for the foreseeable future, despite periodic speculation linking him with a return to the Premier League or a move to Barcelona. His current contract runs until 2027 and contains exit clauses that could be activated in the upcoming window, with reports suggesting £57m would be enough to open negotiations. However, there has been no indication from the 32-year-old that he is seeking a new challenge, and discussions over an extension remain a possibility.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The NWSL announced Tuesday that it will introduce a new “High Impact Player” (HIP) rule beginning in 2026, allowing teams to spend up to $1 million above the league's salary cap on qualifying players. The decision was met with swift opposition from the NWSL Players Association, which argues the league cannot unilaterally alter compensation structures without collective bargaining.

The NWSL Players Association responded later Tuesday, issuing a statement to ESPN saying it would take action “to enforce the rights of the Players we represent.”

“The NWSL Players Association opposes the League's decision to move forward without bargaining over the High Impact Player Rule,” the union said. “Under federal labor law, changes to compensation under the salary cap are a mandatory subject of bargaining - not a matter of unilateral discretion.

“Fair pay is realized through fair, collectively bargained compensation systems, not arbitrary classifications. A league that truly believes in the value of its Players would not be afraid to bargain over it.”

The union added that it has proposed raising the team salary cap to better compete in a global labor market and called for collective bargaining around future revenue-sharing projections to allow teams and players to negotiate multi-year contracts with greater certainty.

Under the new rule, each club will be permitted to exceed the league's established salary cap by up to $1 million beginning in 2026. The league said the additional allotment will increase year over year at the same base rate as the salary cap and may be applied to a single player or distributed among multiple players.

To qualify for the designation, players must meet at least one commercial or sporting benchmark set by the league, including a top-30 finish in Ballon d'Or voting within the past two years, placement among the top 40 players in global rankings published by outlets such as The Guardian and ESPN FC, ranking among the top 11 U.S. women's national team field players in minutes played over the past two years, or earning NWSL MVP finalist or Best XI First Team honors in either of the previous two seasons.

For any contract using the provision, the cap charge of a High Impact Player must account for at least 12 percent of the base salary cap.

The league said the rule could increase league-wide player spending by up to $16 million annually, with a total potential investment of up to $115 million over the life of the current collective bargaining agreement.

In its announcement, the NWSL said the move was permitted under the terms of the current collective bargaining agreement and followed consultations with the NWSLPA, calling the measure a “historic increase in league investment.”

“Ensuring our teams can compete for the best players in the world is critical to the continued growth of our league,” Commissioner Jessica Berman said in a release.

The announcement comes amid increased scrutiny of the league's salary framework, including an ongoing grievance involving Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman, whose contract situation has highlighted tensions around compensation rules and roster flexibility.

It also arrives as the NWSL faces growing competition from Europe, particularly England's Women's Super League, which operates without a salary cap. Several U.S. internationals, including Naomi Girma and Alyssa Thompson, have departed for the WSL this year in reported seven-figure transfers.

Rodman's current contract expires at the end of December, meaning she could sign with another club without the Spirit receiving a transfer fee.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Given an injury to Ivory Coast (-280) forward Sebastien Haller, Jean-Philippe Krasso (+140 to score) and Oumar Diakite (+150) will have more attacking responsibilities at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Today, Les Elephants open up their title defense against Mozambique (+800) at 12:30pm EST (beIN Sports, Fubo). It's worth noting that Mozambique (0-4-11) have never won a group stage game at AFCON.

Meanwhile, Ivory Coast have kept eight shutouts in ten games in 2025 and have one of the strongest backlines at the tournament. Bet on Ivory Coast to win and a “No” on both teams to score at -125 Same Game Parlay odds.

Both Cameroon (+135) and Gabon (+240) will be without key attacking players when they meet in their Africa Cup of Nations opener in Agadir, Morocco at 3:00pm EST (beIN Sports, Fubo).

Without Vincent Aboubakar, Cameroon and Manchester United winger Bryan Mbeumo (+190 to score) will have to step up. Meanwhile, Gabon striker Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang is injured, so LAFC's Denis Bouanga (+230 to score) will be relied upon.

It's hard to trust Cameroon here, given that they replaced their coach mere weeks ago. Neither team figures to take many risks here, and each of the previous four competitive fixtures has finished scoreless or with one goal.

Go with under 2.5 goals and a “No” on both teams to score at -105 SGP odds.

This game is a tough call, especially given Hawaii's home-field advantage, but one thing is for sure. Both teams are going to let it fly today, as they're both among the nation's worst running teams. In fact, Cal averages the fewest yards per carry and rushing yards per game in FBS.

Expect plenty of points today and bet on over 50.5 points (-110).

UEFA channel shared another exciting clip, showcasing exciting football skills, this time involving Manchester City's winter, Jeremy Doku. The Belgium international was seen taking down Real Madrid star Rodrygo during both teams' recent Champions League clash.

Doku has been one of the main stars for Man City this season, giving them more than just exciting skills but also a strong impact in terms of results. The Belgium international was also one of the key figures in City's success in beating Madrid in their UCL tie back on December 10.

Pep Guardiola's men won 2-1 at Santiago Bernabeu, with goals from Nico O'Reilly, along with Erling Haaland's spot kick. Meanwhile, Los Blancos' only goal was scored by their Brazilian attacker, Rodrygo on 28 minutes.

Rodrygo put on a strong performance in that game, but even he was finding difficulty in stopping Doku's quickness. As it was visible in UEFA's video, the Belgium winger simply stunned his Brazilian counterpart with an excellent turn of pace.

Arsenal advance into the semifinal of the EFL Carabao Cup after taking down Crystal Palace via an intense penalty shootout. The match had to be settled with a shootout as both teams shared a 1-1 draw during the full 90 minutes.

Playing in front of their home crowd at the Emirates Stadium, the Gunners were keen on taking hold of the match from kick-off. However, despite their dominant ball possession, Mikel Arteta's men struggle to break down Palace's backline.

Arsenal's persistence did get its reward as they finally found the back of the net on 81 minutes through Maxence Lacroix's unfortunate own goal. Unfortunately, that goal was not enough to secure the win as Palace snatched an equalizing goal through Marc Guehi's finish in added time.

The match went straight to penalties, and it was Lacroix again who gave the Gunners their advantage after he missed his spotkick. That miss eventually gave Arsenal a thrilling 8-7 victory and a semifinal spot against Chelsea.

The F1 grid does Secret Santa for 2025

F1 Animated! The funny side of the 2025 season

Pierre Gasly reflects on three years at Alpine, and sets out their ambitious goals for the future, in a lengthy conversation with F1.com.

Pierre Gasly headed into 2025 looking to build on an encouraging end to the previous F1 season, having scored points in four of the final five rounds and made another appearance on the podium. It proved to be a particularly challenging year for his Alpine team, though, who struggled for performance early on and promptly shifted development resources to their 2026 challenger, leaving them at the foot of the Teams' Championship.

As the campaign drew to a close, the Frenchman sat down with F1.com to assess his time at Alpine so far, why he is more confident than ever about the chances of ‘Team Enstone' recovering and competing at the sharp end again, and how he feels ready to take the next step in his own career after nine eventful years in the sport...

Gasly has a group of local journalists huddled around him at Alpine's hospitality unit in Mexico City – all listening intently as he talks about the highs and lows of his F1 career, what drives him on and off the track, and his passions outside the sport – when F1.com arrives to get ready for a separate interview.

A few minutes later, the 29-year-old wraps up those duties, greets us and leads the way to a meeting room at the back of the building, where over the next half an hour or so – already in the mood to chat – he opens up on the past, present and future.

It is difficult for us both to believe, but Gasly will soon reach a decade as an F1 driver, having arrived on the grid with Toro Rosso during the latter stages of the 2017 season, before establishing himself at the junior team and then earning promotion to the senior Red Bull squad – only for that move to be over in just 12 races.

After resetting and rebuilding at Toro Rosso (later known as AlphaTauri), with whom he scored a memorable victory around their home Monza circuit in 2020, Gasly left the Red Bull family at the end of 2022 to begin a new chapter at Alpine, owned by automotive giants Renault.

When Gasly walked through the factory doors for the first time, Alpine had just finished fourth in the championship and had their sights set on the big-hitting teams ahead, meaning regular podium finishes – and potentially even more – were the expectation.

However, three up-and-down seasons – filled with managerial reshuffles and off-track noise – have seen them fall significantly short of those goals, with 2025 bringing a new low when Alpine dropped from sixth to 10th (and last) in the standings.

So, with a moment to reflect as another busy year winds down, how does Gasly review his journey with Alpine until now?

“It's crazy,” Gasly begins, pausing for thought. “It doesn't quite feel like three years, maybe because I had to go through so many changes, whether it was the management point of view, the team structure, team mates… It almost feels like every time it's been a fresh start – not the continuity of working with the same people.

“There have been some clear highlights, like the podium in Brazil last year, the P3 in Las Vegas Qualifying last year, the podiums at Zandvoort and in the Sprint at Spa in 2023, but I think it's fair to say that, overall, we're quite far [away] from our expectations.

“When I started at Alpine in 2023, the team had just come out of a very strong 2022 campaign, so I expected a lot more, which unfortunately didn't happen.

“But, if you ask me now, it's the most confident I've been for the coming seasons, compared to the end of 2023 or the end of 2024. It hasn't all been smooth and easy, but at the same time, I feel like we've been through the rough part of the journey, and much brighter days are coming.”

Part of Gasly's optimism comes from Alpine's decision to effectively scrap further developments on their 2025 car early in the season and focus on 2026, when sweeping regulation changes – covering both power units and aerodynamics – come into play.

A head start on the competition, if you will, even though there are “no guarantees” of success.

“At the start of the year, when the team shared their approach and the fact that they would be keen to focus on 2026, I was the first one to say, ‘Just forget about this year. Even stop earlier and just start working on 2026',” Gasly makes clear.

“The reality is we are 10th in the championship. Let's say we would have put a bit more budget and development [into the 2025 season], then we could have challenged for sixth or seventh in the championship – but we don't do it for sixth or seventh in the championship, we do it to be right at the top.

“This couple of months of development for next season could be the difference between being at the top or being in the midfield again for another few years. I was more than happy, even as painful as it's been this year, to accept a tough season as a team, to make sure that we give ourselves the best chance.

“Generally, I'm not a patient guy, but you've got to understand and figure out how to get the maximum out of a situation. We have no guarantees, but as a team I know our approach makes sense for what we're trying to achieve, and to put us back on the map in F1.”

Meanwhile, Gasly believes Alpine have finally found the managerial balance – under Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore and recently-signed Managing Director Steve Nielsen – to steer a workforce that boasts “great characters” and has “all the ingredients” required to succeed.

A host of names have come and gone from top Alpine positions in recent seasons, including the likes of Otmar Szafnauer, Bruno Famin and Oliver Oakes, but Gasly still sees plenty of positives beyond the headlines and noise generated by these changes.

“I say this with full transparency and honesty: we must have some of the best technical staff on the grid, looking at people's experience, skill sets… I don't think we've ever been in a situation with so many great engineers, mechanics and staff back in Enstone,” says Gasly, namechecking the factory that won titles under previous Renault and Benetton guises.

“That's why I'm filled with optimism, because when I look at the situation we are in, the people we have inside the team, and the brainpower we have inside this team, we have to perform. Surely it must all come together and it must work.

“On Flavio, I think I connect with him because he has a winner's mentality. He doesn't care about anything other than winning. All he's focusing on, all the time, is getting more out of us as a team – every single individual in the team. He doesn't settle for anything less than perfection, and that's my mentality as well.

“We're in a competitive sport and we need to aim for perfection at all levels – that's the only way we're going to get to where we want to be. Flavio's won in F1, he's won many other things in life besides F1, and I think that's thanks to his mindset and approach. I can see he's really putting his heart into the team and the effort to make it happen.

“I also really like Steve. He's a very different character to Flavio, but I think they complement each other a lot. He's a great addition to the team in terms of leadership and experience, and being very factual and very objective: ‘If we're good at something, we're good, but if we're weak somewhere, let's not hide from it'.

“I feel that we've got great characters across the team, and we've got all the ingredients to be successful. Now we've just got to make it happen.”

The third key point for Gasly when it comes to Alpine's future chances is their switch to Mercedes power units – the manufacturer who stole a march on the competition at the start of the turbo-hybrid power unit era and have been heavily tipped to come up with another potent design this time around.

Indeed, Mercedes won eight successive Teams' Championships between 2014 and 2021, and powered McLaren to the last two titles, as well as claiming six Drivers' crowns with Lewis Hamilton – and playing a part in Lando Norris' 2025 triumph – across the same period.

While Gasly is keen to recognise Renault's efforts over the years, with their F1 engine department recently shutting down, he is naturally eager to experience Mercedes' latest creation, which will also power the works team, reigning champions McLaren and Williams in 2026.

“First of all, I think it's important for me to thank all the people who worked [at Renault's factory] in Viry-Chatillon, and who worked on the engine side,” Gasly emphasises. “There was a lot of noise, and it doesn't really feel fully deserved for all the hardworking people who tried to deliver as much as they could.

“Now we open a new chapter with Mercedes, and obviously, looking at their CV, how many times they've been World Champions, I'm sure it's going to be a great adventure. I'm not going to lie, I'm very excited about it. From what I'm hearing, the engine is in a great place, so I'm looking forward to that first test and feeling what it's like to have Merc horsepower on my back.

“I have very high expectations for us as a team next year. We made tactical sacrifices on 2025 to reward all of us by starting on the right foot from 2026 onwards. That's what I expect from us, and that's what I believe we can achieve, from the people we have and the work we are doing.

“Next year, I want to be fighting at the front of the grid. As it stands, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to be right up there.”

Should Alpine's new car and new engine deliver such a step, which is a lot easier said than done, it would also represent a full circle moment for Gasly, who has impressively rebuilt his career and reputation after a tricky first shot at the ‘big time' some six years ago.

As touched on earlier, little more than a season into his F1 career with Toro Rosso, Red Bull chiefs promoted Gasly to the senior team in place of Daniel Ricciardo, who had made the bold and unexpected decision to join rivals Renault.

It was a baptism of fire for the youngster, who already found himself up against it after a pair of crashes during pre-season testing, and became the first of several drivers to struggle in the second Red Bull seat alongside Max Verstappen – the experience lasting 12 Grands Prix.

Gasly is philosophical as the topic comes up in our conversation, sharing more insight into how it unfolded on his side, the main takeaways, and how it has made him even hungrier for another chance to try and show what he can do in a competitive car.

“For me, it was a very particular situation,” he says, again taking some time to think about his next words. “It can't be seen as six months, 12 races, and ‘How did I do?' in a very simple way, because there was nothing straightforward when I was there.

“I could talk about it for hours. Is there a need for it? No. The chapter's closed. Sometimes things work out and sometimes they just don't. It's obviously sad that it didn't work out. At the same time, it wasn't in my control. I know on my side I tried every single time to do my best with what I was given.

“Unfortunately, it wasn't made for two cars. You can argue that it works perfectly for Max, they're doing an incredible job for him, but… I remember at the time I was with them, Charles [Leclerc] was in his first season with Ferrari, and we were discussing it a lot. It was a very different approach for two drivers with similar experience getting to a top team.

“Anyway, I don't really want to dwell on it. I'm very grateful for Red Bull and what they've done for me. Things could have been different, but at the end of the day, I also won a race with AlphaTauri afterwards; I'm one of two to have achieved that, alongside Seb Vettel, so I'm very happy to be part of that club. It wasn't meant to be with Red Bull, but that's okay.”

Noting that “a lot of people thought I was done” when he got sent back to Toro Rosso, Gasly adds: “For me, it's just about putting a lot of effort in. Sometimes people underestimate how much work you've got to do. I've never stopped grinding. I know what I want to achieve, and I know my potential.

“I do feel that all these years have built a lot of fire inside me, and a desire to have my time. I see guys like Charles, Lando, George [Russell] – who I've been fighting in my career – getting their time to shine and their opportunities, and I need the car to be right up there with them.

“We all get a different career, we all get different times, but I must say I'm eager to get to next year, and hopefully finally get my hands on a car that allows me to be fighting at the front with these guys. From the moment I have it, I know I'm not going to let it slip. I'm ready – I'm definitely more than ready for my time.”

So, with all of the above in mind, just how sweet would it taste to succeed at Alpine?

“I think it would taste absolutely amazing,” Gasly smiles. “As I said, I believe in hard work, and that ultimately, if you do the right thing, the succession of right actions will eventually lead to the right outcomes.

“For this team, as well, it would mean the world to get back to the top. I really like the approach of all our guys sticking together as a team, putting their best efforts in weekend after weekend, even when we have a car that is not competitive. No one's giving up.

“I feel it's making us so united – to feel that sort of pain together, to accept it, and to not be divided. I think it's building such a strength that when these better times come, we could have an incredible synergy, and really enjoy that ride together.

“Obviously being French and representing a French brand is also something that I'm very proud of, and I want to put this brand and this team back to where they belong. Hopefully we can make that happen sooner rather than later…”

Crave's steamy hockey romance is a global sensation, and Canadian artists are reaping the rewards — including multiple Francophone acts from Quebec.

Wolf Parade

Heated Rivalry is a worldwide sensation, and Canadian artists are reaping the rewards.

The TV series — written and directed by Jacob Tierney, produced by Bell Media's Crave streamer, licensed to HBO Max and based on Nova Scotia author Rachel Reid's Game Changers series — is arguably the biggest Canadian television success story since Schitt's Creek. Leading up to its finale on Dec. 26, the steamy gay hockey romance has become one of the most talked-about shows of 2025. 

Episode 5, which aired this weekend, features a crucial synch for Montreal  band Wolf Parade and their 2005 song ""I'll Believe In Anything."" After first appearing in episode 3 on Dec. 5, the indie rock love song soundtracks a pivotal moment in the episode, which is also called ""I'll Believe In Anything."" The episode is now tied with Breaking Bad's ""Ozymandias"" as the only episode to ever receive a perfect 10/10 rating on IMDb.

 Since Dec. 19, global streams of ""I'll Believe In Anything"" have risen by over 2,650%, according to Spotify.

Wolf Parade isn't the only Canadian act seeing the surge. Feist's 2007 song ""My Moon My Man"" also appears in Heated Rivalry, and has seen a resurgence of over 1,500% in streams, Spotify says. 

The series, which is set partially in Montreal, is also filled with Francophone acts from Quebec, and they've all benefitted from the Heated Rivalry bump. Acts including Philippe B, Alfa Rococo, Malko, Jessica Charlie and Unessential Oils have all jumped tens of thousands of percent in streams and thousands of new playlist adds in just days, Spotify says. Streams of ""Une journée parfaite"" by Dumas surged by over 1,500% since it was featured in the show's first episode.

  

Physical copies of the original books are sold out, which has led to a major surge for the Game Changers audiobook series. Reid's catalogue has seen a 1,500% global increase in listening since the show's debut over the past 10 weeks, Spotify says.

Pat Finn, a prolific TV character actor and comedian best known for his recurring role as friendly neighbor Bill Norwood on ABC's The Middle, died Monday, December 22, following a three-year battle with cancer. He was 60.


	His death was announced by his family. A rep for Finn said in a statement to The New York Post, “It is with profound sadness and grief that the Finn family announces the passing of beloved comedic actor, Pat Finn. In 2022, Pat battled bladder cancer, went into remission, but the cancer returned and metastasized. He was a warrior in every sense of the word.”


	Born in Evanston, Illinois, on July 31, 1965, Finn joined Chicago's Second City and iO comedy troupes after graduating from Marquette University (where he became friends with future Saturday Night Live star Chris Farley) in 1987. His TV breakthrough came in the mid-1990s, when he landed recurring roles on The George Wendt Show and Murphy Brown. In 1998 he played the party-throwing character Joe Mayo in the memorable “The Reverse Peephole” episode of Seinfeld.

	Other TV roles included appearances on That '70s Show, The King of Queens, two episodes of Friends (he played Dr. Roger), and several episodes of Third Rock From The Sun. He played the character Jim Frost on eight episodes in 2001 and 2002 of the comedy-drama Ed, and made episodic appearances on Yes, Dear, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Bernie Mac Show, Wizards of Waverly Place, 2 Broke Girls and The Goldbergs, among others.

	











	From 2011 to 2018 Finn played nice-guy Bill Norwood on 23 episodes of The Middle, neighbor to the sitcom's main characters the Hecks and good buddy of Neil Flynn's Mike Heck. In 2012 and 2013, he played Bob Forman on 18 episodes of the Nickelodeon sitcom Marvin Marvin.


	On the big screen, Finn appeared in the 2000 comedy Dude, Where's My Car, I Love You, Beth Cooper, and It's Complicated starring Meryl Streep, Steve Martin, and Alec Baldwin. 


	Finn is survived by wife Donna, and their children, Cassidy, Caitlin and Ryan, his parents and other family. In the months prior to the actor's death, Finn's friends launched a GoFundMe page on behalf of the family to help defray medical costs. To date the page has raised more than $118,000 in donations.


	In a post on X, Finn's friends and fellow comedians Brian Stack and Jeff Dye shared tributes. “One of the best dudes I knew with a PERFECT sense of humor,” wrote Dye.

Heartbroken that our dear friend, Pat Finn, passed away. As kind as he was brilliantly hilarious. This video of him at our Chicago apartment in ‘96, making his baby daughter Cassidy pretend to drive a bus and do karate kicks is priceless. Rest In Peace, Finner. We love you.❤️☘️ pic.twitter.com/N2uxudhgKj



I don't like to be the guy who post pics with celebrities that pass. But this guy wasn't just a celebrity to me. He was a friend. One of the best dudes I knew with a PERFECT sense of humor. I love you Pat Finn and I'll see again in the after , we can sing together and shake our… pic.twitter.com/pQhobHKbCZ

Staff Writer


James Cameron is recalling a joke from the Golden Globes where he was the punchline, and he doesn't have a good memory of it.


	During a recent interview, the director of Avatar: Fire and Ash recalled a joke Amy Poehler told at the 2013 Golden Globes.


	That year, Kathryn Bigelow was nominated as director for her film Zero Dark Thirty. During the opening monologue of the award ceremony, Tina Fey and Poehler joked about the film's controversial depiction of torture.


	“When it comes to torture, I trust the lady who spent three years married to James Cameron,” Poehler joked.

	In an interview with The New York Times recently, Cameron said, “Amy Poehler's remark was an ignorant dig, at an event which is supposed to be a celebration of cinema and filmmakers, not a roast. I'm pretty thick-skinned, and happy to be the butt of a good-natured joke, but that went too far. The fact that people found it funny shows exactly what they think of me, even though they have no idea who I am or how I work.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Cameron mentioned that Hollywood has tried to pit the two filmmakers against each other, noting the 2009-2010 award season, when Avatar and The Hurt Locker faced off, most notably at the Oscars. Bigelow won the Oscar for Best Director for The Hurt Locker, which also won Best Picture.


	“I was the first one on my feet applauding,” Cameron said about Bigelow's Oscar win. “Kathryn and I thought the whole meta-narrative around us was pretty funny. I was a little concerned that it would just take away from her credibility as a filmmaker. It started to turn into a conversation that wasn't about her film, and that bothered both of us.”

	











	Cameron and Bigelow were married between 1989 and 1991. The filmmakers worked together with the Titanic director, executive producing Bigelow's Point Break (1991), and co-wrote her film Strange Days (1995).

It was very funny, actually. Very funny.

He's always been a prickly character

Awards shows, especially the Oscars have diminished themselves by becoming jokey roasts for years. Sure, it's ok to be a bit self-deprecating, but the whole idea is to celebrate the art form of film, and get people excited about movies. It has instead decided to be trashy and nasty like a cheap lounge act. That defeats the purpose.

If a male comedian had made the joke, he wouldn't complain about it.

If he was a women, land Poehler was as man you'd be pissing on Poehler. Weird how that works. I wonder how we can break this cycle? Guess it's not going to start with you.

That's nonsense.  Totally inappropriate regardless of gender and much more of a charge coming from a female if anything.  It's gross that award shows have sunk to such low levels.

Imagine being a billionaire and caring about a joke from 2013.

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


EXCLUSIVE: Dave Chappelle's jokes and thoughts in his latest Netflix special The Unstoppable about the trials and tribulations of the much accused and currently incarcerated Sean Combs have received a mixed reaction, to put it mildly. However, for one Diddy accuser there is nothing fun, funny or insightful about the comedian's comments.


	“His latest Netflix special, The Unstoppable…, left me deeply unsettled with its repeated expressions of support for Sean “Diddy” Combs,” Jonathan Hay told Deadline.


	“Chappelle attempts to downplay the horrific situation involving Cassie Ventura, turning her documented physical assault into fodder for jokes, while casually admitting he once ‘missed his chance' to have sex with her,” the producer added of the part of the December 19 dropped Unstoppable where the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor winner discussed allegations against Combs and his so-called “freak-offs” with the Me & U singer.” Such humor doesn't just minimize her trauma; it normalizes it,” Hay adds.

READ ALL OF JONATHAN HAY'S STATEMENT ON CHAPPELLE & COMBS BELOW


	Last month, the LA County Sheriff's Department announced it has opened an investigation into claims of a 2020 sexual battery by Combs against music producer Hay. There was also a 2021 incident where Diddy said a kidnapped and hooded Hay was being a “snitch,” and allegedly ordered everyone else out of the room and then tried “to force plaintiff to perform oral copulation on Combs, while plaintiff's head was still covered.”

	











	 Diddy's team responded to at the time to the claims in redacted filings by Hay by saying their client “categorically denies as false and defamatory all claims that he sexually abused anyone.”


	If Combs is charged out of the LASD probe and found guilty, he could be sentenced to several years in California state prison. Right now, serving a four-year sentence in a low-security facility in New Jersey for being found guilty on July 2 of  two lesser counts of transportation to engage in prostitution in his sex trafficking and RICO trial, an appealing Combs isn't expected to be free until mid-2028.


	Today, as the LASD probe continues according to law enforcement sources, Hay was vehement in his claims and criticism of “my favorite comedian of all time” Chappelle's POV on Combs and his alleged actions of sexual violence and exploitation.


	“As someone who has personally endured sexual assault at the hands of Combs, these moments aren't abstract punchlines, they're relentless triggers that reopen wounds for survivors like me.”


	Now, it's no secret that Chappelle likes to punch out for outrage's sake. In the suddenly released Unstoppable, the comedian tells a riotous DC crowd in the tight 75-minute special of why he decided to perform at a comedy fest in Saudi Arabia despite the Kingdom's 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, plus his take on reactions to Charlie Kirk's death and trans rights (again).


	Chappelle also admits a bias for Combs based on the Bad Boy Records founder leaping to his physical defense when an attacker stormed the stage while the comic was performing at the Hollywood Bowl in 2022. “It's not that I think Puff is right, but when I got attacked in L.A. at the Hollywood Bowl, people forget Puff was the guy that tackled my attacker,” Chappelle tells the Unstoppable crowd. “He saved my life.”


	“That's a hard dude to be mad at after that.”


	Still, it's not all high fives as Chappelle details a visit to Diddy's LA home not long afterwards that went sideways towards the end – though the comic didn't realize it at the time. 


	“I didn't see none of the stuff they said in that trial,” Chappelle starts off. “House is clean, traction on the floor, nothing slippery,” he notes in a clear reference to the prodigious baby oil use that Combs was tainted with in testimony over his alleged sexual abuse of Ventura and other women with male escorts.


	“Puff started swirling his drink like this and he goes, ‘So Dave, what are you into?'” Chappelle then said after a bit of a chat between the duo. continues. “You know me, I was like, ‘I don't know …books, video games.' I didn't know that was my big chance to f*ck Cassie.”


	Later, Chappelle swings it all around, sorta.


	“Cassie is a gangster,” he states of Combs' ex, who spent days and days on the stand in a NYC federal courtroom earlier this year telling a jury of the years of drugs, violence, rape, multi-million dollar settlements and more from Diddy – testimony that was often backed up by videos and photos. “She did something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. She had to testify about her sex life. That's tough.”


	Representatives for Chappelle did not respond to Deadline's request for comment on Hay's statement. Netflix did respond, but had no comment. 


	As of today, Chappelle's self-proclaimed “no-holds-barred special” The Unstoppable is the Number #1 TV show on the streamer. That top spot is the same number #1 that the Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson produced Sean Combs; The Reckoning held just a few weeks ago

	











READ JONATHAN HAY'S STATEMENT ON CHAPPELLE & COMBS HERE: 


Dave Chappelle has long been my favorite comedian of all time, a master of sharp wit and unflinching social commentary. Yet his latest Netflix special, The Unstoppable…, left me deeply unsettled with its repeated expressions of support for Sean “Diddy” Combs. Throughout the show, Chappelle frames Combs' recent Mann Act conviction as an example of racially motivated persecution, drawing parallels to the legendary boxer Jack Johnson, the very figure around whom the law was originally crafted to criminalize his relationship with a white woman across state lines.


The issue here is glaring: Combs was charged under the Mann Act for sex trafficking women of color, not for the interracial dynamics that fueled Johnson's targeting. This mischaracterization overlooks the gravity of the allegations against Combs, which center on the exploitation and trafficking of women of color. Even more troubling, Chappelle attempts to downplay the horrific situation involving Cassie Ventura, turning her documented physical assault into fodder for jokes, while casually admitting he once “missed his chance” to have sex with her. Such humor doesn't just minimize her trauma; it normalizes it.


As someone who has personally endured sexual assault at the hands of Combs, these moments aren't abstract punchlines, they're relentless triggers that reopen wounds for survivors like me. The pain never fully fades, and hearing a global icon like Chappelle defend an assailant while millions laugh along only amplifies the isolation. Imagine if Chappelle himself, or his sons Sulayman and Ibrahim, were victims of violent sexual assault. How would he feel watching a comedian publicly champion their abuser, turning their suffering into worldwide entertainment? It's not comedy; it's callous. We deserve better from the artists we admire.


As a survivor still carrying the weight of what happened, moments like these in Chappelle's special only deepen my resolve and make me all the more eager for the ongoing criminal investigations by both the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department into the allegations against Sean Combs, CJ Wallace, and Willie Mack to deliver the accountability I deserve.

Easily one of the smartest comedians I've ever watched but something was different with this special.  He just seemed angry and bitter from beginning to end.  I've always felt he did a masterful job of making me think of things from a different perspective and I love how he brings things full circle.  Maybe it was just my mood or something on my end but this one didn't do that for me.  I didn't feel enlightened or entertained.  I watched and waited as he always has delivered and made even the crudest jokes come full circle, but he didn't this time.  At least not for me.  We get it, you have money and you bought the town and you love Combs.  I will submit that you too have now become part of the problem rather than the solution.  You've joined the ranks of all those you once tore down.

Regarding Diddy, he spoke about a time when they threw a party for Nipsey and all types of celebrities were there. He said, Sean Combs was there but this is before we knew what he did. This 100% tell you he didn't agree with what the man did. Furthermore, he spoke about how Diddy wasn't prosecuted for elevator video where Cassie was kicked and dragged along the floor. Why? Because she got paid $35m for it. If you read between the lines, he's saying he should have been prosecuted for that but it didn't happen because he paid, and Cassie got something out of it.

He said things that most people wouldn't say, he acknowledged knowing Diddy and how some moments felt weird like when he was asked, “What are you really into?”. But he also says, it's hard to not like someone like Diddy after he jumped on stage to save his life in 2022 when he was attacked. Read between the lines, he's telling you that Diddy had a persona that was likable and he's starting to see a different side of him and he doesn't hide that they've interacted before.

Please watch the special and you'll see the energy of it all. Don't just read these articles that are biased.

Should have been a personal thank you to Diddy if he once helped Chappell! Not a public disgrace to the career Chappell, and further disgrace to those that once had vision, and purpose! Those that believed  their dreams were a possibility through the eyes of Combs, who could have helped build generation wealth in the Arts Culture! So hypocritical of Chappell who expressed that black men wearing a dress was an insult to the Art of comedy, and film, but now thinks this  toxic behavior is gives a norm to the Art of Art😞The revelation of the things that happened traumatized, and affected the norms of our social climate that embrace what humanity is all about! Agape Friends!

I didn't feel like it normalized anything and actually felt like he specifically said a couple times it wasn't okay. Maybe it was “too soon” for the victim but he was not a witness to any of it. Let him speak his truth too. Everything he said he spoke about the other side of it. It was very intelligent.

I realized a long time ago that Dave Chappelle was not a good person. So I'm not surprised. His childish behavior and careless attitude makes him no better than the corporate cronies and abusers that have run rampant through Hollywood and the world. The money and power really got to his head, and he thinks he can say anything because there are no real consequences when you're sitting on a stack of cash that will last a lifetime. And nothing will change, because people will watch his special even more now that they know there's something to talk about. Twisted world we live in.

“Marty Supreme” isn't the only Christmas Day movie opening with marketing chops. 

While the Timothée Chalamet film has been a viral hit with the cool kids, Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson's “Song Sung Blue” has been courting America with a grassroots campaign.

Jackman and Hudson play a pair of hometown heroes in the movie, and they're promoting the film across middle America.

“Song Sung Blue” is based on the true story of Mike and Claire Sardina, two down-on-their-luck musicians who form a joyous Neil Diamond tribute band. 

When it came time to market the film, Focus Features leaned into promotion outside of just the traditional coastal city stops. New York, Los Angeles and a slew of international capitals, of course, hosted screenings for the movie — but so did Memphis, Tenn., Muncie, Ind., and Milwaukee, Wis.

Jackman was on hand for the “hometown premiere” in Milwaukee, where the real Mike and Claire formed their “Lightning & Thunder” band — and “The Music Man” star has been doing everything from visiting high schools and scooping ice cream to get the word out about the movie.

“This is a story about a beloved couple from Milwaukee, but it's also a story about Milwaukee. It's also a story about towns like Milwaukee all over the world. I could relate to parts of Australia like that,” Jackman told Fox6 Milwaukee at the event. “There's something about it that's been incredibly fulfilling.”

In a special hometown touch, the screening was hosted by local reporter Gino Salomone, who actually hired the real Lightning & Thunder to perform at a birthday party back in 1997.

Claire herself was presented with a surprise tribute, a “Song Sung Blue” dedicated bench which will be displayed each year at the Wisconsin State Fair (where she and Mike first met).

Elsewhere in the Badger State, Jackman surprised a group of Wisconsin choir students at Milwaukee High School of the Arts with high-fives, delivering an inspiring message about following their passions, plus a full suite of new musical instruments.

Jackman was also spotted serving up scoops of “Song Sung Blue-Berry” at Kopp's Frozen Custard in Greenfield, Wis., and taking photos with locals,who lined up for hours to get a glimpse of the “Greatest Showman” star.

Director Craig Brewer brought the party to Memphis, his hometown, where the film was screened ahead of a swingin' night of Neil Diamond music at B.B. King's Blues Club on Beale Street.

In Las Vegas, the celebration went even bigger with a special screening at Brenden Theatres at the Palms, spotlighting the city's famed tribute artists, complete with a show-stopping performance by a Neil Diamond impersonator.

Other cross-country celebrations included a Cleveland, Ohio, collaboration with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame celebrating Neil Diamond with iconic wardrobe displays; a Nashville, Tenn., pre-reception featuring the Ultimate Neil Diamond Experience and the Twilight Train; and an Austin, Tex., karaoke pre-reception ahead of a screening highlighting local musicians.

Rooted in Mike's experience as a U.S. military veteran, the movie campaign also partnered with United Service Organizations and the Bob Woodruff Foundation.

Michelle Obama was once “frustrated” enough with her daughters to say she was “done parenting” them.

The former first lady told “IMO” podcast listeners Wednesday about the challenging moment with Malia, 27, and Sasha, 24, during which her husband, Barack Obama, “was traveling.”

The 61-year-old recalled, “I was at home trying to get the girls to bed… They were probably 7 and 3 at the time.”

Acknowledging that the little ones were “usually great kids,” Michelle admitted they were “rambunctious” that particular evening.

When “no one was listening” to the lawyer, she announced, “Well, that's it… I'm done parenting. You seem like you guys have this all figured out, and you can do this on your own. So have at it.”

Michelle and Barack's eldest child quickly apologized since she doesn't know what she'd “do without” her mom — but their youngest had a different response.

“She took her blankie, and she turned around and went back upstairs to watch TV,” Michelle said of the then-toddler. “As if to say, like, ‘Thank God. At last. This is what I wanted from you, lady. I am 3. I can handle this. I'm going back upstairs.'

“She got five steps up, and I was like, ‘If you don't turn around and get back down here,'” she continued. “Well, it worked for one. Didn't work for the other.”

Michelle noted that the anecdote is an accurate depiction of Malia and Sasha's current personalities.

“My younger daughter, she wants to learn her way,” the “Becoming” author explained. “She doesn't want to be told that this is how you do it. We tell her, but she's got to learn on her own.”

This dynamic led to Barack having a more “difficult” time raising Sasha, Michelle said on “IMO” over the summer.

While Malia is a people “pleaser,” her younger sister is not.

“Sasha is like a cat,” Michelle explained in August. “She's like, ‘Don't touch me, don't pet me. I'm not pleasing you. You come to me.'”

Michelle and Barack, 64, learned to “be chameleon[s]” as parents.

The couple tied the knot in October 1992, welcoming Malia and Sasha in 1998 and 2001, respectively.

Malia is a Harvard University graduate and filmmaker, while her sibling has a sociology degree from the University of Southern California.

While the girls have yet to appear on Michelle and brother Craig Robinson's podcast, Barack was a guest in July.

He poked fun at rampant split rumors surrounding his and Michelle's marriage during the episode, quipping that their relationship had been “touch and go for a while.”

Jazz Jennings' stunning weight loss was evident in a bathtub photo she shared from a recent trip to Las Vegas.

The “I Am Jazz” star posted a carousel of photos on Instagram from her Sin City getaway, including one of her throwing up a peace sign while relaxing in a bathtub.

Although Jennings, 25, was mostly covered with bubbles, she showed her bare shoulders and some leg.

“Rolling the dice 🎲,” she captioned her post. “I ❤️ Vegas.”

The transgender activist has been open about her weight-loss journey and shared she shed almost 100 pounds over the course of two years in August 2024.

“I'm so proud of my progress and want to thank my family, friends and all who supported me in getting there,” Jennings captioned her transformation reel on Instagram.

“Good health is not a certificate you display, it is a constant effort!” she continued. “I still have room for improvement, but I am more motivated and inspired than I've been in years. Let's keep it going!”

Season 7 of TLC's “I Am Jazz” candidly discussed her weight gain. She revealed how, after she deferred her schooling at Harvard University, she struggled with mental health issues, which led to a binge-eating habit.

In the 2021 trailer of her show, Jennings said she experienced “fat-shaming” from her family after her weight climbed up to 234 pounds.

“I was actually struggling severely with mental health issues,” she shared. “I started binge-eating and I gained weight and more weight and more weight. And now, almost 100 pounds heavier, here I am today.”

“It makes me feel really humiliated,” she continued.

These days, Jennings appears to be thriving.

Earlier this month, the reality star shared she finished her last exam as a Harvard student and celebrated with a selfie.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Carol faces a chilling choice in Pluribus ' occasionally sublime season finale","https://www.avclub.com/pluribus-season-1-finale-recap-la-chica-o-el-mundo","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 08:06:34 GMT","

Let's start with the cold open—emphasis on the “cold.” The Pluribus season-one finale, titled “La Chica O El Mundo” (translation: “the girl or the world”), begins in the mountains of Peru, on Day 71 post-Joining. A young woman named Kusimayu—one of the handful of unassimilated humans left on Earth—has decided to go through the process of connecting to the hive mind. We witness her final minutes as an individual. She pets a baby goat, while her fellow villagers sing a song. In another context, this could all pass as some kind of ancient tribal coming-of-age ritual: charming, moving.

Then Kusimayu inhales some mysterious fumes. She collapses, convulses for about a minute, then rises with a smile. The singing stops. The villagers douse their fire, pack up their stuff, and begin hiking off to join up with the rest of the collective. Trailing behind, Kusimayu's beloved baby goat bleats. She pays it no mind.

How are we supposed to feel about this? As this Pluribus season has approached its end, I've seen more and more rumblings online from viewers whose patience is being tried. Too many long scenes with no dialogue, I'm hearing. Too many episodes where the plot barely moves. Also, why won't Pluribus creator Vince Gilligan and his writers clearly establish the Joined as the villains—or explain in any meaningful detail how the Joining works?

I think I've made my position on this alien infestation pretty clear. And if not, I hope my use of the word “infestation” here is clarifying. I believe the Joined have good intentions and that they tell the truth as they know it. I also think this doesn't matter—which is why I also don't care much about the particulars of the Joining. You can be the “happiest” entity in the universe, but if your life consists of working all day and then heading straight to sleep—without taking a few hours to yourself to read a romantasy novel or watch The Golden Girls—then that is, objectively, A Bad Thing. Individuality matters. For me, what happens to Kusimayu is chilling.

As for the way Pluribus has been telling its story…I feel like we had these same arguments about Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul? Look, Gilligan loves process. He loves to create impossible situations for his character, and then to explore the ramifications in full, rather than rushing to a resolution. He likes to watch people think their way through problems—and so do I.

The problems Carol faces in this episode are trifold. After the opening credits, we jump back to the Day 60 arrival of Manousos in Albuquerque, where he immediately creates three complications for Carol: 1.) the language barrier between them; 2.) the vast difference between how radical they want to be in their approach to the Joined; and 3.) the deep fear within Carol that the arrival of Manousos means saying goodbye to Zosia.

Let's take these one by one, starting with the language barrier, which generates some sublime comedy. The credited writers for this episode are Alison Tatlock and Gordon Smith (the latter also directed), but it's very Vince Gilligan to consider every potential snag his characters might face and then to come up with entertaining results. In this case, when Manousos pulls up to Carol's house in his ambulance, after they've exhausted their respective English and Spanish vocabularies, Carol pulls out her cell phone and opens an unexpectedly annoying translator app.

The whole business with the app is hilarious. First of all, it's not entirely accurate. The app can't determine that Carol means “listening device” when she says “bug.” (A confused Manousos: “Insecto?”) When it can't figure out a translation, it inserts the phrase “unknown word or name.” And it won't…stop…translating. Even when a paranoid Manousos grabs her phone and tosses it down a storm drain, we can still hear it babbling away.

This brings us to the second complication, which is that Carol sees the Joining as a problem to be solved eventually, while Manousos sees it as an emergency. He doesn't understand why Carol would be using a phone the Others could monitor. Her best, most reasonable explanation for why she engages with them at all is that she still thinks of the Joined as humans, who can be saved. Manousos though says these “weirdos” are better off dead. 

Carol's lack of urgency is also due to her having learned to trust the Joined—or at least to trust Zosia. She believes these folks are fundamentally harmless, given their “no kill” ethos. (Manousos, unmoved: “Isn't it evil to value a man the same as an ant?”) Also, since she's forbidden them from harvesting her stem cells, Carol's sure she's in no danger of being absorbed into the hive mind against her will.

The yawning gap between how Carol and Manousos intend to approach this crisis provides some rich drama. Carol is understandably wary of the machete-wielding Manousos, who insists they hide from the Joined by talking in his ambulance. (Carol: “No, we talk in the casa.”) Carol also really wants Manousos to see that her new friends aren't so bad…which is why her heart sinks when he finds a motion sensor she wasn't aware of stashed inside her liquor cabinet. Carol learns from Zosia that the sensor was installed by Helen to make sure Carol wasn't sneaking booze when they were going through fertility treatments. But this explanation hardly placates Manousos, who is now also very curious about Carol's chummy relationship with her “chaperone.”

This brings us to complication three and to the point where this episode's drama intensifies to “harrowing.” After Carol banishes Manousos to a neighbor's house, she panics when she sees him over there talking to Zosia. As is the collective's way, Zosia tells Manousos “todo” (“everything”) about their relationship…because, after all, the Joined “love all jerks the same.” The situation then gets worse when Manousos attempts an experiment. He screams in the face of an Other named Rick, then uses his radio and the unique signal he found back in Paraguay to soothe Rick and to try to coax some humanity back into him. (Meanwhile, back at Carol's house, Zosia is convulsing. It's all quite frightening.)

The plan doesn't work. But for Manousos, it's a solid start. As for Carol? She's not ready to accept that Manousos's aggressive presence in Albuquerque now means Zosia (and everyone else) will leave again. Nor is she ready to engage with Manousos's pithy challenge: “Do you want to save the world or get the girl?” It's more complicated than that. Manousos feels he's lost everything. Carol still has something—someone—to cling to. 

“La Chica O El Mundo” takes a couple of unexpected turns at the end. First, Carol leaves Albuquerque for an extended vacation with Zosia, visiting a hot spring, a beach, a luxury urban hotel, and a ski lodge. They look to be having a great time in their little bubble of abundance, shielded from the emptiness of the world just outside their range of vision.

But there's trouble in paradise. During a conversation at the ski lodge, Carol senses a hesitation in some of Zosia's answers about the future. After further probing, Carol learns the Joined are actively planning to convert her. They can access her stem cells from the eggs she froze with Helen, and they're about a month away (or maybe two or three) from figuring out how to make them usable, at which point Carol will Join. “If you loved me you wouldn't do this,” Carol says. Zosia replies, “We have to do this because we love you.” She then adds, unconvincingly, “Because I love you.”

We close on a cliffhanger, as Zosia deposits Carol and a big crate back in Albuquerque, via helicopter. Carol tells Manousos, “You win. We save the world.” 

What's in the crate? Oh, just an atom bomb. We'll have to wait for season two to learn how Carol plans to use it—if she has a plan at all. But we don't need to wonder why she's feeling so apocalyptic. We can see it in the stricken look she gives to Zosia before she steps off the helicopter and says goodbye…perhaps forever.

Just consider Carol's history. Think of her as a teen, glowering her way through conversion camp. Think about her family, shaming her so profoundly that as an adult Carol continues to hide who she is from her fans. Think about this persistent pessimist being lucky enough to find a wife who understands her moods—and then losing her in the Joining. And now here's Zosia, who outwardly affirms Carol while secretly planning to change her. Imagine how devastating all of this must be. With Zosia, Carol insists—sincerely—that she's the best, happiest version of herself. But it's still not enough. Damn it all.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Fallout asks, ""How many pricks can one Wasteland take?""","https://www.avclub.com/fallout-recap-season-2-episode-2","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 08:06:36 GMT","

How many assholes can you fill a setting with before it begins, overwhelmingly, to stink? It's a question Fallout has struggled with before and never more than when dealing with the Brotherhood Of Steel, quite possibly the biggest collection of reeking anuses in all the bombed-out Wastes. Outside of Maximus, Dane, and, arguably, Elder Cleric Quintus—who's at least a different flavor of power-hungry piece of shit—every Brotherhood member we've seen in the show so far has been the worst that the post-apocalyptic world has to offer, a whole army of insecure, heavily armed frat-bros whose only difference from the other “matching jackets” trying to control the Wastes has been a nicer set of duds. Fallout has raised the question before, and it's one it wrestles with now: If this is the “best” of humanity after the bombs fell, what's even the fucking point? 

This nihilism is underscored by our opening of this episode, which is fixated, as ever, on the ending of the world. It's a slightly smaller one than usual, admittedly, as we get to see the final moments of the thriving, peaceful settlement of Shady Sands, which we found out last season was Maximus' original home before, well…just watch, yeah? If Shady Sands isn't outright paradise, it's clear that this corner of the New California Republic was a hell of a lot better of a place to grow up than literally anywhere else we've seen in this entire show, with people working together toward self-sustainability, libraries set up in the streets, and violence kept to a minimum. It's a pity, then, that their growing community was growing up just a little too close to Vaults 31, 32, and 33—or that they'd just figured out how to tap into the Vaults' water supply to continue to grow their crops. (Nobody we see here, meanwhile, seems to know that their real sin was harboring the escaping wife of a cheerful, family-obsessed psychopath like Hank MacLean.) This cold open, in which Maximus' dad seems to successfully disarm the giant nuke that Hank's poor cyberzombie has snuck into town—only to have a happy Fallout chirp announce that the backup failsafe has now been activated and this little slice of heaven if irreparably fucked—is a classic Fallout blend of tragic and darkly comedic. Even knowing what's coming, watching two parents fling their scared little light into the future has a sweetness that this show knows to use sparingly.

Post-title card, we dive into an episode that's slightly less unfocused than “The Innovator,” by dint of not trying to cram six different sets of unconnected characters, each pursuing their own goals, themes, and tones, into the frame. (Of course, that still means we have four sets of unconnected characters running around and never interacting with each other, but still: progress!) I'll take these plots separately, and in order of increasing interest—which means I'll unfortunately (and somewhat surprisingly) have to kick off things with Lucy and The Ghoul., who already seem to be in danger of falling into a rut: I wrote last week about how Ella Purnell has a serious knack for making Lucy's idealism come off as a deliberate choice instead of rampant naivete, but apparently that has its limits. Having been lured into a destroyed hospital by some screams, Lucy ultimately chooses to ditch The Ghoul (at least temporarily) in order to escort a young woman back to her people, having to wade through a horde of deadly, radioactive scorpions and an even more brightly glowing series of red flags in order to do so.

I understand that Fallout needs to re-establish these characters' dynamics for its second season. But nothing about this sequence—where Purnell and Walton Goggins toss snide dialogue about the Golden Rule back and forth while their characters mostly talk past each other—does anything that “The Innovator” didn't already set back up in half the time and without making either character look like a fool. In that context, watching Lucy blindly stumble into an obvious trap, after ignoring the advice of her much-more-knowledgeable-about-this-region partner, is simply infuriating. (Really, Lucy? You don't think to immediately bail around “I wouldn't want to see you get raped by the wrong people”?) One of the things I genuinely enjoy about Lucy is that the show and Purnell frequently manage to make her seem nice without making her seem dumb; in this case, well…hey, at least the radscorpions looked pretty freaking cool.

Meanwhile, back in our Ascending List Of Disconnected Plots, we also get to hang with Lucy's little brother Norm, as he successfully manages to turn a bunch of potentially hostile, recently defrosted Vault-Tec management trainees into useful lackeys via some steadily delivered bullshit and a quack motivational program. (Shout-out to the showrunners for successfully signposting what dipshits these guys are supposed to be by casting Jeremy Levick and Rajat Suresh as two of them.) This is pretty slight stuff, running almost entirely in Fallout-as-satire mode, but it does give Moisés Arias a chance to continue fleshing out Norm as he seemingly takes on more importance in season two. (Notably, his excitement for being out on the surface for the first time in his life is palpable, even as one of his new army of doofs can only yell, “Aw, man, the mall's gone!”)

While we're checking in on MacLeans, we also get an extended sequence with Hank, who starts burning his way through Vault-Tec's supply of lab animals in order to try to fine-tune the mind-control devices that are apparently going to be, like, the thing this season. It's not clear, honestly, if Hank actually knows what the fuck he's doing here, or if he's just fiddling around with knobs and making mice explode. But damn if Kyle MacLachlan doesn't look convincing while doing it! Hank eventually decides he needs to upgrade to human subjects, and it's here where my enthusiasm for MacLachlan being front-and-center this season continues to grow: That good-natured alien quality that made the actor such a highlight of shows like Portlandia and the Return season of Twin Peaks makes Hank's utter indifference to human life both funny and deeply menacing—especially when we find out why he might have chosen this particular “Premium Elite Plus” customer to get a chip jammed bloodily into his neck, when he notes that the guy abandoned his family for safety in the vaults. “You can't put a price on family, Steve,” he says, with that seething chipperness that means heads are about to explode. “We were very clear on that in the advertisements.”

With our subplots nicely sorted, that brings me, in roundabout fashion, back to the main event of this episode: “Knight Maximus,” new golden boy of the California chapter of The Brotherhood Of Steel. His fortunes, along with those of his dickhead comrades, are now literally soaring in the aftermath of their seizure of the Cold Fusion technology last season, which presumably has something to do with the giant airship Quintus and his minions are now tooling around in. And that's not the least of the treasures this chapter of the Brotherhood is proving themselves almost instantly too stupid to know the value of, as the installation of a quickly acquired MacGuffin, and the activation of some big, impressive fans, allows them to stumble onto actual, no-fooling Area 51, complete with alien corpses and classic cars that are both swiftly destroyed in an orgy of acquisitive idiocy.

Maximus, for his part, has been rendered largely numb to both stupidity and praise alike—which doesn't mean there's not a thrill to seeing Aaron Moten back in the part after missing last week's premiere. Moten had the hardest path to tread back in Fallout's first season, and specifically when it came to making his part of the show's three-protagonist structure work: Without Goggins' veteran, charismatic drawl, or Purnell's infectious cheerfulness to draw upon, he had to flesh out a character who charted a middle course between semi-suicidal idealism and relentless cynicism, slowly unearthing a sweet kid from out beneath the Brotherhood's toxic bullshit. Now he's drowning in it all over again, executing Quintus' orders even as he has to constantly remind his fellow “Knights” not to play with fusion grenades indoors. (Nobody ever accused Fallout of being subtle television.) His conversations with Dane and his new squire make it clear that he knows nothing good is coming of giving Quintus' Brotherhood bigger, nastier grenades to juggle, even as he tries to tell himself he's pushing for small, incremental reforms from within. But what good is keeping yourself clean when the Wasteland mindset is always ready to drag you back down into the mire?

All of this comes into sharp focus once Quintus—emboldened by all the cheap Fusion Cores he's now pumping out thanks to the Cold Fusion tech—brings in his fellow local chapter heads to pitch them on a civil war against the “Commonwealth Brotherhood.” Seeing the three other leaders at the table, it becomes clear that all we're really watching is a different flavor of tribal warlords hashing out their territory, as each chapter asserts its own awful (and occasionally violently misogynistic) brand of Wasteland evil. Even once the four tribes agree to unite, it doesn't promise peace: Maximus ends up being goaded into a fight with a big, nasty bastard from one of the other chapters, and, as Quintus looks on with a testing eye, he's forced to brutally kill the man to save his own life, the two locked in mortal combat for no reason other than to show brutal dominance over the other. War, as they say, sure never seems to change (unless, of course, a big flashy guest star like Kumail Nanjiani can suddenly waltz in at the end and force it to, but we'll presumably get to that next week). 

There are big, weighty ideas buried in this A-plot, and Moten quickly re-proves he has the chops to carry them. He's got command now of both Maximus' harder side and the flop-sweat doofus hiding just underneath. But, just like the premiere, this episode is also a damn hard piece of television to talk about cohesively, because it doesn't feel especially interested in being that. Squint and you can pull out something resonant about humanity's recurrent pitfalls when it comes to re-forging civilization, whether it's the Brotherhood's violence, Hank's head-exploding techno-fascism, or Norm's reinvention of middle management employee pacification techniques. But it's a lot of squinting at what are ultimately four stories separated by time, distance, and very little in the way of thematic overlap. Even the most rote of these stories has good or funny stuff, like Lucy subjecting The Ghoul to her re-telling of A Christmas Carol, or the segment where Norm constructs a semi-literal corporate ladder to climb his way out of the Vault. But Fallout, when it's really cooking, is a smart enough show to have its component sections reflect on each other. So far, though, it's coming in as exactly the sum of its parts. Nothing less, but also nothing more.

The first animated Avatar: The Last Airbender movie is heading to an algorithm near you. Earlier today, Paramount announced that the new Last Airbender sequel film, The Legend Of Aang, which returns the series to its original protagonist, Aang, will skip theaters and head straight to streaming next fall. Aang is an expansion of the wildly popular Last Airbender franchise, taking place between Avatar and Legend Of Korra, and will be followed by a new streaming series, Avatar: Seven Havens. First announced in 2021, the movie has a formidable voice cast, including Taika Waititi, Geraldine Viswanathan, Dee Bradley Baker, Freida Pinto, Ke Huy Quan, Dave Bautista, Eric Nam, Jessica Matten, Dionne Quan, Román Zaragoza, and Steven Yeun.

Both Avatar and its first spin-off, The Legend of Korra, have remained viable animated franchises over the years, with a growing and fervent fanbase. Avatar has also been adapted twice. There was, of course, M. Night Shyamalan's 2010 live-action adaptation, which people often forget was actually a pretty big hit. There was also a live-action Netflix series that was released in 2024, which, frankly, failed to have the stickiness of Netflix's other live-action adaptation of another beloved animated fantasy, One Piece. Still, two more seasons (and no more) of Airbender are on the way.

Still, while Avatar is an American production, its heavy anime influence surely would've grabbed some of the moviegoers who made Demon Slayer and Chainsaw Man hits. Not to mention, two decades of fans who grew up with the show and now want to expose their children to it. But what do we know? We're just a website that wants people to go to the movies more, and an animated family adventure film based on popular IP would've been a good opportunity to make our dreams a reality.

Tylor Chase is getting help from familiar faces as concern grows over his well-being. The former “Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide” actor, who played Martin Qwerly on the Nickelodeon series, reunited this week with ex-co-star Daniel Curtis Lee in Los Angeles. 

Lee shared footage of the emotional reunion on Instagram, capturing the two reconnecting after Chase was recently seen living unhoused.

Chase, 36, drew renewed attention earlier this week when a clip from September resurfaced online showing him living on the streets of Riverside, California.

On Tuesday, Lee, who portrayed Simon “Cookie” Nelson-Cook on “Ned's Declassified,” posted a video documenting his reunion with Chase on the streets of Los Angeles.

After greeting each other with a long embrace, Lee took Chase out for pizza and later FaceTimed fellow series alum Devon Werkheiser. The clip ended with Lee checking Chase into a hotel and discussing next steps toward treatment.

“Tylor Chase and Cookie reunite with Ned on FaceTime. Well fed and safe from the rain. Hotel secured! One step closer to long-term treatment,” Lee captioned the post. “PS: Tylor wants to livestream video games. Who can help?”

Lee later shared more details about his efforts to support Chase, explaining that beyond food and shelter, he also helped Chase reconnect with his father.

“Love is all we can really give people sometimes, and I'm happy that he was able to have that connection with his pops,” Lee said in an Instagram reel.

“I really believe we can get Tylor back on his feet, and you know I'm super feeling it right now with the holiday season,” he added. “He's on my heart often, on my mind often.”

Lee, Werkheiser, and fellow “Ned's Declassified” alum Lindsey Shaw previously addressed Chase's situation when the video of him living on the streets first surfaced in September.

During an episode of the “Ned's Declassified Podcast Survival Guide,” Lee admitted the footage was difficult to process.

“After I was angry at the people who were filming it, I was upset with myself in that I feel powerless,” he said. “I feel like there's not much I can do.”

Chase has also drawn support beyond his former Nickelodeon castmates. Shaun Weiss, best known for playing Greg Goldberg in “The Mighty Ducks,” revealed that concrete steps are already in place to help Chase access treatment.

“I have received many messages about Tylor Chase. I reached out to some friends of mine, and we have a bed for him at a detox, and we have a place for him to go and get long-term treatment,” Weiss said in an Instagram video.

“All we need to do now is find him,” he added. “If anybody could go get a face-to-face with Tylor, please DM me so we can get him some help in time for the holiday.”

Devon Werkheiser also spoke candidly about watching his former co-star struggle.

“Tylor was a sensitive, sweet, and kind kid,” Werkheiser told TMZ. “It is heartbreaking to see him this way.”

“Anyone who has dealt with severe addiction and deep mental health issues knows it's an unbelievably challenging situation if they don't want help,” he continued. “It's an everyday uphill battle to course correct. It requires a ton of support and patience and time.”

Werkheiser said he hopes the renewed attention leads to meaningful intervention. “My only hope is that from this exposure, someone with real understanding and resources can step in, get Tylor into treatment, and help him get back on track,” he said. “We all want a happy ending.”

Hallmark star Sarah Drew is an incredibly busy actress, not only with her popular series “Mistletoe Murders” but also with other projects. She has one film, “Venice Days,” in post-production, and she's getting ready to begin “Say it in German.” She also just finished filming “Jimmy,” in which she portrayed real-life gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. 

Given that she's also the mother of a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old, it's understandable that finding relaxation can be difficult. In a long-ranging chat with Jennie Garth on her “I Choose Me” podcast, the multi-hyphenate revealed the self-care she chose to get back into a joyful spirit after a particularly grueling year. Hint: It involved 46 books.

“Last year, I burned myself out a little bit with work, writing, producing, while also starring on a show,” Drew told Garth. “And I was so exhausted that, by the time November hit, I decided to start reading romantasy.”

“I got so into romantasy. I basically was supposed to be writing all spring, all winter, and did not,” she continued. “I read 46 books. I had to give it up for Lent. I was like, ‘I just need to pause because this has taken over my life.”

“But I will say, I was saying earlier, it's very difficult for me to do something that… just, just brings me joy and delight, that is not accomplishing anything,” she added. “And reading fantasy and romantasy is such a delightful traipse into another world. I'm not trying to option anything, turn anything into a movie. I'm not trying to grow and expand, I'm just trying to find delight.”

I have a bone to pick with you #jenniferlarmentrout #primalofbloodandbone #romantasy #romantasybooks #romantasybooktok 

Sarah Drew has been outspoken about her love for the romantasy genre. She often posts on her social media accounts which books she's currently reading and which are her favorites. Most recently, she expressed frustration with the ending of the book “Primal of Blood and Bone.” 

“I get to the end of the book, everything is a disaster,” she said. “I have actual real-life anxiety from the anxiety in the story.” Her fans flocked to the comments to commiserate. 

“I LOVE when celebrities talk about what books they are reading and I know they are just as upset with authors as we are! 🤣🤣🤣” Wrote one fan.

Drew also recently revealed that she'd love to be in an adaptation of the romantasy series “A Court of Thorns and Roses” (ACOTAR). She's okay with not being a lead character.

“Unfortunately, all of those heroines are 17,” she told Soaps.com. “Seventeen and saving the world, it's fine. I'll never play one of them. I can play one of the moms,” she said.

Veteran comedic actor Pat Finn, known for his memorable roles on sitcoms such as “The Middle,” “Seinfeld” and “Friends,” has died at age 60 after a battle with cancer, according to TMZ.

Finn, who brought warmth and humor to screens for decades, passed away Tuesday, December 23, at his home in Los Angeles, surrounded by loved ones.

According to local reports, Finn had been fighting bladder cancer for several years, first entering remission in 2022 before the illness returned and metastasized.

He leaves behind his wife Donna, and their children, Cassidy, Caitlin and Ryan.

Born Patrick Cassidy Finn on July 31, 1965, in Evanston, Illinois, Finn grew up in the Chicago area and developed a passion for performance that would define his life and career.

After graduating from Marquette University, he honed his craft at Chicago's famed Second City comedy troupe alongside friends including Chris Farley, and eventually made his way into television and film.

Finn first gained notice with guest appearances on shows like “Seinfeld,” playing the harried Joe Mayo, and went on to appear in comedies such as “Murphy Brown” and “3rd Rock from the Sun,” according to IMDb.

But he became perhaps best known to a broad audience for his lasting role as Bill Norwood on the hit ABC sitcom “The Middle,” which he played from 2011 to 2018. He was credited with 23 episodes for the beloved sitcom.

Fans appreciated his ability to create characters who felt fully human — relatable, funny and deeply engaging.  

Colleagues and fellow performers reacted with sadness as word of Finn's death spread.

Comedian Jeff Dye shared a heartfelt tribute on social media.

“I don't like to be the guy who post pics with celebrities that pass. But this guy wasn't just a celebrity to me. He was a friend,” he began.

The touching tribute continued, “One of the best dudes I knew with a PERFECT sense of humor. I love you Pat Finn and I'll see again in the after , we can sing together and shake our heads about all the meannes in the used to be.”

Writer Brian Stack shared a touching throwback video of Finn to social media.

“Heartbroken that our dear friend, Pat Finn, passed away. As kind as he was brilliantly hilarious. This video of him at our Chicago apartment in ‘96, making his baby daughter Cassidy pretend to drive a bus and do karate kicks is priceless. Rest In Peace, Finner. We love you,” he wrote.

Really love how you present information in such engaging and clear ways 🌻

I remember him most for the iconic Toyota commercials.  Always brought a smile to my face.

Jazz Jennings is embracing her confidence and celebrating how far she has come. The YouTube star and “I Am Jazz” alum, 24, shared a series of vacation photos from Las Vegas on Instagram on Sunday, December 21, offering fans a glimpse into a moment of self-love, joy, and pride after a transformative health journey.

She became widely known through TLC's reality series “I Am Jazz,” which premiered in 2015 and documented her life as a transgender teen navigating family, school, relationships, mental health, and medical milestones.

In the carousel, Jennings posted snapshots from her Vegas getaway, including photos with family members such as her mother, Jeanette, who joined her on the trip.

One image showed Jennings relaxing in a bubble bath, flashing a peace sign while strategically covered by bubbles. See her confident photos here.

“Rolling the dice 🎲I ❤️ Vegas,” she captioned the post.

Jennings shared in August that she had lost nearly 100 pounds over two years, opening up about the milestone with gratitude and pride.

“I'm so proud of my progress and want to thank my family, friends, and all who supported me in getting there! Good health is not a certificate you display; it is a constant effort! I still have room for improvement, but I am more motivated and inspired than I've been in years. Let's keep it going,” she wrote at the time.

She paired the message with a side-by-side video showing her running and holding a wall sit two years earlier compared with the present day. Text across the clip read, “I'm proud of my progress towards better health, but I'm still running towards more goals!”

Jennings has been candid about her earlier challenges. In June 2021, she shared that she struggled with binge eating and weight gain.

“As many of you have noticed, over the past few years, I have gained a substantial amount of weight,” she wrote at the time. 

“My binging, along with an increased appetite I experience from some of the meds I'm on, has caused me to gain almost 100 pounds in a little less than 2 years.”

She also explained her mindset shift toward healthier habits.

“I'm ready to change my ways; I've been saying I'm ready to turn over a new leaf, but I'm running out of trees now. I'm ready to take the initiative and create positive changes when it comes to my health and body,” she wrote. 

“I have a fabulous team supporting me, both professionals and family/friends, but at the end of the day, I have to be the one committed toward bettering myself. I know I have the power in me to lose the weight.”

Jennings' Vegas trip followed another major milestone. On December 3, she revealed that she had completed her final exam as “a Harvard student.”

“Picture taken in mad scientist mode,” she captioned a smiling photo of herself.

Fans flooded the comments with praise and encouragement. “Congratulations, and u always looked like a princess,” one follower wrote.

Another added, “Jazz, all of your internet aunties are SO! PROUD! Of you!!! Enjoy your break!!! ❤️❤️❤️.”

As Jennings continues to share her journey, her recent posts reflect a mix of confidence, resilience, and gratitude for the growth she has achieved both physically and personally.

[Editor's note: The following review contains spoilers for “Pluribus” Episode 9, “La Chica o El Mundo” — the Season 1 finale.]

Way back in the second episode of “Pluribus,” Carol (Rhea Seehorn) poses a direct question to the five other English-speaking survivors of The Joining. Rather than focus on what's been gained from an alien virus turning (almost) all of humanity into a global hive mind — including the minor benefit of peace on Earth — she implores them to look at their situation from the opposite angle. “Ask yourselves what's been lost,” she says.

 










At first, the group appears to dismiss its singular curmudgeon. Carol's fellow free people barely pause to consider her request before shifting their focus to the newly emptied zoos. Instead of examining the fate of the world, Xiu Mei (Sharon Gee) complains about a stray giraffe eating all the leaves off her tree.

But then she stops. Xiu turns first to Carol and then to each one of her fellow humans as she says, “I tell you this: I do not give away my dog.”

 










Xiu's statement doesn't mean much to Carol at the time — “Can we just stick with talking about the people?” she pleads — but after the Season 1 finale, it looks like a missed opportunity. Episode 9, “La Chica o El Mundo,” begins less than two months later, when another guest from that initial meeting — Kusimayu (Darinka Arones), the young Peruvian woman who longed to join her family post-Joining — is about to get her wish. A potion manufactured by the hive mind's top minds (mind?) is on its way to her tiny farming village, and one whiff will correct whatever biological error left her separated from everyone else.

As she waits for the container to arrive, Kusimayu sits in a small paddock, cradling a baby goat. She strokes its fur slowly, gazing down on the dear creature with blissful affection. From her expression and tenderness, her tranquility and devotion, it's clear Kusimayu loves this little goat.

But after she sniffs those consciousness-altering vapors, Kusimayu doesn't care about the goat anymore. As the hive mind gets ready to abandon the village, along with its culture and history, she frees the farm animals, just like her fellow “weirdos” did at the zoos. And when her furry black-and-white friend follows her — bleating at her heels, eager for more affection — Kusimayu keeps walking. Her smile may seem similar to what the goat conjured a few minutes prior, but it's not the same. It's more uniform now. Homogenized. Broad. She doesn't feel the particular attachment she once did to the little goat, even though the little goat certainly still feels attached to Kusimayu.

 










Without realizing it, Kusimayu has done the unthinkable: She's given away her dog. 

Had Carol been paying attention to Xiu Mei on Air Force One, perhaps she could've recognized the Chinese woman's fierce devotion to her dog mirrored humanity's fierce devotion to our pets — goats very much included. Sure, we may be able to shrug off atrocities inflicted on our fellow man with alarming ease, but if Jesus Christ Himself came down from Heaven and accidentally landed on an innocent pupper, we'd run Him out of town faster than you could say “Hallelujah.” Simply put, there's just an elemental connection between the empathy we show animals and whatever it is that makes us human.

“Pluribus” Episode 9 beautifully illustrates as much in its heartbreaking opening scene. Without saying a word, we can tell when Kusimayu joins the hive mind, she loses a part of herself that's good, pure, and soulful. Where once there was individualized love, now there is only generalized compassion. Something is missing, and whatever you want to call it, you feel its acute, agonizing absence when Kusimayu walks away from her tiny goat.

Kusimayu's choice sets the stage for Carol's own decision at episode's end, when she has to choose between continuing her pretend life with her pretend wife within their indulgent delusions, or going home to help Manousos (Carlos-Manuel Vesga) do the hard, right, and real thing (aka saving the world). 

 










And… it's not much of a choice. Even without Kusimayu's tear-jerking precurso, griven all we've come to learn about Carol, it's impossible to imagine her living the rest of her days on a romantic vacation with Zosia (Karolina Wydra), to say nothing of agreeing to Join once her own personalized vapor dose is ready. Of course she's going to do the work to “put things back in their place,” as Manuosos describes it.

But it's not good enough to know what Carol will do. We have to understand why she's compelled to do it.

For many shows, that's easy. The protagonist needs money and/or power, or they need to find their kid, or they need to avoid being slashed to bits by monsters from another dimension. But “Pluribus” is tackling one of the most challenging and enduring existential questions out there: What makes us human? That's the question Carol has to answer in order to make her decision. That's the question Vince Gilligan wants us thinking about in 2025 (and beyond), and that's why “Pluribus” has spent its first season providing answer after answer through a series of enthralling examples. (OK, sometimes they're not so enthralling, but hey, that's human subjectivity for ya.)

What makes us human? Well, what about in Episode 8, when Carol writes the first chapter of her next book and lets Zosia read it? The hive mind couldn't be more excited to read something they've never read before. Now they can discover something new, discuss what it means with the author, and share in eager anticipation of whatever comes next. That's human. Or this week, when Carol and Manuosos argue and fight as they slowly learn how to communicate effectively, make compromises for the greater good, and work together — also human. 

 










Or when Carol cautiously invests in a new romantic relationship only to eventually accept her “chaperone” has just been going through the motions. Just like their time together mirrors a typical courtship, their break-up can be seen as a common, relatable split: These two lovebirds can't overcome a fundamental disparity: Carol needs to be seen and understood by the person sitting across from her, and all the knowledge in the world (aka the hive mind) can't provide her that. In other words, Carol is human, and Zosia is not.

(Huh. I wonder what Vince Gilligan might be trying to tell us here. Hmm… oh, I know! [picks up iPhone] “Hey Siri, what is ‘Pluribus' about?“)

So what does she do? She goes home — and brings an atom bomb with her. I won't pretend to know what happens when Carol unboxes her giant crate (especially since there's a decent chance Gilligan doesn't know either), but my best guess is she brought it home as insurance: If the “weirdos” try to Join her or they succeed in building that giant antenna, she'll set off the nuke and put an end to their interstellar takeover. (“Weirdos,” it must be said, is a term I love not only because it's the perfect descriptor for these well-meaning but distant individuals, but also because it's a handy way to avoid stepping on “Lost's” toes by calling them “the Others.”)

 










No matter her plans, the bomb itself still represents loss. Bombs destroy, and Carol is trying to preserve. “I think there's a way to put things back in their place,” Manuosos says. If they can't do it — if they can't bring back our shared humanity — then we've lost everything that matters. Things like unexpected friends, new art, and true love. The weirdos saved civilization, sure, but what good is civilization if not to further humanity? And what good is survival without what makes life worth living? Season 1 slowly, steadily revealed that to us, allowing us to consider our values just as Carol does. And what better way to drive home the point than with a baby goat, trotting after its owner, wondering why she was so eager to give him away?

“Pluribus” Season 1 is available in full on Apple TV. The second season has already been renewed.

Editor Affonso Gonçalves has worked with directors as wide-ranging in style as Maggie Gyllenhaal and Todd Haynes, Roger Ross Williams, and Ira Sachs. But on “Hamnet,” he wasn't just brought in to bring a raw, rhythmic, textured approach to the fictionalized story of William Shakespeare (Paul Mescal), Agnes Shakespeare (Jessie Buckley), and how the death of their son Hamnet (Jacobi Jupe) ripples through their lives. He was brought in to be another set of eyes for director Chloé Zhao.

“Chloé is the co-editor. We edit together the way Chloé — I think in all her movies, she always does the first pass. With this one, we talked about it. She says, ‘I want to cut it. Don't watch any footage. Don't watch anything.  I want you to watch my cut first, when you come in,'” Gonçalves told IndieWire as part of our recent craft roundtable.

Once Gonçalves had seen Zhao's first cut of the film, they got on the phone to talk about those performances and the flow of the movie as a whole. But then Gonçalves was turned loose to make a film that is about a kind of mystical communion — between the natural and the fantastical, between life and death, theater and life — even more lyrical.

 










“I think because she's so specific, she's so particular about performance, so she wanted to do the first pass the way it is in the script. And then I came in, and I had a little more freedom to do different things,” Gonçalves said. Gonçalves' experiments allowed Zhao to either follow those curiosities or pull back towards the script, depending on what felt right. But assembling the film really was a collaborative push and pull between the two editors, once Zhao was back from shooting in London.

“It was super fun. It was great. It was a great relationship we had in the cutting room,” Gonçalves said.

There's something about a bleak Birmingham winter that just screams Christmas, which Netflix clearly knew when they released the teaser trailer for “Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man” on Wednesday. 

Four years after the original BBC series aired its final episode, the new “Peaky Blinders” feature film takes place in the English manufacturing hub not long after the UK entered World War II. Last we saw Cillian Murphy as the lovable gangster Tommy Shelby, he was riding off into the distance on a white horse in the wake of another dispute that cost him multiple loved ones. But as we know, it takes more than a bit of guilt and spilt blood to deter a Shelby, meaning that Tommy is back for what the logline of the film calls “his most destructive reckoning yet.”

Written by “Peaky Blinders” series creator Steven Knight and directed by Tom Harper (“Wild Rose,” “The Aeronauts”), “Immortal Man” co-stars highly decorated newcomers Rebecca Ferguson, Tim Roth, and Barry Keoghan, alongside series regular Sophie Rundle and Season 6 addition Stephen Graham, who is in the midst of a career high following Netflix's “Adolescence.” Back in February, Knight gave his assessment of the film and its stellar cast to Variety: “I would say this — wouldn't I? — but it's fantastic. We've got the best, I think, the best British actors all in one place.” Meanwhile, “Saltburn” star Keoghan told IndieWire of the project a few months before, “I read the script and loved it and have chatted to Cillian about it and it's going to be epic.”

Like the vibey series, the brief first trailer for the film is moody, propulsive, and full of Murphy. It hints at the fact that, once again, we'll see Tommy at a crossroad, torn between giving into his demons and trying to chart a new, more constructive path. Given the scars he bears from the first World War, finding happiness in 1940 won't be easy, but we'll all be there to cheer on the most charming, gun-toting man in the West Midlands.

“Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man” will release in select theaters on March 6, 2026, and on Netflix March 20. Watch the full trailer below.

The scale of “Marty Supreme” matches the ambition of its protagonist, Marty Mauser (Timothée Chalamet). While Mauser's manic quest to become the face of table tennis as a world champion takes him everywhere from the bowels of the Lower East Side to Japan (and back again), the challenge for casting director Jennifer Venditti in her seventh collaboration with a Safdie brother, and fourth with director Josh Safdie, was to find over 150 roles that would fit the early '50s time period and specific cultural milieus that Marty runs headlong through.

 










To steal the wisdom of “Ratatouille,” maybe not everyone can act, but great actors can come from anywhere. Venditti's documentary background and extensive exploration of street photography from the '50s both prompted her to look outside the pipeline of established actors for core roles within the film. “It's not that I don't love actors, too,” Venditti told IndieWire. “When non-actors come into play [for casting consideration], it's when they have a lived experience that can inform the character in a way that the writers maybe didn't think of, or that they can add depth to the part.”

Venditti cited Kevin O'Leary, who plays pen mogul Milton Rockwell in the film, as a great example of this. Most folks would be more familiar with O'Leary's work playing himself in front of hundreds of hopeful entrepreneurs as one of the hosts of “Shark Tank.” It would be what a modern-day version of Milton is doing, so O'Leary's particular lived experience adds an enticing level of authenticity to the role, even while Safdie helps him to shape his persona and mannerisms to fit the needs of the story and its period worldbuilding. “I'm lucky enough to work with a director who is super skilled and doesn't mind having to help people get there,” Venditti said.

With O'Leary, Venditti's team didn't have much of a chance to work with him, so it was really on Safdie and co-screenwriter Ronald Bronstein to have the conversations that would help shape his performance. But for a character like Dion (Luke Manley), who also has to go toe-to-toe with Chalamet, Venditti and her team were instrumental in finding the right, and unexpected, person for the part. “We saw a lot of people for it. Actors and non-actors, and Luke is not an actor, but he came in and I took him through the process. We had many stages of what I do [with non-actors], and he passed every phase of it with flying colors,” Venditti said. “So a lot of times, I'm prepping the person for Josh before they get onto the set.”

 










Venditti starts this process with a documentary-style interview, just to get a sense of the person and their life, maybe if they have anything that overlaps or resonates with a character. “It doesn't have to be specific, but the energetics of their life, maybe they have similar things to the characters on the page — it's kind of like being a detective, a little bit, finding out if there's anything in this person's personality that would be interesting to bring to a character,” Venditti said.

From there, Venditti's goal is to create a safe environment for folks to do a little bit of improv. “First of all, to be taken from your life, and brought into this situation where these people are gonna judge you, or they want you to be something — we never want to think of it like we're asking you to perform, you know? We're asking you to come into this environment and have an experience and bring yourself to it. So I really try to make it an environment that feels safe,” Venditti said. “I'll come up with a scene or an improv scenario that [has] similar energetics of whatever one of the scenes might be in the movie — if it's hostile, or confused, or something — and then I have an actor there that's good at improv, so they have a great sparring partner.”

 










While the experienced improviser can lead a scene or game and give someone scenarios to play with, Venditti is fascinated by how people without acting training can respond to it — and often it's more fun than your average 201 showcase. “Oh my God, if these walls could talk, in my office. Like, on ‘Uncut Gems' it was insane. My associate basically almost got murdered so many times. Because people get so into it and because they're not actors, they don't know any of the rules. So it's like, ‘Can I touch this?' you know? They just go for it,” Venditti said.

If a performer can be playful, in the moment, and really bring themselves to an acting scenario, then from there, Venditti and her team will give them lines to learn and progress them onto further stages of the audition process. “But the idea is to keep reinforcing that they're there because of them, not because we want them to be someone else. We want them to bring themselves to this role. We want them to play, but we don't want them to become someone else,” Venditti said.

Venditti's background is documentary, and her facility with casting and working with non-actors, but her work across the board comes out of an insatiable interest in people. She'd auditioned Odessa A'zion, who plays Rachel Mizler, very much Marty's sparring partner and also his baby mama, for something wildly different years before “Marty Supreme,” but always remembered her.

 










“In the movie, you see [her as] this hustler, and she's this vulnerable sweet girl that you feel for, and she also has this spunk to her where she's resilient, she's quick. They're mirrors of each other, but she is a shapeshifter in that way where you're like, ‘Oh, she's a little shit,' but you also care about her,” Venditti said. “For Rachel, it wasn't about her looks, it was about the spirit of this character and the life she'd lived and what she's been through and what her resilience and her tenacity is. And I think [A'zion] just had it all. Odessa has this authentic, original quality about herself [and] a real connection to the spectrum of who she is and the capacity to feel a lot. She just — it's who she is.”

That is what makes the casting of “Marty Supreme” so staggering. Every one of the 150-plus roles is exactly who these people are.

An A24 release, “Marty Supreme” opens in theaters on December 25.

Article by Peter Stuart and Sam Winebaum

R.A.D. Running UFO ($200)



Introduction

Sam: The R.A.D UFO exploded on the run scene the last few months with the most fun looking and bright shoe in a long time, maybe ever? 





But how does this dual density PEBA foam trainer at a very respectable 8.85 oz / 251g US9 for its max cushion 42mm heel /  34mm forefoot stack height fit and run? Does the ride and fit match the super fun looks? How does a shoe from a new UK/LA brand first known for edgy shoe geekery sneaker culture  (R.A.D Intro Video),  and their first gym/functional fitness shoes, measure up in a crowded field of super critical foam powered run trainers? How does it compare to others in its light and stacked category? My take on that in my video comparison review to others in the category here and in Comparisons below with Peter.



Pros:

Very energetic soft ride: Sam/Peter

Stunning visual design that brilliantly matches the run experience: Sam/Peter

Excellent energy return: Peter/Sam

Very comfortable upper: Peter/Sam

Excellent grip: Peter/Sam

Cons:

Higher priced than several competitors but with a superior quality and fitting upper than the competitors: Sam/Peter

Soft ride and high stack makes them not particularly stable and can lead to some fatigue on longer runs (over 10) or for slow very easy runs”  Peter/Sam

Stats

Approx. Weight: men's  8.85 oz / 251g US9 :: women's  oz / g US8

  Sample Weights: 

     men's  8.64 oz / 245g US8.5

     women''s oz / g US

Stack Height: 42mm heel /  34mm forefoot 

Platform Width:  90mm heel /  80mm midfoot  / 110mm forefoot (at ground contact)

First Impressions, Fit and Upper



Peter: What are these awesome looking hot pink beauties? What is RAD? Oh my. I think the RAD UFO is a great looking shoe. They take some design cues from basketball shoes—and have a nice high stack and a big ol' slab of foam. Even my cynical 13 year old said they look “tough”. 

Step-in is super comfortable and the well padded tongue and sleek lacing system hold the foot in place beautifully. Fit is true to size for me. 

I've had no issues with the upper–it's been super comfortable every second of every mile.

First impressions on the run is that these are a strong contender for best shoe of the year. Fun, fun, fun on the first run. Soft, bouncy, good at any speed and left me feeling fresh. The UFO also has some nice reflective touches that help you stay visible. 

Sam: We ran into RAD on a pre The Running Event run in the Hemisfer park behind the convention center. Off on a side street in the distance, we saw a van and many bright feet. 



We knew it was RAD from miles away as their shoes are so colorful. Sally and I demoed pairs and RAD was kind to let us keep them for this review.

It is always fantastic, and actually quite rare, when visual design perfectly matches the run experience and here with the UFO it does! The curving bulbous lines and bright colors point to fun and energy of the softer variety and that is what the UFO delivers.



The upper, as befitting a $200 shoe, is premium in materials, very comfortable and light.

The main mesh is thin, single layer, soft and supportive. To support the midfoot the eyestays combinE cord loops with s stout supporting structure (black and gray below). This allows the lower thin mesh to expand if needed for higher volume wider feet while for lower volume ones snugs the upper over the top of the foot. 



I have a higher arch lower volume foot and at my true to size US8.5 / EU 42 in the sample, I have to pull the laces very tight yet unlike similar situations once laced I have no excessive pressure and a very adequate midfoot hold. Why? 



The narrow tongue has a substantial center top panel so no lace bite and also includes a gusset. Do I wish for a touch more overall support for the uptempo purposes of the shoe and its soft midsole? Maybe, via a bit denser thicker overall mesh but I have no significant complaints.



The toes area is well held with a substantial vertical internal toe bumper. 



While just behind the front there is plenty of well held mesh give the toe box is a bit pointy and low (but not felt over my dodgy big toes). This design is robably required to hold the foot in what is a very unstructured and soft front of the shoe and also looks cool and fast after all the curves towards the rear of the shoe. 

Midsole & Platform



Sam: The 42mm heel / 34 mm forefoot full stack height is made up of a dual layer PEBA blend, a notably soft layer below the foot with a somewhat firmer layer at the ground. 



The platform despite its bulbous joyous look is pretty average in width for such a high stack shoe at 90mm heel / 80mm midfoot / 110mm forefoot at outsole contact and a bit broader if one takes into account the foam beyond.

The feel is soft, super bouncy and energetic. Pure fun on the run! At 8.64 oz / 245g in my US8.5 sample we have a light shoe accentuating its dynamic foam

This is not the firmer more stable feel of say New Balance's FuelCell PEBA blend in the Rebel v5. The foams favor faster paces towards the front over slow paced heel striking where things can get a touch unstable at the rear of the shoe. I do think the lower layer could be firmed up a some to help stabilize and also provide a touch more decisive response

Peter: The foams do their job here. The first run reminded me of the joyous bounce of the OG Vaporfly–or the later craziness of the Mizuno Wave Rebellion. 

Even though it's a big stack of foam at 42/34, I find it pretty stable. Hard corners can be a little unstable, but I generally feel like I stay on track. The softer layer of foam near the foot may be a hair too soft, but I don't really notice that on runs under 10 miles. I was a bit worried that the foam might collapse a bit over time, but I'm nearly 100 miles in and they feel pretty much the same as when I started. 

Outsole



Sam: The outsole is the now an increasingly common CPU (cast polyurethane) compound seen for example on the Mount to Coast H1, and increasingly also on race supershoes. CPU “rubber” is lighter than conventional rubber and in my experience longer lasting allowing thin outsoles, again helping reduce weights. Grip is excellent of wet and dry pavement. While a mostly rigid rocker shoe they do have some far front flex, similar to the EVO SL's. 



Peter: The Outsole consists of a fair amount of exposed foam with four large sections of pretty firm rubber. Each section has grooves and a hole in the middle. The result is a very grippy and somewhat firm outsole that helps firm up the ride, holds the road and allows for a strong toe-off. The outsole rubber is raised off of the bottom of the shoe and decently thick. Wear seems to be minimal at 100 miles, so I expect that they will hold up well. 

Ride, Conclusions and Recommendations

Peter: Absolutely one of my favorite shoes from the first run. I've reached for them for nearly every run since I got them and they've been just fantastic. It's a nearly perfect mix of cushioning,energy return and propulsion. They are definitely on the soft side, but I like that–and they snap to attention when you push them. The RAD UFO disappears on my foot and makes running really, really, really FUN. I highly recommend that anyone try a pair on and see how they feel. It's a great way to see what the new foams can feel like. It's hard to believe that this is RAD's first foray into a running shoe is such a banger, but it is!

Peter's Score 9.8  Not an inexpensive shoe at $200 and I get a little fatigued when I go long, but boy are they fun. 

😊😊😊😊😊

Sam: Fun looks meet a super fun and energetic ride here! Big smiles when you see them and big smiles on the run. The soft and energetic foam, big stack and relatively broad platform had me bounding along. The UFO due to its softness and to a lesser extent its upper favors faster paces over easy ones as it can feel a bit unstable back on the heels. The UFO shines brightest for me at faster daily training to tempo paces and, agreeing with Peter for medium length runs.

I think a slightly firmer lower midsole layer could improve its versatility. At $200 they are on the pricey side but not out of line with direct competitors such as the Megablast and Superblast. There are lower priced direct competitors such as the EVO SL and TYR Maverick-V1 but neither has the more  premium upper of the UFO.

RAD's debut shoe is for sure an “eye opener”, and on many levels from of courseits looks to its 5 Smiles ride.

Sam's Score: 9.31 /10 😊😊😊😊😊

Ride (50%): 9.4 Supreme fun but could be a bit more stable

Fit (30%): 9.2 if the ride stays as soft as currently a bit more midfoot support would improve

Value (15%): 9 Ok for a small brand's debut given premium materials

Style (5%): 10 Homerun!



5 Comparisons



TYR Maverick-V1 (RTR Review)

Sam: The $150 Maverick is another out of left field eye opener from a brand not known for running shoes before. Considerably lighter and slightly higher stack height at 7.7 oz / 218g US 8.5  and with a 44/36 stack height, the Maverick is somewhat firmer and more stable than the UFO. It is more practical over a wider range of paces and run types if more “serious” riding and traditional and less fun. It's simple upper is just fine with superior foot hold compared to the UFO but is rougher in feel if still comfortable and adequate with, as with the Azura and EVO SL below a tradeoff in part to keep the price low for such a shoe, $50 less than the UFO.

RAD UFO Vs. Adizero EVO SL (RTR Review)

Peter: These are two of my favorite shoes. The Asics Megablast is in there too. The Adidas EVO SL has a small plate at the midfoot and feels a little more like a standard running shoe. The Adidas feels a little faster and is firmer on the run. On longer runs I prefer Adidas, but  for any daily short run the RAD UFO is right there in the mix. Such a fun shoe. 

Sam: While there foams are similar in soft energetic feel, the inclusion of the small midfoot plate in the adidas relegates them to fast paces only for me as I find them awkward and over rigid otherwise. The adidas is a very reasonable $150 but has a not so secure upper which only accentuates the imbalance between soft foam and rigid midfoot for me. 

RAD UFO Vs. Adizero EVO SL ATR (RTR Review)

The EVO SL ATR variant (on road) with its fuller outsole with mini 1.5 Continental rubber lugs and clearly more secure upper solves my issues with the EVO SL. It delivers a more balanced ride, more stability and support, and a wider pace (and terrain) range than the UFO but with a more serious and firmer (and heavier weight) personality. Not a “fun” shoe as the UFO is but a more practical one at a lower price point of $160 so the ATR is overall a better value for a shoe that can range to slippery conditions and light trails as well as road.

RAD UFO Vs. ASICS Megablast (RTR Review)

Peter: Both of these are non-plated super shoes. I prefer the upper of the RAD as I get a little bit of rubbing against the outside of my foot in the Megablast. The Megablast may be a little more efficient, but the RAD is, well, more rad. It's bouncier and a fun change from other running shoes. Both of these are fantastic. You can't go wrong with either. 



Saucony Endoprhin Azura (RTR Review)

Sam: The early 2026 releasing Azura is lighter at 7.72 oz/ 219g US8.5 sitting on a 2mm lower stack height. It's PWRRUN Pb expanded beads PEBA foam is somewhat firmer, more stable and more on the responsive side than the UFO soft bouncy spring. Also with a CPU outsole, its front toe off is almost plate like and more responsive. Its upper is not as plushy, soft or thin but is more supportive. At $150 the Azura is a better value with a more traditional feeling ride, dare I say more “practical”, but is not nearly as much pure fun as the UFO.

The UFO researcher Jacques Vallée has recently made startling remarks regarding the communication with extra-terrestrial entities in a recent interview. 

While talking in the podcast titled Weaponized hosted by Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp,  Vallée shared the details of a classified US program in which officials interacted with non-human entities 20 years ago.

The government was capable of establishing “direct, structured communications” with a non-human intelligence through a “very sophisticated process,” conducted on an ongoing basis under controlled laboratory conditions at a secure facility he had never heard publicly referenced, he added. 

“What they described to me, is a very sophisticated process by which we may be able to interact with The Entities,” the UFO expert said in response to a question related to non-human beings. 

When the host asked about the factual nature of the claims in which the US was able to make communication with non-human intelligence, Vallée called the account factual. 

“Yes, Yes, it is factual based on the people I met with,” he added. At the same time, he also noted uncertainty over whether the entity was real or simulated, distinguishing it from cases like the 1945 Trinity crash. 

During the podcast, Vallée also interpreted the 1917 Fatima event as a deep one in the term of testimony as 80,000 people witnessed massive disc, silver thing between them and the sun. 

These claims have taken the internet by the storm and added another layer of mystery in the discussions wrapping around UFOs and aliens.

Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar's visit to Kabul on July 17, 2025, officially paved the way for fast-tracking the Uzbekistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan (UAP) railway project. The signing of the landmark Trilateral Agreement or the Framework Agreement on the Joint Feasibility Study for the Naibabad–Kharlachi railway reflects a significant step in Pakistan's quest for accessing the heartland of Central Asia. This represents a groundbreaking development for Pakistan as it edges closer to consolidating its ‘Vision Central Asia' guided by the pursuit of geo-economics. Moreover, the development is particularly important considering the broader progress on the Trans-Afghan railway.

The UAP Railway Corridor has been widely recognized as a major milestone for regional connectivity in South and Central Asia. The project envisions extending 700 kilometers of railway line starting off from Termaiz (Uzbekistan), passing through Mazar-i-Sharif and Logar in Afghanistan, making its way to Pakistan through the Karlachi border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.[1] The estimated cost of the project is $4.8-7 billion. This direct overland route offers the shortest path connecting Central Asia with the ports of Pakistan, providing CARs strategic access to the Arabian Sea[2].
The route forms the Eastern Corridor of the broader Trans-Afghan Railway whereas the Western Corridor runs from Mazar-e-Sharif (Afghanistan) to the industrial city of Herat, passing through the town of Dilaram (Nimroz) and Kandahar (Afghanistan) to enter Pakistan via Chaman border, finally reaching Pakistani seaports (Karachi and Gwadar). Analysts label it as the “Suez Canal of Asia”. This mega-infrastructural project can virtually transform regional trade by decreasing freight transit time between Uzbekistan and Pakistan by up to five days[3] while slashing transportation costs by about 40 percent. Some conservative estimates predict this railway line to be shipping between 15 to 20 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2030[4], illustrating its considerable geo-economic potential, thus making it into one of the most critical economic arteries linking Central Asia and South Asia.

James Melzer is a Senior Staff Writer at MovieWeb, working remotely from Pennsylvania. He covers the hottest entertainment news, as well as the latest and greatest in streaming from around the world. James has been a regular staple at MovieWeb for almost three years, writing everything from lists and features, to breaking news and movie reviews. 

Before joining MovieWeb, James covered pop culture news for a variety of different media sites, including Manolith and Real TV Addict. He also hosted a successful audio podcast, where he interviewed everyone from authors and artists, to screenwriters and actors.

In the realm of reality TV shows that focus on thrilling adventures and paranormal entities, it doesn't get much better than those hosted by Josh Gates. Serving as a modern day Indiana Jones, the host first rose to prominence thanks to Destination Truth before he eventually went off to do his own thing. The results were Expedition Unknown, as well as a successful spin-off that was launched in 2020 and is already up to its 11th season.

Titled Expedition X, HBO Max has set January 8, 2026, as the release date for Season 11 of the popular paranormal adventure reality series. It will feature the return of Gates as host (and sometimes adventurer) along with Phil Torres and Heather Amaro, who took over for Jessica Chobot in Season 8. It comes hot on the heels of Season 10, which wrapped up on October 22 with the episode ""Welcome to the Real Derry,"" which saw Heather and Phil traipse through Bangor, Maine to explore haunted locations from Stephen King's IT.

Premiering back in 2020 right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Expedition X quickly became a favorite of fans thanks to the show's thrilling adventures that took Phil and Jessica everywhere from the infamous Island of the Dolls in Mexico City, to Bangkok, Thailand, where they investigated a mysterious UFO cult. From time to time, they've been joined by guest investigators including Amy Bruni and Adam Berry from Kindred Spirits, actor/comedian Rhys Darby, and UFO disclosure activist, Luis Elizondo. The official synopsis for Expedition X reads:

""Whether trekking through the remote jungles of Cambodia in search of a legendary ape-man or exploring the secrets of the world's largest cave system right in the United States, the EXPEDITION X team is taking viewers to the stranger side of the unknown.""

 As with previous seasons of Expedition X, there's no shortage of unique locations that Heather and Phil will investigate in Season 11. Thus far, it's been revealed that they'll be heading to North Carolina's Ocracoke Island, La Mancha, Spain, the USS Hornet in San Francisco, and rural Pennsylvania to investigate a legendary and powerful shapeshifting bird. That being said, things are kicking off with a bang as they head to Vulture City, Arizona, along with a very special guest fans of the paranormal will easily recognize:

""In the season premiere, special guest and paranormal investigator Jack Osbourne teams up with Heather Amaro in Vulture City, AZ, a former old west gold mining village that brings new meaning to the term 'ghost town.' With its violent and bloody past, Vulture City is rife with paranormal activity, from phantom voices to shadow figures, poltergeist activity, and even a possessed doll.

""Inside the haunted ruins, Amaro and Osbourne capture bone-chilling activity indicative of the town's horrendous history. But an ancient legend surrounding the land unveils another layer of fear and darkness. Do the vengeful spirits of the town's brutal past still linger, or has something bigger and even more evil taken over, driving them into hiding?""

Look for Expedition X to premiere on Discovery Channel on Jan. 7, 2026, at 9pm ET/PT, and the next day on HBO Max.

The first forms of life on Earth were microbial, preceding the evolution of multicellular life by more than two billion years.

Based on our current understanding of the origin of life, it is likely that the first life forms on any extraterrestrial world would also be microbial. Due to the extreme temperatures, radiation or aridity on most planetary surfaces, such extraterrestrial microbes would most likely dwell in subsurface environments. Earth's subsurface features a wide range of environments, including deep marine sediments, crustal aquifers, rock fracture fluids, hydrocarbon reservoirs, caves and permafrost soils.

These environments are known to host an immense diversity of life forms, predominantly microbes that survive or even thrive under extreme conditions and energy scarcity. Life's ability to endure and possibly evolve in Earth's subsurface lends credence to the possible existence of life beyond our planet and provides a blueprint for the extraterrestrial life forms and biosignatures we might expect.

The exploration of space via extraterrestrial samples analysed on Earth, in situ extraterrestrial analyses, and remote sensing continue to advance our search for and understanding of potential biosignatures on other planetary bodies. But by investigating Earth's deep, dark and isolated ecosystems, we not only broaden our understanding of life's adaptability but also refine our strategies and technologies for detecting life on other planets and moons.

Subsurface exploration is not just a frontier of Earth science—it is a cornerstone of astrobiology and in the pursuit of understanding the multitude of processes that could create and sustain life anywhere.

In this opinion article, we discuss the latest highlights in subsurface research and technology, how Earth's subsurface environments serve as models for potential environments on other planetary bodies, why insights into subsurface microbiomes inform the search for life elsewhere, and which technologies and developments will advance the field in the future.

After over 15 years, director Steven Spielberg is finally getting back into the world of alien invaders. Sure, as a producer, Spielberg has continued to attach his name to shows like Falling Skies and films like Super 8, but as far as his own, personal directorial projects are concerned, it's been a hot minute since he tackled UFOs and little green men. But with the release of the first teaser for his 2026 film Disclosure Day, we couldn't be more excited to see him back in the sci-fi business.

Spielberg has long been known for his love of alien-related material. That's why he produced the abduction-based Taken miniseries back in the early 2000s, as well as the Transformers franchise soon after. In fact, the filmmaker's directorial debut was a film called Firelight, which has never been officially released to the public. The nearly two-and-a-half-hour feature dealt with an alien invasion as flying saucers terrorized a small town. But Spielberg has grown immensely as a filmmaker since then, and as we wait patiently to see what he does with Disclosure Day, here are the rest of his alien-movies ranked.

The long-anticipated return of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones was quite controversial due to the presence of the alien beings in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Hoping to emulate the B-movies of the 1950s, George Lucas was adamant that the titular artifact would be connected to extra-terrestrial beings, but Spielberg famously rejected the concept. It took the pair a long time to get the fourth Indiana Jones made because Spielberg wasn't interested in doing another alien invasion flick. But when Lucas suggested that these beings could be interdimensional rather than from the stars, Spielberg relented and gave it a shot.

In truth, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not a bad movie. It's structured quite well and while the alien reveal at the end is a bit odd in comparison to previous installments, it mostly lands. To call Kingdom of the Crystal Skull an ""alien movie"" might be a bit of a stretch, to be sure, but considering how vital the skull is to the entire plot, what else can you call it? Indeed, the whole thing ends with a South American pyramid being transformed into a flying saucer and jumping for another dimension. If that's not an alien picture, we're not quite sure what is.

Another film that is only vaguely ""alien"" in nature, A.I. Artificial Intelligence certainly meets the literal definition of the word. While many viewers have been confused by the ending of the film, particularly due to the elongated, alien-like future robots that David (Haley Joel Osment) encounters, the silicon-based lifeforms are not technically aliens as we traditionally think of them. Yet, the way Spielberg presents them, they are effectually so, having super-mechas take over the world over the course of two-thousand years.

While A.I. Artificial Intelligence began as a Stanley Kubrick production, Spielberg was handed the reins by Kubrick himself, and crafted an underrated presentation of the alien life that exists in the form of AI. While artificial intelligence wasn't then what it is today, the film is eerily prophetic as we inch closer to a world where machines do more than human beings. It's not your traditional extra-terrestrial aliens, but it is quite alien-like in the way these ""Specialists"" are presented.

Over a decade after he first made Firelight, Spielberg's passion project to put together a UFO story was realized in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. After Richard Dreyfuss' Roy Neary (who was originally meant to be played by Steve McQueen) encounters a UFO while working as a lineman in Indiana, he dives head-first into uncovering the truth behind his experience. Meanwhile, a young mother, Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon), witnesses the abduction of her young son, which sets her on an investigation of her own. Together, they ultimately make their way to Devil's Tower in Wyoming, and that's where the true excitement lies.

Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a bit of a slow-burn by today's fast-paced standards, but it's a riveting drama about how alien abduction can drastically change the course of a person's life. Spielberg's first public take on the sci-fi genre, Close Encounters is a powerful film that — along with George Lucas' Star Wars, which also hit theaters earlier that year — helped prove that the B-pictures of the filmmaker's youth had wide appeal. As the director was once quoted as saying, ""I wanted to make it a very accessible story, about the very common, everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life as he once knew it.""

A modernized, American adaptation of H.G. Wells' iconic alien triumph, War of the Worlds is far better than it has any right to be. Stripping the tale of its initial 1890s Southern England setting and transporting the drama to 21st-century New England, Spielberg reignites the fear that many who first heard the Orson Welles' radio drama felt, only now on the big-screen. A blockbuster with incredible performances by Tom Cruise, Tim Robbins, and a young Dakota Fanning, War of the Worlds is all you could ask for in a Spielberg invasion picture.

Although not the first film that will likely come to mind when you think of Spielberg's masterful filmography, War of the Worlds is no dip in quality. If anything, the pure carnage and distress that an actual alien invasion would cause is best seen in a film like this, where the camera sticks with the characters for a street-level view of the apocalyptic horrors. It's no wonder that the director wanted to work with Cruise on this after Minority Report, he's just perfect for the part.

Easily the best of Spielberg's alien flicks, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a magnificent production that speaks to the childlike wonder of science fiction discovery and the power of friendship. If there's one film in Spielberg's filmography that he will always be firmly associated with, it's E.T. — heck, there's a reason that the Amblin Entertainment logo calls back to that iconic moon shot. Whether you love E.T. for John Williams' iconic score, Elliott's (Henry Thomas) simple trust in the titular creature, or the warm feelings of youthful nostalgia, this is one alien movie that will leave you not frightened at the prospect of first-contact, but marveled by it.

After Spielberg tried to follow up Close Encounters with the ultimately unmade Night Skies, the director ultimately turned his eye toward the project that became E.T. With an exceptional screenplay penned by Melissa Mathison and an iconic-looking puppet to play E.T., it has become one of the most beloved movies in all cinema. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is the true culmination of Spielberg's take on alien lifeforms, one that is far more hopeful than anything else.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

CALEB POMEROY is Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science and the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto.

 Why Stronger States Are More Fearful Than Weaker Ones

 Caleb Pomeroy

A basic premise unites most foreign policy thinking: power begets security. Because no global police force can respond in times of trouble, states must accumulate power to ensure their safety. They must build strong militaries to protect their homelands and defend vital international interests. They need to nurture robust economies to fund those militaries and withstand financial pressure. These notions have motivated strategy for centuries, including the policies of the world's two most powerful countries today. U.S. President Donald Trump is pursuing a military buildup and economic self-sufficiency to deter adversaries, a policy his advisers call “peace through strength.” Chinese leader Xi Jinping, meanwhile, is plowing money into the People's Liberation Army and the manufacturing sector to make his country “self-reliant and strong.”

It is true that power can bolster security in purely material terms. But security is a psychological phenomenon, too. Leaders and citizens alike want large militaries in order to feel safe, not simply for their own sakes. Yet almost no psychological research supports the idea that feelings of safety align with objective statistics about material power. In fact, the evidence shows the contrary: power makes people more skeptical of others' intentions and thus heightens anxiety. The strong, it turns out, are far more likely than the weak to skip careful, reasoned analysis when making decisions. Instead, they assess threats from the gut and shoot from the hip. While the weak know they must think critically to navigate their surroundings, the strong imagine they can rely on stereotypes and other mental shortcuts to get by. As a result, the powerful view the world in bleak and oversimplified terms, breeding suspicion and anxiety.

To see whether this psychological finding applies to international relations, I examined how both foreign policy elites and ordinary people think about state power and threat perception. I looked specifically at the thinking of American decision-makers during the Cold War, Russian policymakers before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and contemporary Chinese and American publics. My findings were unambiguous. Stronger countries, like more powerful people, tend to be more insecure than weaker ones. Their leaders and citizens imagine or exaggerate threats. They think impulsively. And they are easy to trigger. As a result, they are more likely to support starting and escalating wars than individuals who feel their state is feeble.

This finding has unfortunate implications. Today, the world is characterized by renewed great-power competition, particularly between the United States and China. Each side is trying to acquire more power than the other, in large part to feel safer. But this strategy is likely to have the opposite of its intended effect. Should Washington grow stronger, it will become more convinced that Beijing is a menace. If Beijing becomes more powerful, it will view Washington's actions in its neighborhood as more threatening. The result could be a vicious cycle: as each country becomes more capable, it will feel more insecure, prompting further military buildups that drive each side's anxiety higher still.

To avoid this outcome, officials in both the United States and China—and, indeed, in any strong country—should try to neutralize the psychological effects of power. That means they should pause before making decisions. They should carefully evaluate all available evidence regarding a potential threat rather than jumping to conclusions. In other words, they should reason as if they run weak governments, not strong ones.

One of the oldest and most dominant ideas in international relations is that power leads to security and weakness to insecurity. This premise anchored Thucydides's analysis of the Peloponnesian War: “The growth of the power of Athens, and the alarm it inspired in Sparta, made war inevitable.” But students of individual psychology have long understood that power may not generate rational views and behaviors. Or as Shakespeare's Henry IV observes, “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.”

Psychologists directly studied the effects of strength in the aftermath of World War II in an effort to understand how supposedly normal individuals could commit acts of great cruelty when they felt powerful. In the infamous 1971 Stanford prison experiment, for example, psychologists assigned study participants to serve either as a hypothetical guard or as a hypothetical prisoner and found that the guards quickly turned abusive. A decade earlier, Stanley Milgram conducted notorious obedience experiments in which participants were instructed to administer electric shocks to another participant. (In reality, that other participant was an actor, simply pretending to get shocked.) Milgram's subjects continued to administer the supposed shocks when told to do so, even in doses that would have been lethal. These controversial studies provided initial indications that power can have corrupting effects on individual behavior—effects so corrupting that they inspired new protocols for research ethics in academia.

In the decades that followed, researchers such as Susan Fiske and Dacher Keltner started testing these intuitions in a rigorous and scientific fashion. Psychologists provided subjects with greater or fewer resources in a laboratory setting and measured their views, observed their interactions in groups, and watched their behaviors. They surveyed and analyzed the views and actions of bosses and subordinates in corporate settings, as well. The findings were striking: a sense of power appeared to activate impulsive and intuitive thinking writ large. People who felt powerful accepted more risk and exhibited more overconfidence, leading to greater financial losses in laboratory games. They were quicker to dehumanize others, engage in hypocrisy, and rely on racial biases when interacting with members of marginalized groups. They were less empathetic and saw others as threatening. In one study, for instance, subjects played a cooperation game involving the division of a communal pot of money. Subjects who were randomly assigned to a powerful ""manager"" position were more likely to view their teammates as untrustworthy and thus more likely to feel that teammates should be punished to deter selfish behavior. The study, the experimenters wrote, suggested that power activates “Hobbesian” thinking marked by a tendency “to distrust others and therefore rely more on deterrence as a punishment motive.”



Fiske, Keltner, and their colleagues, of course, were mostly studying how power affects individual thinking in controlled environments—a far cry from the high-stakes world of foreign policy decision-making. In theory, even the research they did in corporate settings shouldn't neatly apply. States, after all, generally have many institutions and bureaucracies designed to foster deliberation among competing voices. Yet my research found that the psychological literature was in fact highly relevant. Policymakers in powerful states felt more insecure and acted with more aggression than those in weaker ones. One might hope that these effects would be tempered in democracies, where public opinion could constrain a leader's worst impulses. But in my surveys of American (and Chinese and Russian) citizens, I found that ordinary people who feel their country is stronger also have higher threat assessments and are more supportive of hawkish policies than those who feel their country is weaker. Democracies are therefore just as vulnerable to this kind of thinking.

In fact, the United States might provide the clearest case study of how an increase in a country's power drives an uptick in fear. At its founding in the 1780s, the country was materially very weak. Its economy was crippled by war debt. It was surrounded by dozens of capable, sovereign Indian nations. The southeastern Choctaws alone possessed a military force ten times as large as the United States' standing army. Even the U.S. founders were unsure whether their fledgling nation could survive. But rather than panic, they assessed the strategic environment carefully and adopted diplomacy as the primary tool of statecraft. President George Washington regularly hosted and honored Indian delegations, just as he did European dignitaries, and paid these nations for land cessions. Dreams of enjoying “full security,” warned Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, were “too visionary to be a rule for national conduct.”

Yet as the United States ascended to hegemony in the Western Hemisphere over the course of the nineteenth century, its calculus shifted. Decision-makers concluded that Indian nations were not potential partners but intolerable threats. They relied more heavily on racialized stereotypes that portrayed Indians as warlike and irrational. The government therefore decided it had no choice but to attack them. In 1890, a religious movement known as the “Ghost Dance” sought to reunite participants with their ancestor's spirits to resist the United States' westward expansion and cultural assimilation. The Lakota people's practice of this dance so concerned U.S. elites that President Benjamin Harrison dispatched the largest mobilization of military force since the American Civil War to Pine Ridge Reservation. The result was the Wounded Knee Massacre. Rather than feeling safer with strength, the United States literally began chasing ghosts.

Some of this aggression was driven by opportunity, not fear. With growing power, Washington could simply acquire more land than when it was weaker. But decision-makers made clear that the expansion was also driven by the perceived threat of Indian nations. “I don't go so far as to think that the only good Indians are the dead Indians,” the future president Theodore Roosevelt infamously remarked in 1886, “but I believe nine out of every ten are, and I shouldn't like to inquire too closely into the case of the tenth.” To quote the historian Ned Blackhawk, U.S. officials felt that their “emergent racial order” was “under constant threat” from Indians in the West.

The end of World War II brought about another massive increase in American power. Before the war, other governments could at least claim to be Washington's equals. But afterward, the United States had no true peer. France, Germany, and Japan had been torn apart. The United Kingdom avoided invasion, but it had suffered heavy casualties and German bombings had damaged its cities and industrial centers. The Soviet Union was closer in stature, but it, too, was exhausted: it suffered around 27 million military and civilian deaths, compared with fewer than 500,000 for the United States, and a number of its major cities were left devastated by German advances. Its economy and military paled in comparison with the United States's industrial might, blue-water navy, and network of overseas bases.

The United States, however, did not act as if it were the most secure country in the world. Instead, leaders in Washington fretted more than they had before the war. From almost the moment Japan surrendered, U.S. officials began worrying about communist governments. In 1950, the Departments of State and Defense drafted NSC-68, a memorandum that called for a massive increase in peacetime defense spending and the development of the hydrogen bomb. “In the ascendancy of their strength,” the document declared, the United States and its citizens “stand in their deepest peril.”

President Harry Truman quickly made the memo the lodestar of American Cold War strategy. Less than three months after its release, Truman had U.S. troops flood the Korean Peninsula in response to North Korea's invasion of its southern neighbor. Doing so was hardly a security imperative for Washington; the fight was a civil war. But primed for suspicion, American officials interpreted the North's invasion as an attempt by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to start a chain reaction that would transform government after government into communist regimes (or what policymakers would later call “domino theory”), culminating in a world war aimed at the United States. “If South Korea was allowed to fall,” reflected Truman, “communist leaders would be emboldened to override nations closer to our own shores. . . . If this was allowed to go unchallenged it would mean a third world war.” The far weaker British, by contrast, saw things more clearly. In Washington, “there are too many Puritan avenging angels” who want “to get on with punishing the guilty,” the British ambassador to the United States wrote in 1950. The American invasion, in other words, was an act of U.S. aggression—not one of self-defense. The Canadians, who were even weaker, went further in questioning Washington's response. The most urgent threat to international security, they assessed, was not Stalin, but rather an American overreaction in Korea.



When the Soviet Union collapsed, bringing an end to the Cold War, the United States' power became even more unrivaled. It was no longer merely the world's most powerful country. It was the first uncontested global superpower in human history. But even this lofty status failed to ease U.S. fears. “We have slain a large dragon, but we live now in a jungle filled with a bewildering variety of poisonous snakes. And in many ways, the dragon was easier to keep track of,” James Woolsey, the soon-to-be director of the CIA, declared in his 1993 Senate confirmation hearing. Other foreign policy officials issued similar assessments. And as with Korea (and later, Vietnam), they acted on them. A full quarter of all of the United States' military interventions have taken place in the post–Cold War era.

As in the nineteenth century, these adventures resulted in part from Washington's substantial capabilities. A country that can deploy special operations forces around the world in 30 minutes and launch a full-scale ground invasion that topples regimes within days is more willing to start wars than one that can't. The powerful do as they wish.

But these actions are also the unmistakable product of rising anxiety—specifically, the fear of what might result from inaction. Consider the invasion of Iraq. The country's leader, Saddam Hussein, posed no threat to the United States. Washington's intelligence reports suggested that he lacked weapons of mass destruction. But that did not assuage the concerns of the George W. Bush administration. In 2002, Condoleezza Rice, then Bush's national security adviser, warned that the costs of awaiting evidence of an Iraqi nuclear capability far outweighed the costs of acting now. “We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud,” she explained. U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld put a finer point on it: “no terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people and the stability of the world than the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.” Bush's thinking was even less reasoned. “I don't spend a lot of time taking polls around the world to tell me what I think is the right way to act,” the president said in the lead-up to the attack. “I've just got to know how I feel.” He was worried about Hussein, and that was enough. The result was innumerable civilian deaths, the radicalization of populations, the production of future terrorists, and a price tag of over $2 trillion.

The United States is hardly the only country whose power has made it feel less secure. Moscow, too, has a lengthy history of power-induced fear. In the 1970s, the Soviet Union enjoyed an advantageous shift in nuclear and conventional capabilities relative to the United States, which was demobilizing after the Vietnam War. In response, it began to worry more about American influence in Afghanistan and thus embarked on an incredibly costly invasion of the country. Today, Moscow is no longer a superpower, but it remains both strong and insecure. In fact, a 2020 survey of high-ranking Russian elites and government officials—including people in the armed forces and security agencies—found that officials who felt that Russian power was on the rise were the ones most likely to view Ukraine, the United States, and NATO as threats. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not among those surveyed, but he seems to hold similar views. His decision to invade Ukraine was no doubt motivated in part by irredentism. Yet in speeches and treatises justifying the war, he has repeatedly expressed fear that Washington will use Kyiv to threaten Russian security.

And then there is China. Over the last 50 years, it has pulled off nothing short of an economic miracle. Western exploitation in the nineteenth century, Japanese aggression in the early twentieth century, and various reforms under Mao Zedong in the 1950s and 1960s all left the country materially weak and with good reason to feel threatened. Now, it is the world's second-richest country and in possession of a massive and strong military. Yet China's surge to superpower status over the past half century does not seem to have solved Beijing's fundamental security concerns. The country's leader, Xi Jinping, has purged high-ranking officials from the party apparatus, ordered mass arrests of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region out of fear of domestic terrorism, and even restricted elements of Western culture in the Chinese media to quell perceived U.S. influence.

The world, then, might seem as if it is headed in a very dangerous direction. It will, after all, be hard for the leaders of these various strong countries to become less fearful. But they can make better choices by actively trying to think like the weak—which is to say, deliberately, empathetically, and realistically. It is something that a strong United States, at least, has some experience with. Faced with what he saw as rising Soviet expansionism and an incoherent, costly, and increasingly militarized U.S. foreign policy, President Dwight Eisenhower initiated a top-secret review of grand strategy design in 1953. In this exercise, teams of high-ranking officials studied three foreign policy strategies that varied in levels of aggressiveness. After reviewing their analysis, Eisenhower decided that a milder approach would work well and opted for a more cost-effective strategy of containment rather than a more expensive one of actively and aggressively rolling back Moscow's influence.

Eisenhower's exercise did not require a pricey restructuring of bureaucracies and institutions. It simply entailed careful, deliberative thinking. To avoid dangerous entanglements, strong states should do more of this. Such an exercise, for example, might steer Washington away from its current military buildup in the waters around Venezuela. According to Trump, striking boats, seizing oil tankers, and threatening to attack Caracas are all necessary to stop the flow of illegal fentanyl into the United States. But this is based on faulty reasoning. Fentanyl is perhaps the primary cause of American overdose deaths, yet there is no evidence that Venezuela produces fentanyl at any significant level. These operations thus do not bolster U.S. security. Instead, they risk starting a major new conflict that would consume massive amounts of American resources, easily pushing spending beyond what the recently passed, nearly $1 trillion defense budget provides for. And that enormous budget is itself unlikely to bring Washington a sense of peace. To people across party lines, the dollars devoted to the Pentagon are meant to shore up U.S. security. But the psychological math is perverse.

None of this means that governments shouldn't make investments in their armed forces. It certainly doesn't mean that they should abandon efforts to expand their economies. But it does mean that leaders and analysts must abandon the idea that in foreign affairs, power reduces insecurity.

BRUSSELS, December 24. /TASS/. Anders Vistisen, a member of the European Parliament from the Danish People's Party, believes that US President Donald Trump can take control of Greenland without 'firing a shot,' using economic methods.

""The U.S. can gain control of Greenland without firing a shot - through investment, economic dependence and security-policy realities,"" he told Politico Europe.

The member of the European Parliament also noted that Denmark ""cannot defend Greenland alone,"" but he suggested that any military invasion would be ""political suicide"" for Washington. According to him, talk of Greenland's independence can turn the island into ""an Arctic Puerto Rico.""

On December 22, the Danish Foreign Ministry summoned US Ambassador to Denmark Ken Howery in connection with Trump's appointment of Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as the country's special envoy to Greenland. According to the US leader, the governor ""understands how essential Greenland is to our national security, and will strongly advance our country's interests for the safety.""

On March 13, Trump stated that the United States would annex Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark. On March 4, he said he would approve of the island's people's decision to join the United States. The US leader has repeatedly said that Greenland should become a part of the United States. He threatened to impose high tariffs on Denmark if it did not give up the island. Even during his first term, Trump offered to buy Greenland. Denmark and Greenland rejected the idea.

Greenland is an autonomous region of Denmark. In 1951, Washington and Copenhagen, in addition to their allied commitments to NATO, signed the Greenland Defense Treaty. According to it, the United States has committed to defending the island from aggression.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

More than a year after the storm ripped apart families and farms, growers are bullish about strength of their industry

Christmas tree farmers in western North Carolina are still rebuilding from last year's devastating Hurricane Helene, but growers are optimistic about business and the overall strength of their industry in the region.

“There's still a lot of recovery that needs to happen, but we're in much better shape than we were this time last year … sales are good,” Kevin Gray, owner of Hickory Creek Farm Christmas Trees in Greensboro, said earlier this month, while the buying season was in full swing.

North Carolina is the nation's second-largest Christmas tree producer, harvesting about 4m trees, mainly Fraser firs, annually, most grown in the western part of the state. As people all over the nation thrill to the twinkling lights and accumulating gifts under the boughs this festive season, few who buy a real tree may spare a thought for where it came from.

In October, 2024, Helene tore through the region, killing at least 95 people and causing widespread damage to homes, farms, roads, land and infrastructure. Officials estimated that the storm, at one stage a category 4, caused about $125m in losses of ornamental nurseries and Christmas trees alone.

A year later, while full recovery for some farms is still distant, many growers said their sales before the holidays were lively.

At Avery Farms, a 200-year-old family operation in Avery county, Helene ripped out about 80,000 of their Christmas trees, wrecked fields, equipment and buildings, and destroyed the home of manager Graham Avery's parents.

That fall, the family sold what they could to the customers: a limited number of trees, wreaths, boughs and improvised tabletop trees fashioned from salvaged tops.

This year has been focused on rebuilding. Avery's parents' home was rebuilt with help from “lots of people donating their time” and they moved back in just a month ago. The family bulldozed damaged fields, fertilized the soil and planted about 20,000 trees this spring, a long-term project to regain pre-Helene output, as Christmas trees take from six to 12 years to mature.

“It's going to be a while, but that's the whole game that we play doing Christmas trees. It's a very long-term investment,” Avery said. “We are set up to do it, and we will continue to do it.”

Even with significantly reduced inventory, Avery said, this season's sales have been “very, very good” and the farm has doubled its wreath output and is shipping them nationwide.

“With what inventory we do have, we've had no issue selling,” Avery said.

Jennifer Greene, executive director of the North Carolina Christmas Tree Association, said the industry remained strong despite the devastation to some growers.

The 2025 growing season also offered some relief. “We had a great spring with April rainfall,” she said, noting the trees “have actually had a great growing season”.

“We're in the middle of a great season, we're happy to not have a hurricane and we've had good weather for harvest. So things are looking good,” she said.

Dee Clark, owner of Christmas Corner and C&G Nursery in Avery county, shared similar optimism, despite retail sales plummeting last year when a road washed out and remained closed until summer.

“Early indications look promising,” Clark, 63, said, earlier in December. He added that his son had developed social-marketing efforts to boost sales.

A third-generation grower, Clark said Helene destroyed much of his farm's infrastructure and damaged roads and culverts, triggering landslides that cost about 1,000 trees and stripped vital nutrients from the soil.

Clark, who said the storm “almost put us out of business”, has focused on repairs, replanting and restoring the land. He expects it will take years to replace lost trees, and knows many growers face a similar, long climb. But, he said: “The Christmas tree industry in western North Carolina as a whole is probably the best shape it's ever been in as far as the supply of trees right now.”

At Cartner's Christmas Tree Farm, owner Sam Cartner said he felt fortunate no lives or homes were lost in the flooding, but said landslides destroyed up to 10,000 trees.

“We probably won't ever be able to plant those areas back, because the topsoil slid off,” he said. “We'll have to find other areas to plant if we recover that number of trees.”

The Cartners worked quickly, and made enough repairs to have a “relatively normal harvest” last fall, he said, despite the major damage to roads, bridges and culverts on the property.

One of their trees was even selected last year to be displayed at the White House.

For many in the region, the Cartners' White House tree became a symbol of resilience. Jamie Bookwalter, an extension specialist at North Carolina State University, recalled attending its send-off ceremony in Avery county.

“That Christmas tree represented a lot of people problem-solving,” she said, “which I think is what this area of the country is kind of known for: resiliency, problem-solving and self-reliance.”

Will Kohlway IV, a Christmas tree production extension specialist also at NC State, said the Cartners' ability to harvest and deliver the tree, despite everything the region had dealt with, exemplified “the spirit of the mountains and also Christmas tree growers”.

They called the tree “Tremendous”, he said, because “it was really a tremendous effort”.

Bookwalter visited some of the hardest-hit farms immediately following the storm. “Helene was a terrible event, but farming in general is just becoming more difficult as temperatures become more unpredictable and we get wetter periods – the wetter periods are wetter, the drier periods are drier,” she said. “We're all just kind of learning day by day.”

She said researchers are working to develop trees more resilient to the changing climate.

Kohlway said that the public's support for the region's growers and farms had been “humbling”.

“Buying a tree supports a North Carolina farmer,” he said. Even if purchased at a big-box store, the tree, Bookwalter added, “really represents probably a pretty small farmer”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Editor's note: This story has been updated with the confirmation from the Ukrainian military.

A synthetic rubber factory in Russia's Tula Oblast was set ablaze overnight on Dec. 24 following an attack, Ukraine's General Staff reported.

The plant, located in the town of Efremov, produces dual-use synthetic rubber and polymers used in military vehicle tires, armored personnel carriers, and other weapons-related applications, making it a strategically significant target.

The General Staff said explosions and a large-scale fire were reported at the site. 

According to the Ukrainian military, explosions were reported at the site, followed by a large-scale fire. Local residents shared images and accounts on social media showing flames engulfing the Efremov synthetic rubber plant.

Tula Oblast Governor Alexei Dyumin confirmed that an attack caused a fire at ""one of the enterprises"" in the region but did not identify the facility or provide information on damage or casualties.

Russia's Defense Ministry said air defenses shot down 172 Ukrainian drones overnight across several regions, without specifying whether the Tula incident was linked to the reported drone attacks.

Earlier this year, the pro-Ukrainian Atesh partisan group claimed responsibility for an attack on a communications tower at an air defense factory in the city of Tula.

""The role of unmanned systems on the battlefield is growing, and therefore the production of innovative instruments of war is our number one priority,"" Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said.

Ukrainian intelligence sources said the officers had previously taken part in Russia's war against Ukraine and were implicated in the abuse of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs).

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would be willing to withdraw troops from the country's eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end Russia's war, if Moscow also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarized zone monitored by international forces.

The proposal offered another potential compromise on control of the Donbas region, which has been a major sticking point in peace negotiations.

Zelensky said the U.S. proposed the creation of a “free economic zone,” which he said should be demilitarized. But it was unclear what that idea would mean for governance or development of the region.

A similar arrangement could be possible for the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently under Russian control, Zelensky said. He said any peace plan would need to be put to a referendum.

Zelensky spoke to reporters Tuesday to describe an overarching 20-point plan that negotiators from Ukraine and the U.S. hammered out in Florida in recent days, though he said many details are still being discussed.

Russia has given no indication that it will agree to any kind of withdrawal from land it has seized. In fact, Moscow has insisted that Ukraine relinquish the remaining territory it still holds in the Donbas – an ultimatum that Ukraine has rejected. Russia has captured most of Luhansk and about 70 per cent of Donetsk – the two areas that make up the Donbas.

Asked about the plan, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Moscow would decide its position based on information received by Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met with U.S. envoys in Florida over the weekend. Peskov declined to share further details.

U.S. intelligence shows Putin's territorial ambitions in Ukraine remain unchanged, sources say

American negotiators have engaged in a series of talks with Ukraine and Russia separately since U.S. President Donald Trump presented a plan to end the war last month – a proposal widely seen as favouring Moscow, which invaded its neighbour nearly four years ago. Since then, Ukraine and its allies in Europe have worked to pull the plan closer to Kyiv's position.

Zelensky said figuring out control of the Donbas region is “the most difficult point.”

Meanwhile, on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the U.S. has proposed creating a consortium with Ukraine and Russia, in which each party would have an equal stake.

Zelensky countered with a proposal for a joint venture between the U.S. and Ukraine, in which the Americans would be able to decide how to distribute their share, including giving some of it to Russia.

Zelensky acknowledged that the U.S. has not yet accepted Ukraine's counter-proposals.

“But we have significantly brought most of the positions closer together,” Zelensky said. “In principle, all other consensus in this agreement has been found between us and them.”

Creating the demilitarized economic zone in the Donbas would require difficult discussions on how far troops would be required to move back and where international forces would be stationed, Zelensky said, adding that it should discussed at the leaders level.

The working U.S.-Ukraine draft also proposes that Russian forces withdraw from the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy and Kharkiv regions. Zelensky envisions that international forces could be located along certain points of the contact line within the zone to monitor the implementation of the agreement.

They left India for jobs in Russia, then disappeared in the fog of war

Ukraine also proposes that the occupied city of Enerhodar, which is the closest city to the Zaporizhzhia power plant, become a demilitarized free economic zone, Zelensky said.

This point required 15 hours of discussions with the U.S., he said, and no agreement was reached.

For now, the U.S. proposes that the plant be jointly operated by Ukraine, the U.S. and Russia, with each side controlling a 33% stake in the enterprise – a plan Zelensky called “not entirely realistic.”

“How can you have joint commerce with the Russians after everything?” he asked.

Ukraine instead suggested that the plant be operated by a joint venture with the U.S. in which the Americans can determine independently how to distribute the energy from their 50% share.

Zelensky said billions in investments are needed to make the plant run again, including restoring the adjacent dam.

The working draft ensures that Ukraine will receive “strong” security guarantees that would require Ukraine's partners to act in the event of renewed Russian aggression. That would mirror NATO's Article 5, which says an armed attack on one member of the alliance is an attack on all.

Zelensky said a separate document with the U.S. will outline these guarantees. It will detail the conditions under which security will be provided, particularly in the event of another Russian assault, and it will establish a mechanism to monitor any ceasefire. The document will be signed with the main agreement to end the war, Zelensky said.

“The mood of the United States of America is that this is an unprecedented step toward Ukraine on their part. They believe that they are giving strong security guarantees,” he said.

The draft contains other elements, including keeping Ukraine's army at 800,000 during peacetime and making Ukraine a member of the European Union by a specific date. Limiting the size of Ukraine's military is a key Russian demand.

Opinion: Ukraine has earned the right to shape its own future. Washington and Moscow are denying it that right

The document also proposes accelerating a free-trade agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. The U.S. wants the same deal with Russia, Zelensky said.

Ukraine would like to receive short-term privileged access to the European market and a robust global development package that would include the creation of a development fund to solicit outside investment in Ukraine's industries.

Other points include raising funds for Ukraine's reconstruction, with the goal of attracting $800 billion through equity, grants, loans and private sector contributions.

The draft proposal also requires Ukraine to hold elections after the signing of the agreement. Zelensky's five-year term was scheduled to end in May 2024, but elections were put off due to Russia's invasion.

Ukraine is also asking that all prisoners taken since 2014 be released at once, and that civilian detainees, political prisoners and children be returned to Ukraine.

In other developments, an explosion in Moscow on Wednesday killed three people, including two police officers, Russian investigators said, days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking general not far away.

An official from Ukraine's military intelligence agency, known as GUR, told the Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation. Another official from the agency said the police officers had taken part in Russia's war in Ukraine, without providing details. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

Apple chief Tim Cook bought shares worth ‍about US$3-million ​in Nike (NKE-N), a ‍move that nearly ​doubled his personal stake in the sportswear maker and signaled confidence in the turnaround strategy laid out by CEO Elliott Hill.

Shares of the company closed 4.6% higher on Wednesday after a regulatory filing showed that Cook, who has been on Nike's board since 2005, bought 50,000 shares at $58.97 each.

As of December ⁠22, he held about 105,000 shares, according to the filing released on Tuesday.

It was the largest open market stock purchase for a Nike director or executive and possibly the largest in more than a decade, said Jonathan Komp, analyst at Baird Equity Research.

“(We see) Cook's move as a positive signal ‌for the progress under CEO ‍Elliott Hill and Nike's ‘Win Now' actions,” Komp said.

The purchase comes days after Nike reported ‍weaker quarterly margins and sluggish sales in China, even as ‌CEO Hill tries to revive demand through fresh marketing plans and innovation focused ⁠on running and sports, while phasing out lagging lifestyle brands.

Hill has also attempted to mend Nike's ties ​with wholesalers such as Dicks Sporting Goods to increase visibility among shoppers amid stiff competition from newer brands.

“For Tim Cook to be an inside buyer is a modest positive,” said David Sowerby, portfolio manager at Ancora Advisors. The investment firm said it sold its stake in Nike over a year ago due ​to the “lingering effect of an ineffective CEO,” as well as excess inventory, weak innovation in key categories such as running and loss of market share to competitors.

However, the strategy has strained Nike's margins, which have been declining for over a year, while its efforts to win back its premier position in discount-friendly China appear to be faltering.

Nike's shares have slumped nearly 13% since the company reported results on ⁠December 18, and are on track for the fourth straight year of declines. The stock, ⁠which is one of the worst performers on the blue-chip Dow Jones index, closed at $60 on Wednesday.

Cook has been ‌a lead independent director of Nike since 2016, when co-founder Phil Knight stepped down as its chairman.

Apple CEO “remains extremely close” with Knight, Komp said, adding that he has advised Nike through key strategic decisions, including Hill's appointment last year.

Board director and former Intel CEO Robert Swan also bought about 8,700 shares for about $500,000 this week.

US president Donald Trump continues to ratchet up pressure on Venezuela. There is also a geopolitical element to the conflict. What interests do China and Russia have in the country?

The actions of the US fleet in the Caribbean are increasingly causing alarm. US warships not only have alleged drug boats in their sights; since early December, they have also been targeting oil tankers.

Experts differ in their assessments of Venezuela's role in drug trafficking, but they all agree that oil exports are vitally important to the South American country. Venezuela's economy may be in tatters, but it is sitting on the world's largest known oil reserves, estimated at more than 300 billion barrels.

It can safely be assumed that these mineral resources also play a role in the strategic considerations of the oil-friendly US president, Donald Trump. For his Venezuelan counterpart, Nicolas Maduro, they act as a lubricant for foreign relations.

But the intensification of the US conflict with Venezuela cannot be explained by oil alone. There are numerous other interests at play. As well as the US, the other two great world powers, China and Russia, are pursuing their own aims in the country.

Venezuelan oil recently constituted only 4% of Chinese oil imports, but that share has been increasing. The Reuters news agency quoted two market analysts who estimated that maximum daily import volumes will hit new highs this December.

China is set to import more than 600,000 barrels a day from Venezuela, the majority of its daily production. For China, Venezuela is an important oil source, primarily because it reinforces Beijing's energy independence amid the global tug-of-war over raw materials. Venezuela's Merey oil blend is particularly well-positioned to do this, as the West has sanctioned it.

In turn, a lot of Chinese money flows to Venezuela, including in the form of credits. Caracas is variously estimated to be indebted to Beijing to the tune of between $60 billion and $70 billion.

Venezuela is also a market for Chinese technology. Many of its armaments are Chinese-made, and the telecommunications infrastructure is substantially based on Chinese components.

In September, Maduro presented a new Huawei cellphone at a press conference in Caracas. He announced that the Chinese President Xi Jinping had personally gifted him the ""best phone in the world"" and that American intelligence services couldn't possibly hack it.

Venezuela's authoritarian-nationalist socialism is compatible with China's state ideology. By verbally condemning the US seizure of oil tankers, as it recently did, Xi's government can present itself as an ally. This presumably also serves to keep the United States busy in its own backyard.

For more than a decade now, US presidents have been more focused on the Indo-Pacific region, where China also wants to be the dominant power and is being increasingly aggressive in asserting its claim to Taiwan. It therefore plays into China's hands if the US is forced to devote more attention to the situation in Venezuela or Cuba.

Presumably, it is also advantageous for Russia to increase its influence over allies in Latin America, challenging US supremacy in the region. President Vladimir Putin first received a visit from the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in 2001, after which Russia became Venezuela's largest arms supplier. In 2008, Putin went to war with Georgia; the following year, Chavez supported Putin when Venezuela was one of only a few countries, along with Nicaragua and Nauru, to recognize the independence of the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

After Chavez's death in 2013, Maduro tried to maintain the country's close relationship with Russia. His power was seriously threatened after the election in 2019, when the then-president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaido, declared himself the rightful interim president. Just minutes later, Guaido received the backing of the United States.

Already in his first term in office, Trump had spotted an opportunity to get rid of Maduro. But then Russia sent two military aircraft carrying soldiers and equipment.

""In a way, Moscow saved Maduro,"" Vladimir Rouvinski, a political scientist at Colombia's ICESI University, told DW. ""For the first time since the Cuban missile crisis, the US was compelled to negotiate directly with Russia over a situation in Latin America.""

In the current crisis, though, Rouvinski doesn't think Russia will support Maduro as decisively. So far, support from the Kremlin has been verbal only.

In a post on Truth Social in mid-December, Trump demanded that Venezuela return all the ""Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us."" This could be a reference to expropriations when the Venezuelan oil industry was nationalized in 2007 — not all US companies were compensated. Only Chevron is still active in the country, by special arrangement.

For US companies, oil production in neighboring Guyana is much more lucrative. Venezuela has also laid claim to Guyana's border region of Essequibo. As far as US oil interests are concerned, there are two strong arguments in favor of forcing Maduro from power.

In his first term, Trump significantly extended the sanctions imposed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and initiated a first trial of strength with Maduro. His security advisor at the time, John Bolton, described Venezuela, along with Cuba and Nicaragua, as the ""triangle of terror.""

Bolton was fired by Trump when US support for Juan Guaido's failed to achieve its aim. But Trump still hopes to bring about regime change in Venezuela, and is more determined now than ever.

British police have arrested climate activist Greta Thunberg during a pro-Palestinian protest in central London. The detention, under terrorism legislation, was linked to a placard referencing a banned group.

British police arrested Swedish activist Greta Thunberg on Tuesday during a pro-Palestinian protest in London, according to UK-based campaign group Defend Our Juries.

The group said Thunberg was arrested under the Terrorism Act after holding a sign stating support for prisoners linked to Palestine Action, an organization that the British government has proscribed as a terrorist group.

A spokesperson for the City of London Police said two people had earlier been arrested for throwing red paint on a building.

""A little while later, a 22-year-old woman also attended the scene,"" the police spokesperson said in a statement. ""She has been arrested for displaying an item [in this case ‍a placard] in support of a proscribed organization [in this case Palestine Action] contrary ​to Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.""

Palestinian activist group Prisoners for Palestine said Thunberg had been holding a sign reading ""I support the Palestine Action prisoners. I oppose genocide.""

Several experts, including those commissioned by a UN body, have said that Israel's offensive in Gaza amounts to genocide. Israel vigorously denies the claim.

Thunberg has spoken out previously about the hunger strikers, who are in prison awaiting trial after showing support for Palestine Action. 

Defend Our Juries said the Tuesday protest targeted a building used by an insurance firm that, according to the group, provides services to the British arm of Israeli defense company Elbit Systems.

The group says it exists to highlight the undermining of the legal process for people acting on their conscience. It has, in particular, supported the actions of Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain climate campaigners, as well as those protesting against the proscription of Palestine Action.

In June 2025, the UK Home Office announced plans to designate Palestine Action as a proscribed terrorist organization after activists broke into an airforce base.

The group vandalized two Royal Air Force Airbus A330 MRTT refueling aircraft, spraying red paint into their engines and causing damage that the government said went beyond protest and posed a serious risk to national security.

The terrorist organization designation makes it a criminal offense to support the group, display its symbols, or express support for it in public.

The decision was controversial and has been challenged by civil liberties groups, who argue the group's actions constitute criminal damage rather than terrorism.

            The simple act of crossing the road landed gang member Calen Morris in more trouble with the police.
    


            He had been wearing his leather patch – depicting a horned skull engulfed in red flames, and the gang's name “Head Hunters” spelled in giant gothic lettering – at a private party at the group's clubhouse in late October. He left the event, walked across the road to his car and drove off.
    


            Then, Morris said, his house was raided by the police, who he says seized his patch, arrested him and told his partner to flee with their children. They also raided the clubhouse.
    


            Morris, 40, is accused of wearing his patch while crossing a public road – a breach of a recent law banning displays of gang insignia in New Zealand. But the bike mechanic, from the west of the country's most populous city Auckland, claims his patch was folded under his arms and therefore not on display.
    


            “It meant a lot to me,” said Morris.
    


            His was one of 192 patches seized by police in the first 12 months of the law being in effect.
    


            The legislation was the conservative coalition government's response to growing public concern over a surge in gang membership over the past decade, which brought the country's reported gang population close to outstripping its number of sworn police officers.
    


            A year on, more than 850 charges have been laid for breaches of the prohibition order, and the government is touting the law change as a roaring success – claiming a decrease in serious violent crime.
    


            The patches have all but disappeared from the streets. But the gangs have not.
    


            According to gang members, the banishment of the patches is just optics – they're recruiting new members just as fast as before. And even the police admit the most sinister gang activities are still happening.
    


            Despite tourism campaigns marketing a pristine paradise in the South Pacific, New Zealand has a menacing criminal underbelly. The country's 37 “identified” gangs and their more than 10,000 known members are credited with running the drug trade – primarily dealing methamphetamine, MDMA and cocaine – and driving violent crime.
    


            “It's about a quarter of a percent of our adult population… (committing) about 18% of our serious violent crime,” said Corrie Parnell, an acting assistant commissioner with New Zealand Police.
    


            Between October 2024, just before the insignia ban came into effect, and August this year, the number of victims of violent offending dropped by 23%, figures from a regular justice ministry crime survey showed.
    


            The government and police both chalked that up as a win for the patch ban and associated anti-gang measures that were introduced, but the data doesn't actually spell out what offending is gang-related.
    


            Parnell did admit it was hard to “draw the nexus” between the seizing of a patch and any change in drug crime or other serious offending like child abuse and sexual assault.
    


            Ask a gang member if anything has changed and they will likely just laugh.
    


            “Everyone's still there, nobody's scared of anything. Nobody gives a f**k,” said Morris.
    


            “Serious crime has never been done with a patch on,” said Bronson Edwards, 34, a chapter captain of the Mongrel Mob – one of New Zealand's most storied gangs, whose mostly indigenous Māori members often seek to shock and provoke by bearing Nazi swastikas, and shouting the rallying cry “Sieg Heil.”
    


            While the gangs say it's business as usual, they have generally complied with the patch ban.
    


            That's because it's no small thing for a gang member to lose their patch –– under the lore of the subculture, the patch never really belongs to the individual; it belongs to the gang.
    


            “It's so special and sacred to us,” said Edwards. “If you lose your patch there are consequences: you lose a life with us, you get your head kicked in and go back to normal life.”
    


            Patches, bandanas and even just specific colors are used by gangs globally to state their presence, protect territory and, when conflict erupts, identify who is who. But patches have an elevated status because they're usually earned by new recruits – known as “prospects” – for doing certain, often nefarious, tasks.
    


            The law covers insignia in broad terms – defining them as any sign, symbol or representation commonly associated with a gang – and it applies to anything it is displayed on, be that clothing, cars, or even rings. But the legislation does not outlaw gang colors entirely, as lawmakers could not ban plain-colored clothing.
    


            The punishment for breaching the ban is up to six months in prison, or a maximum fine of $5,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,870). In the first six months of the law being in effect, 22 people were jailed, according to authorities.
    


            Outlaw motorcycle clubs and patched street gangs began to spread their roots into New Zealand society in the 1960s, with the opening of local chapters of overseas gangs, like the US-founded Hells Angels, and the establishment of homegrown gangs like the Mongrel Mob, the Nomads, Black Power (which has no connection to the US civil rights movement), and others.
    


            At a time when indigenous Māori were being uprooted from their ancestral homes as part of an urbanization push, and amid an immigration crackdown on Polynesian people who had moved to New Zealand from the Pacific Islands in search of work and education, gangs – offering fraternity, status and protection – became a draw card for marginalized people.
    


            Over the decades, the gangs have become what many would consider an unwelcome part of New Zealand life. Drive down the motorway in Auckland, and there's a chance your vehicle will be swarmed and overtaken by dozens of bikies out on a weekend ride. Or stop off for a bite to eat in a small town and you might find yourself standing next to a leather-clad gang member ordering a sandwich.
    


            Roughly 10 years ago, new gangs began to set up shop – some founded by serious criminals booted out of Australia under a controversial Canberra policy that deported visa holders who failed a “character” test, even if they had lived most of their lives in Australia.
    


            The newly established gangs quickly began to grow and muscle in on the drug trade –– building connections with notorious overseas organized crime syndicates, like Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, co-founded by notorious narco Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.
    


            Turf wars and renewed rivalries led to gun violence that played out in public, with gang members shot dead in the streets, and the homes of innocent families left riddled with bullet holes after being shot at in the night by gang members who got the wrong address.
    


            Public frustration built and, in 2023, the funeral of a high-profile gang leader became a political flashpoint when two small North Island towns were brought to a standstill, and a state highway closed, as hundreds of patched bikies rolled in to pay their respects.
    


            Assistant commissioner Parnell said reports of communities “feeling overwhelmed by the presence of patched gang members” were not uncommon.
    


            But he said the insignia ban had drawn a line and people were now able to “go about their business and actually feel safe… without being impeded by en masse patched gang members.”
    


            Where farmland meets the Pacific Ocean in the north of Hawke's Bay, on the eastern coast of the North Island, sits the tiny town of Wairoa. One of the few remaining Māori-majority places in New Zealand, it has a population of just 5,000.
    


            Wairoa has been beset by gang violence for decades, including some high-profile gang murders. The Mongrel Mob and Black Power have a strong presence.
    


            The local mayor Craig Little said there has been “a real big turnaround” since the insignia law took effect. “You're not seeing gang members walking down your main street or anywhere really.”
    


            The gang patches, Little said, were intimidating for some members of the public, particularly visitors to the town. “People aren't missing them, that's for sure.”
    


            The mayor estimated that 80% of the town's crime was related to gangs. But he wasn't convinced the patch ban had made any difference to the local crime rate: “I'd say it's the same, but police are saying it's less.”
    


            Edwards, captain of the town's Mongrel Mob chapter, agreed the law has made no real difference to crime. “We're still out there, out on the street, just less visible –– which, you know, (with) the things that I want to do, that works out quite fine,” he said.
    


            The self-described mobster said conflict between the two gangs in the town was still happening, because “some people still needed to learn some lessons.”
    


            Gang membership in New Zealand is more than just about being part of a club. Often, it's a family affair.
    


            “I've grown up around bikes my whole life. All my uncles are Head Hunters, so it's just one of those things,” said Morris. “I didn't think anything of it when I joined the club, I just said: Yo, I'll join… and I prospected for a whole year.”
    


            And it's the depth of those family ties – which span generations – that make gang membership in New Zealand distinct; it's not a phase people just grow out of, but more of a lifetime commitment, often from birth.
    


            “What a lot of people don't realize is we've created our own culture, our own whanau (family), and that aspect is heavy here in the Hawke's Bay,” said Edwards, who is also part of a multi-generational gang family.
    


            “We've got third generation, second generation now,” he said. And because of that, he says he's trying to focus the attention of members of his gang into things like boxing, rather than fighting on the streets. “We're all family and the last thing we want is for our families to be doing life (in prison),” Edwards said.
    


            But blood relatives often end up in rival gangs too.
    


            That is “a real sad thing,” said Little, Wairoa's mayor. “Most of the gang members are related in some way or form, so it seems ridiculous that they are fighting each other.”
    


            For those without family ties, being in a gang is primarily about having a community of “like-minded bros” to ride bikes and have a drink with, according to Morris. Very few gang members get caught up in real crime, he said.
    


            “We've got 300 members and, like, only 5% is in jail for dumb s**t. You know, the majority of us are business owners.”
    


            Morris himself has a prior conviction for unlawful gun possession, but claims he is not involved in the organized crime side of gang life.
    


            Family, community and the claimed sanctity of the patch are not much of a consideration for the government's Police Minister Mark Mitchell, who appears confident he has taught the gangs a lesson.
    


            “They can no longer behave as if they're above the law by taking over our streets, intimidating the public, and making a mockery of our criminal justice system,” he said on the anniversary of the law change.
    


            State agencies in New Zealand keep a national list of patched gang members and prospects, which experts say is easy to get on, but hard to get off.
    


            In early November 2025, there were 10,242 people on the list. That is a large number for a country of just 5.3 million people, and is proportionally higher than previously reported estimates of gang members in Australia and Britain.
    


            The tally has been weaponized by political figures, including Mitchell while he was in opposition, to stoke fear that the country's number of gang members might overtake the number of sworn police officers. The latter figure stood at 10,368 in early November, according to Mitchell's response to a written parliamentary question.
    


            Despite the patch ban and other new anti-gang measures that came into effect, the gang list has grown by more than 700 in the past year.
    


            Parnell, the assistant commissioner, said he expects the number of gang members to come down over the next five years. But the gangs doubt that, saying the ban has had no impact on their pulling power.
    


            “Numbers have grown,” said Edwards, speaking about his Mongrel Mob chapter. “They always will.”
    


            Morris, the Head Hunter, said his gang had recruited more people too.
    


            “There's more of us. Yeah, you can take my patch off me, but it just doesn't change anything,” he said.
    


            Both men are before the courts for breaching the prohibition order.
    


            Edwards was accused of wearing his Mongrel Mob patch in public at a tangi – a Māori funeral – earlier this year. He claims that when police came to his home to seize his patch they showed him “paparazzi-type photos” taken from “over in the bushes” on the day of the tangi. “Those are the lengths that they're going to,” he said.
    


            Similarly, Morris said he was filmed by police standing “down the end of the road” when he was accused of breaching the ban.
    


            When asked if this was usual practice, police said they use both “overt and covert techniques” to gather evidence. Rather than confronting gang members on the spot, they will opt to take videos and photographs in situations when police know they're outnumbered, at events that might become emotionally charged –– like funerals –– or if there is a risk to public safety.
    


            Police now have specialist organized crime teams in most regions, whose officers act like envoys to gangs and hold talks with senior figures, particularly around managing upcoming gang events, like funerals or sports days, that risk becoming a public nuisance. “We will engage a number of weeks out and set out: these are the rules of engagement,” said Parnell. And those rules are pragmatic. Gang members can wear their insignia on private land, but risk arrest as soon as they set foot on public property –– like roads, footpaths or local sports fields.
    


            Some gang members have been arrested for being spotted wearing insignia in public on security camera footage from shops and other videos posted to social media.
    


            With so many members' patches now being seized, gangs are having to rethink the hardline policy of punishing members who lose them. “You don't even have a chance to fight for it because you're not home,” said Edwards, explaining that they're often seized from the homes of gang members after they have been arrested.
    


            “So… we can't really hold brothers accountable.”
    


            Even so, the patches and affiliated gang emblems remain “like a code of honor,” said Morris. And new recruits still want to earn them.
    


            Just days before his arrest for allegedly breaching the patch ban, Morris proudly showed off his new tattoo –– the Head Hunters gang insignia permanently brandished across his back.
    


            “I earned it, like I earned my colors,” said Morris, who likened it to having a customary tattoo. “They tell a story about where we come from, what we've been through and what we achieved.”
    


            Insignia tattoos are a growing trend among gang members, because the new law doesn't stretch that far. “I could go walk up and down the street with no shirt on. It's the same as a patch,” said Morris.
    


            “It's like: Haha, f**k you, you can't take this one.”

An explosion in Moscow on Wednesday killed three people, including two police officers, Russian investigators said, days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking general not far away.

An official from Ukraine's military intelligence, known as GUR, told The Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation. Another official from the agency said the police officers had taken part in Russia's war in Ukraine, without providing details. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

Russian authorities did not comment on who may be behind the attack. Since Moscow invaded nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Kyiv for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them.

On Wednesday, two traffic police officers were approaching a suspicious individual when a device detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement. The officers and another person standing nearby died from their injuries.

The Interior Ministry named the officers as Lt. Ilya Klimanov, 24, who joined the Moscow police in October 2023, and Lt. Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Gorbunov had a wife and a 9-month-old daughter, the statement said.

The blast took place in the same area of the Russian capital where Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb on Monday. Sarvarov was the head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff.




Investigators have said they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind that attack, which was the third such killing of a senior military officer in just over a year. Ukraine has not commented on it.

Ukraine — which is outnumbered by Russia's larger, better equipped military — has frequently tried to change the course of the war by attacking in unexpected ways. 

In August last year, Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region even as they struggled to stem Russian offensives elsewhere. Moscow's troops eventually drove them out, but the incursion diverted Russian military resources and raised Ukrainian morale.

In June, swarms of drones launched from trucks targeted bomber bases across Russia.

Moscow has also blamed assassinations on Ukraine. Just over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military's nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov's assistant also died. Ukraine's security service claimed responsibility for the attack.

In April, Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the General Staff, was killed by an explosive device placed in his car parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow..

Days after Moskalik's killing, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine's foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes” although he didn't mention Moskalik's name.

Meanwhile, Western officials have accused Russia of staging a campaign of disruption and sabotage across Europe as part of an effort to sap support for Ukraine. Moscow has denied the claims.

Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports on the latest developments in the FBI's investigation into a planned New Year's Eve terror attack in Los Angeles on ‘The Story.'

Four individuals have been federally indicted in connection with a foiled New Year's Eve bombing terror plot in Southern California, according to the United States District Court for the Central District of California.

Court documents state that the group planned attacks on multiple businesses and also initiated plans to target Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents following the holiday season.

Prosecutors allege that the individuals are associated with the anti-government extremist group Turtle Island Liberation Front (TILF), whose members glorified terrorism and aimed to do ""as much damage as possible.""

Authorities identified the defendants as Audrey Illeene Carroll, Zachary Aaron Page, Dante James Anthony-Gaffield and Tina Lai in the alleged bombing plot, referred to by the group as ""Operation Midnight Sun."" The members face varying charges including conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, providing and attempting to provide material support to terrorists and possessing unregistered firearms.

Court documents said the four individuals were planning on detonating pipe bombs targeting at least five locations, including technology and logistics businesses, across Southern California. 

Throughout early December 2025, the defendants allegedly took steps to procure bomb-making materials and used encrypted messaging platforms to coordinate the construction and testing of explosive devices.

Authorities reported that Carroll, through encrypted messaging, made alarming statements including ""I identify as a terrorist,"" ""I am a Hamas fangirl"" and had goals of ""completely pulverizing"" buildings. She allegedly denounced peaceful protests while discussing fantasies of ambushing law enforcement agents.

The terror plot was reportedly foiled on Dec. 12, when the defendants traveled to the Mojave Desert to conduct live weapons testing but were abruptly intercepted by members of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team.

Officials said that despite the defendants' efforts to avoid detection — such as wrapping phones in tinfoil to create ""makeshift Faraday bags"" and using apps that automatically delete encrypted messages — law enforcement was able to intercept their plans with the help of informants and undercover agents.

Authorities stated that defendant Carroll had unknowingly shared the group's bombing plans with law enforcement assets. Through this, the FBI reportedly obtained copies of handwritten bombing plans, lists of required bomb-making materials, and information about the group's extremist messaging network.

Defendants Carroll and Page also allegedly discussed plans they intended to carry out after the New Year's Eve bombings, including targeting ICE agents and vehicles in order to intimidate and harm law enforcement, according to court documents.

All four defendants are expected to make their initial appearances in federal court in the Central District of California.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts break down the latest legal clashes over President Donald Trump's deportations of illegal immigrants.

El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele responded to allegations by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about the conditions at the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), the country's maximum-security prison that has received migrants deported from the United States. 

Bukele was responding to a post on X by Clinton that was accompanied by an 11-minute video of the PBS Frontline documentary titled: ""Surviving CECOT."" 

""Curious to learn more about CECOT?"" she wrote. ""Hear Juan, Andry, and Wilmer share firsthand how the Trump administration branded them as gang members without evidence and deported them to the brutal El Salvadoran prison.""

The short documentary tells the story of three Venezuelan men — Juan José Ramos Ramos, Andry Blanco Bonilla and Wilmer Vega Sandia — who were deported by the Trump administration to CECOT, a description of the short film states.

All three men were branded by the U.S. government as Tren de Aragua gang members, which they deny. 

In response, Bukele said his country was ready to cooperate if Clinton thinks people have been tortured in the notorious prison that houses many of the country's gang members and migrants deported from the U.S. 

""We are willing to release our entire prison population (including all gang leaders and all those described as ""political prisoners"") to any country willing to receive them,"" he wrote. ""The only condition is straightforward: it must be everyone.""

""This would also greatly assist journalists and your favorite NGOs, who would then have thousands of former inmates available for interviews, making it far easier to find additional voices critical of the Salvadoran government (or willing to confirm whatever conclusions are already expected),"" added Bukele. ""Surely, if these testimonies reflect a systemic reality, a much larger pool of sources should only reinforce the claim, and many governments should be eager to offer protection.""

Until then, he continued, El Salvador will continue prioritizing the human rights of the millions of Salvadorans who today live free from gang rule,"" Bukele said. 

Bukele solidified his relationship with President Donald Trump by offering to house certain migrants deported from the U.S. at CECOT. The U.S. has deported Venezuelan migrants deemed to be gang members to El Salvador after their home country refused to take them back.

A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to provide due process to a class of Venezuelan migrants deported to El Salvador in March, and gave it two weeks to detail how it will do so – setting up another high-stakes clash between the White House and the federal courts.

I learned what it means to be an orphan long before I learned what it means to be protected by the system that claims to exist for children such as me.

After my mother died, I went to live with a relative from her side of the family. My father had no custody or visitation rights due to his long-standing drug addiction, so there was no fallback parent, no second chance at stability. For the year before I moved in with a relative, I was effectively homeless — sleeping at friends' houses, trying to finish high school without drawing attention to how precarious my life had become. Like many children in crisis, I learned quickly how to be unobtrusive, how to make myself small.

When I finally moved in, my guardian made what sounded like a solemn promise. She told me she would save my Social Security survivor benefits for me — both the benefits from the year I lived with her and the benefits from the year prior, when I had no stable home at all. This was money my mother had earned through a lifetime of work, federal benefits explicitly intended to support her child after her death. I believed her because I needed to believe someone was looking out for me.

Besides, who would steal from an orphan?

At my high school graduation, when Social Security survivor benefits traditionally end, she announced that I was being kicked out onto the streets of New York City, with everything I owned in black trash bags. In the same breath, she told me she would be keeping every dollar of my survivor benefits, more than $35,000 she had collected while acting as my guardian.

I did what children are told to do when someone wrongs them: I went to the authorities. A Social Security agent, who was clearly cognitively impaired, told me the situation appeared to be a case of fraud and theft. Investigators were sent to my guardian's home. For a brief moment, it seemed possible that the system might intervene and protect me. Then, just as suddenly, the case was closed because she refused to answer the door for investigators. I was informed that nothing more could be done.

As a penniless orphan, I had no way to hire an attorney. Even if I had scraped together the money for legal representation, I would likely have ended up with nothing after legal fees. The pursuit of justice evaporated, and I moved on with nothing to my name. The money my mother had earned for me, money meant to help me launch into adulthood without her, was gone forever.

The experience permanently altered how I understood authority, vulnerability, and the ease with which adults can rationalize taking from children who have no ability to fight back. This is why the news coming out of the Department of Health and Human Services this month matters so deeply to me, not merely as policy, but as a long-overdue moral reckoning.

Earlier this month, the Administration for Children and Families sent letters to 39 governors informing them that their states allow child welfare agencies to intercept Social Security survivor benefits earned by foster children and divert those funds to reimburse state care costs. These benefits are tied to a deceased parent's work history and are intended to be, as the letter notes, “the last, or only, financial support deceased parents can provide to their children.” Yet for decades, states have quietly taken them to offset the cost of a child's care, often without notifying the children at all.

Only 11 states currently prohibit this practice. The rest, representing the overwhelming majority of the country, including both blue and red states, permit it as a matter of routine administration.

The letter, signed by ACF Assistant Secretary Alex Adams, is unusually blunt in its moral framing. The practice, it states, is “contrary to the best interests of children,” and the ACF makes clear that it is “working to put an end to this practice” by encouraging states to stop intercepting children's survivor benefits and to conserve them for the child's unmet needs.

Adams told the Washington Examiner that he has seen this issue from every angle, including the one states often use to justify it. “Before running the Department of Health and Welfare in Idaho, I used to run the state budget,” he said. “And it's clear to me this isn't a budget issue, this is a moral issue. I would never try to balance my budget on the backs of orphans.”

During his tenure in Idaho, Adams ended the practice entirely. Survivor benefits were used only for genuine unmet needs, and the remaining balance was preserved for the child's future. The fiscal impact on the state was negligible. The implications for foster youth were profound.

“The amount we collected was, in the grand scheme of things, almost insignificant in the context of the state budget,” Adams explained. “But it means everything to these kids. So many foster youth age out into homelessness or near-homelessness, and the difference between success and failure in life could be these resources.”

The ACF letter echoes this concern, emphasizing that child welfare agencies bear responsibility not only for safeguarding children while they are in state custody, but for “ensuring they are better off when they leave the state's custody than when they entered.” Intercepting a child's only financial asset does the opposite.

Youth who age out of foster care already face dramatically higher rates of homelessness, incarceration, unemployment, and early parenthood than children raised in a home by their family members. Removing survivor benefits from the equation does not merely worsen those odds — it all but guarantees failure.

What is most disturbing is how normalized this practice became and how it was justified when it was implemented. “If you chase down the history on this,” Adams said, “a lot of states started doing it in the early 1990s. They began treating children as a revenue-maximization opportunity to help balance their budgets.” After three decades, the practice has become so embedded in bureaucratic routine that many governors are genuinely unaware it is happening in their states at all.

That ignorance is beginning to lift. Adams says states have already begun responding to ACF's outreach, and with most state legislatures convening in January 2026, he expects swift movement. “We've heard from a number of states, and I anticipate a flurry of activity in the upcoming legislative sessions based on the drumbeat we've been hearing for the past two weeks.”

New Jersey has already announced plans to address the issue, launching state-level efforts to rectify what officials are now openly acknowledging is a grave wrong.

What makes this moment particularly notable is its bipartisan character. Two policy organizations, the America First Policy Institute and the John Marshall Project, have spearheaded the issue at the think-tank level, developing model legislation that states can adopt immediately. Adams used that language as a blueprint in Idaho and is now informing federal guidance to the remaining states.

At a time when much of what Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has done has generated intense controversy, this initiative has managed to cut cleanly across ideological lines.

“Protecting children should be a bipartisan effort,” Adams told the Washington Examiner. “I am committed to working with all 38 states that continue to steal from orphans to ensure our child welfare systems actually serve the best interests of children.”

That word, steal, is not a rhetorical excess. It is an accurate description of what has been happening for decades under the cover of administrative procedure. As the ACF letter makes clear, states may have done this “perhaps unknowingly,” but the harm is no less real for the children who paid the price.

Survivor benefits are often the only inheritance foster youth will ever receive. They are not extra — they are a lifeline.

THE CAMPUS VIBE SHIFT IS AN ILLUSION

Ending this practice will not undo the harm that has already been done. It will not return the money taken from former foster youth who aged out with nothing. However, it will mean that the next child does not begin adulthood empty-handed, because the adults entrusted with their care helped themselves first.

That alone makes this one of the most consequential and plainly moral policy fights unfolding in America today.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A gunman fatally shot a Delaware state trooper Tuesday afternoon at a DMV location in Wilmington.

The shooter was shot and killed by law enforcement after police responded to the active shooter situation around 2 p.m. Tuesday. The shooting, which an on-the-ground reporter described as an “execution-style” attack, occurred two days before Christmas.

The 44-year-old male suspect entered the DMV building as a customer and shot the state trooper who pushed a DMV employee out of the way, Delaware State Police told reporters at a press conference. The deceased trooper's name will not be released until his family has been adequately notified.

Officials thanked the state trooper, along with others, for saving lives up until his death.

“What happened today was an act of pure evil,” Gov. Matt Meyer (D-DE) said. “If not for the heroism of several troopers and other officers, the consequences could have been so much worse. We are deeply grateful to the state and law enforcement officers whose quick action and professionalism helped prevent further harm.”

A second trooper and two women were also injured. The surviving trooper sustained a minor, non-gunshot-related injury. A 40-year-old woman also sustained minor, non-gunshot-related injuries, and a 35-year-old woman was evaluated for shortness of breath following the shooting.

Meyer also thanked first responders, medical professionals, and DMV employees for their efforts in helping to save lives as the tragedy unfolded.

“Please remember tonight that there are Delawareans who are alive because of heroic actions of the deceased trooper and others,” the governor added, “and I ask that all Delawareans join me in keeping the entire Delaware State Police family in their prayers tonight and into the new year.”

The Delaware State Police continued to urge the public to avoid the area through Tuesday night.

Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) and Delaware House Speaker Melissa Minor-Brown were among the lawmakers who responded to the gun violence.

BROWN-MIT SHOOTING SUSPECT KILLED HIMSELF TWO DAYS BEFORE BEING FOUND, AUTOPSY SHOWS

“This officer put on their uniform this morning and went to work to make our community safer,” Coons said. “Now, they will never come home. This is devastating for their family, their fellow officers, and our entire state.”

“We are absolutely horrified and heartbroken by the reports coming out of Wilmington this afternoon,” Minor-Brown said on behalf of the Delaware House Democratic Caucus. “On what should have been a day of togetherness and cheer, people simply running errands and preparing for Christmas were met with a senseless and horrific act of violence.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Not everyone in AI is ready to declare the end of the age of scaling.

""I'm not convinced it's completely over,"" Geoffrey Hinton, the ""Godfather of AI,"" recently told Business Insider, weighing in on one of the hottest debates in AI circles this year.

Hinton is aware that OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever, one of his former students, said last month that the pendulum of AI development is swinging back toward research — and away from companies simply making breakthroughs by scaling, or acquiring more compute and more chips.

""Is the belief really: 'Oh, it's so big, but if you had 100x more, everything would be so different?' It would be different, for sure. But is the belief that if you just 100x the scale, everything would be transformed? I don't think that's true,"" Sutskever said on an episode of the ""Dwarkesh Podcast.""

""So it's back to the age of research again, just with big computers,"" added Sutskever, who is now running his own AI startup.

Hinton said there will always be a need for more data. (Another issue facing scaling is the finite amount of high-quality data.) He predicted that the large chatbots will start generating their own data, as Google DeepMind's AlphaGo and AlphaZero do on a much smaller scale to master the board game Go.

""Nobody's worried about a lack of data because it plays against itself and generates data that way,"" Hinton said of the early program. ""And the equivalent for a language model is when it starts reasoning and saying, 'Look, I believe these things and these things imply that thing, but I don't believe that thing, so I'd better change something somewhere.' And by doing reasoning to check the consistency of his own beliefs, it can generate a lot more data.""

Scaling is at the very core of Big Tech's capex spending spree, a bet based on the belief that by acquiring more compute or training data, AI models will continue to grow smarter and more advanced.

Increasingly, some AI leaders have expressed uncertainty about making their future bets based on their trust in scaling. Alexandr Wang, now head of Meta's superintelligence division, said in 2024 that scaling is ""the biggest question in the industry.""

Yann LeCun, who worked with Hinton on pioneering AI research, has also challenged the extent of the scale doctrine.

""You cannot just assume that more data and more compute means smarter AI,"" LeCun said in April when he was still Meta's chief AI scientist. Like Sutskever, LeCun has since launched his own startup.

Sutskever said scaling has been attractive because it allows companies to make a ""very low-risk way"" bet on AI advancements.

In contrast, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said that scaling laws could ultimately unlock the biggest and most elusive prize in AI: artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

""The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system,"" Hassabis said at the Axios' AI+ Summit in December. ""It could be the entirety of the AGI system.""

In this article

Sanofi said on Wednesday it will buy U.S. biotech Dynavax Technologies for around $2.2 billion (1.9 billion euros) in an agreed deal that will add an adult hepatitis B vaccine and a promising experimental shingles shot to its portfolio.

The acquisition will help the French drugmaker diversify its vaccine business at a time when U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is remaking policy for childhood immunisation, industry analysts say.

The Trump administration has dropped a long-standing universal recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination in infants, drawing an outcry from the medical community, and is considering other changes for 2026.

Shares in Dynavax surged nearly 39% to $15.45 in U.S. trading hours on news of the deal. Sanofi shares eased 0.7%.

""We believe the acquisition makes sense given growing regulatory concerns around vaccines,"" said William Blair analyst Matt Phipps.

""Sanofi is a logical acquisition partner for Dynavax given the company has extensive vaccine capabilities but the portfolio does not have an adult hepatitis B or shingles program.""

Sanofi has been seeking new products to drive revenue growth once its blockbuster asthma drug Dupixent goes off patent in 2031. It bought British private vaccine developer Vicebio for $1.5 billion in July after finalising an up to $9.5 billion deal for Blueprint Medicines.

It will pay $15.50 per Dynavax share, representing a 39% premium over the vaccine maker's closing share price of $11.13 on Tuesday. Phipps said this was below his estimated value for the U.S. biotech's hepatitis B shot, Heplisav-B, of $2.6 billion.

Sanofi will fund the deal using available cash, and expects to close the acquisition in the first quarter of 2026. The deal would not affect its 2025 financial outlook, it added.

Earlier this year, Sanofi and British rival GSK noted pressure in the U.S. flu vaccine market, while Australian biotech CSL delayed plans to spin off its vaccine division citing ""heightened volatility"" and a greater than expected decline in U.S. immunization rates.

Dynavax's Heplisav‑B shot is given to those aged 18 years and older to help prevent infection from the hepatitis B virus. It is administered in two doses, one month apart, compared to other vaccines that are given in three doses over six months.

The shot generated $90 million in sales in the third quarter of 2025. Analysts expect peak annual sales of $609 million in the U.S.

The deal will also add an experimental shingles vaccine to Sanofi's existing products that include flu and polio shots as well as the antibody therapy Beyfortus for the respiratory syncytial virus.

J.P. Morgan analysts said Dynavax's experimental shot, Z-1018, could boost revenues beyond 2030 for Sanofi, if early data on its safety and effectiveness is replicated in larger trials.

It could take a share in the shingles market, where GSK's top-selling Shingrix is on track to generate sales of 4 billion euros this year, the analysts added.

In August, Dynavax said its experimental shot generated a similar immune response as Shingrix, while showing a better safety profile, in a study of 92 people aged 50 to 69 years.

Separately, Sanofi said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had declined to approve its experimental drug tolebrutinib to slow disability progression in patients with a form of multiple sclerosis.

Houman Ashrafian, Sanofi's head of research and development, said the news came as a surprise to the company, which had previously been told that the FDA review process would continue into the first quarter of 2026.

""Today's FDA decision is a significant and meaningful change in direction from the feedback the agency previously provided to Sanofi. We are very disappointed by the FDA's action,"" Ashrafian said in a press release.

The decision adds to a year of data from Sanofi's experimental drugs for eczema and smoker's lung that disappointed investors. Sanofi's shares have largely underperformed the broader European sector index.

In 2017, Thomas Kelly graduated from medical school and finally became a doctor — a career he had dreamt about as a kid and spent years working towards. But once he started practicing, Kelly realized that the job was different from what he'd imagined. 

""My time as a doctor [was] very constrained. I only get 10 minutes for the patient,"" he told CNBC Make It. ""I was finding I had, you know, 100 patients to see in a day, and [was] always in a rush and always coordinating 700 tests and a million tasks.""

""In a perfect world ... I would spend as much time with [patients] as they need ...  I would understand their family, I would remember them deeply, and then I would check in on them regularly,"" he said. However, the reality is that, like many other clinicians, he faced ""incredible burnout"" working in the field. 

Inspired to tackle this problem, Kelly created an AI tool that helps transcribe medical visits, generates clinical notes and more, with the goal of lessening the load on doctors and clinicians. 

Now, the 33-year-old is the co-founder and CEO of Heidi, an AI medical scribe. The company announced its $65 million Series B round in October, valuing the company at $465 million.

Growing up in Melbourne, Australia, Kelly was inspired by his primary care doctor to pursue medicine. 

""I just loved my primary care doctor ... He was like, the pinnacle of using your intelligence and knowledge for good,"" said Kelly. ""He always had an amazing plan. He was very warm, great bedside manner, but also, just incredibly sharp and intelligent always.""

That experience stayed with him. During university, he explored other interests such as math and computer science before ultimately deciding to go into medicine. In 2013, he enrolled into the University of Melbourne where he began medical school.

While studying medicine, Kelly also started a side hustle where he posted educational videos on YouTube and tutored students interested in getting into medicine. 

To his surprise, the videos began to attract many students, more than he could handle at the time, and what started as a hobby steadily grew into a small business. To better manage his time during his tutoring business, Kelly began experimenting with building out artificial intelligence tools. 

""The first AI product I ever tried to build was an interview tutor that people could practice with,"" said Kelly. This tool, called ""Oscar"" allowed students to practice conversations with a medical interviewer, and by 2020, about 20,000 students were using it, he added.

""That was the seed that grew into Heidi,"" he said.

As Oscar improved, Kelly began to notice its broader potential. ""There was no [single] lightbulb moment,"" Kelly said, however, he realized that if an AI tool could understand a conversation between a student and a medical examiner, it could do the same for a patient and a doctor. 

""You could then create clinical notes. You could do differential diagnosis, potentially. You could complete tasks,"" he said. ""That is the root [of] medicine. It's a very advanced, very technical, deep, complicated conversation, but it's still a conversation."" 

By 2021, Kelly was faced with a big decision: go all-in on his medical career and begin vascular surgery training or take a career break and try to build out his AI tool to help serve not just medical students but also clinicians and doctors. 

""I took the leap,"" said Kelly. ""[I thought] I'll regret it forever if I don't take this chance. How many surgical trainees are good enough in math and have had business experience and can build this product? I think not many."" 

""Maybe it was hubris, but I thought if anyone can start this company, it would be me, and let's try and see what happens,"" he said. 

So in 2021, Kelly officially left his medical career behind and went all-in on building Heidi. Today, the tool assists in helping doctors offload some administrative tasks such as creating documentation, clinical notes and more.

Heidi has grown into a strong business and has attracted nearly $100 million in funding. 

""At some point I just [did the] introspection ... if you're sitting in an aged care home and your family's around you, what are the things you're going to regret? And for me, it was, I definitely would have regretted not having tried,"" said Kelly.

(KRON) – Grubhub users have reported receiving official-looking scam emails and app notifications encouraging recipients to send bitcoin to receive rewards as part of a limited-time holiday promotion, raising concerns that the company may have been hacked.

The first email, sent Tuesday evening, promised that Grubhub would 10x any bitcoin sent to a specific wallet address contained in the email as part of a ‘Holiday Crypto Promotion'.

“For example, if you send $1,000, we'll send back $10,000”, the email stated. 

A follow up email, sent less than an hour later, included recipients names, wished them a happy holidays and urged there were only '30 minutes' left in the promotion.

The emails were sent from the addresses crypto-promotion@b.grubhub.com and merry-christmas@b.grubhub.com. 

For those who received the messages to a Gmail account, the emails were ‘verified' with a blue checkmark. According to Google's website  the checkmark means “the sender has verified that they own the email address and brand logo.”

The scam emails do appear to originate from a valid Grubhub email domain. KRON4 reviewed recent official Grubhub promotional emails that were sent from the same domain (b.grubhub.com) but with a different username.

In addition to the two emails, some users on X have also reported receiving push alerts on the Grubhub merchant app with an identical, too-good-to-be-true offer, urging users to send bitcoin. 

It appears some users may have fallen for the scam. 

KRON4 reviewed transactions associated with the bitcoin wallet account contained in the email. Since 8:42 p.m. (the time of the first email), the wallet has received multiple deposits totaling $4,207.07 as of 11:26 p.m. 

The transactions ranged in size; the smallest was 50 cents, the largest was nearly $1,000.

KRON4 has reached out to Grubhub to ask if the scam email is related to any breach of user data. 

Earlier this year Grubhub reported a “security incident” that allowed “unauthorized access” to the contact information for an unknown number of customers and drivers. It is not clear if Tuesday's scam emails and notifications are related to the February incident.

The scam email received by some Grubhub users appears to be a play off of a common cryptocurrency ‘investment scam' warned about on the Federal Trade Commission Consumer Advice website, where scammers will promise free cash or cryptocurrency through an unsolicited email.

If you fall victim to a crypto-related scam, the FBI website recommends you immediately file a report online at the Internet Crime Complaint Center.

Dogecoin slipped under the $0.13 level Tuesday as heavy spot selling coincided with a sharp jump in derivatives activity, suggesting traders are positioning for wider swings rather than an immediate rebound.

BitMEX reported Dogecoin futures volume surging 53,000% to $260 million as traders ramped up exposure into the move, a sign that volatility expectations are rising even as spot price weakens. The burst in derivatives turnover came alongside a heavy spot selloff that pushed DOGE through the $0.13 psychological floor, keeping the meme-coin complex under pressure while broader crypto markets remained uneven.

The rise in futures activity also comes as traders continue to use meme coins as high-beta expressions of sentiment, making DOGE more sensitive to positioning shifts and liquidity pockets than many large-cap tokens. That dynamic tends to amplify moves once key levels break, particularly around round-number supports like $0.13.

DOGE broke below $0.1300 after sellers pressed the market during U.S. hours, with the key confirmation coming at 16:00 on Dec. 23 when volume hit 639 million tokens, about 101% above the session average. That spike marked a clear change in flow: buyers that had previously defended $0.13 stepped back, and the level flipped from support into overhead supply.

On the intraday chart, selling picked up again from around 01:41, with price slicing through interim supports at $0.1295 and $0.1292. The structure now resembles a descending channel, with DOGE leaning toward the lower boundary as it trades below short-term moving averages. That typically keeps rallies shallow until the market can reclaim the broken pivot.

$0.13 is now the level that matters. If DOGE can reclaim and hold it, the move looks more like a flush-and-reset and could trigger a short-covering bounce back toward $0.1320. If it fails to retake $0.13, the market is likely to probe the next demand cluster around $0.1285–$0.1280, where buyers may attempt another defense.

The outsized jump in futures volume suggests traders are bracing for continued volatility rather than a quiet drift. That can cut both ways: it increases the odds of sharp squeezes, but it also means breaks can extend quickly if stops trigger below $0.1290 and liquidity thins.

9/10

Everyone wants immersive, cinematic sound in their living room, but not everyone has the room (or the outlets) for placing rear surround speakers. Folks in smaller apartments or with smaller living rooms or older homes will love the power of the new JBL Bar 500MK2 as much as they love how compact the main bar is.

This is probably the best-sounding smaller soundbar setup I've ever heard—the type of thing that actually benefits from a disc player and my newly eBay'd copy of Casino Royale. If you have a medium-sized budget but really want to jazz up the crappy sound of your massive flatscreen TV, this is a fantastic and reasonably affordable way to do that, and really get bang for your buck.

The best part about the Bar 500MK2 is that it is a small, oblong rectangle that easily fits beneath any modern TV. JBL doesn't make its own screens, so it puts a lot of attention into making sure everything fits between various feet and pedestal designs, and the short, 2-inch high bar squeezes below the bezel (and IR input) of most TVs.

You get the bar itself and a large wireless subwoofer to place anywhere in your room. I find the best way to do this is to plug it in where you have a convenient outlet, then move it around until you like the sound best, but in my acoustically treated review space, that happens to be right next to my TV.

The subwoofer is no joke, at about 13 x 16 inches and 18 pounds, but it's not something you'll need to move once you get it set up, and it contributes massively (pun intended) to the depth and breadth of the Bar 500MK2's sound. With a 10-inch driver, it's more than enough to get to its claimed 40-Hz floor.

Controls on the bar are minimal, with volume and input buttons hidden in the center of the matte black bar, and an included remote that lets you adjust settings. There is a convenient LED screen hidden inside the right front of the grille that tells you in plain English what is going on, which is a nice departure from many brands' variety of lights and colors.

The impressive 750 watts of claimed total output of the speaker and subwoofer really are a bold departure from any built-in TV speakers. In fact, for a small bar, the Bar 500MK2 filled my testing room with some of the most immersive sound I've heard from a bar that doesn't include rear surround speakers.

It has an uncanny ability to bounce sounds around you in a way that makes it feel like they're genuinely coming from the sides or rear, especially when playing Gran Turismo 7 on PlayStation 5 Pro.

Dolby Atmos effects in movies are equally impressive. While watching my 4K Blu-ray copy of Ford Vs. Ferrari, cars zipped by my head in such lifelike detail I sometimes felt like I needed to lean out of the way. When listening to music like Agave Fire Pit's “Goodnight,” I was impressed by how cleanly it is able to render the vocal effects right in the center of the stereo image.

Likewise, folks who are a bit hard of hearing will love JBL's excellent PureVoice 2.0 setting; it can raise dialog based on ambient sound in the scene and the current volume of the bar, helping you actually hear what the characters are saying without subtitles.

Bass response is full and warm, though this isn't the speediest and most punchy I've heard; it does better with the THX intro sound than it does with speedy Outkast kick drums, but that's not actually a huge deal to my ears. I prefer warmer, slower, bolder sub-100-Hz bass from a system this size, rather than the basic punchy low-mids that smaller woofers tend toward.

On the high end, the brightness is never too bright, and there is lots of definition. Rainbrother's “Black Chemicals” showcases just how great it can be with stereo guitars; my aforementioned copy of Casino Royale showcases how awesome it can be with Bond-y bullet ricochets (shimmering, not ear-piercing).

I also love that the bar supports every major casting method: Airplay, Google Cast, Spotify Connect, Tidal Connect, and Roon Ready. Basically, if you want to cast audio to this thing from your phone—any phone—it works flawlessly. It also includes HDR10+ and Dolby Vision pass-through, which makes it easy to pair with disc players or gaming consoles, if you don't have enough inputs on your TV. JBL's One app allows you to adjust bass and treble to your liking, and there is room calibration that helps it adjust settings to your specific listening environment.

As a convenient way to get proper-ish surround sound in medium-sized rooms or smaller, I am not sure there is a bar I prefer more that doesn't come with rear speakers (and the associated hassle). The JBL Bar 500 has it where it counts: It's under $500, it fits below most TVs, and the 10-inch subwoofer really provides the proper amount of bass, even with a smaller bar below the TV itself.

It's a great solution to the problem that many bars have, which is a lack of proper low end, and a weird bump in the low midrange that affects the sound of voices on screen. The JBL bar has none of those problems, and it still fits in the vast majority of rooms. If you want a compact soundbar setup that actually performs well, this is a great place to start.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

New federal restrictions on foreign-made drones, announced this week, promise to boost Washington state as a hub for domestic drone manufacturing — adding thousands or even tens of thousands of jobs in the process.

That's the prediction from Blake Resnick, CEO of Seattle-based Brinc Drones, who says the region's concentration of aerospace talent makes it uniquely positioned to benefit from the shift. He cites the presence of companies including Boeing, Blue Origin, Amazon (with its Prime Air unit) and SpaceX, along with an existing base of aerospace suppliers and technicians. 

“I don't even think you have to look outside of Washington to find all the talent that's needed to build an incredible, globally competitive drone company,” Resnick said in an interview.

The FCC this week added foreign-made drones to its list of equipment deemed national security threats. That blocks new foreign-made drone models from obtaining FCC equipment authorization — effectively preventing the import, marketing, and sale of new models.

The move primarily impacts Chinese giant DJI, which controls roughly 70% of the global drone market. 

It has drawn sharp criticism from drone hobbyists, who worry it will drive up prices and limit access to affordable, high-quality options. The Academy of Model Aeronautics warned that the move will “have huge implications for both the hobbyist and commercial airspace industries moving forward.”

There is a carve-out: existing models that have received prior FCC approval can still be sold, which means that the impact will unfold over an extended period of time. But as current inventory depletes and DJI's product line ages, U.S. manufacturers will need to scale up. 

Resnick said he foresees a need for hundreds of thousands and potentially even millions of square feet of new manufacturing space across the U.S. drone industry.

Washington's aerospace industry employs more than 77,000 workers directly and generates more than $71 billion in total economic activity, according to a July 2024 analysis by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. That gives the region a major edge in drone production.

Resnick knows this first-hand. He relocated Brinc from Las Vegas to Seattle in 2021, drawn by the region's engineering talent pool. The company, which employs about 140 people, develops drones and related technology for police, fire, and emergency response agencies. It closed a $75 million funding round and announced a strategic alliance with Motorola Solutions earlier this year.

Brinc has spent $660,000 on lobbying over the past three years, including advocacy for controls on Chinese-made drones, Forbes reported in a story on Resnick earlier this month. The company's prominence in the trade war has made it a target: In 2024, China formally sanctioned Brinc and Resnick, freezing any assets in the country and barring Resnick from entry.

Speaking with GeekWire this week, Resnick said DJI's dominance stems from billions in Chinese government subsidies, making fair competition nearly impossible. 

“Frankly, I think this just evens the playing field,” he said.

Brinc, which has manufacturing operations at its Seattle headquarters, has already shifted to a non-Chinese supply chain, sourcing components from Taiwan, Germany, the U.K., and Japan. Resnick said the new restrictions will require a further shift toward domestic suppliers: “Moving forward, we are going to have to do a lot more business with American companies.”

Resnick said this shift ensures the U.S. industrial base remains resilient even if international partners face constraints during a conflict. While the transition presents a hurdle, Resnick described it as an “organizational cost that we're very happy to pay” in exchange for a market free of state-sponsored Chinese competition.

He acknowledged that there could be a price premium in the drone market overall as American suppliers scale up, a process he estimates will take two to three years.

When asked if he sees these events as an opening for Brinc to expand into other sectors, beyond public safety, Resnick didn't entirely rule out the possibility. “The free world,” he said, “needs more drone manufacturing capacity in a whole bunch of different verticals.”

Waymo appears to be testing adding Google's Gemini AI chatbot to its robotaxis in an effort to integrate an AI assistant that would accompany riders and answer their queries, according to findings by researcher Jane Manchun Wong.

“While digging through Waymo's mobile app code, I discovered the complete system prompt for its unreleased Gemini integration,” Wong wrote in a blog. “The document, internally titled ‘Waymo Ride Assistant Meta-Prompt,' is a 1,200+ line specification that defines exactly how the AI assistant is expected to behave inside a Waymo vehicle.”

The feature hasn't shipped in public builds, but Wong says the system prompt makes it clear that this is “more than a simple chatbot.” The assistant is said to have the ability to answer questions, manage certain in-cabin functions like climate control, and, if required, reassure riders. 

“While we have no details to share today, our team is always tinkering with features to make riding with Waymo delightful, seamless, and useful,” Julia Ilina, a spokesperson for Waymo, told TechCrunch. “Some of these may or may not come to our rider experience.”

This wouldn't be the first time Gemini has been integrated into the Alphabet-owned self-driving company's stack. Waymo says it has used Gemini's “world knowledge” to train its autonomous vehicles to navigate complex, rare, and high-stakes scenarios. 

Waymo is working on Gemini AI in-car assistantThey tried to hide it from the app, but here's the full 1200-line system prompt pic.twitter.com/weh1EBPj7y

Wong writes the assistant is instructed to possess a clear identity and purpose: “a friendly and helpful AI companion integrated into a Waymo autonomous vehicle” whose primary goal is “to enhance the rider's experience by providing useful information and assistance in a safe, reassuring, and unobtrusive manner.” The bot is directed to use clear, simple language and avoid technical jargon, and is instructed to keep its responses succinct to one to three sentences. 

According to the system prompts, when a rider activates the assistant via the in-car screen, Gemini can choose from a set of pre-approved greetings personalized with the rider's first name. The system can also access contextual data about the rider, like how many Waymo trips they've been on. 

The prompts currently let Gemini access and control in-car features, like the temperature, lighting and music. Notably absent from the function list are volume control, route changes, seat adjustment, and window control, Wong pointed out. If a rider asks for a feature that Gemini can't control, the bot is to reply with “aspirational phrases,” like, “It's not something I can do yet.”

Interestingly, the assistant is directed to maintain a clear distinction between its identity as Gemini the AI bot and the autonomous driving technology (the Waymo Driver). So when replying to a question such as, “How do you see the road?” Gemini shouldn't say “I use a combination of sensors,” and instead should reply, “The Waymo Driver uses a combination of sensors…”

The system prompts include a range of compelling tidbits, such as how the bot is meant to handle being asked questions about competitors like Tesla or the now-defunct Cruise, or which trigger keywords will get it to stop talking. 

The assistant is also directed to avoiding speculating on, explaining, confirming, denying, or commenting on real-time driving actions or specific driving events. So if a passenger asks about a video they saw of a Waymo hitting something, the bot is instructed to not answer directly and deflect.

“Your role is not to be a spokesperson for the driving system's performance, and you must not adopt a defensive or apologetic tone,” the prompt reads.

The in-car assistant is allowed to answer general knowledge questions like about the weather, the height of the Eiffel Tower, what time the local Trader Joe's closes, and who won the last World Series. It is not allowed to take real-world actions like ordering food, making reservations, or handling emergencies. 

Waymo isn't the only company integrating AI assistants into driverless vehicles. Tesla is doing something similar with xAI's Grok. The two different car assistants serve different functions, however. Gemini appears to be programmed to be more pragmatic and ride-focused, while Grok is pitched more as an in-car buddy that can handle long conversations and remember context from previous questions.

There's plenty of hype around AI and robots in healthcare, but the problem that's actually costing hospitals money right now is operating room coordination. Two to four hours of OR time is lost every single day, not because of the surgeries themselves, but because of everything in between from manual scheduling and coordination chaos to guesswork about room turnover.  

Today on TechCrunch's Equity podcast, we're bringing you a conversation that TechCrunch AI Editor Russell Brandom had with Conor McGinn, co-founder and CEO of Akara, the startup that recently landed a spot on Time's Best Inventions of 2025 and is building what's essentially air traffic control for hospitals using thermal sensors and AI.

                Reading time 6 minutes
      

This is it, Carol: the season one finale of Pluribus. Vince Gilligan's sci-fi standout got a two-season order from Apple TV right off the bat, so fans knew a tidy conclusion wouldn't be coming.

However, while a cliffhanger ending was to be expected, the climb we took to get there was packed with Pluribus' trademark blend of careful pacing, high-wire tension, and observations about humanity that are both hilarious and heartbreaking.



First, a deeply unsettling prologue kicks off “La Chica o El Mundo”: it's now 71 days after the Joining, and we're in a remote village in Peru, home of Kusimayu—one of the survivors who attended Carol's disastrous summit back in episode two. She's decided to join the hive mind.

We're spared the part of the procedure that extracts her stem cells; we see what comes after. All she has to do is inhale vapors and endure a brief seizure, and when she opens her eyes again, she's on the team. With that familiar bland smile now fixed to her face, Kusimayu opens the pen containing all her animals, including the most poignant baby goat this side of Severance.

In Albuquerque, Carol and Zosia watch satellite footage of Manousos getting closer. Carol is nervous about this intrusion; she's just gotten comfortably settled into her newfound happiness (or the illusion of happiness, anyway) with Zosia, and his arrival is absolutely going to disrupt the fantasy. “I'll just hear him out and send him on his way,” Carol declares.

(By the way, this is 60 days post-joining, so we've rewound to before Kusimayu's transformation.)

Zosia makes herself scarce, and Carol receives Manousos alone, in a scene about a million times more awkward than we could have imagined. Their previous interactions consisted of screaming back and forth at each other over the phone—frustrating, but also a hopeful sign that someone, anyone capable of even having a screaming argument still exists. And as we've seen, Manousos was so intrigued by Carol's video he made an agonizingly long trek to find her, learning English (sort of) and suffering grievous injuries along the way.

But upon meeting face-to-face, the two immediately clash. She's leery of the machete he carries. He's leery of entering her home, convinced the Others (he calls them “the weirdos”) have installed surveillance equipment without her knowledge. When they finally talk outside, he insists on holding an umbrella to prevent prying eyes from drones overhead. (Considering we saw how closely he was being watched on his approach to Albuquerque, his fears feel legitimate in this case, though his overall vibe is very paranoid.)

But even when they finally compromise on where they should converse, things are still very prickly between them. Carol insists she doesn't want to “destroy” the Others; Manousos maintains, “These weirdos are evil” because “they have stolen everyone's soul.” Carol argues that they're still human; Manousos argues that they are not.

Then, Carol—who has just underlined the fact that the Others cannot lie—tells a whopper to Manousos, saying she doesn't know why they returned to Albuquerque after abandoning her for 40 days. (Good thing she asked Zosia to have that giant “come back” plea she'd painted onto the street removed before Manousos' arrival.)

Eventually, they move their chat—aided by the monotone of Google Translate, though Manousos' English is by now far better than Carol's very rudimentary Spanish—into Carol's house. He won't engage until he does a thorough search for listening devices and finds something very odd hidden in Carol's liquor cabinet.

When Carol calls Zosia demanding answers, she finds out it's a sensor that's been there for years. Like, since 2011, when she was freezing her eggs. It seems Helen hid it there to keep discreet tabs on her boozy spouse, and it's been hanging out ever since. Detail-obsessed Pluribus fans will remember that Carol has referenced freezing her eggs before, making a joke about it during that flashback to Carol and Helen's stay in the Norwegian ice hotel.

So that's two mentions of Carol's eggs across Pluribus season one, and series creator Vince Gilligan isn't dropping that information in vain. But before we get to that, we still have more Carol-Manousos drama to get through. Needing some time away from her new frenemy, Carol gets him to move into the empty house next door, something he's very reluctant to do. This reaction is very much in keeping with his desire to pay for everything he takes, or at least sign an IOU for it. This guy has a moral code that's remained firmly in place, even as the world has dramatically shifted around him.

At any rate, while Carol is getting drunk and falling asleep to Golden Girls, Manousos is prying into her activities by talking to Zosia. He could really talk to any of the Others—it would truly make no difference—but summoning Zosia in particular is designed to get a rise out of Carol, and it works. She's furious. She drags Zosia away, but Manousos quickly requests another Other come talk to him instead.

While Carol is fumbling through Zosia's gentle insistence that “We love him the same as we love you”—logically, Carol knows that's how the hive mind works, but emotionally, she can't comprehend that; Zosia is her special, uh, “chaperone,” after all—Manousos takes a page from Carol's own playbook.

“Something's about to happen,” Zosia announces, and calmly lies on the floor before she begins to shake. Carol, frantic, races next door and sees that Manousos has caused the mass seizure event this time. He's been deliberately agitating the Other sent to replace Zosia to try and pull him out of his hive-mind stupor.

It doesn't work, and to Carol's horror, the Others decide it's Manousos' turn to be put in isolation—and since he's now in Albuquerque, that means another mass exodus from Carol's hometown.

“I think there's a way to put things back in their place,” Manousos insists to Carol. “Now the work begins!”

When she hesitates, he goes for the kill, and here we learn why the episode is titled “La Chica o El Mundo”: “Do you want to save the world or get the girl?”

For a moment, Pluribus makes us think that Carol has chosen Zosia. There's a blissful montage of the pair on various luxurious vacations (Carol's beach read of choice: The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin). It's peaceful. It's idyllic.

But a fireside conversation on their ski trip brings all that to a screeching halt. Carol is happy, and she's startled by how good it feels. “It only gets better,” Zosia beams.

Slowly Carol realizes she means… the Joining. It's the thing Carol has vehemently resisted from the start. Though this newfound happiness has been blissful, she'd rather be miserable forever with her individuality intact.

And besides, back in Las Vegas, didn't Mr. Diabaté assure her that the survivors could not be converted without their express consent? The stem-cell extraction process is invasive, and without getting permission to perform the procedure, the Others wouldn't have the necessary material to bring a holdout into the hive mind.

That information was liberating. It put Carol in an actual good mood. But now, she has a horrible realization: her eggs. The Others have her frozen eggs. They don't need to stick a giant needle into her hip. They've already got the goods.

“How long do I have?” she asks Zosia.

“A month,” Zosia replies. She's thrilled that Carol will soon be forced into receiving this marvelous gift. “Hopefully not more than two or three.”

Needless to say, this changes everything.

It's now 74 days post-joining. Manousos is still alone in Albuquerque, and he hears a helicopter approaching. It's toting a large box, which it sets down outside Carol's place. We see that Zosia is the pilot, and Carol's sitting beside her.  They share a very loaded look as Carol climbs out. It's a sad moment. But they're sad for different reasons.

When a baffled Manousos approaches, Carol tells him, “You win. We save the world.”

What's in the box? Why, an atom bomb, of course!

The Others sure hoped she wouldn't ask for one after her semi-serious inquiry following the grenade incident. But they're obligated to give Carol whatever she wants. Bringing a giant bomb into the story is bang-up way to set up the events of season two, isn't it?

You can watch all nine episodes of Pluribus season one on Apple TV. A second season has already been greenlit, but so far there's no word on when new episodes might arrive.

For a brief moment in time, Asus let one of its cats out of the bag. A webpage showed up on the company's website about a fancypants new 32"" display, the ROG Swift PG32UCDM3. This new model has a 4K QD-OLED running panel at 240 Hz, complemented by a BlackShield filter that claims to offer an even deeper black level than the already-inky hue common in OLED displays and dramatically improved scratch prevention.

Technically speaking, the new display is the third generation of the existing PG32UCDM lineup. Note that the specs list we managed to dig up came from unofficial sources, but they all look in line with what we'd expect for a new revision.

The standard OLED fare is present, in the form of an effectively infinite 1,500,000:1 contrast ratio, 99% coverage of the DCI-P3 color space, and factory calibration with a Delta-E average of 2 or under. Things get more interesting with Dolby Vision support, standard HDR10, and DisplayHDR 500 True Black certification, which guarantees at least 500 nits of brightness in HDR mode.

Those are pretty good specs already, especially with the assumption the monitor a fourth-gen LG QD-OLED panel with higher and more stable brightness versus previous offerings. The true star of the show here, though, is the BlackShield Film, which Asus purportedly says offers a 40% deeper black level, along with 2.5x higher scratch resistance than before.

Although OLED displays are self-emissive and have zero black level by nature (and superior to any other display type), any ambient light is reflected on the panel surface, making pure black colors look ever so slightly grey or purple, especially in brightly lit rooms. Glossy coatings are the best to fix that, but those introduce distracting screen reflections, so panel and monitor makers often have to find a balanced trade-off, or come up with novel ideas, as Asus apparently has done.

The rest of the specifications are about what you'd expect from a high-end OLED display: 90 W USB-C power delivery, connectivity options including Display HDR 2.1a UHBR20 and HDMI 2.1, and an integrated hub. It's safe enough to assume that the included stand will be height and tilt-adjustable, and there will be RGB lighting on tap.

Given the specs of this unit, don't expect it to be affordable. The current PG32UCDM is often priced at $900 to $1,000, so the new version should command a premium over that figure.

Hardware-accelerated BitLocker promises faster SSD speeds and lower CPU usage


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft has introduced a new form of hardware-accelerated BitLocker encryption in Windows 11, offloading encryption and decryption to a purpose-built cryptography accelerator baked into future CPUs to improve performance and efficiency. First announced at Ignite 2025 in November, the feature has been added to the latest versions of Windows 11 (25H2) and Windows Server (2025 with the September Update), along with UFS (Universal Flash Storage) Inline Crypto Engine technology. This new tech will undo the performance penalties that Microsoft imposed on its users by forcing them to use software-based encryption by default, offering twice the storage performance in some types of workloads.

 




According to our testing and support documentation, software-based BitLocker encryption is enabled by default on new installs of Windows 11 Pro. It reduces SSD performance by up to 45%, as encryption and decryption are handled by software running on the CPU. Hardware-accelerated BitLocker is already available for storage devices, with the encryption offload being handled on the storage device itself, be it an SSD or HDD, as long as it is TCG Opal-compliant. Most modern SSDs include hardware-based encryption, in which all encryption/decryption processing occurs directly on the drive with no performance impact.

However, Microsoft, being Microsoft, opted to force-enable the software version of BitLocker for new Windows Pro installs, hurting performance and battery life — you can only use hardware-based SSD encryption if you jump through a complicated series of largely undocumented hoops.

The company now plans to use a new hardware-accelerated BitLocker CPU implementation to address the issue it created, but it will take time to even become available.

Hardware-accelerated BitLocker will initially be available on Windows 11 devices with Intel vPro platforms based on upcoming Intel Core Ultra series 3 “Panther Lake” CPUs, with broader support planned. The latest version of BitLocker is expected to leverage new capabilities on upcoming chips, including crypto offloading, where the bulk of cryptographic operations will be moved from software running on the CPU to a dedicated fixed-function crypto engine. Additionally, BitLocker bulk encryption keys will be hardware-wrapped on select SoCs to improve security by reducing exposure to CPU and memory vulnerabilities.

Microsoft's Rafal Sosnowski stated in a blog post, “When enabling BitLocker, supported devices with NVMe drives along with one of the new crypto offload capable SoCs will use hardware-accelerated BitLocker with the XTS-AES-256 algorithm by default. This includes automatic device encryption, manual BitLocker enablement, policy driven enablement, or script-based enablement with some exceptions.”

Microsoft claims that hardware-accelerated BitLocker can deliver performance improvements in storage and I/O metrics, such as sequential and random reads and writes, when compared with software BitLocker. Additionally, users can expect up to 70% reduction in CPU cycles required to process BitLocker workloads, thereby resulting in improved battery life.​

The company has also shared CrystalDiskMark performance test results in a video, showing that a drive with software-based BitLocker encryption achieved read speeds of 1632 MB/s on single-thread sequential workloads, compared with 3746 MB/s on a drive with hardware-based BitLocker enabled. Similarly, write speeds improved to 3530 MB/s from 1510 MB/s.

For now, hardware-accelerated BitLocker will be reserved for future Windows PCs, so widespread adoption will take time. That said, the feature's introduction indicates that Microsoft is finally rethinking how encryption should work on modern hardware.

Current smoking was linked to a higher risk for all-cause dementia, especially vascular dementia, with the strongest effects seen in those younger than 85 years and women. It was not significantly associated with the risk for Alzheimer's dementia. Former smoking was associated with an increased risk for vascular dementia only in men, particularly those younger than 85 years.

""Our findings add to the literature arguing for the importance of early preventive measures and targeted public health initiatives to reduce smoking-related cognitive performance,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Christian Myrstad, Norwegian National Centre for Ageing and Health, Vestfold Hospital Trust, Tønsberg, Norway. It was published online on December 16, 2025, in BMC Public Health.

Data on smoking exposure and most covariates were self-reported and subjected to recall bias, potentially affecting the magnitude of the association with the risk for dementia. Potential changes in smoking status over a long period between baseline and follow-up were not accounted for, leading to the possible misclassification of smoking exposure. Additionally, dementia was not assessed at baseline.

This study was funded by the Norwegian National Centre for Ageing and Health. One author reported participating in advisory boards of Biogen, Eisai, and Roche concerning antidementia drugs.

Clinicians caring for patients with congenital heart disease are now facing a growing challenge: managing the condition in adults. Often adults born with congenital heart disease fall through the cracks when it comes to accessing lifelong specialized follow-up and care. Major societies hope to change that.

On December 18, updated guidelines for management of adults with congenital heart disease, developed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) in conjunction with several other societies, were published in Circulation and the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

Decades ago, people with congenital heart disease had lower odds of survival beyond childhood, so the idea prevailed that surviving to adulthood meant patients did not need ongoing treatment.

Gaps in treatment often occur around the time of early adulthood, the guidelines' lead author Michelle Gurvitz, MD, MS, told Medscape Medical News.

“Our previous work suggested that these patients tend to feel good and therefore are less likely to pursue follow-up care,” said Gurvitz, a senior associate cardiologist and director of the Adult Congenital Heart Disease Fellowship Program at Harvard Medical School, Boston.

Congenital heart defects occur in approximately 1% of all live births, or about 40,000 infants, each year in the US, amounting to one child born with congenital heart disease every 15 minutes. About half of these cases are ventricular septal defects.

Among infants born with congenital heart disease, about 1 in 4 have a severe defect requiring surgery or other interventions in the first year. The neonatal period and first year of life are critical times for survival. Between 1999 and 2017, about 1 in every 814 deaths occurring in the US were attributable to heart defects, and 48% of these occurred in children younger than 1 year.

With continued improvements, we now know that 97% of patients with congenital heart disease will reach adulthood, and for those alive at age 18, 75% may live into their sixties. However, complex defects like tricuspid atresia or pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum are associated with higher infant mortality and shorter average lifespans.

Caring for adults born with these defects differs significantly from the care of children with congenital heart disease and the care of adults with heart disease acquired later in life, according to congenital heart disease specialist Georges Ephrem, MD, MSc, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, Tennessee.

“Adult congenital heart disease care entails the management of acquired adult comorbidities, cardiovascular risk factors, and coronary artery disease,” Ephrem, who was not involved with the guidelines, said in an interview. “Some of those issues have a pediatric counterpart, but their magnitude and prevalence in adult care is on a different scale. A major part of adult congenital heart disease care involves integrating baseline pathology with the history of transcatheter and surgical interventions — or lack of — that have occurred by the time the patient enters adulthood.”

The updated guidelines stress the benefits of detecting potential problems early. “When people with adult congenital heart disease fall out of care for 5 or 10 years, there is a higher risk of need for urgent intervention,” Gurvitz told Medscape Medical News. “For our patients with moderate or complex disease, some interventions are best to perform before the patient becomes symptomatic.”

One example is pulmonary valve regurgitation in patients with tetralogy of Fallot, she said.

“This condition can be asymptomatic, with symptoms developing gradually. In our criteria for valve replacement in these patients, we consider symptom development but also look at ventricular size or reduced ventricular function. These can be picked up on surveillance before a person becomes symptomatic,” Gurvitz said.

The new guidelines update the criteria for pulmonary valve replacement in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot based on right ventricular end-systolic volume > 80 mL/m2 and other metrics, instead of end-diastolic volume.

The recommendations also include several new and updated sections for managing adults with congenital heart disease.

Specifically, the guidelines advocate an individualized approach for authorizing physical activity, which represents a shift away from more blanket restrictions, Gurvitz noted.

In the past, clinicians would typically err on the side of caution when it came to exercise. “Patients in their thirties and forties have told me they were not allowed to participate in gym class or sports as children,” she said. “Our new guideline recognizes the benefits of regular recreational exercise on heart health.”

The guidelines also address mental health and neurocognitive conditions, such as mood disorders or cognitive and memory problems, experienced by some adults with congenital heart disease. In a global survey of 3815 adults with congenital heart disease, almost a third reported elevated symptoms of depression and/or anxiety.

“Some of our patients have experiences that appear similar to PTSD [posttraumatic stress disorder], which may stem from hospitalization and interventions as a young child,” Gurvitz told Medscape Medical News. “One of the most important things we can do is ask our patients about their mental health and help direct them to support.”

The recommendations also feature new and updated recommendations on birth control options, pregnancy, and childbirth.

Adults with congenital heart disease interested in pregnancy, for example, should receive preconception counseling, in collaboration with an adult congenital heart disease cardiologist. Discussions should include genetic testing, how pregnancy can affect their own health, fetal risks associated with pregnancy, and safe birthing options.

The guideline authors noted that many patients with adult congenital heart disease “tolerate the hemodynamic changes of pregnancy without major adverse events,” but emphasize that problems can arise. The involvement of clinicians with expertise in adult congenital heart disease, maternal-fetal medicine, and anesthesiology is paramount.

Physicians should also counsel patients on the benefits and risks of various contraceptive methods, according to the guidelines.

The ACC/AHA guidelines authors acknowledged the dilemma between the growing number of patients with congenital heart disease reaching adulthood and the shortage of specialists trained to manage these conditions.

“The number of adult congenital heart disease specialists and specialty centers are still inadequate to meet the demand, in both numbers and geographic distribution,” Gurvitz said. “Then there is the added difficulty of access to care since many patients are uninsured or underinsured.”

Ephrem has made it a mission to address this shortage at an organizational level. “The mismatch between the availability of adult congenital heart disease expertise and the need from this patient population is due partly to a lack of adult congenital heart disease-trained physicians but also a resultof our immense successes in improving diagnosis and treatment of patients with congenital heart disease from younger ages,” he told Medscape Medical News.

In the US, the number of adults with congenital heart disease is now estimated to be twice that of children with congenital heart disease and is growing by approximately 5% per year.

In an American Journal of Cardiology paper published in November 2025, Ephrem lays down a call to action to address this issue:

“As the gap between the growth of the adult congenital heart disease patient population and the paucity of trained, board-certified adult congenital heart disease physicians continues, the problem will only become more consequential,” Ephrem stressed.

He pointed out that legislation such as the Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act of 2024 (H.R. 7189/S. 3757), “should be emulated and expanded so we can turn the trend around and start heading into a more promising direction.”

Ephrem and Gurvitz reported no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

When added to standard care, precision immunotherapy targeting macrophage activation-like syndrome and sepsis-induced immunoparalysis improved organ dysfunction by day 9 compared with placebo in patients with sepsis.

“These findings are consistent with previous work targeting immune dysregulation in sepsis,” the authors of the study wrote.

“It is reassuring that the additional analyses were supportive of the primary findings. However, as noted by the authors, it would be nice to see this approach tested in a larger trial with a primary outcome that was more patient-centric,” an expert wrote in an editorial accompanying the journal article.

The study was led by Evangelos J. Giamarellos-Bourboulis, MD, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Athens, Greece. It was published online on December 08, 2025, in JAMA.

The trial used change in the SOFA score as the main outcome, which was a surrogate rather than a patient-centered outcome. Measuring ferritin and human leukocyte antigen-DR required specialized testing that may not have been feasible in all hospitals, and the complexity and turnaround time could have limited broader use. The findings were generalizable only to sepsis caused by pneumonia or bacteremia because other causes of sepsis were excluded.

The study was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme. Several authors disclosed receiving personal fees or grants, serving on the executive committee and council of the International Sepsis Forum, participating on data and safety monitoring boards, or having other ties with various organizations and pharmaceutical companies.

 December 24, 2025  

Researchers from 28 countries have proposed updating the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to better measure organ dysfunction in critically ill patients admitted to the ICUs.

SOFA 2, the revised score, incorporates interventions that are now routinely available but did not exist when the original tool was introduced 29 years ago, including newer medications and life-support technologies.

Both scores assess hepatic, renal, cardiac, respiratory, neurologic, and blood coagulation functions. Researchers have also attempted gastrointestinal and immunologic assessments; however, they have not yielded satisfactory results.

Speaking with Medscape's Portuguese edition, “Since 1996, ICUs and medicine have evolved a great deal,” said Otavio T. Ranzani, MD, PhD, the study's first author. “For example, we can now replace kidney function very effectively with dialysis. When the original score was developed in 1996, dialysis was not even considered because it was not widely used at the time.”

Ranzani leads the DataHealth Lab at Institut de Recerca Sant Pau in Barcelona, Spain. He is also a researcher in the Pulmonary Division, Faculty of Medicine, Heart Institute, at Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo in São Paulo, Brazil.

The study involved 64 expert researchers in intensive care, epidemiology, and data science. The research was conducted in eight stages, beginning with a review of the original SOFA method. Divided into eight working groups and supported by systematic reviews, participants proposed updates refined through two Delphi consensus rounds, followed by application to large clinical databases. The final phase, which combined the Delphi rounds with the database analyses, was repeated until validation.

Researchers analyzed health data from more than 3.3 million patients admitted to 1319 ICUs across nine countries: Australia, Austria, Brazil, France, Italy, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, and the US. According to the authors, the study's strengths include its diverse working group of intensive care, epidemiology, and data science experts from multiple regions (including low-resource settings); real-world analyses from low- and middle-income countries with a wide geographic distribution, supporting generalizability (prior SOFA-1 validation used far fewer patients); and collaboration via multiple modified Delphi rounds and data analyses, yielding an evidence-based bedside tool applicable across ICUs.

To support broader applicability, the team developed guidelines for hospitals that serve socially vulnerable populations and settings with limited access to diagnostic tests or advanced therapies. A SOFA score of 2 is not routinely used in clinical settings. “It is still too early to say that it is in use. It is gaining a lot of attention, and soon we should begin to see applications,” Ranzani said.

The structure of the SOFA scoring system remained the same. It remains a practical, low-cost bedside tool designed for daily use that does not require additional laboratory testing beyond standard ICU monitoring.

Assessment relies on the information available at the time of evaluation, such as whether a patient is receiving dialysis or is in a coma, oxygenation status, and platelet count. Each of the six organ systems was scored from 0 to 4. Scores of 1-2 indicate organ dysfunction, and scores of 3-4 indicate organ failure. Scores were summed up to a maximum of 24, with higher scores reflecting greater organ dysfunction and illness severity.

SOFA-2 modified the cutoff values for the six organ systems of the original SOFA score, particularly brain, respiratory, cardiovascular, liver, kidney, and hemostasis, reflecting advances in treatment options and clinical practice.

Noninvasive respiratory support, including high-flow nasal cannulas and noninvasive ventilation via facial or nasal masks, has now been incorporated into respiratory assessments.

In contrast, a SOFA score of 1 point accounted only for invasive mechanical ventilation. Updated criteria were also introduced for vasoactive medications used to stabilize blood pressure.

“The higher the dose, the more severe the patient's condition. At that time, the medications and doses were inconsistent with the current protocols. We have also updated this,” Ranzani stated.

Another key advancement is the improved applicability of the model to ICUs with limited resources.

“We provide many indications on how to manage and score patients,” he said. “Previously, it was unclear how to respond to certain situations. Now, we have very direct recommendations, he said. This includes guidance when diagnostic tests and treatments are unavailable.

“To assess the lungs, we can draw blood from the artery in the hand, but we do not measure this in all patients. The study proposed the use of pulse oximetry saturation,” Ranzani noted.

He added that the revised score also addressed limited access to renal replacement therapy. “We provide guidance on what to do if a physician practices in a country without access to dialysis machines. Based on blood biochemistry, we established criteria indicating equivalence to dialysis. Previously, dialysis was not considered in the scoring system. Now it counts for the maximum score, and when dialysis would be indicated but is unavailable, that also counts as 4 points.”

Efforts to formally define gastrointestinal and immunologic dysfunction have not reached a consensus because of limited data and a lack of validation. “We recommend that validation efforts be undertaken to better characterize these types of dysfunctions, which can occur in the ICU and are not quantified,” Ranzani said.

According to the authors, the need to update SOFA-1 has long been recognized by intensive care physicians and clinical researchers, as years without revisions have caused ambiguities in interpretation, leading to inconsistent scoring.

Fernando Suparregui Dias, MD, PhD, coordinator of the intensive care service at Hospital São Lucas, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil, agreed that revision was overdue.

“This update was necessary because, over three decades, there have been significant changes in the approach to critically ill patients, with the introduction of new drugs and technologies, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other forms of extracorporeal circulatory support. This influences how we treat critically ill patients.” Dias said.

Dias also highlighted the validation using databases comprising millions of ICU admissions. “From an epidemiologic standpoint, this is extremely powerful to support clinical practice and provides a very accurate view of the degree of patient impairment,” he said.

They added that SOFA 2 could replace SOFA 1 in the coming years, depending on factors such as the heterogeneity of each population in the ICU and patient turnover rate. As noted in this study, clinicians are likely to apply both scores in parallel during the initial transition period before fully adopting the revised tools.

Further research is planned to evaluate SOFA 2 scores in pediatric populations and critically ill patients outside the ICU, including in emergency departments and semi-ICUs.

Both require validation of their applicability and efficacy, as with SOFA 1, which was adapted for children after the score was introduced in adults.

“We believe the new score will need adaptation, because children have specific physiology that changes greatly with age,” Ranzani said. “We used ICU data, but critically ill patients are also treated outside the ICU, including in emergency departments, hospital wards, and step-down units. The score will probably apply well to these settings, but it needs to be validated,” he concluded.

Lionel Messi had an almost perfect season with Inter Miami in Major League Soccer 2025, which culminated in the championship after defeating Vancouver Whitecaps in the final. Thomas Muller experienced the talent of the Argentine forward firsthand in that match and, based on that experience, offered his perspective on the role Leo could play in the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

During a recent interview with Magenta TV, Muller was asked about the speculation regarding whether Messi will be part of the Argentina squad next summer in North America. “It would be an interesting project from my point of view if he were there,” the German player began.

However, Thomas made it clear that Messi's presence would not necessarily provide a boost for Argentina. “That could, of course, change the whole balance of the team, whether for better or for worse,” he said.

These comments relate to a topic often debated about Messi's role on the field. He remains a decisive player, even at 38, in the creative aspects of the game, but his defensive contributions are minimal, forcing his teammates to work harder to compensate. When Muller refers to Argentina's “balance,” he is undoubtedly alluding to this dynamic.

Messi has yet to confirm whether he will play in the 2026 World Cup with Argentina.

After facing each other for more than a decade at the international level and in European soccer, Thomas Muller and Lionel Messi met again this year in the United States, in the Major League Soccer final between Vancouver Whitecaps and Inter Miami.

There, Messi delivered a standout performance with two assists for the victory and the championship for the Herons, something Muller observed up close. “When he was on the ball, he just absolutely burst into life in the right areas and then really initiated a lot of things,” the German star recalled.

Still, Muller emphasized that the level of competition in MLS is far from what the World Cup demands, being the most important tournament in soccer. “Whether that would work like that off the cuff at top international level, I doubt,” explained the Bayern Munich legend.

In the same interview, reflecting on Lionel Messi, Thomas Muller shared his thoughts on Argentina's chances of repeating their 2022 World Cup title, acknowledging that the South American team is “high on the list” of favorites.

Finally, he also spoke about his country's own prospects. “At first glance, when you read the names of the opponents, it is of course a must to go through,” he said, referring to Ecuador, Ivory Coast, and Curacao, Germany's Group E rivals.

“With Ivory Coast we have the African champions, and with Ecuador the runners-up from South American qualifying. But when you then look again at the overall set-up, that the eight best third-placed teams from 12 groups also go through, then going through is again a must,” Muller added.

Lionel Messi's successor in Catalonia, Yamal, has not only matched the elite—he has surpassed them at just 18, topping Mbappe in a decisive attacking feat that underlines how rapidly the balance of power is shifting.


Lionel Messi emerged as Inter Miami's offensive leader, leading them to their first MLS Cup. Despite this, the veteran was firmly accompanied by Tadeo Allende, who stepped up his level. However, the 26-year-old star's continuity with the Herons may be in jeopardy.

Kingsley Coman outshines Cristiano Ronaldo as Al-Nassr thump Al-Zawraa in AFC Champions League Two win","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/kingsley-coman-outshines-cristiano-ronaldo-al-nassr-thump-al-zawraa-afc-champions-league-two-win/blta8b1528ee0ffea27","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 18:04:18 GMT","

Al-Nassr thrashed Iraqi side Al-Zawraa 5-1 to end the group stage of the AFC Champions League Two with a 100 per cent record. After skipping the first five group games, Cristiano Ronaldo finally played a continental match as he provided an assist in the game. However, it was Kingsley Coman who stole the limelight as his brace helped Al-Nassr bulldoze past their opponents.

Saudi Pro League giants Al-Nassr capped off their AFC Champions League Two group stage with a 100 per cent record as they scored five past Al-Zawraa at their home on Wednesday.

Al-Nassr dominated proceedings right from the start as Coman broke the deadlock for his side in the 12th minute. Angelo Gomes exchanged a quick one-two with the Frenchman to enter the box from the right before squaring it back to the winger, who found the back of the net. Seven minutes later, Wesley doubled Al-Nassr's lead. Joao Felix attempted a first-time header from a corner, which was initially stopped, but the midfielder pounced on the rebound ball and found the back of the net.

Abdulelah Al-Amiri then added a third goal before the half-hour mark as he converted a clinical header from Felix's corner. The Portuguese then finally got his name on the scoresheet on the stroke of half-time. In a well-orchestrated move from the right side, Coman found Ronaldo at the edge of the box. The 40-year-old took a touch before chipping the ball towards Felix, who, in turn, lobbed the ball over the opponent's goalkeeper with a first-time attempt.

Five minutes after the break, the visitors pulled one back as Ibrahim Gbadamosi scored a consolation goal for the Iraqi club but Coman sealed the fate of the game in the 56th minute as he completed his brace. While Ronaldo contributed in the encounter with an assist, the veteran star mostly remained silent on a night that truly belonged to Coman.

Coman was a livewire on the right flank for Al-Nassr and was the most important player for his side as the Frenchman scored a double and provided the assist for Felix's goal just before the break.

The Al-Zawraa backline remained clueless throughout the game as they did not have any answer to Al-Nassr's relentless attack throughout the 90 minutes, as they gave their opponents ample space to exploit near their penalty box. It proved to be a cakewalk for the Saudi giants eventually.

Electronic music is added to the inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage, acknowledgement that the artform is shaping France's artistic identity.

	It's official: Air, Cassius, Daft Punk, Justice and the great Jean-Michel Jarre are pillars of French culture.


	Electronic music is added to the national Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage, acknowledgement that the artform is shaping France's artistic identity.


	“Electronic music has a rightful place in our national intangible heritage,” says French Culture Minister Rachida Dati, following the ministry's labelling of clubs as “places of artistic expression and celebration”.

	Special mention is given to Jean-Michel Jarre, who, in his late 20s created the masterpiece Oxygène, an album of sweeping electronic tunes, all of them made on early synthesizers, without a vocal in the mix.

Oxygène, released in 1976, and the albums that came after it, including Equinoxe and Zoolook, inspired the French Touch sound which spun around the world and continues to shine.


	Jarre has put the work in for decades. The former president of CISAC, the global confederation of authors societies, has served as a UNESCO Ambassador since 1993, a role through which he plays point on advocating for electronic music.




	In 2021, president Emmanuel Macron presented the composer and artist with the French Legion of Honour, the country's highest order of merit. On that occasion, Jarre was feted with the insignia of Commander to the Legion of Honour, recognized as the country's highest honor, both military and civil.


	“I'm glad to see that electronic music is finally taking its place within world heritage, especially after more than three decades of commitment as a UNESCO Ambassador and spokesperson for intangible culture,” says Jarre in a social post, marking this “historic milestone for electronic music.”


	Over five decades, Jarre, now 77, has presented electronic music at the grandest of stages by performing at UNESCO World Heritage sites including the Pyramids of Giza, the Forbidden City, the Eiffel Tower, Versailles, Masada, Pompeii and, most recently, Samarkand. Just last month, he played at Registan Square in Samarkand during UNESCO's 43rd General Conference.


	France might've birthed the electronic music movement almost 100 years ago. It was the French inventor Maurice Martenot who in 1928 unveiled the Ondes Martenot, one of the first electronic instruments and one that is still used today by orchestras.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Bob Vylan Won't Face Charges for “Death to the IDF” Chant","https://pitchfork.com/news/bob-vylan-glastonbury-police-drop-charges/","Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:24:50 GMT","

U.K. police have ended their criminal investigation into Bob Vylan over comments the punk duo made on stage about the Israeli military.

“We have concluded, after reviewing all the evidence, that it does not meet the criminal threshold outlined by the [Crown Prosecution Service] for any person to be prosecuted,” the Avon and Somerset Police said in a statement. “No further action will be taken on the basis there is insufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction.”

In a statement posted on Instagram, Bob Vylan wrote in part,“The arrival of the news that no further action will be taken against any member of Bob Vylan regarding our Glasonbury performance in June 2025, should be something we as a band find celebration in. But the fact is, the criminal investigation of the chant was never warranted in the first place. Over the past 6 months, the media and politicians have consistently attacked us for using our art and platform to take a stand against the actions of Israel and its illegal occupying military force.”

In June, Bob Vylan's frontman, who goes by Bobby Vylan, led fans at Glastonbury in a chant of “Death, death to the IDF.” “Sometimes we have to get our message across with violence because that's the only language some people speak, unfortunately,” he later told the crowd, while an on-stage backdrop read messages such as “United Nations have called it a genocide. The BBC calls it a ‘conflict.'” Bobby's comments led to immediate criticism from Glastonbury organizers, the BBC, and British prime minster Keir Starmer. The duo were also dropped by United Talent Agency and had their U.S. visas revoked.

Longtime supporters of the Free Palestine movement, Bob Vylan have frequently criticized Israel's assault on Gaza and the West Bank. The duo later defended their actions at Glastonbury in a statement, writing, “We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people. We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine. A machine whose own soldiers were told to use ‘unnecessary lethal force' against innocent civilians waiting for aid. A machine that has destroyed much of Gaza.”

In July, U.K. police announced it was dropping an investigation of Irish rap trio Kneecap following similar comments they made at Glastonbury.

This story has been updated to include a statement from Bob Vylan.

													By Robert Scucci
						 | Published 16 seconds ago 

Ever since Conan O'Brien got screwed out of his NBC deal in 2010, I've distanced myself from late-night programming because it's always the same format. There's a monologue about the president, celebrity and musical guests, and rehearsed interviews that become increasingly ridiculous once you notice stars doing their press rounds, reciting the same jokes and stories verbatim from show to show. Conan was the outlier because he brought surreal, over-the-top bits to the table that made the format feel less stale, something that should have been encouraged rather than outright eliminated from primetime, late-night television.

However, if every single late-night show ended up resembling Night Owls with Jack Delroy, the fictional program at the center of 2023's Late Night with the Devil, I'd most definitely tune in more often. Late Night with the Devil has so much going for it, and I'm honestly mad I only just watched it for the first time this week. Its functionality is threefold: a late-night program, a found-footage horror film, and a possession story. Across all three modes, the film thrives at generating unease, and it's a blast watching everything unravel as the story is told from multiple vantage points.

Late Night with the Devil focuses on Jack Delroy (David Dastmalchian), the host of Night Owls, a late-night show competing directly with The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Returning to poor ratings after time away to cope with his wife Madeleine's (Georgina Haig) death, Jack knows he needs a big win during Sweeps Week if his comeback is going to mean anything. His solution is a Halloween-themed episode centered on the occult, stacking the desk with guests who promise a lively, media-friendly discussion. Spoiler alert: nothing about this ends up being media friendly.

Jack's first guest is Christou (Fayssal Bazzi), a psychic who claims he can communicate with the dead. At first, his act feels like a John Edwards-style cold-reading parlor trick, but everything shifts when he reveals a premonition about Jack's late wife that was never publicly disclosed. Moments later, Christou becomes violently ill and is rushed off the set, never to be seen again.

The next segment brings out Carmichael Haig (Ian Bliss), a professional magician and outspoken skeptic who insists there must be a logical explanation for what just happened. Carmichael ups the ante by offering a substantial cash reward to anyone who can definitively prove the existence of supernatural phenomena, positioning himself as the voice of reason in a studio that's already starting to feel unsteady.

This leads directly to the real meat and potatoes of Late Night with the Devil: June Ross-Mitchell, a respected parapsychologist and author, and her latest subject, Lilly (Ingrid Torelli). Jack pushes June to demonstrate, both for the studio audience and the viewers at home, that demonic possession is real. Lilly claims she's possessed by a demon she calls Mr. Wriggles, and from this point forward, there's no pulling the ripcord. Her chair levitates, her voice and physicality change in unsettling ways, and everybody is suddenly, and rightfully on edge.

While Carmichael assumes the entire thing is an elaborate ratings stunt, Jack and his producers scramble behind the scenes because they genuinely have no idea what's happening. The show is spiraling, the crew is panicking, and it becomes increasingly clear that something far more sinister is unfolding. Making matters worse, Jack begins to suspect that he may be more connected to the demonic presence than he ever realized.

Unlike many found footage films that rely on shaky cameras and questionable edits that break immersion, Late Night with the Devil succeeds because of its setting. A television studio is the perfect environment for this approach. It's technically found footage in the sense that we're watching raw A and B reels, but nothing about it feels artificial.

The film commits fully to the idea that we're watching a late-night broadcast collapse in real time. Color footage represents what actually aired, while black-and-white sequences capture what happens during commercial breaks as the crew desperately tries to regain control after each increasingly bizarre incident. That contrast grounds the premise and keeps everything feeling authentic.

The gasps from the audience seal the deal. Even better is watching Jack and his guests tense up as a producer counts down to the moment they're live again, only for everyone to snap back into polished, performative mode the second the cameras roll. It never feels forced. It feels like a real late-night show that went catastrophically off the rails, was quietly pulled from syndication, and then rediscovered years later.

GFR SCORE

If you've felt like late-night programming hasn't been the same since Coco took his hit in 2010, Late Night with the Devil is exactly the kind of chaotic breath of fresh air you've been waiting for, and it's streaming on Hulu as of this writing.

Sanofi said on Wednesday it will buy U.S. biotech Dynavax Technologies for around $2.2 billion (1.9 billion euros) in an agreed deal that will add an adult hepatitis B vaccine and a promising experimental shingles shot to its portfolio.

The acquisition will help the French drugmaker diversify its vaccine business at a time when U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is remaking policy for childhood immunisation, industry analysts say.

The Trump administration has dropped a long-standing universal recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination in infants, drawing an outcry from the medical community, and is considering other changes for 2026.

Shares in Dynavax surged nearly 39% to $15.45 in U.S. trading hours on news of the deal. Sanofi shares eased 0.7%.

""We believe the acquisition makes sense given growing regulatory concerns around vaccines,"" said William Blair analyst Matt Phipps.

""Sanofi is a logical acquisition partner for Dynavax given the company has extensive vaccine capabilities but the portfolio does not have an adult hepatitis B or shingles program.""

Sanofi has been seeking new products to drive revenue growth once its blockbuster asthma drug Dupixent goes off patent in 2031. It bought British private vaccine developer Vicebio for $1.5 billion in July after finalising an up to $9.5 billion deal for Blueprint Medicines.

It will pay $15.50 per Dynavax share, representing a 39% premium over the vaccine maker's closing share price of $11.13 on Tuesday. Phipps said this was below his estimated value for the U.S. biotech's hepatitis B shot, Heplisav-B, of $2.6 billion.

Sanofi will fund the deal using available cash, and expects to close the acquisition in the first quarter of 2026. The deal would not affect its 2025 financial outlook, it added.

Earlier this year, Sanofi and British rival GSK noted pressure in the U.S. flu vaccine market, while Australian biotech CSL delayed plans to spin off its vaccine division citing ""heightened volatility"" and a greater than expected decline in U.S. immunization rates.

Dynavax's Heplisav‑B shot is given to those aged 18 years and older to help prevent infection from the hepatitis B virus. It is administered in two doses, one month apart, compared to other vaccines that are given in three doses over six months.

The shot generated $90 million in sales in the third quarter of 2025. Analysts expect peak annual sales of $609 million in the U.S.

The deal will also add an experimental shingles vaccine to Sanofi's existing products that include flu and polio shots as well as the antibody therapy Beyfortus for the respiratory syncytial virus.

J.P. Morgan analysts said Dynavax's experimental shot, Z-1018, could boost revenues beyond 2030 for Sanofi, if early data on its safety and effectiveness is replicated in larger trials.

It could take a share in the shingles market, where GSK's top-selling Shingrix is on track to generate sales of 4 billion euros this year, the analysts added.

In August, Dynavax said its experimental shot generated a similar immune response as Shingrix, while showing a better safety profile, in a study of 92 people aged 50 to 69 years.

Separately, Sanofi said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had declined to approve its experimental drug tolebrutinib to slow disability progression in patients with a form of multiple sclerosis.

Houman Ashrafian, Sanofi's head of research and development, said the news came as a surprise to the company, which had previously been told that the FDA review process would continue into the first quarter of 2026.

""Today's FDA decision is a significant and meaningful change in direction from the feedback the agency previously provided to Sanofi. We are very disappointed by the FDA's action,"" Ashrafian said in a press release.

The decision adds to a year of data from Sanofi's experimental drugs for eczema and smoker's lung that disappointed investors. Sanofi's shares have largely underperformed the broader European sector index.

 December 24, 2025  

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has approved bevacizumab for untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. 

The final draft guidance applies to the originator drug bevacizumab (Avastin, Roche) and its biosimilars.

NICE said more than 7000 people in England could benefit.

Bevacizumab is a targeted monoclonal antibody with anti-angiogenic activity. It binds to VEGF, preventing interaction with endothelial cell receptors. This action inhibits new blood vessel formation and slows tumour growth by reducing the tumour's blood supply. 

Clinical trial evidence showed that adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy improved outcomes compared with chemotherapy alone. Progression-free survival increased to 9.4 months from 8.0 months. Overall survival rose to 21.3 months from 19.9 months.

Around 35,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer in England each year, with nearly 10,000 presenting with metastatic disease.

Although bevacizumab has been licensed to treat bowel cancer for almost 20 years, it was previously not considered cost-effective for use by the NHS. NICE said it could not recommend the drug in earlier assessments because the branded version did not represent value for money. 

The availability of lower-cost biosimilars prompted a new review. Biosimilars are biologic medicines that are almost identical to an original product, manufactured by a different company, with no clinically meaningful differences.

NICE assessed bevacizumab under its “whole lifecycle approach” to guidance development. This approach forms part of the government's 10-year plan to review priority clinical pathways.

The review used a simplified evaluation process. NICE concluded that there is now sufficient evidence that bevacizumab with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy provides clinical benefit and value for money for routine NHS use.

NICE said that bevacizumab with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy can be used as a first- or second-line treatment in adults with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. This option applies when targeted treatments or immunotherapy are unsuitable and chemotherapy would otherwise be offered. NICE said the decision provides a new option for patients who would otherwise receive only chemotherapy.

Bevacizumab is given as an infusion every 2 or 3 weeks alongside chemotherapy.

Possible side effects include high blood pressure, fatigue, bleeding, slow wound healing, renal impairment, increased risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart attack. Sexual and reproductive risks, including teratogenesis, have also been reported.

The drug was approved for use in Scotland in July 2025.

Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE, said: “Assessing the cost-effectiveness of biosimilar medicines is an important step for NICE, allowing us to quickly get effective treatments to patients while ensuring the NHS gets the best value for money.”

She said that the new evaluation approach allows the regulator to rapidly reconsider medicines when more affordable versions become available.

Mark Samuels, chief executive of Medicines UK, which represents off-patent generic and biosimilar medicine suppliers, welcomed the decision. He said it would enable more patients to benefit from what he described as a “life-extending treatment.”

“NICE has a vital role in reassessing treatments as more affordable off-patent biosimilar and generic medicines reshape how we evaluate costs and benefits,” Samuels said. “With many of the NHS's most expensive medicines being biologics, biosimilars will play an increasingly important role in expanding patient access to proven therapies.”

The list price of the originator bevacizumab is £242.66 for a 100 mg vial and £924.40 for a 400 mg vial. 

Biosimilar prices range from £202.50 to £242.66 for a 100 mg vial and from £810.00 to £924.40 for a 400 mg vial. National price reductions agreed through NHS procurement arrangements are commercially confidential.

Bevacizumab with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy will be available immediately on the NHS, subject to agreed pricing within the medicines procurement and supply chain.

	Two months after Sean “Diddy” Combs filed a two-page notice of appeal signaling plans to challenge both his conviction and sentencing, an in-depth appeal has been filed. In court documents reviewed by Rolling Stone, attorneys for Combs call for his “immediate release” from federal prison, and request that the court “either grant a judgment of acquittal or vacate and remand for resentencing.”


	Appellate attorney Alexandra A.E. Shapiro argues that the court determined Combs' 50-month sentence following his conviction on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution with “heavy reliance on acquitted conduct.” 


	In July, Combs was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges, though he was found guilty of two lesser felony charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. At the time, the jury rejected prosecutors' claims Combs ran a criminal enterprise and coerced two ex-girlfriends into drug-fueled sex with male escorts.


	The latest filing accuses U.S. District Court Judge Arun Subramanian of having “acted as a thirteenth juror” by handing down a sentence “based on the very allegations of coercion and other acquitted conduct the jury had rejected.” Shapiro states that the court ignored the verdict when it “insisted it needed to impose a ‘serious sentence' reflecting the ‘aggravating factors that I have addressed,' especially ‘the coercion.'”

	“We've filed the final appellate brief in United States v. Combs, and it raises issues that go well beyond this case. In short, the appeal argues that the district court imposed a record-setting sentence by relying on conduct the jury explicitly rejected, in direct conflict with the 2024 Sentencing Guidelines and core constitutional principles,” a representative for Combs shared in an email to Rolling Stone. “The filing asks the appellate court to vacate the sentence and order immediate release, or alternatively to reverse the convictions or remand for lawful resentencing limited strictly to the offenses of conviction.”

	In addition to the sentencing appeal, the document presents “a separate and independent basis for overturning Combs's convictions,” arguing that his First Amendment rights were violated by the district court “as a consumer of the sexual performances that took place during freak-offs and hotel nights.” Combs's attorneys claim he was “an observer and producer,” but did not have sex with those present and involved in the videos he filmed.

	Judge Subramanian previously stated, “At some point, illegal activity can't be laundered into constitutionally protected activity just by the desire to watch it.” In the appeal filing, this statement is quoted with attorneys adding the comment, “whatever that means.”


	Combs, 56, has been in custody since his September 2024 arrest. In October 2025, he was transferred to the New Jersey federal prison FCI Fort Dix. His projected release date is May 8, 2028, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Combs' defense initially asked for no more than 14 months, which would have been well below the federal probation department's recommended range of 70 to 87 months, or around six to seven years.
