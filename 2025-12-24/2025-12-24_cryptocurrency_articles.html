                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Monad launched with $400M backing and a rare Coinbase ICO, but retail investors now sit on losses as valuation pressure weighs on price. It had big funding rounds, speed claims and a historic Coinbase ICO that all fueled attention. Price action after launch has hurt retail buyers while early backers remain well funded. Here's how Monad reached this point and why the launch became a warning sign for everyday traders. Former Jump Trading engineers wanted to build a faster Ethereum-style chain and spent three years on development. Venture firms noticed early and early last year, Monad Labs closed a $225 million Series A round with Paradigm leading the raise. This massive number changed everything that followed as venture firms saw long-term infrastructure value and entered lockup agreements of three to five years. On the other hand, Retail traders saw a token that was already priced in success and that difference in time horizon mattered. Coinbase opened a rare door in November of this year and allowed United States retail users to join the primary token sale. It even performed identity checks and provided clear rules that framed the event as safe. Many buyers also viewed this ICO as a chance to join early without shady risks. The Monad mainnet went live on November 24, and trading started soon after. The MON token reached nearly $0.06 and early buyers doubled their money on paper. Market conditions changed in mid-December as a wider pullback hit many assets. Monad felt extra pressure due to its supply size and trader behavior. As of writing, every Coinbase ICO buyer now holds a loss. The token also fell more than 60% from its peak and technical charts showed a death cross, which added fear.

The network claims up to 10,000 transactions per second and some of its early testing supports that figure. More than 200 decentralised apps are already deployed on the chain and eevelopers continue building.</p>

University College London provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. One of the first modern coworking spaces, C-Base in Berlin, was launched 30 years ago by a group of computer engineers as a “hacker space” in which to share their tech and techniques. We wondered if they had been put off by the throngs of travellers who have followed in their sandal-clad footsteps, attracted by glamorous – if often inaccurate – images of the digital nomad lifestyle. One of the city's nomad hotspots is Yellow Coworking, which launched in 2020 as a blockchain-oriented, collaborative escape zone from the COVID pandemic. The later stages of the pandemic were an interesting time to be in Chiang Mai: Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was followed by mass layoffs in Silicon Valley when Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Microsoft all made significant cuts. “Some ex-Silicon Valley employees are here playing around with startups,” one Yellow staff member explained. “It makes sense for them to come here if they are trying to create an MVP” (that's “minimum viable product” – startup jargon for a basic prototype that, with luck, will become the next technological success story). People walking into Yellow Coworking's modernist, European-style building simply raise their hands to sign themselves in via biometric fingerprint scanners. Many are computer coders or IT specialists in their 20s, taking advantage of fast broadband and (mostly western) passports to disconnect their lives from any particular location. Vitalik Buterin, creator of ethereum – the decentralised blockchain behind the world's second biggest cryptocurrency, Ether – was often a focus of discussion at Yellow's regular meet-ups. Like many crypto folk, he views this borderless lifestyle as making perfect ideological sense. In Chiang Mai, cryptocurrency usage has spread to the local population. She too talked about the borderless revolution that was coming, and crypto being part of her financial future. One of the western “crypto nomads” present was trying to launch his own cryptocoin (built on Buterin's ethereum ecosystem) and get others to invest in it. A few tables away, another who had invested – and lost – a fortune in cryptocurrency explained he was now living in Chiang Mai because of the city's relatively low cost of living. For every success story, there were tales of loss and potential scams. Some told outlandish stories of crypto startups and other projects that were hard to validate. Digital nomad hotspots, which also include European cities such as Lisbon in Portugal, show how the worlds of cryptocurrency, blockchain and digital nomadism are colliding – and evolving beyond mere workspace provision. A collaborative, incubator-like atmosphere is at the core of The Block Lisboa, where you can pay in cryptocurrency and which hosts weekly Crypto Fridays for networking, collaboration and ideas sharing. These spaces are open to cryptocurrency professionals and enthusiasts with professional exchange in mind. Digital nomads are becoming a valuable asset for states to compete for – as Tsugio Makimoto and David Manners predicted they would in their 1997 book, Digital Nomad. “Just as we are already seeing governments competing with each other to attract industrial investment,” they wrote, “we may see governments competing with each other for citizens.” While these visas typically restrict local employment, many allow nomads to bring family members and offer a path to residency, such as in Spain and Portugal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) moved roughly 2,000 bitcoin BTC$87,328.09, worth about $174 million, through a series of wallets a day after it was reported to have increased its holdings to 11,542 BTC. The transfers routed the bitcoin across multiple addresses, with around $12 million ultimately reaching Coinbase Prime Custody, according to blockchain data tracked by CoinDesk on Arkham. The remainder is held in other wallets that appear to be linked to the same entity, suggesting a reshuffle of reserves rather than a one-way move toward an exchange. Assets in custody can remain parked there for long periods without being traded. Corporate holders often move assets between wallets for operational reasons, particularly after new purchases, internal policy changes, or custodial transitions. Traders have been watching flows and positioning closely, with recent market action showing bitcoin struggling to hold key psychological levels above $90,000. The onchain transfers also come as Trump Media's equity has rallied. L1 tokens broadly underperformed in 2025 despite a backdrop of regulatory and institutional wins. 2025 was defined by a stark divergence: structural progress collided with stagnant price action. Institutional milestones were reached and TVL increased across most major ecosystems, yet the majority of large-cap Layer-1 tokens finished the year with negative or flat returns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Council has published a 157-page paper outlining its negotiating position for digital euro legislation. The European Central Bank targets 2029 for launch, though legislative passage is no longer a foregone conclusion. In November, Rapporteur Fernando Navarrete presented a proposal suggesting that only an offline digital euro should be pursued, giving the private sector room to expand existing European retail payment solutions such as WERO. This offline only path has been rejected by the European Council, which is insisting on both an offline and online digital euro. While the European Council announcement also highlighted holding limits for the CBDC and compensation for payment providers, the document showed hints of early feature creep. In its first iteration, the digital euro is primarily intended to support P2P payments and retail payments. It mentions the ability to “fulfil future payments needs, and in particular machine to machine payment in the context of Industry 4.0 and payments in the decentralised internet (web3).” Additionally, it asserts that the solution should be “designed from the outset” to support business to business conditional payments. This functionality overlaps with private sector initiatives, including Germany's Commercial Bank Money Token project, which could launch within a year, subject to regulatory approval.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four years ago, California startup Theta Labs' cryptocurrency was soaring, and its future appeared bright when it landed a partnership with pop star Katy Perry. The Bay Area company had built a marketplace for digital collectibles known as nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, and had teamed up with Perry to launch NFTs tied to her Las Vegas concert residency. Its THETA token jumped by more than 500% in early 2021, reaching a peak of more than $15, making it one of the world's most valuable cryptocurrencies. “I can't wait to dive in with the Theta team on all the exciting and memorable creative pieces, so my fans can own a special moment of my residency,” Perry said in a June 2021 news release. Today, like many cryptocurrencies, THETA is 95% off its 2021 peak. It took a hit this week  after former executives accused it of manipulating markets to dupe consumers into buying its products. On Tuesday, it was trading at less than  30 cents. Some of the alleged misconduct involved placing fake bids on Perry's NFTs, engaging in token “pump and dump” schemes and using celebrity endorsements and “misleading” partnerships with high-profile companies such as Google to deceive the public, according to the December lawsuits filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed, and its founder, Samuel Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2024 after being found guilty of multiple fraud charges. Binance founder and former Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao also got prison time after he pleaded guilty to violating money laundering laws, but President Trump pardoned him this year. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission previously charged celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul and Ne-Yo for promoting crypto without disclosing they were paid to do so. Theta Labs created a network that rewarded people with cryptocurrency for contributing spare bandwidth and computing power to enhance video streaming and lower content delivery costs. The company describes Theta Network as a “blockchain-powered decentralized cloud for AI, media and entertainment.” The network has two tokens: THETA, used to secure the network, and TFUEL, used to pay users for services and power operations. The whistleblowers suing Theta Labs are Jerry Kowal, its former head of content, and Andrea Berry,  previously the company's head of business development. “Liu used Theta Labs as his personal trading vehicle, perpetrating fraud, self-dealing, and market manipulation,” said Mark Mermelstein, Kowal's attorney, in a statement. “His calculated ‘pump-and-dump' schemes repeatedly wiped out employee and investor value. The latest lawsuits allege that Liu profited from buying and selling THETA tokens using insider knowledge about partnerships with celebrities, studios and others in the entertainment industry. “Liu's true motive in pursuing such partnerships was not to develop a sustainable content business but to generate publicity that could be used to artificially inflate token prices for Liu's personal gain,” Kowal's lawsuit says. In 2020, Liu traded and sold tokens knowing that the company would close a content licensing deal with MGM Studios, according to the lawsuit. When NFTs started to take off in 2021, Kowal closed deals with high-profile partners such as Perry, Fremantle Media and Resorts World Las Vegas for the startup's NFT marketplace. To inflate the price and demand for these digital collectibles, Liu allegedly made bids on NFTs and directed employees to do the same. This led to people overpaying for the Perry NFTs. Multiple examples of alleged manipulation are outlined in the lawsuits. In one instance from 2022, the startup launched a new token called TDROP that employees also received as part of a bonus. When the TDROP token reached a high, he then sold the token, and its price collapsed by more than 90% within months. Berry's lawsuit also alleges that Theta Labs announced “misleading” or fake partnerships with high-profile companies such as Google and entities including NASA to pump up the value of the THETA token. Theta paid for Google Cloud products but claimed it was a partner when it was a Google customer, according to the lawsuit.

Dimitar is a Top 1% SEO strategist and content expert known for scaling iGaming, Web3, SaaS, and E-commerce brands through AI-ready, E-E-A-T optimized content. Ethereum price prediction is in sharp focus as ETH trades at $2,926.60, down 1.13% over the past 24 hours. Traders are watching closely as ETH hovers near psychological levels, and many are now turning attention to early-stage alternatives like Bitcoin Hyper, a presale token nearing a key funding milestone. In the last 24 hours, ETH ranged between $2,911.68 and $2,979.57, with a daily drop of 1.14%. This puts Ethereum in a tight sideways zone, and sentiment metrics indicate growing indecision. However, without a strong catalyst, the sideways structure could break down if volume declines further. The $2,900 level continues to act as a fragile support zone, and any decisive break below it could trigger further downside toward $2,830 or even the $2,631 low. Compared to this time last year, Ethereum is down 14.07%, falling from $3,405.84 on December 24, 2024. This contrast shows a pattern of slow accumulation after a broader correction, and may hint at an early accumulation phase going into 2026. Despite short-term bearishness, long-term forecasts for Ethereum price prediction remain optimistic. The current projected trajectory puts ETH at $3,181.09 in 2026, gradually increasing to $4,059.97 by 2031. These predictions factor in low supply inflation (0.20%), continued staking growth, and sustained Layer 2 development. Ethereum's supply remains stable, with 120.69 million ETH in circulation and no hard cap. With Ethereum consolidating and volatility staying muted, many retail traders are shifting focus toward early-stage tokens like Bitcoin Hyper. Only one day remains until the next automatic price increase, which has fueled increased investor attention. While Ethereum remains a strong long-term asset, smaller cap tokens with momentum narratives are becoming increasingly attractive to short-term risk-tolerant buyers. The Ethereum price prediction still supports a recovery scenario, but timing remains uncertain, and alternative presale assets are gaining traction in the meantime. Shiba Inu (SHIB) continued to trade under pressure on Wednesday, extending a multi-day decline as bearish momentum persisted across the broader cryptocurrency market.

The complaint charged crypto asset trading platforms Morocoin Tech Corp., Berge Blockchain Technology Co., Ltd., and Cirkor Inc., as well as investment clubs AI Wealth Inc., Lane Wealth Inc., AI Investment Education Foundation (AIIEF) Ltd., and Zenith Asset Tech Foundation, in connection with the operation. The SEC said the scam unfolded as a multi-step fraud that enticed unsuspecting users with ads on social media and built trust with them through group chats in which the scammers posed as financial professionals and promised returns from artificial intelligence (AI)-generated investment tips. According to the SEC, AI Wealth, Lane Wealth, AIIEF, and Zenith operated investment clubs on messaging apps like WhatsApp to which retail investors were lured into joining via ads on social media. While AI Wealth and Lane Wealth operated their WhatsApp groups from at least January 2024 to June 2024, AIIEF and Zenith ran from at least July 2024 to January 2025. Each of these clubs included a "professor" who sent updates to investors via WhatsApp on macroeconomic conditions or commentary on stocks and an "assistant" who handled day-to-day interactions with participants. These personas also send trade recommendations that they falsely claimed were based on AI-generated "signals." "The clubs gained investors' confidence with supposedly AI-generated investment tips before luring investors to open and fund accounts on purported crypto asset trading platforms Morocoin, Berge, and Cirkor, which falsely claimed to have government licenses, as alleged," the SEC said. "The investment clubs and platforms then allegedly offered 'Security Token Offerings' that were purportedly issued by legitimate businesses. In reality, no trading took place on the trading platforms, which were fake, and the Security Token Offerings and their purported issuing companies did not exist." The AI Wealth and Lane Wealth WhatsApp groups are said to have promoted an STO of a cryptocurrency asset called SCT, purportedly issued by the company SatCommTech. Likewise, the AIIEF and Zenith WhatsApp groups advertised an STO of another crypto asset called HMB that was issued by HumanBlock. The ill-gotten proceeds, totaling at least $14 million, were moved overseas through a web of bank accounts and crypto asset wallets, in some cases through accounts held by Chinese or Burmese individuals located in Southeast Asia. There have also been multiple reports on Reddit about individuals losing their money to the scam, with the AIIEF using names like "Richard Dill" and "Daisy Akemi" for professors and assistants. "This matter highlights an all-too-common form of investment scam that is being used to target U.S. retail investors with devastating consequences," said Laura D'Allaird, Chief of the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(KRON) – Grubhub users have reported receiving official-looking scam emails and app notifications encouraging recipients to send bitcoin to receive rewards as part of a limited-time holiday promotion, raising concerns that the company may have been hacked. The first email, sent Tuesday evening, promised that Grubhub would 10x any bitcoin sent to a specific wallet address contained in the email as part of a ‘Holiday Crypto Promotion'. A follow up email, sent less than an hour later, included recipients names, wished them a happy holidays and urged there were only '30 minutes' left in the promotion. For those who received the messages to a Gmail account, the emails were ‘verified' with a blue checkmark. The scam emails do appear to originate from a valid Grubhub email domain. KRON4 reviewed recent official Grubhub promotional emails that were sent from the same domain (b.grubhub.com) but with a different username. In addition to the two emails, some users on X have also reported receiving push alerts on the Grubhub merchant app with an identical, too-good-to-be-true offer, urging users to send bitcoin. It appears some users may have fallen for the scam. Earlier this year Grubhub reported a “security incident” that allowed “unauthorized access” to the contact information for an unknown number of customers and drivers. It is not clear if Tuesday's scam emails and notifications are related to the February incident. The scam email received by some Grubhub users appears to be a play off of a common cryptocurrency ‘investment scam' warned about on the Federal Trade Commission Consumer Advice website, where scammers will promise free cash or cryptocurrency through an unsolicited email. If you fall victim to a crypto-related scam, the FBI website recommends you immediately file a report online at the Internet Crime Complaint Center. Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>December has been another busy month for online safety developments, with both Ofcom and the ICO being active. Ofcom has imposed a penalty of £20,000 on the provider of the Im.ge service regarding its failure to comply with two statutory information requests. Ofcom said that the fine has been set with its Penalty Guidelines in mind. If it still doesn't comply, Ofcom will impose a daily rate penalty of £100 per day. Ofcom is continuing to investigate the Im.ge Service's compliance with its duties to complete, and keep a record of, a suitable and sufficient illegal content risk assessment and its compliance with the illegal content duties in respect of child sexual abuse material remain ongoing. It will provide updates on these matters in due course. Ofcom also confirmed that AVS Group Ltd, which it recently fined £1 million for not having robust age checks in place on 18 adult websites, has now introduced a new age assurance process on all sites that were the subject of Ofcom's investigation. In accordance with its Roadmap, Ofcom is seeking views on proposed industry guidance relating to how tech firms respond to requests from bereaved parents about their child's use of a service in the event of their death. The Online Safety Act places requirements on tech firms about how they can increase transparency and reduce uncertainty for bereaved parents making requests in difficult circumstances. The draft guidance expects services, among other things, to provide clear and accessible information in their terms of service about their information disclosure policy, including how bereaved parents can make requests and the evidence required; make sure that they respond to bereaved parents in a timely manner; offer a support function, which might be a helpline, to bereaved parents; and operate a simple to use, easy to access and transparent complaints function, with a nominated team or individual responsible for handling concerns, and a clear response timeframe. Separately, Ofcom has issued its final Guidance for online platforms that sets out what information they are required to retain about a child's online activity when Ofcom issues a Data Preservation Notice. It has already issued a number of these notices since the provisions came into force on 30 September. Earlier this month, the ICO announced that it would be scrutinising how popular mobile games played by children in the UK protect their online privacy. It highlighted that around 90% of UK children play games on digital devices, so it is launching a monitoring programme targeting ten popular mobile games. It will also consider any other privacy issues identified during the review process. The ICO says that the new focus on mobile games follows significant progress in improving children's privacy standards across social media and video-sharing platforms through its Children's code strategy. We will be writing more about this topic in the new year. As part of its strategy to reduce violence against women and girls, the UK government has highlighted the rise of nudification apps. It has said that it will ban nudification apps and other tools designed to create synthetic non-consensual intimate images to stop women and girls' images being tampered with and exploited without their consent. We are waiting for more detail on when and how this will be done. Ofcom has received some criticism for its slow implementation of the Act, but it is getting into its stride now with more fines, facilitating platforms to change their practices, and issuing new guidance. Platforms and service providers should note that the ICO is monitoring them as well. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chainlink faces a multitude of regulatory challenges when it comes to integrating crypto payroll into traditional finance systems. Fragmented Regulatory Landscape: Different countries and regions impose varying regulations on cryptocurrencies. Companies must navigate a confusing array of laws, potentially leading to inconsistent applications. KYC/AML Compliance: For on-chain payroll implementations, the enforcement of Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering laws is crucial. Chainlink must ensure that transactions for payroll are verifiable and in line with current regulations, which is a significant barrier to broader adoption. Operational Risks: Custody management, finality of settlements, and the need for interoperability with stablecoins and CBDCs consist of several complex risks that must be carefully addressed. Chainlink's oracle technology could dramatically improve crypto payroll solutions, especially for unbanked individuals. This becomes vital to ensure that payments remain accurate and prompt, particularly in regions with unstable currency values. Automated Payment Execution: Chainlink can execute payroll payments automatically and on time, which is especially beneficial for unbanked laborers in need of timely wages. This adaptability is key for those without access to standard banking systems. This transparency builds trust with workers who may already be wary of conventional financial systems. Cost and Delay Reduction: Chainlink minimizes reliance on middlemen, which can significantly cut down on both transaction costs and delays associated with conventional payroll systems, benefiting businesses with a multi-country presence. Adopting stablecoins into payroll systems could drastically affect Chainlink's price trajectory. Accurate off-chain data like fiat exchange rates and compliance triggers will be essential for secure, programmable payroll. Improved Cross-Border Efficiency: Stablecoins facilitate quicker settlements, reducing forex risks and fees for global workforces. Chainlink's oracles provide necessary liquidity data and conversions, making it a key player in these payroll systems. Institutional Integration: With more financial institutions exploring stablecoin usage, Chainlink's established presence as a trusted oracle network could serve it well. This increased transaction volume could translate into higher LINK token utilization and value. Changing Market Perception: As stablecoins become an accepted part of the financial landscape, Chainlink's narrative will shift from a speculative asset to the backbone of real-world finance. This shift could draw institutional investments and improve its overall market perception. Significant Price Catalysts: The integration of stablecoins in payroll could spark a notable price surge for LINK if Chainlink manages to capture a considerable market share in this growing industry. Though Chainlink is currently the leader in oracles, emerging competitors present new challenges. Latency Issues: Competitors like Pyth Network, which provide near-instant updates, hold an advantage for financial applications. Chainlink must match their performance or risk losing ground in high-speed trading environments. If Chainlink can't lower its validation costs, it may struggle to attract new users. Competitors able to provide better scalability might capture more users. Focused Applications: Some competitors have chosen specific niches, such as first-party oracles for particular industries. Chainlink occupies a crucial and increasingly significant space within the blockchain ecosystem. As an essential link between smart contracts and real-world data, its value is key to the growth of decentralized applications. Investors should keep a close eye on regulatory changes, technological innovations, and shifting competitive landscapes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $3,000 and dipped. ETH is now showing bearish signs and might slide further below $2,880. Ethereum price failed to stay above the $3,000 pivot level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin. ETH price dipped below $2,980 to enter a bearish zone. Besides, there was a break below a rising channel with support at $2,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls are able to protect more losses below $2,880, the price could start a fresh recovery. Immediate resistance is seen near the $2,980 level. An upside break above the $3,120 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,200 resistance zone or even $3,220 in the near term. If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,000 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. The next key support sits at $2,720. Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.
