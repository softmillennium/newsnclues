                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump raised the prospect of War Secretary Pete Hegseth and military courts looking into Democrats the president has accused of sedition for their appeal to active service members and intelligence operatives to defy illegal orders from their commander in chief. I know they're looking into it militarily,” Trump said. Trump has seized on a video this week made by Democratic lawmakers who served either in the military or the country's national security apparatus, in which they implore military and intelligence personnel to disobey orders they allege are unlawful without specifying which ones. In multiple social media posts, Trump this week described their call as “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” But during his appearance on Kilmeade's program, Trump remained adamant that he is not “threatening them,” while insisting, “I think they're in serious trouble.” "I'm not threatening them, but I think they're in serious trouble," says @POTUS on Democrat Members of Congress encouraging members of the military to defy orders from their commander-in-chief. "These are people that, in my opinion, broke the law." “I think what they did is really bad,” he added. These are people that, in my opinion, broke the law. I can't tell you, but they broke the law. If I ever said that and there were a Democrat as president, all hell would have broken loose.” Trump's comments were preceded by similar ones by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday, in which she also emphasized the president was not threatening the lawmakers, Sens. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ), in addition to Reps. Jason Crow (D-CO), Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Chris Deluzio (D-PA), and Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), after they shared the video on Tuesday. “Many in this room want to talk about the president's response, but not what brought the president to responding in this way,” Leavitt told reporters. It can lead to chaos, and that's what these members of Congress who swore an oath to abide by the Constitution are essentially encouraging.” Sedition is a federal crime under 18 United States Code Section 2384, but it is punishable by fines and imprisonment for up to 20 years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Holding votes on a Friday typically dwindles the number of members present. A similar vote on socialism was taken in February 2023, and 19 Democrats who had either voted for the resolution or “present” back then switched their votes to no on Friday. Troy Carter (LA), Madeline Dean (PA), Glenn Ivey (MD), Jonathan Jackson (IL), Rob Menendez (NJ), Joe Neguse (CO), Terri Sewell (AL), Mike Thompson (CA), Bennie Thompson (MS), and Lauren Underwood (IL), as well as Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Those who switched from present to no among Democrats were Reps. Shontel Brown (OH), Jasmine Crockett (TX), Veronica Escobar (TX), Val Hoyle (OR), Sara Jacobs (CA), Teresa Leger Fernandez (NM), Doris Matsui (CA), and Mary Gay Scanlon (PA). Democratic leadership, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), voted to denounce socialism, whereas high profile figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) joined her progressive colleagues in voting against the resolution. Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez has been a staunch ally of the new mayor. Pelosi's vote comes as she prepares to retire from Congress. It will be the first-ever meeting between the political figures and comes as a crucial point after Mamdani, a self-proclaimed socialist, overwhelmingly beat his independent and Republican competitors. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, just one day before election night. Trump also threatened to withhold federal funding from New York City if Mamdani won. WHAT TO EXPECT FROM TRUMP's OVAL OFFICE MEETING WITH ‘COMMUNIST' MAMDANI On the other hand, Mamdani has slammed Trump for his immigration policies and deportation of undocumented citizens, while also critiquing the president's economic agenda. Affordability was the main focus of Mamdani's campaign and of the larger 2025 election cycle, securing victories for both centrist gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia, as well as a win for Mamdani, who sits much further to the left. It is rare to see a national party focus so much on a mayor, but the GOP is working diligently to make Mamdani their new boogeyman heading into the 2026 midterm elections, in which they will be on defense.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Deputy Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations told members of the Security Council that it has reviewed a “draft” U.S. peace plan to end its war with Russia, but that it would not give away any territory. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz briefs the media in Berlin, Germany, Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2025. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday cautiously welcomed a U.S. proposal to end Moscow's nearly four-year war in Ukraine, saying it “could form the basis of a final peace settlement.” Apparently, Ukraine and its European allies are still under illusions and the dream of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia on the battlefield.” Earlier Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an address that his country is at a pivotal point in its four-year fight to defeat Russia's invasion, with Ukrainians potentially facing a choice between standing up for their sovereign rights or losing American support as leaders negotiate a U.S. peace proposal. The U.S. plan contains many of Putin's longstanding demands while offering limited security guarantees to Ukraine. It foresees Ukraine handing over territory to Russia, something Zelenskyy has repeatedly ruled out, reduces the size of it army and blocks its coveted path to NATO membership. Zelenskyy pledged to hold constructive discussions with Washington at what he called “truly one of the most difficult moments in our history.” Zelenskyy said he spoke for almost an hour Friday with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll about the peace proposal. U.S. President Donald Trump in a radio interview on Friday said that he wants an answer from Zelenskyy on his 28-point plan by Thursday, but says an extension is possible to finalize terms. “I've had a lot of deadlines, but if things are working well, you tend to extend the deadlines,” Trump said in an interview on the Brian Kilmeade Show on Fox News Radio. “But Thursday is it — we think an appropriate time.” While Zelenskyy has offered to negotiate with the U.S. and Russia, he signaled Ukraine may not get everything it wants and has to confront the possibility of losing American support if it makes a stand. “We will work calmly with America and all partners,” he said, but insisted on fair treatment. He urged Ukrainians to “stop fighting” each other, in a possible reference to a major corruption scandal that has brought fierce criticism of the government, and said peace talks next week “will be very difficult.” Zelenskyy spoke earlier by phone with the leaders of Germany, France and the United Kingdom, who assured him of their continued support, as European officials scrambled to respond to the U.S. proposals that apparently caught them unawares. European countries see their own futures at stake in Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion and have insisted on being consulted in peace efforts. “Russia's war against Ukraine is an existential threat to Europe. But how it ends matters,” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in Brussels. “Russia has no legal right whatsoever to any concessions from the country it invaded. Ultimately, the terms of any agreement are for Ukraine to decide.” Trump in his radio interview pushed back against the notion that the settlement, which offers plentiful concessions to Russia, would embolden Putin to carry out further malign action on his European neighbors. I mean, this was supposed to be a one-day war that has been four years now.” Many of the proposals are “quite concerning,” the official said, adding that a bad deal for Ukraine would also be a threat to broader European security. European Council President Antonio Costa in Johannesburg said of the U.S. proposals: “The European Union has not been communicated (about) any plans in (an) official manner.” Ukrainian officials said they were weighing the U.S. proposals, and Zelenskyy said he expected to talk to Trump about it in coming days. A U.S. team began drawing up the plan soon after U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Rustem Umerov, a top adviser to Zelenskyy, according to a senior Trump administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. However, Umerov on Friday denied that version of events. He said technical talks between the U.S. and Ukraine were continuing in Kyiv. “We are thoughtfully processing the partners' proposals within the framework of Ukraine's unchanging principles — sovereignty, people's security, and a just peace,” he said.

(AP Photo/George Walker IV) But now funding from President Donald Trump's allies and an appearance by former Vice President Kamala Harris have turned the Dec. 2 contest into a marquee political battle with potential consequences for next year's midterms. If places like Tennessee's 7th congressional district seem within reach, the party could expand its list of targets next year. MAGA Inc., a Trump-supporting super PAC, has reported more than $1 million in spending so far to support Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate and former Army helicopter pilot who served in combat tours overseas. With the election taking place just days after Thanksgiving, “I'm very concerned that we could be caught with our pants down,” said Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the request for Trump to campaign for Van Epps, which was disclosed by two people with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. State Rep. Aftyn Behn, the Democratic candidate and progressive community organizer, is getting national support of her own, including a recent visit by party chair Ken Martin and $1 million in television and digital advertising from the House Majority PAC reported on Friday. In four previous special House elections that were completed this year, the Democratic candidate exceeded Harris' vote share by an average of 9 percentage points. Tennessee organized a special election after Republican Rep. Mark Green, first elected in 2018, retired earlier this year. Green won the district by 21 percentage points in 2024, and Trump scored a similar margin. It was one of three seats redrawn in redistricting in 2022 that attempted to erode the influence of Nashville, the state's largest city and a Democratic bastion. He pledged to focus on lowering costs and helping veterans, plus supporting Trump's immigration enforcement and rules preventing transgender women from playing on women's sports teams. Behn, who describes herself as a “pissed off social worker,” narrowly won Democrats' four-way primary. Like Democrats who emerged victorious in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere earlier this month, Behn has been hammering away at concerns about affordability. She's emphasized her proposal to eliminate a state tax on groceries. Behn has condemned Trump's tax and spending legislation known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill” and his tariffs, both of which Van Epps supports. Democratic allies hope to undermine Van Epps by promoting Jon Thorp, a conservative independent candidate in the race. Your Community PAC, which has spent more than $16 million supporting Democratic candidates across the country since last year, is sending out mailers that encourage Republicans to vote for Thorp by describing Van Epps as a “hedge fund billionaire-backed RINO.” Conservatives for American Excellence, backed by megadonor Ken Griffin, is spending over $600,000 in advertisements opposing Behn, according to a campaign finance report filed this week. And Club for Growth, a pro-school voucher group heavily involved during the primary, is targeting Behn over past remarks where she described herself as “radical.” The group has spent $300,000 on advertising so far. Chip Saltsman, a Tennessee political strategist not involved in the race, said the slew of spending does not change his expectation that Van Epps will win. He suggested that Republicans take “a extra couple swigs of Pepto Bismol on election night.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Gunmen attacked a Catholic boarding school in a western region of Nigeria and abducted schoolchildren and staff on Friday, the latest in a spate of abductions in Africa's most populous country just days after 25 schoolgirls were abducted in a neighboring state. Local media broadcaster Arise TV said that 52 schoolchildren were abducted. It described St. Mary's as a secondary school, which in Nigeria would serve children between the ages of 12 and 17. A satellite image shows that the school compound is attached to an adjoining primary school, with more than 50 classroom and dormitory buildings. It's located near a major road linking the towns of Yelwa and Mokwa. Dauda Chekula, 62, said that four of his grandchildren, ranging in age from 7 to 10, were among the schoolchildren abducted. “We don't know what is happening now, because we have not heard anything since this morning,” Chekula said. “Regrettably, St. Mary's School proceeded to reopen and resume academic activities without notifying or seeking clearance from the State Government, thereby exposing pupils and the staff to avoidable risk,” it read. The Catholic Diocese of Kontagora said in a statement that a security staffer was “badly shot” during the attack. The abductions took place days after gunmen on Monday attacked a high school and abducted 25 schoolgirls in the neighboring Kebbi state, in Maga, around 170 kilometers (105 miles) from Papiri. In a separate attack on Monday in Kwara state, which borders Niger state, gunmen attacked a church, killing two people. He said that the kidnappers are demanding a ransom of 100 million naira ($69,000) for each person taken. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu canceled his trip to this weekend's Group of 20 summit in South Africa over the recent events. “We will use every instrument of the state to bring these girls home and to ensure that the perpetrators of this wickedness face the full weight of justice,” Shettima said during a visit to Kebbi state on Wednesday. Authorities say the gunmen are mostly former herders who have taken up arms against farming communities after clashes between them over strained resources. Abductions have come to define the insecurity prevailing in Africa's most populous nation. At least 1,500 students have been abducted in the region since Boko Haram jihadi extremists seized 276 Chibok schoolgirls more than a decade ago. But bandits are also active in the region, and analysts say gangs often target schools to gain attention. While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say that the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur. Analysts and residents blame the insecurity on a failure to prosecute known attackers, and the rampant corruption that limits weapons supplies to security forces while ensuring a steady supply to the gangs. Yohanna Buru, a pastor and head of the Peace Revival And Reconciliation Foundation, an organization focused on interfaith dialogue, called on authorities to increase security around schools in areas affected by the security crisis. “If the government was doing enough, then rampant kidnappings all over the country would not have happened,” he said. “It's as if they don't care about the future of our children.” Mohammed Ibrahim contributed to this report from Kaduna.</p>

Blendon Township police officer Connor Grubb greets a family member Friday, Nov. 21, 2025 after the not guilty verdict is read at Franklin County Common Pleas Court in Columbus, Ohio on Friday, Nov. 21, 2025. COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The Ohio police officer who shot and killed Ta'Kiya Young, a pregnant Black mother who had been accused of shoplifting, was acquitted on all counts Friday, including murder. Blendon Township police officer Connor Grubb, who faced up to life in prison, appeared stalwart as he heard the verdict. Young's grandmother collapsed into sobs at the decision, shouting “It's not right! This is not right!” The judge then told Grubb he was free to leave. “If you look at these recent police killings in Columbus, you have officers who have an irrational fear with no weapons involved or folks doing very minimal behavior that they escalate into a murder.” Defense attorney Mark Collins said Grubb and his family are relieved, but that it's wrong to suggest the officer was untouched by the death of Young and her unborn daughter. “Trust me, you didn't get to hear from him because the government put his statement out, but he took a life on duty and realized another's life after the fact, and to walk around with that is a difficult situation.” At the same time, Collins called it “unconscionable” that a law enforcement officer would be indicted for felony murder in such a case. He said legislators should fix Ohio's grand jury system. Grubb had pleaded not guilty to murder, involuntary manslaughter and felonious assault in the death of Young, 21, on Aug. 24, 2023. Bodycam recordings showed Young refusing to exit her parked car outside a Kroger in suburban Columbus, and then turning her steering wheel to the right before the vehicle began slowly rolling forward toward Grubb, who fired one shot into her chest through the windshield. Franklin County Common Pleas Judge David Young, no relation to Ta'Kiya, dropped four of 10 counts relating to the death of Young's baby, agreeing with defense attorneys that prosecutors failed to present proof that Grubb knew Young was seven months' pregnant when he shot her. Jurors were shown the bodycam video and heard testimony from a use-of-force expert, an accident reconstructionist, a police policy expert and Sgt. Erick Moynihan, the officer who with Grubb had ordered Young out of her car. He attended the trial, but prosecutors were unable to question him directly. Grubb and Moynihan had approached Young's parked car about a report that she was suspected of stealing alcohol from a Kroger store in the Columbus suburb. Young could be heard asking them, “Are you going to shoot me?” Then, she put on a turn signal and her car rolled slowly forward toward Grubb, who fired a single bullet into her chest, the recording showed. In the statement, Grubb said he positioned himself in front of Young's vehicle to provide backup and to protect other people. Police said they tried to save her life, but she was mortally wounded. Young and her unborn daughter were pronounced dead at a hospital. He said his law firm found a witness who saw Young put down bottles of alcohol as she left the grocery store.</p>

New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who wants to make buses free, was asked where funding would come from for the policy if the governor isn't for increasing taxes. The House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted in favor of a resolution condemning socialism Friday morning, with several Democrats crossing the aisle to rebuke "socialist policies" in the U.S. following Zohran Mamdani's recent election as the mayor-elect of New York City. Two members, Rep. Deborah Ross, D-Pa., and Rep. Janelle Bynum, D-Ore., voted present. Notably, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. — who endorsed Mamdani just days before the mayoral election — also voted in favor of the measure. The resolution, introduced by Rep. Maria Salazar, R-Fla., highlights a list of the economic system's failures and serves as a rebuke of political forces inching toward more socialist platforms. Among other items, it asserts that socialism has led to famine and mass murder under the Cuban Castro regime, the Chinese rule of Mao Zedong, the ongoing Venezuelan regime of Nicolás Maduro and others. Rep. Maria Salazar, R-Fla., speaks during a roundtable discussion at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Mar. While the resolution itself isn't binding, the congressional rebuke comes as socialism — and its political momentum — have taken up a larger share of the national spotlight in recent months. Progressive candidates like Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and others have continued to push for an increased government role in public services like healthcare and education. That's dovetailed with new champions of progressive policies like Mamdani, a self-described socialist. The resolution also comes as Mamdani is set to meet with President Donald Trump on Friday. Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said he believes socialism is incompatible with the American ideal of freedom. New York City Democratic Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani celebrates as he takes the stage at his election night watch party at the Brooklyn Paramount in New York City on Nov. 4, 2025. That, he believes, is a trait shared by other forms of oppressive government. "We have a responsibility to defend the American core of capitalism, free markets and liberty [against] socialism, democratic socialism, communism, authoritarianism, fascism," Donalds said. While increasingly progressive wings of the Democratic Party have enjoyed momentum in recent months at a time when the party has struggled to unite behind a cohesive brand, not all Democrat lawmakers view socialism's emergence as something the party should embrace. Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., one of the members who voted for the disapproval resolution on Friday, has opposed overtly socialist platforms, urging his Democrat colleagues to return to a more centrist path. "I talk about being a new kind of old-fashioned Democrat and giving policy prescriptions about what we need to do to address people's concerns about the economy and affordability and the cost of living and wages," Suozzi wrote on X earlier this month. "The answer is not the populism of Donald Trump or Zohran Mamdani — it's about giving specific policy prescriptions."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“High Horse: The Black Cowboy,” a new docuseries from Jordan Peele's a Monkeypaw Productions, highlights who it says are the first American cowboys – Black men. The three-part project, now streaming on Peacock, focuses on the history of Black American cowboys, their erasure from Hollywood, and the triumphs and struggles of present-day African American cowboy communities around America. (Nov. 21) (AP interviews and production by Gary Gerard Hamilton) This image released by Peacock shows Damon Hopkins, left, in a scene from the documentary “High Horse: The Black Cowboy.” (Troy Harvey/Peacock via AP) Black people across this country – East Coast to West Coast – have been prevalent in this space for years,” said Bun B, who, with partner Pimp C, became pillars of southern hip-hop, creating hits to help it become today's current dominant rap genre. Bun, an ambassador for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo and the first and only Black male hip-hop headliner in its history, shares his experiences in “High Horse: The Black Cowboy,” a new docuseries executive produced by Jordan Peele and his Monkeypaw Productions. “Being a Black performer at this 90-plus year concert series has been amazing for me, but it's also given me a deeper perspective of understanding the Black cowboys' place in American history,” Bun told The Associated Press. “It's really energized me to try to fill this void of confusion where people who are somewhat aware typically will have a distorted view.” Directed by Jason Perez and streaming on Peacock, the three-part docuseries is an extension of Peele's 2022 blockbuster film “Nope.” Starring Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer, the movie follows siblings who operate the only Black-owned horse ranch in California, training horses for Hollywood productions. “At Monkeypaw, we really think erasure is a horror story.” In addition to creating a more complete composite of the Old West, it documents how Black cowboy communities remain vibrant in various pockets across the country, while following their struggles and triumphs. It arrives amid the nation's current political flashpoints. Peele, Glynn Turman, Pam Grier, Tina Knowles and Rick Ross, who all make appearances, speak to their own experiences with cowboy culture. R&B legend Raphael Saadiq provides the project's original score. “This is an important time in history, and I can see the writing on the wall,” said Turman, a New York City-raised actor who's lived on a California ranch for decades. Turman, the 78-year-old Emmy winner who received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in July, is no stranger to using entertainment to educate. He starred as retired Army colonel Bradford Taylor on the hit '90s sitcom “A Different World,” a spinoff from “The Cosby Show” set on the campus of a historically Black college. That topic reached a pop cultural fever pitch in recent years, thanks to inflection points such Beyoncé's “Cowboy Carter” album and her subsequent album of the year win at the Grammys in February. There's also Lil Nas X's record-breaking 2019 smash “Old Town Road,” the viral line dance for “Boots on the Ground” by 803Fresh, western-themed Hollywood productions like “The Harder They Fall” and “Lawmen: Bass Reeves,” and Ivan McClellan's book, “Eight Seconds: Black Rodeo Culture.” Bun says the heart of “High Horse” is examining this ignored — or erased — slice of history to gain greater insight about the country overall. “This will turn everything that you know about the American cowboy on its head in the right way, and put these things into proper historical context.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Thursday threatened to pull $75 million in federal funds from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation if it does not revoke commercial driver's licenses given to “ineligible and unqualified” drivers. The threat comes after the Transportation Department's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration conducted a nationwide audit that alleged the state violated federal safety regulations through its illegal issuance of nondomiciled commercial driver's licenses, including to illegal immigrants. The FMCSA's review found that PennDOT issued nondomiciled CDLs with expiration dates far beyond drivers' authorized stays in the United States and failed to require applicants to provide any proof of lawful presence. If the state wishes to keep the funding, Duffy demanded that it must immediately pause the issuance of all new, renewed, transferred, or upgraded nondomiciled CDLs or commercial learner's permits. He said it must also conduct an extensive internal audit to identify any CDLs issued that do not comply with federal regulations, policies, practices, or procedures. The demands follow a string of actions by President Donald Trump and Duffy to remove unqualified drivers from the U.S. truck driving industry. Trump signed an executive order in April directing DOT to focus on roadway safety. Duffy announced an emergency action plan in September to reduce the number of eligible applicants of nondomiciled CDLs and CLPs. The emergency action follows Duffy's announcement of a nationwide audit in June, which highlighted several states that did not comply with federal regulations when issuing nondomiciled CDLs.Prior to the audit, Duffy signed an order in May that announced new guidelines to strengthen English language enforcement for commercial truck operators. The new guidance requires commercial motor vehicle drivers who fail to comply with FMCSA's long-standing English-language proficiency requirements to be decommissioned.</p>

The Iran-backed Lebanese terrorist movement Hezbollah is rebuilding its military arsenal on Israel's northern border, as experts warn that another war between the two sides could be on the horizon. On Wednesday, IDF spokesman Nadav Shoshani, said Hezbollah had engaged "in a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement." Hezbollah fighters attend the funeral of their commander Wissam al-Tawil, in the village of Khirbet Selm, south Lebanon, Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2024. A war of words that has unfolded in Lebanon show longstanding schisms in the small country over Hezbollah, now amplified by the militant group's role in the Lebanon-Israel border clashes and by fears that an already crisis-hit Lebanon could be dragged into an all-out war. Sarit Zehavi, a leading Israeli security expert on Hezbollah from the Israel Alma Research and Education Center, told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah does not currently "have the capability to carry out an October invasion. They can send in a few terrorists. Fox News Digital exclusively reported last year on Hezbollah's war plan to invade northern Israel and carry out a scorched-earth campaign against the Jewish state. A day after the Iran-backed Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and massacred over 1,200 people, Hezbollah launched missile attacks against Israel. A strike against Hezbollah that the Israeli Air Force says was carried out overnight. Zehavi said, "Both the IDF and Hezbollah are very active. The IDF is very active to stop the rehabilitation of Hezbollah and Hezbollah is very active in rebuilding. Hezbollah is relying more on manufacturing rockets." Zehavi, who lives in northern Israel, said that "almost half of Israeli attacks on Hezbollah are south of the Litani river. We see a lot of investment from Hezbollah in drones, short-range rockets, mortars and anti-tank missiles." On Tuesday in Germany, prosecutors started a trial against an alleged Hezbollah member running "an extensive drone program for some time." The German Federal Prosecutor's Office said the suspected Hezbollah operative Fadel Z joined Hezbollah more than 10 years ago and worked as a "foreign operator" for the group's drone program in 2022 in Spain and Germany. Zehavi said it suffered a defeat of its leadership via the Mossad pager attack on its commanders. Hezbollah fighters carry the coffin of four fallen comrades who were killed Tuesday after their handheld pagers exploded, in the southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, on Wednesday, Sept. 18. She outlined Israel's main defense strategy against Hezbollah. First, the IDF has positions in Syria and Lebanon. "We cannot have civilians on the front line. This means when an Israeli woman opens her window and used to see a Hezbollah flag, she now sees an Israeli flag. This gives her a sense of security. She estimates Hezbollah has 50,000 terrorists and 50,000 reservists. The IDF made dramatic advances in eradicating Hezbollah's missile arsenal. Edy Cohen, a Lebanese-born Israeli scholar of Hezbollah, said, "There is no lack of arms for Hezbollah in Beirut and Lebanon. Lately, we saw many reports that Hezbollah received arms from Syria and Iran is trying to send arms by civilian Iranian airplanes." Lebanese Hezbollah fighters are taking part in cross-border raids, part of a large-scale military exercise, in Aaramta bordering Israel on May 21, 2023 ahead of the anniversary of Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000. He said there is enormous pressure on Hezbollah and every week Israel is killing Hezbollah operative. Cohen said the IDF is gathering intelligence information about Hezbollah's arsenal and attacking almost every day its leaders and operatives. Hezbollah terrorists are taking part in cross-border raids, part of a large-scale military exercise, in Aaramta, bordering Israel, on May 21, 2023 ahead of the anniversary of Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000. He warned that because "Hezbollah said it will not disarm its militia ... the big war will come." Fox News Digital reported in early November that Trump's U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Thomas Barrack, who also serves as envoy to Syria, said that Lebanon is a "failed state," because of its "paralyzed government." He also noted that Hezbollah retains 40,000 fighters and between 15,000 and 20,000 rockets and missiles, noting the terror group pays its militia $2,200 per month, whereas the Lebanese Armed Forces soldiers earn $275 a month and have inferior equipment as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Coast Guard on Thursday issued a memo that reclassifies swastikas and nooses as “hate symbols,” in a rapid about-face after facing intense scrutiny for a previous policy change which downplayed their display as merely “potentially divisive.” Since 2023, Coast Guard policy had said displaying the symbols “constitutes a potential hate incident.” In the updated policy first reported by The Post on Thursday, and issued by the Coast Guard last week, that language had been changed to referring to those symbols simply as “potentially divisive.” That policy had been set to take effect in December. The newest policy, released yesterday, says: “Divisive or hate symbols and flags are prohibited.” It lists swastikas, nooses and other emblems that have been adopted or co-opted by hate groups. An agency spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, also denied in a post to social media on Friday that the Coast Guard was “backtracking” by issuing the latest memo. “The 2025 policy is not changing—USCG issued a lawful order that doubles down on our *current* policies prohibiting the display, distribution or use of hate symbols by Coast Guard personnel,” she said. Swastikas epitomize Adolf Hitler's murderous regime in Nazi Germany, which killed millions of people during the Holocaust and sparked a war in which more than 400,000 American service members — including about 1,900 who served in the Coast Guard — also died. “He came by the office and assured us that there is an across-the-board prohibition on hate symbols, including swastikas and nooses,” Underwood said in a video statement. “Any display, use or promotion of such symbols, as always, will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished,” he said. “Symbols such as swastikas, nooses and other extremist or racist imagery violate our core values and are treated with the seriousness they warrant under current policy.” The military at times has struggled with combatting extremism among their service members. A 2020 Pentagon report found that extremist views were not widespread in the military, but said the issue was still urgent due to the ability of people with military experience to carry out “high-impact events.” During President Joe Biden's term, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in 2021 ordered a staggered pause in operations across the military so commanders could have discussions with their service members about the issue of extremism. During his confirmation hearing in January, Hegseth said a focus on extremism has “created a climate inside our ranks that feel political when it hasn't ever been political.” CNN's Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran ended its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency on Thursday after the United Nations watchdog passed a resolution backing further inspections of the Islamic Republic's nuclear facilities. The measure was meant to demand information about the status of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile and nuclear sites that the United States and Israel bombed during a brief conflict in June. In response, the Iranian Foreign Ministry rejected the approved IAEA measure as an “illegal and unjustified” action. Preceding the June bombing campaign, the IAEA published a separate report in late May that concluded that Iran's “rapid accumulation of highly enriched uranium is of serious concern.” Now, Iran's foreign minister is calling into question the body's “credibility and independence.” “It should be noted that the Islamic Republic of Iran had signed a new framework of cooperation with the agency on September 9, under which inspections of certain nuclear facilities had resumed.” There are international concerns over Iran's uranium because the element, if enriched at high levels, could be used to develop nuclear weapons. Iran insists its nuclear energy program is peaceful and maintains it is not enriching uranium anymore. Iran's foreign minister says it is open to resuming the talks as long as both sides move toward a “fair and balanced deal.” President Donald Trump indicated this week he is open to restarting the nuclear talks with Iran, which he claimed “very badly” wants to make a deal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But a fresh look at the site, called Monte Sierpe, or “serpent mountain,” may help archaeologists to decipher why ancient people constructed it hundreds of years ago. Hypotheses about the holes' use have included defense, accounting, storage, gardening, water collection, and fog capturing purposes. People who support ancient astronaut theory, a belief that aliens are real and shaped early civilizations on Earth, have also suggested extraterrestrial connections. Oldest and biggest Maya temple was built to depict the cosmos “Why would ancient peoples make over 5,000 holes in the foothills of southern Peru?” said lead study author Dr. Jacob Bongers, digital archaeologist at the University of Sydney and a Visiting Research Fellow at the Australian Museum Research Institute. “We don't know why they are here, but we have produced some promising new data that yield important clues and support novel theories about the site's use.” The sheer scale of Monte Sierpe has made it difficult to study, but drone technology has allowed for a new perspective, said study coauthor Charles Stanish, professor in the department of anthropology at the University of South Florida. The drone photography shows them to be organized into roughly 60 distinct sections that are separated by empty spaces, Bongers said. His team was also able to identify patterns — for example, a section of 12 rows that alternate between seven and eight holes, suggesting the organization is not random, he added. Crops and other goods may have been placed in these baskets or deposited in the holes, which could have been lined with plant material. It's possible that structures were also built over or near the holes, Bongers said, but there is no remaining evidence if any architecture ever existed. The team believes that indigenous people of the pre-Inca Chincha Kingdom from Peru's coast and highland may have come to exchange goods and barter using their own goods, rather than currency. “Monte Sierpe is a site that has truly been a mystery in Andean archaeology, and I am excited to see this research being done,” Ogburn wrote in an email. While the team is still carrying out more radiocarbon dating to determine an accurate timeline, they believe it was constructed during Peru's Late Intermediate Period, between AD 1000 and 1400, which aligns with the pre-Inca civilization's use of the site. It's possible that Monte Sierpe only included a few sections of holes as a barter marketplace before being expanded under the Inca empire.Or, it may have been completed before the Incas arrived. “In a sense, Monte Sierpe could have been an ‘Excel spreadsheet' for the Inca Empire,” Bongers said. The segmented organization of Monte Sierpe mirrors an Inca counting system involving knotted strings called a khipu. “The numbers knotted on these cords show an intricate set of arithmetic interrelationships, suggesting that it is a surviving record” of the accounting operations that may have been used at Monte Sierpe, Bongers said. Ancient temple could reveal secrets of a lost society that predates the Inca Empire Members of Bongers' team continue to study khipus from Peru to test any potential numerical relationship between Monte Sierpe's design and the Inca counting system. Given that the marketplace and accounting systems would have operated in two very different ways, and that the connection between the holes and Inca khipus is tenuous, more support is needed to be convincing, Ogburn said. As new research aims to unlock the secrets of Monte Sierpe, future findings could provide a glimpse into a piece of history that has not been well preserved. Dr. Christian Mader, a research group leader at the University of Bonn's Center for Dependency and Slavery Studies in Germany, believes the paper is an important contribution to Andean archaeology, as well as the study of ancient economies. While Mader did not participate in this research, his work has focused on pre-Hispanic economies and exchange. “Their proposal that the site served as a marketplace during the Late Intermediate period and as an accounting device for goods and tribute under the Inca Empire is interesting and convincing,” Mader wrote in an email. “And this paper illustrates how much we still have to learn about Indigenous economic mechanisms.” Monte Sierpe presents a puzzle that is challenging to interpret, Bongers said, and part of the puzzle is presenting hypotheses, rather than arguments, that can be further tested to better understand local heritage. “The narratives we build about local cultural heritage have real impact,” Bongers said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“A lot of our customers have been scared to come out.” Some patrons now afraid to leave their homes are taking Sav/Way up on its offer of free home delivery. Inside the store, rows of tortillas and shoulder-high stacks of canned hominy sit largely untouched, while the jewelry and travel kiosks are dark. A phone rings inside the store's main office, and seconds later, Duran's manager comes out. “They don't have no right to be in here,” she says. All along Central Avenue, the heart of this immigrant business community in East Charlotte, stark black-and-white signs now posted outside most businesses warn: “ICE is not welcome here.” The immigration action called Operation Charlotte's Web has shocked and frightened the community, with hundreds of arrests and dozens of minority-owned businesses closed out of fear for their customers and their workers. Charlotte is the latest stop in a virtual four-corners tour of the country by Border Patrol Chief Control Agent Gregory Bovino and his agents, who this year have made weekslong visits to Los Angeles and Chicago, with New Orleans expected next. In contrast to their Windy City presence, Bovino and at least some of his team left Charlotte on Thursday, a Homeland Security official said, as elevated immigration enforcement continues. The strong shows of force against migrants in Democratic-led cities have become a cornerstone of the Trump administration's intense immigration enforcement agenda. In the Charlotte area, more than 250 people were arrested over four days of immigration raids, the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday. “Criminal records of those arrested include known gang membership, aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony larceny, simple assault, hit and run, possession of stolen goods, shoplifting, DUI, DWI, and illegal re-entry after prior deportation, a felony,” the agency said. “Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. Jerry Ortiz stands alongside Central Avenue, waving a massive Puerto Rican flag featuring a tree frog called the coquí – with a songlike call that sounds like its name – as passing drivers honk their support. Now, the car horns are music to his ears. But not every note of Central Avenue's cacophony supports his message. It's not an entirely surprising message in a county where a third of the votes cast in the last presidential election were for Donald Trump. “Something is wrong that they don't appreciate us here,” he says. While Ortiz keeps watch along the street, bakery owner Manolo Betancur stops by several times a day to make sure federal agents haven't returned and to talk to the growing crowd that cheers loudly as he raises a large American flag alongside the coquí. “My biggest concern right now is our children need to have their fathers and mothers next to them,” Betancur says. “A lot of these people are so scared, they're not going to have Thanksgiving (dinner),” adds Ortiz, standing a few feet from the locked entrance to Manolo's. Even as the fear forced Betancur to close his business, supporters are still paying for cakes from Manolo's through the bakery's website. More protesters show up outside Manolo's as midday approaches. Brandi Yanes is supporting people who now feel the pain she felt in 2018, when her husband was detained by ICE after a sheriff's office identified him as undocumented following an altercation at a bar, she says. “Once he came home, my daughter was 6 months old. Though they talk on the phone almost daily, Yanes' daughter – now almost 8 years old – hasn't seen her father in person in two years. “Now, with (immigration agents) being back here, and she's seeing what's going on, she's waking up at 2 or 3 in the morning, crying,” says Yanes. “She's asking, ‘Are my friends going to be OK? Betancur looks on at the crowd, growing to dozens by midafternoon, with appreciation. Dianna Ward gave up a high-paying corporate career to start her own tour business, and she knows how to weave in history lessons at Charlotte's hot spots. “Look over here,” she says, pointing to a row of headstones from the 1940s. “This has always been an immigrant community,” says Ward. Ward points to million-dollar historic homes, Vietnamese restaurants, an Irish pub and bohemian art as signs of her neighborhood's diversity. “But this is my favorite place,” she says while passing the Central Avenue location of Tacos El Nevado. With the earlier threat of federal agents turning out to be false alarm, things pick up a bit by midday at the Sav/Way, where the bustling lunch counter is serving up massive tortas piled impossibly high with meat and jalapeños. Unlike an average day before Operation Charlotte's Web, there is no 30-minute wait to be served. Residents in Charlotte, North Carolina, have been protesting an immigration enforcement operation that has led to hundreds of arrests. Locals share their fears over businesses closures and how they are coming together to alert the presence of federal agents. “Even if we lose money, we need to keep it open if we can,” says Sav/Way owner Rudy Montero, whose weathered face and gray moustache are the only visible signs of his 72 years. After decades of seven-day weeks running the store, Montero still comes every day to take deliveries and energetically supervise. “You need to be positive all the time,” says Montero. “I feel terrible about this, but we need to keep going.” Montero's positivity is matched by one of his most enthusiastic lunch counter customers, Jesse Pacheco-Anguiano. Wearing a beaded crucifix over the number “7” on his shirt in honor of Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, he gives new visitors the lowdown on his favorites. Pacheco-Anguiano is a home renovation contractor who depends on day laborers, including a worker he saw being picked up by Border Patrol agents in their now-familiar green uniforms and facemasks at a Lowe's on Saturday, the first day of the Charlotte operation. “I was born and raised here in Charlotte my whole life, and this is the first time in my life I've seen this happen,” he says. Pacheco-Anguiano says the agents left him alone after checking his driver's license, but agents drove away with his worker in two unmarked crossovers, leaving a half-loaded stack of lumber still sticking out of the back of the customized work van with the name of his business covering both sides. They're embarrassing me,” he says in Spanish in a cell phone video of the encounter he took and shared with CNN. DHS has not responded to CNN's questions about this incident. With his business effectively shut down, Pacheco-Anguiano joins the protesters when he can. Starting his own business was a long-time dream, and he wants to use what he has to help those who can't speak up. “I'm just trying to protest for my people who don't have a voice, and I'm here for them,” Pacheco-Anguiano says. The full economic impact of the immigration enforcement operation is not clear, but CharlotteEAST, a nonprofit community organization, says small businesses are struggling. His group looks out for about 400 mom-and-pop businesses in East Charlotte, about half of them owned by immigrants, Asciutto says. “I mean, our whole commercial thoroughfare is shut down, right?” he says. Even as the immigration raids go on, Pacheco-Anguiano continues to get calls from workers asking for a gig, telling him they have no choice as their money begins to dry up, he says. “They're willing to take the risk, but I'm like, ‘Dude, I can't have that on my conscience if anything happens on the way from here to your house,'” says Pacheco-Anguiano. With Manolo's Bakery closed, Pacheco-Anguiano moves down Central Avenue to Panadería Odalys, where traditional Latino pastries sit alongside doughnuts and slices of vanilla-iced cake with sprinkles, loading up a pan of treats for family and friends. About half of the display cases are uncharacteristically empty, a sign of the difficulty owner Cervantes Almanza is having in finding enough staff who feel safe going to work. A new customer is unprepared for the store's cash-only policy, but Almanza gives a silent wave and head shake to show this one is on the house, his gratitude for the community's support. Since Lolo Pendergrast found out Odalys was open but struggling with a reduced staff, she buys as many pastries as she can stuff into an oversized delivery box. “I got a whole bunch now, and I'm just going around town and handing them out to protesters,” she says. “The people that live right next to it, they're our friends, our neighbors, you know, and they're not illegal,” said Pendergrast. “I do not understand how we've gotten so off the rails.” Almanza stays vigilant, looking out his bakery's front door. She runs fast through a residential street into the back of the Odalys parking lot, tailing a pair of unmarked vehicles that quickly blast a siren at oncoming traffic before making sharp right turns onto Central Avenue. Another vehicle follows, with a protester lying on the horn. “I'm born and raised in East Charlotte,” says neighbor Jorge Neri-Moreno, standing next to the shuttered restaurant, “and seeing all this breaks my heart.” Outside Shamrock Gardens Elementary School, parents Patricia Hoke and Laura Blum sit in lawn chairs at the entrance on Anne Street, a large handwritten poster next to them saying, “NO ICE.” They're part of a network of volunteers waiting outside local schools during drop-off and pickup hours with whistles around their necks, watching for federal agents. “And I think it's just a presence for people to know their community's behind them.” There have been no immigration raids outside Charlotte schools so far, but the mothers' work mixes a strong sense of purpose with a lingering sense of paranoia. “Everyone feels on edge, even though it's quiet,” says Hoke. More than 30,000 students – about 20% of district enrollment – were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday as the immigration enforcement mission in Charlotte continued, the district said. To make sure as many East Charlotte schools as possible are covered, many parent volunteers are now communicating using encrypted messaging apps, just in case they're being monitored themselves. “I learned to use Signal yesterday,” says Blum with a slight smile. Before getting back to the protests – his new job for the time being – Pacheco-Anguiano has one more stop to make, pulling his work van into the parking lot at La Reina de las Carnitas, where the smell of fried pork and freshly made tortillas usually draws an overflow crowd. The visitor didn't just come here for food. Just a few years earlier, Pacheco-Anguiano worked here before striking out on his own with the renovation business. Now, he wants to check up on his old boss. Albarrán sees would-be customers doing their own surveillance, trying to figure out whether an officer in the parking lot, or even just an SUV with tinted windows, might be from Border Patrol, making the short trip from a car to his door too risky. “I came from Mexico, and this is my dream,” he says. Pacheco-Anguiano gets another pat on the shoulder and heads out, happy to see his old workplace has been able to stay in operation. Because we're here just trying to get a job done.” CNN's Dianne Gallagher and Lacey Russell contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of President Donald Trump‘s biggest critics in Congress announced Thursday night that he is jumping into the crowded California governor's race. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) revealed his plans on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, confirming his intention to leave the House of Representatives to run for Gov. “Our state, this great state, needs a fighter and a protector, someone who will bring prices down, lift wages up,” Swalwell told Kimmel. Both Swalwell and host Kimmel have been on Trump's bad side for years now, something political analysts say is a badge of honor when running for office in California. Swalwell's decision to run follows allegations that the seven-term House member committed mortgage and tax fraud. He has denied those claims, calling them baseless and accusing the Trump administration of targeting him. Swalwell was a manager during Trump's second impeachment trial in 2021. Similar allegations have been leveled against the president's other perceived enemies. Former Vice President Kamala Harris had also signaled she was interested in taking over Newsom's office when he is termed out in 2026, but ultimately decided against it. “I think he has a shot,” Lincoln Mitchell, a lecturer in the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University who has written extensively on California politics, told the Washington Examiner of Swalwell's chances. “There is no clear front-runner, and he's a skilled politician.” To succeed, Swalwell will have to set himself apart from six Democrats in the race who have uniformly cast themselves as anti-Trump, Mitchell added. Swalwell, one of the most outspoken House Democrats, was raised by Republicans. After graduating from law school, Swalwell went to work as a prosecutor in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, where he led the hate crimes unit. Swalwell was among several politicians contacted by a suspected Chinese intelligence operative, Christine Fang. He cooperated fully with federal investigators and was never accused of wrongdoing. The FBI confirmed that he severed all ties with Fang immediately after receiving a “defensive briefing” in 2015. Kimmel, like Swalwell, has been on the receiving end of Trump's anger. During his opening monologue Wednesday night, Kimmel implied Trump would be a major player exposed in the release of documents related to disgraced New York financier Jeffrey Epstein. “We are carefully following the path of Hurricane Epstein right now. It's expected to make landfall sometime very soon,” Kimmel joked on his show. “Why does ABC Fake News keep Jimmy Kimmel, a man with NO TALENT and VERY POOR TELEVISION RATINGS, on the air?” the president posted on Truth Social early Thursday.</p>

National Park Service rangers cited a man who was seen on video approaching a pack of wild wolves at Yellowstone National Park. National Park Service (NPS) rangers tracked down and cited a man who was seen on video approaching a wild wolf pack at Yellowstone National Park and spraying them with a suspicious substance. Footage showed the unidentified man hopping toward the unbothered animals, seemingly taunting them as they retreated. As he was backing up, the wolves started running toward him, at which point he started spraying an unknown substance in their direction. NPS officials said the incident was reported to rangers, who later found and cited the man. The man, who has not yet been publicly identified, was cited by park rangers, authorities said. "We would recommend all visitors remember the following: Wolves may look beautiful, even fluffy from a distance, and that is part of their appeal. But they are still powerful wild predators, and treating them like pets puts both visitors and the animals at risk," NPS wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital. "The National Park Service reminds all visitors that while our parks are open and accessible, they remain true wilderness. They added when visitors get too close to wildlife, they may feel threatened and act in self-defense, especially if their young are nearby. "It is the visitor's responsibility to maintain a safe distance at all times," the NPS wrote. If an animal moves toward you, back away and give it space. Human interaction can also harm wildlife by becoming habituated to human presence, which increases the likelihood of dangerous encounters and can disrupt hunting, feeding and breeding behaviors, according to the NPS. In some cases, animals that become too familiar with people must be relocated or euthanized to protect public safety.

Fox News correspondent David Spunt reports on the latest in the legal battle that Kilmar Abrego Garcia faces on 'Special Report.' — Lawyers for Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia urged a federal judge in Maryland on Thursday to prohibit the Trump administration from deporting their client to Liberia, the latest twist in a nine-month legal fight that has garnered international attention and dominated headlines and court dockets for months. That effort appeared stunted Thursday after U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis tried and failed to answer a more fundamental question of whether the government had obtained a final order of removal to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. Without that document, she said, Abrego Garcia is "at a minimum" entitled to certain relief under Supreme Court precedent, just as the Justice Department is free to seek relief from higher courts. "You've raised all these arguments, and they all depend on me having a withholding of removal order," Xinis said Thursday. Kilmar Abrego Garcia and Jennifer Vasquez Sura attend a prayer vigil before he enters a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office Aug. 25, 2025, in Baltimore. Though she vowed to issue a ruling "soon," Thursday's hearing ended with little in the way of satisfactory answers for the parties or for Xinis, the federal judge who has presided over Abrego Garcia's civil case and habeas cases since March. "Today was a zero in my view," she noted at one point. Lawyers for the Trump administration had asked Xinis to dissolve an emergency order she handed down in August ordering Abrego Garcia to remain in U.S. immigration custody. They told her earlier this month that they planned to immediately deport him to Liberia pending the dissolution of her emergency order. They previously tried and failed to remove Abrego Garcia to the African countries of Eswatini, Uganda and briefly Ghana. During Thursday's hearing, Xinis again upbraided the Justice Department for failing to tell the court why Costa Rica, a country that previously granted assurances to grant Abrego Garcia legal status in the country and not to return him to his home country of El Salvador, is now apparently off the table. She noted that the government is "saying Costa Rica has now rescinded" its original offer to accept Abrego Garcia but had not provided evidence to the court why. "If you are saying that … I'd love to see the evidence so that I can rest assured this is not just an empty ‘word salad' of an affidavit," she told lawyers for the Trump administration. "I want us to be clear," Xinis said. "I am just interested in finding the notice of removal." Without it, she is expected to order Abrego Garcia's release, citing precedent set in Zadvydas v. Davis, a Supreme Court case that bars the government from indefinitely detaining migrants after removal issues have been ordered. Though the Justice Department would almost certainly seek relief from a higher court as Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign said in October that the government planned to do. The order of release would also likely allow Abrego Garcia to participate in a two-day evidentiary hearing next month in Tennessee centered on his motion to dismiss the case against him for "vindictive" and selective prosecution despite the stated objections of Ensign. Ensign suggested the immigration judge who ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia could not be removed back to his home country of El Salvador had "meant," or implied a final order of removal. "This doesn't look anything like" a final order of removal, Xinis said in response. Before adjourning court, Xinis made clear that this would be the final hearing in Abrego Garcia's habeas case, noting to both sides that she considers the record "closed" and will issue a ruling in the coming days. Still, she told the Justice Department, "I don't even know if it matters here, frankly, because if I make a finding that a final order doesn't exist, then we are done."

Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Bryan Bedford announced Thursday that hundreds of air traffic controllers and technicians who worked during the government shutdown will receive bonus checks. "These patriotic men and women never missed a beat and kept the flying public safe throughout the shutdown," Duffy said in a statement. "Democrats may not care about their financial well-being, but President Trump does." The secretary added, "This award is an acknowledgment of their dedication and a heartfelt appreciation for going above and beyond in service to the nation." Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy announced on Nov. 20 that air traffic controllers who maintained perfect attendance during the government shutdown would receive $10,000 checks. DOT said checks would only be sent to workers who maintained perfect attendance during the recent shutdown and that the payments should arrive by Dec. 9, in time for the holidays. "I am profoundly proud and grateful for the air traffic personnel who worked during extraordinary operational challenges to keep the National Airspace System (NAS) running safely during the longest government shutdown," Bedford said in a statement. "Their dedication represents the highest levels of public service." The announcement came after President Donald Trump previously floated the idea of rewarding controllers who remained on the job, writing in a post on Truth Social last week, "For those Air Traffic Controllers who were GREAT PATRIOTS, and didn't take ANY TIME OFF for the 'Democrat Shutdown Hoax,' I will be recommending a BONUS of $10,000 per person for distinguished service to our Country." Sean Duffy announced that air traffic controllers who worked throughout the government shutdown will receive $10,000 checks. "For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU," Trump added. On Nov. 13, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem handed out $10,000 bonus checks to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport who continued working during the shutdown. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that $10,000 checks would be awarded to air traffic controllers who worked during the government shutdown.
