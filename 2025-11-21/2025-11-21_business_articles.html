                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paramount Skydance, Comcast and Netflix formally submitted takeover offers for Warner Bros. Discovery this week ahead of a deadline for first round offers, according to people familiar with the matter. Paramount Skydance and its advisors had been weighing in recent days whether to submit a higher bid than its previous $23.50-per-share offer that WBD rejected, some of the people said. Both Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal, and Netflix, bid solely for the film and streaming assets, which consists of Warner Bros. studio and HBO Max, the people said. Netflix's offer was expected to be "disciplined" with its bid, one of the people said. Discovery is aiming to have its sale process wrapped up by mid- to late-December, CNBC previously reported. Another round of bids is expected to occur in the coming weeks, some of the people said. Discovery, Paramount, Netflix and Comcast declined to comment. Discovery said it was expanding a strategic review of its business to include a potential sale — even as it carries on with a plan to split into two separate entities: Warner Bros., made up of the film studio and streaming platform, and Discovery Global, which would include the company's pay TV networks like CNN and TNT Sports. Discovery's split has been underway, takeover interest from the newly merged Paramount Skydance led CEO David Zaslav and top brass to open up to a formal sale process. Paramount has already sent multiple letters to WBD's board explaining why its offer of $23.50 per share for all of WBD's assets is in the best interest of shareholders and the company itself. WBD's stock was up about 2% in Friday morning trading at roughly $23.40 per share. The company's share price has increased more than 20% since announcing it was up for sale in October. Paramount CEO David Ellison recently met with Saudi-backed sovereign funds about financing a potential transaction, although the conversations were only preliminary and Ellison and his father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, are prepared to fully finance a transaction, people familiar with the matter said. If Comcast's offer for the studio and streaming assets were to be successful, Discovery Global would move forward with its spinout and current WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels would become CEO. Comcast President and soon-to-be co-CEO Mike Cavanagh recently telegraphed in an earnings call that an acquisition of studio and streaming assets would be complementary to NBCUniversal. Comcast is currently in the process of spinning out its portfolio of cable networks, which includes CNBC, but will retain NBCUniversal. Paramount Skydance, Netflix and Comcast are submitted takeover offers Thursday for Warner Bros. — CNBC's David Faber contributed to this report. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eli Lilly briefly hit the $1 trillion mark in morning trading before retreating. It was last trading around $1,048 a share. The drugmaker's stock has climbed more than 36% this year as investors applaud the gains it has made over chief rival Novo Nordisk in the GLP-1 drug space. The Indianapolis-based company's stock has been riding the skyrocketing popularity of its weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. The two drugs have driven eye-popping sales growth for Eli Lilly. Meanwhile, Zepbound posted $3.59 billion in sales during the period, a 184% spike from the prior-year period. Demand for the treatments will only grow as approvals for their use and insurance coverage expand. In addition, Eli Lilly expects an oral version of its popular drugs to hit the market next year, which could give patients a more convenient option than a shot that is easier for the company to produce. Eli Lilly will likely remain a dominant player in the weight loss drug market, which some analysts believe could be worth more than $150 billion by the early 2030s. But despite its recent struggles and leadership shake-ups, Novo Nordisk remains a formidable rival for Eli Lilly in the space. Pfizer also made a push forward in the market, as well, when it won a $10 billion bidding war with Novo Nordisk for obesity drugmaker Metsera earlier this month. Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union veteran of the U.S. Civil War, founded his namesake company in 1876. Eli Lilly became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange by 1952, and for decades relied on a slate of widely successful products to drive much of its profits and revenue. Eli Lilly hit the jackpot with the May 2022 approval of tirzepatide for diabetes, which is sold as Mounjaro. It started to compete with Novo Nordisk's diabetes injection Ozempic, which had entered the market a few years earlier. But Eli Lilly brought a new way to treat diabetes and eventually, obesity. Tirzepatide works by imitating two hormones produced in the gut called GLP-1 and GIP. GIP, which also suppresses appetite, may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and its weight loss drug Wegovy, only targets GLP-1. Mounjaro achieved "blockbuster" status — meaning it generated more than $1 billion in annual sales — during its first full year on the market. Eli Lilly then won approval in late 2023 for tirzepatide as a treatment for obesity, which is sold as Zepbound and now competes with Novo Nordisk's Wegovy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gen Z may have a reputation for delaying adulthood milestones like moving out on their own, getting married and having kids, but saving for retirement is one area where the youngest working adults may be outperforming their elders. In total, 42% of all U.S. adults are on track to have enough retirement savings, Vanguard finds. Vanguard examined data from the Federal Reserve's 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances for over 2,200 U.S. households to estimate the percentage of each generation on track for a successful retirement, defined as having enough money — in most market or longevity scenarios — to maintain their pre-retirement lifestyle throughout retirement. The study focused on "younger baby boomers, Gen X, millennials, older Gen Z individuals" since those cohorts are most likely to be part of the "working population." Though youth may seem like the obvious advantage Gen Z has over older generations, it's not the only reason so many of them are pacing well to retire comfortably. Part of the reason Gen Z is able to prepare for retirement so early in their careers is due to the rise of employer-sponsored defined contribution plans, such as 401(k) and 403(b) accounts, and auto-enrollment in such plans, Vanguard says. "[Gen Zers are] automatically enrolled in their retirement plans, and oftentimes the savings rates are set for them, and it escalates with time," she says. Plus, Gen Z has the benefit of time. "If we were to assume that people continue to save into the [defined contribution] programs, as well as saving at a higher rate than we have seen with the older generations, then that only propels the retirement readiness number for younger generations." Even members of Gen Z who aren't on track for retirement are still better positioned than their older peers, Vanguard reports. However, Gen Z may also face a number of challenges when it comes to saving for retirement. Student debt is one major factor that could impede Gen Z's retirement if they don't stay on top of their balances, Hahn says. Though student debt impacts workers from every generation, Gen Z makes up 28% of all student loan borrowers, according to Education Data Initiative. "We need people to think about their finances holistically, not just in one silo, one sliver of the overall balance sheet, like retirement savings," Hahn says. Additionally, with so much time left in their careers, it's likely many Gen Zers will change jobs at least a couple of times before retirement. They "need to be cognizant of these switch points," Hahn says, because often when workers change jobs, they don't continue contributing to their retirement plan at the same rate at their new job. "We want people to have a balanced approach of thinking about saving, but also debt management, in order to have a strong financial position going into retirement," Hahn says. "I think Gen Zers have a tremendous opportunity to implement that, to not be in the position that certain older generations might have gotten themselves into."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia outperformed all expectations, reporting soaring profits Wednesday thanks to its graphics processing units that excel at AI workloads. But more categories of AI chips are gaining ground. Custom ASICs, or application-specific integrated circuits, are now being designed by all the major hyperscalers, from Google's TPU to Amazon's Trainium and OpenAI's plans with Broadcom. Besides GPUs and ASICs, there are also field-programmable gate arrays, which can be reconfigured with software after they're made for use in all sorts of applications, like signal processing, networking and AI. Qualcomm, Apple and others have championed those on-device AI chips. Once used primarily for gaming, GPUs made Nvidia the world's most valuable public company after their use shifted toward AI workloads. Nvidia shipped some 6 million current-generation Blackwell GPUs over the past year. Whereas others in the contest used central processing units for their applications, AlexNet reliance on GPUs provided incredible accuracy and obliterated its competition. AlexNet's creators discovered that the same parallel processing that helps GPUs render lifelike graphics was also great for training neural networks, in which a computer learns from data rather than relying on a programmer's code. CPUs have a small number of powerful cores running sequential general-purpose tasks, while GPUs have thousands of smaller cores more narrowly focused on parallel math like matrix multiplication. Because GPUs can perform many operations simultaneously, they're ideal for the two main phases of AI computation: training and inference. Training teaches the AI model to learn from patterns in large amounts of data, while inference uses the AI to make decisions based on new information. GPUs are the general-purpose workhorses of Nvidia and its top competitor, Advanced Micro Devices. Software is a major differentiator between the two GPU leaders. While Nvidia GPUs are tightly optimized around CUDA, Nvidia's proprietary software platform, AMD GPUs use a largely open-source software ecosystem. AMD has also recently landed big commitments from OpenAI and Oracle. The chipmaker told CNBC that it charges around $3 million for one of its server racks with 72 Blackwell GPUs acting as one, and ships about 1,000 each week. Dion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of AI infrastructure, told CNBC he couldn't have imagined this much demand when he joined Nvidia over eight years ago. "When we were talking to people about building a system that had eight GPUs, they thought that was overkill," he said. Training on GPUs has been key in the early boom days of large language models, but inference is becoming more crucial as the models mature. Inference can happen on less powerful chips that are programmed for more specific tasks. It's very efficient and fast, but hard-wired to do the exact math for one type of job. "You can't change them once they're already carved into silicon, and so there's a trade off in terms of flexibility," said Chris Miller, author of "Chip War." Nvidia's GPUs are flexible enough for adoption by many AI companies, but they cost up to $40,000 and can be hard to get. Still, startups rely on GPUs because designing a custom ASIC has an even higher up-front cost, starting at tens of millions of dollars, according to Miller. "At the same time, they're going to continue to work very closely with Nvidia, with AMD, because they also need the capacity. Google was the first Big Tech company to make a custom ASIC for AI acceleration, coining the term Tensor Processing Unit when its first ASIC came out in 2015. Google said it considered making a TPU as far back as 2006, but the situation became "urgent" in 2013 as it realized AI was going to double its number of data centers. Anthropic announced it will train its LLM Claude on up to 1 million TPUs. Some people think TPUs are technically on par or superior to Nvidia's GPUs, Miller said. "Traditionally, Google has only used them for in-house purposes," Miller said. "There's a lot of speculation that in the longer run, Google might open up access to TPUs more broadly." Amazon Web Services was the next cloud provider to design its own AI chips, after acquiring Israeli chip startup Annapurna labs in 2015. AWS is expected to announce Trainium's third generation as soon December. Ron Diamant, Trainium's head architect, told CNBC that Amazon's ASIC has 30% to 40% better price performance compared to other hardware vendors in AWS. "Over time, we've seen that Trainium chips can serve both inference and training workloads quite well," Diamant said. In October, CNBC went to Indiana for the first on-camera tour of Amazon's biggest AI data center, where Anthropic is training its models on half a million Trainium2 chips. AWS fills its other data centers with Nvidia GPUs to meet the demand from AI customers like OpenAI. This is why companies turn to chip designers Broadcom and Marvell. "So you've seen Broadcom in particular be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom," Miller said. Microsoft is also getting into the ASIC game, telling CNBC that its in-house Maia 100 chips are currently deployed in its data centers in the eastern U.S. Others include Qualcomm with the A1200, Intel with its  Gaudi AI accelerators and Tesla with its AI5 chip. There's also a slew of start-ups going all in on custom AI chips, including Cerebras, which makes huge full-wafer AI chips, and Groq, with inference-focused language processing units. In China, Huawei, ByteDance, and Alibaba are making custom ASICs, although export controls on the most advanced equipment and AI chips pose a challenge. The final big category of AI chips are those made to run on devices, rather than in the cloud. Edge AI chips, as they're called, enable devices to have AI capabilities while helping them save battery life and space for other components. "You'll be able to do that right on your phone with very low latency, so you don't have to have communication all the way back to a data center," said Saif Khan, former White House AI and semiconductor policy advisor. Neural processing units are a major type of edge AI chip. Qualcomm, Intel and AMD are making NPUs that enable AI capabilities in personal computers. Although Apple doesn't use the term NPU, the in-house M-series chips inside its MacBooks include a dedicated neural engine. Apple also built neural accelerators into the latest iPhone A-series chips. We know that we are much more in control over the experience," Tim Millet, Apple platform architecture vice president, told CNBC in an exclusive September interview. The latest Android phones also have NPUs built into their primary Qualcomm Snapdragon chips, and Samsung has its own NPU on its Galaxy phones, too. NPUs by companies like NXP and Nvidia power AI embedded in cars, robots, cameras, smart home devices and more. "Most of the dollars are going towards the data center, but over time that's going to change because we'll have AI deployed in our phones and our cars and wearables, all sorts of other applications to a much greater degree than today," Miller said. Then there's field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, which can be reconfigured with software after they're made. Although far more flexible than NPUs or ASICs, FPGAs have lower raw performance and lower energy efficiency for AI workloads. TSMC has a giant new chip fabrication plant in Arizona, where Apple has committed to moving some chip production. Although the AI chip space is crowded, dethroning Nvidia won't come easily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said Friday he expects the central bank can lower its key interest rate from here as labor market weakness poses a bigger economic threat than higher inflation. "I view monetary policy as being modestly restrictive, although somewhat less so than before our recent actions," he said in remarks for a speech in Santiago, Chile. Stock market futures rose further into positive territory while Treasury yields were sharply lower. Traders now see a better than 72% probability of another quarter percentage point reduction at the Dec. 9-10 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, and just a 28% chance of no cut, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge. That's a dramatic flip from where expectations were Thursday at the same time. Williams' comments are significant in that he is considered part of a leadership troika that also includes Chair Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. In comments to CNBC on Friday morning, Boston Fed President Susan Collins took a different tone from Williams, noting the threat that inflation still poses while saying she would be hesitant to support more cuts. An FOMC voter this year, Collins said last week she would have a "high bar" for supporting further reductions. "I do think mildly restrictive policy is very appropriate right now. And, you know, and that makes me hesitant as I look forward to think about what the next policy moves should be," she said during the "Squawk Box" interview. Collins said she sees "weakness" particularly among lower-income people "and what that really seems tied to is high price levels and that continued inflation, inflation that's been elevated for nearly five years [and] has a risk of persistence." Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan took a sharply different tack, saying she would have opposed the October cut — and possibly September's as well. Though Logan doesn't vote this year, she will in 2026. Her comments focused on the need to control inflation, and she added that soaring stock market prices this year have added to her caution about easing. "Putting it together, even in September I was not certain we had room to cut rates more than once or twice and still maintain a restrictive stance. And having made two cuts, I'm not certain we have room for more," she added. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, also a 2026 voter, told CNBC on Thursday she also sees policy as "barely restrictive," a potential signal to resistance against cutting. Jefferson spoke Friday morning at a Fed conference in Cleveland, but confined his remarks to the impact that artificial intelligence is having on the economy and financial stability. During a speech last week, Jefferson spoke of "the need to proceed slowly" on further policy decisions. Fed sentiment has divided along the lines of officials who think policy is still somewhat restrictive, meaning there is more room to lower rates without spiking inflation, and those who view it as not restrictive, with further easing a threat to increase prices particularly in the era of dramatically higher tariffs on U.S. imports. "Underlying inflation continues to trend downward, absent any evidence of second-round effects emanating from tariffs." Williams did note, as have many other Fed officials, that progress on inflation "has stalled" due to the impact of tariffs and other factors. However, he noted that longer-run expectations are still in check, giving the Fed latitude as inflation gets back to the central bank's goal, he projected, by 2027.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon's 14,000-plus layoffs announced last month touched almost every piece of the company's sprawling business, from cloud computing and devices to advertising, retail and grocery stores. But one job category bore the brunt of cuts more than others: engineers. Documents filed in New York, California, New Jersey and Amazon's home state of Washington showed that nearly 40% of the more than 4,700 job cuts in those states were engineering roles. The data was reported by Amazon in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, filings to state agencies. Not all data was immediately available because of differences in state WARN reporting requirements. In announcing the steepest round of cuts in its 31-year history, Amazon joined a growing roster of tech companies that have slashed jobs this year even as cash piles have mounted and profits soared. In total, there have been almost 113,000 job cuts at 231 tech companies, according to Layoffs.fyi, continuing a trend that began in 2022 as businesses readjusted to life after the Covid pandemic. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a multiyear mission to transform the company's corporate culture into one that operates like what he calls "the world's largest startup." Amazon is expected to carry out further job reductions in January, CNBC previously reported. The company said it's also shifting resources to invest more in artificial intelligence. The technology is already poised to reshape Amazon's white-collar workforce, with Jassy predicting in June that its corporate head count will shrink in the coming years alongside efficiency gains from AI. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before," Galetti wrote. "We're convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business." Jassy said on Amazon's earnings call last month that the cuts were in response to a "culture" issue inside the company, spurred in part by an extended hiring spree that left it with "a lot more layers" and slower decision-making. The AI boom is making software development jobs harder to come by as companies adopt coding assistants or so-called vibe coding platforms from vendors like Cursor, OpenAI and Cognition. As part of the broader belt-tightening, Amazon has sought in recent years to curtail investments in some of the company's more experimental or unprofitable initiatives. It sunset a telehealth service, kids video calling device, fitness wearable and several brick-and-mortar retail chains. Amazon's video game division was targeted in the company's latest layoff wave, California WARN filings show. Steve Boom, vice president of Audio, Twitch and Games, told staffers in a memo viewed by CNBC that "significant role reductions" would occur in its San Diego and Irvine, California, game studios, as well as within its central publishing team. Game designers, artists and producers made up more than a quarter of the total cuts in Irvine, and they were roughly 11% of staffers laid off at Amazon's San Diego offices, according to filings. The company also told staffers it's halting much of its work on big-budget, or triple A, game development, specifically around massively multiplayer online, or MMO, games, Boom wrote. It was also developing an MMO based on "Lord of the Rings." The unit is responsible for products like Amazon Lens and Lens Live, AI shopping tools that enable users to find products via their camera in real time or images saved to their device. The team was primarily based in Palo Alto, California, and Amazon's WARN filings indicate that software engineers, applied scientists and quality assurance engineers were heavily impacted across its offices there. Amazon's online ad business, one of its biggest profit centers, was downsized as well. More than 140 ad sales and marketing roles were eliminated across Amazon's New York offices, accounting for about 20% of the roughly 760 positions cut, according to state documents viewed by CNBC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oil prices extended declines and energy stocks fell sharply on Friday as U.S. President Donald Trump pushed for a peace deal to end the long-running Russia-Ukraine war. International benchmark Brent crude futures with January expiry slipped 2.2% to $62 per barrel at 3:02 p.m. London time (10:02 a.m. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with January expiry were last seen 2.6% lower at $57.46, after closing Thursday off 0.5%. Europe's Stoxx Oil and Gas index, meanwhile, slipped more than 2.4%. Britain's Shell and BP were both trading around 1.4% lower. Norway's Equinor fell 2.3%, while Germany's Siemens Energy plunged nearly 8%. The bearish market sentiment comes as investors pore over the details of the Trump administration's push to secure a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. The U.S., under a widely leaked plan, has reportedly proposed that Ukraine cede land including Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk, and pledge never to join the NATO military alliance. CNBC has not been able to independently verify the report. Analysts were doubtful that the peace plan, which is thought to be favorable toward Russia, would be backed by Ukraine. Guntram Wolff, senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank, was among those skeptical about whether the proposed peace plan could lead to a deal. "I think it's always good to talk each other so in that sense it's a good development but I have to say when I saw the details of this supposed peace plan, I really don't think it can fly," Wolff told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Friday. "Because at the core, what it says is that Ukraine should give up significant parts of its military personnel, meaning the military personnel would decrease by something like a third from 900,000 to 600,000," he added. Strategists at Saxo Bank said in a research note that oil prices had come under pressure on Friday as the U.S. steps up its push for Ukraine "to accept the terms of a draft plan to end the war it has pieced together with Russia, even as sanctions are set to hit Russian crude from largest producers Rosneft and Lukoil." Alongside the peace plan noise, energy market participants closely monitored the potential impact of U.S. sanctions against Russian oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil, with the measures taking effect from Friday, a stronger U.S. dollar and expectations for the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision.

In a company meeting on Thursday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that "the market did not appreciate" its "incredible" quarter. Nvidia delivered record-shattering earnings on Wednesday as Huang rebuffed swelling narratives around an AI bubble. Its stock popped on Wednesday and then fell again on Thursday as confidence in the AI trade wavered. "If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there's an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble," Huang said at the Thursday meeting, which Business Insider has listened to. Huang said the expectations for Nvidia were so sky-high that the company was in somewhat of a no-win situation. He nodded to online chatter about the company's massive economic sway. "If we delivered a bad quarter, if we're off by just a hair, if it just looked a little bit creaky, the whole world would've fallen apart," Huang said. We're basically holding the planet together — and it's not untrue." Huang also cited posts saying that Nvidia's work was helping the US to avoid a recession. While he said he was "delighted" by the company's results and proud of employees, Huang said that Nvidia's massive influence has made expectations harder to meet — something that has also played out in its market value. An Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement, "After another quarter of incredible growth and off-the-charts demand, Jensen's message to the company was to stay focused and let the market take care of itself."</p>
