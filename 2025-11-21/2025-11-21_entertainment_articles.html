                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jenna Lyons has made the “difficult decision” to quit “The Real Housewives of New York City” after two seasons. Lyons explained that she was asked to participate in Season 16 as a “friend of” the cast given that her “personal life was not really available to be filmed.” While she and the showrunners initially “agreed that made sense,” Lyons gave it more thought and ultimately decided to “not return” in any capacity. “I would be the oldest and only openly gay woman on [‘RHONY'] and feel like this is an opportunity for a new dynamic to emerge,” she shared, making sure to note, “I LOVE THE GIRLS.” Sign up for Virtual Reali-Tea with Danny and Evan, our must-read newsletter!

Lyons then tagged now-former co-stars Erin Lichy, Jessel Taank, Sai De Silva, Ubah Hassan and Racquel Chevremont, in that order, leaving out Brynn Whitfield, who announced her departure from the series in June. “I have so much respect and gratitude to the Entire BRAVO team who produced the show with grace and care,” Lyons marveled. Lyons insisted she would be “watching and bitching from the sidelines with love and outfit judgement,” signing off with: “Sincerely, JFL,” which famously stands for “Jenna F–king Lyons.” She confirmed her long-rumored engagement to photographer Cass Bird in October 2024.</p>

Before it has officially opened on Friday, “Wicked: For Good” has already made $30.8 million at the box office from advanced screenings. $30.8 million would also put it just inside the Top 10 ever for a preview total, just ahead of “The Dark Knight Rises” way back in 2012. Related Stories Did Critics Burst the ‘Wicked: For Good' Bubble? How Mixed Reviews Might Impact Its Oscar Fate ‘The Family Plan 2' Review: Apple TV's Most Forgettably Algorithmic Action Movie Is Now Apple TV's Most Forgettably Algorithmic Action Franchise That $30.8 million is the combined total of screenings on three different days this week, Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The Thursday screenings, if you went to a double feature, began as early as 11 a.m. yesterday, a true matinee, and at 2 p.m. for other standard showings. It's early enough in the day that you could say it's already been in theaters for a full day, practically as a wide release. But because it's before Friday, Glinda is waving her magic wand and telling us all that this magic number is really just “previews.” “Wicked: For Good” is projected for an opening weekend between $150-180 million, which could give it a chance to be the biggest opening weekend of the year and would put it ahead of where the original “Wicked” opened, which wound up with $758.6 million worldwide. The biggest domestic box office opening of 2025 is “A Minecraft Movie,” which did $162.8 million. Just $10.6 million in Thursday previews, though kids movies always do less in previews because most kids generally aren't staying out super late on a school night. Look, literally every studio gooses their numbers this way, so no dig on Universal. But while the trades love to tout these big box office numbers, they mean less than they ever did in terms of projecting how a movie will actually open in a given weekend. I have fond memories of working my tail off at the concession stand at my local Marcus Theaters to service a hoard of fans piling in for as many midnight screenings of “The Dark Knight” as my theater could fit in, and that movie made $18.5 million and certainly wasn't opening at 2 p.m. on a Thursday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stranger Things creators Matt and Ross Duffer shared a small update with Deadline on their spinoff idea that has been brewing since Season 4 of the supernatural show came out in the summer of 2022. So he was the only one who knew.” Ross pointed out that Wolfhard's idea of the spinoff may have drifted from when he first guessed it. “I think he might have forgotten, though, honestly, because last time he brought it up, I was like, ‘That's not what it is,'” Ross said. In August, Wolfhard told Variety that he speculated the show would be like David Lynch's Twin Peaks but with an anthology twist and a similar universe setting tied together with The Upside Down mythology. He suggested that there could be a lab in Russia where the spin-off is centered without any mention of Hawkins or the original Stranger Things characters. “No, that's the funny thing, because everyone freaked out that he had revealed what the spin off was,” Matt chimed in. I'm really excited about the team we've assembled that I can't talk about without potentially getting into trouble, but we'll put out more information soon. RELATED: Shawn Levy Co-Directed ‘Stranger Things' Season 5 Episode 7 With Duffer Brothers: “A Fitting Commemoration” In October, the directing duo told Variety they will start with “a clean slate” and “new characters” to avoid complicating the already complex mythology in Stranger Things. You've just seen that too many times,” Matt added in their conversation with Deadline. “The market, it's diminishing returns at a certain point. So Ross and I are going to remain very, very involved, even though we're going to be at Paramount. In fact, we're busy working on the spin off idea right now.” “We're not super subtle about what our influences are, but at the end of the day, at a certain point, we weren't thinking about those stories at all. The story of Hawkins and these characters were defining this, and it is,  though inspired by what came before it, original IP,” Matt said. “I wish more people and studios were getting behind that. So why not just take inspiration from what came before you and look at what worked and try to bring that into the marketplace?” Like with the spinoff, both brothers plan to remain very involved in any potential offshoot of the show, should it become a franchise, universe or other expansive property. “We want to be intentional and very careful in terms of how we expand, in that we're not doing anything for the sake of doing it, for the sake of putting more Stranger Things out into the world. It has to be something that we're extremely excited about. “So we liked the idea of taking this and turning into an animated form. In August, the Duffers struck a 4-year deal with Paramount for feature films, television and streaming projects. The Chapman University alumni will begin working with Paramount — reuniting with Cindy Holland, who shepherded Stranger Things into creation at Netflix alongside Matt Thunell (who is also now at Paramount after the Skydance merger) — after their current deal with Netflix ends in April 2026. “We grew up going to movies every week as kids, and it was such a big part of our lives. We love the idea of a communal experience. Theaters are still coming back post-pandemic, but we just wanted to try to be part of the part of that solution and fight the good fight,” Ross said. So it's really a dream come true to do that with our next project.” RELATED: ‘Stranger Things' Season 5 Director Frank Darabont Teases David Harbour Scene Where He Wanted To “Crank Up The Heat” And Easter Egg Nod To His Early Career The brothers, executive producing through their Upside Down Pictures shingle, still have The Boroughs, starring Geena Davis, Alfred Molina, Alfre Woodard, Bill Pullman, Clarke Peters and Denis O'Hare and Something Very Bad Is Going To Happen starring Camila Morrone and Adam DiMarco coming up at Netflix. They've previously hinted that The Boroughs slightly echoes certain elements of Stranger Things. Added Ross: “We'll shake it up a little bit. But I do think, like Matt's saying, there's a style of storytelling that's really in the DNA of Stranger Things, and I think that that will probably continue to whatever we do next.” That being said, as they move forward with new projects and head to Paramount, the brothers made clear that they will leave the '80s behind for a while. “Whatever we do next, I'll tell you this, it's not going to be set in the '80s.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Publishing a video earlier this week encouraging members of the military to honor their oath and “refuse illegal orders.” According to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), members of the military are required to obey “lawful” orders from their commanding officers. The Judge Advocate General's (JAG) handbook for Army commanders advises that soldiers be trained on their “duty to disobey” an order that could potentially violate the laws of armed conflict. “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH,” he wrote on Truth Social. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. Their words cannot be allowed to stand – We won't have a Country anymore!!! The president also included over a dozen re-posts of comments related to Democrats statement. “It's called a seditious conspiracy and every one of them should be frog marched out of their homes at 3:00 AM with FOX News cameras filming the whole thing,” another Truth Social user promoted by Trump commented. The response from Republicans in Congress was teed off by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) who combined his signature plea of ignorance with a suggestion that the president's call for their colleagues to be hanged was no big deal. Johnson told CNN that the Democrats' call for members of the military to refuse an illegal order — as they are expected to do — was “wildly irresponsible” and “very dangerous.” That is a factual statement,” Johnson added, absurdly implying that the president had simply been providing the public with a clinical legal definition instead of demanding his critics be arrested and executed. Members of Trump's administration also leapt to excuse the president.

It can lead to chaos, and that's what these members of Congress who swore an oath to abide by the Constitution are essentially encouraging,” Leavitt told reporters. “I think they should be held to account and those congressmen should be required to answer questions about why they did what they did and the American people deserve that, and so does President Trump,” he added. told reporters that he certainly didn't “agree with the president's conclusion on how we ought to handle it,” but claimed that the video had been “ill advised, unnecessary and clearly provocative.” Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) “You can ask me again next week, but I think hanging senators might be overkill,” he added. Our service members should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty.” Sen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Bob Dylan‘s Rough and Rowdy Ways tour hit Waterfront Hall in Belfast, Ireland, on Thursday evening, there were probably quite a few hardcore Van Morrison fans in the crowd. There's always been a large crossover between their two audiences: Belfast is Morrison's hometown, and this very theater was the site of his 80th birthday celebration back in September. Dylan played “Going Down to Bangor” from Morrison's 2016 LP Keep Me Singing. This wasn't a single; it hasn't been featured in any recent movie or TV show, and Morrison himself has only done it 14 times. This is hardly the first time that Dylan has covered Morrison. Over the years, he's performed “One Irish Rover,” “Carrying a Torch,” “Real Real Gone,” “And It Stoned Me,” “Crazy Love,” “Into The Mystic,” “Moondance,” and “Tupelo Honey.” They've even played together a handful of times, most notably in 1998 when they did a series of shows as co-headliners. Morrison, meanwhile, has been covering Dylan since 1966, when his band Them scored a minor hit with “It's All Over Now, Baby Blue.” In the years that followed, he's also done “Just Like a Woman,” “I Shall Be Released,” “Rainy Day Women #12 & 35,” “Idiot Wind,” and “Knockin' on Heaven's Door.” Over the summer, he played Bo Diddley's 1962 single “I Can't Tell” to largely blank faces at amphitheaters all across America on the Outlaw tour.

Jimmy Kimmel Skewers Trump Over Renewed Call to Pull Him Off Air: 'Quiet, Piggy' Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless Pay Tribute to Vince Gill at 2025 CMA Awards If he's sticking with hometown heroes, we'd love to hear him cover U2 in Dublin. And if he wants to stick with their recent work, we recommend “Love Is All We Have Left,” “The Little Things That Give You Away,” or “Every Breaking Wave.” If he wants to go back a little further, “Moment of Surrender” would be sublime. Dylan hasn't announced any 2026 dates yet, but he took the unprecedented step of telling his fans to expect more shows next year with a recent post on X.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jelly Roll's wife, Bunnie Xo, is “going to jail” after getting pulled over — and she plans to vlog the whole thing. The former escort, 45, took to her “Dumb Blonde” podcast on Friday to update listeners on her unintentional “trouble with the law.” Should we talk about it?” she began the episode, sharing that she “got a ticket in 2020 in Alabama.” Bunnie — who lives in Nashville with her musician husband, 40 — said she had completely forgotten about the ticket when she got “pulled over” last month while she was driving what “looks like a drug dealer's vehicle.” The officer asked for her driver's license and ran it through the system, which showed that it was suspended. '” Bunnie recalled responding, insisting that she's an “upstanding citizen these days.” The officer explained that her license got suspended because of the unpaid ticket she got in Alabama, so he let her go with a warning but told her to “get it fixed.” So Bunnie went home, “paid it” and assumed that meant her license got “reinstated.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. But “the other day,” she was driving the same car, “might've been speeding” on a highway and got pulled over again. Bunnie said she later learned that “the ticket was paid Oct. 24,” so she's confused as to why her license would still be suspended, adding that her attorney is on the case. “Looks like your girl is gonna have to go book herself in, and if I do — you guys have seen all my past mug shots, right? And I am going to vlog it,” she vowed.</p>

Just when it seemed like she had found true love, it turned out that her fiancé was a not-so-retired IMF super spy who was existentially incapable of leaving his old life behind. And when that relationship didn't work out (something to do with the demands of saving the world and everyone in it), she rebounded by starting a life with a Buffalo used car salesman who — shortly after the birth of their third child together — was forced to reveal that he's an ex-assassin whose old life refuses to let him go. Some girls just can't catch a break. The good news is that new husband Dan Morgan, unlike Ethan Hunt, is willing to fight for the relationship even if it puts his family in harm's way. And the soft-hearted action series that Apple has built around him — too violent for kids, too childish for adults — feels like a Costco-brand imitation of a Hollywood franchise instead of a property that was manufactured with any creative spark of its own. Related Stories Will Arnett Thought He'd Never Land a Dramatic Role: ‘Why Would They?' No wonder it seems like Apple has bought these movies in bulk. Arriving less than two years after the original, “The Family Plan 2” doubles down on the vibe of its predecessor, which — for those for those of you who don't remember the seismic moment in American culture when Dan Morgan first entered into our lives — might be described as “‘Mission: Impossible' if it were designed to be watched exclusively on the back of a car seat headrest.” It's hard to fathom why Skydance Media continues to partner with Apple and Netflix when they could just cut out the middleman and release masterpieces like “Ghosted,” “Fountain of Youth,” and “The Old Guard 2” directly to the built-in entertainment system that comes with every new Honda Odyssey, but I suppose that CEO David Ellison — the nepo baby final boss who's been devouring the film industry with all of the love and affection that Galactus consumes a planet — must know what he's doing. This movie often feels like it was made by them too, which should be comforting to anyone who considers themselves a fan of the franchise. Continuity is the name of the game here, as OG director Simon Cellan Jones has reteamed with series mastermind David Coggeshall for another exciting round of first-draft fun, and they've brought all of your favorite characters along with them: Dan, his wife Jessica, and their three kids who presumably also have names. Like their mother, a former decathlete, the children all have exactly one trait. And the eldest is a girl who goes to college in London. But it's not all love, actually, as it turns out that Dan's client, Aidan (Kit Harrington, seemingly on lunch breaks from shooting his great performance in season three of “Industry”), isn't a bank owner who's paying Dan to safety-test his new vault, he's a bank robber who's paying Dan to steal a big key from it. You see, Dan and Aidan's supervillain father has died in prison between movies (a mercy killing for Ciarán Hinds, who only appears here in a still photo), and that means his criminal empire is up for grabs to anyone who has the key to unlock his network or something. Aidan frames Dan for the theft, because estranged siblings are complicated, and so our heroes are forced to prove their innocence by foiling Aidan's bid for power. Truth be told, there's no meaningful reason to root for the Morgans in this scenario — not only would it be funny to see these people have to explain the plot of this movie to Interpol, but defeating Aidan would result in the waste of a perfectly good criminal network, complete with fancy computers, a big house in Paris, and a small handful of generic henchmen whom “The Family Plan 2” makes a historically half-assed attempt to establish as individual characters. The action scenes that follow the Morgans from England to France do precious little to sell us the charm of Dan's brood, which proves fatal to a film that hinges — or should — on the idea that his wife and kids can now fight alongside him. The setpieces are sloppy and unexciting to the extreme, and most of them, like a low-energy fight aboard a double-decker bus, are shapeless to the point that they simply end instead of building to a climactic beat (to say nothing of the goon who spontaneously falls dead on a rooftop during the third act). At one point, Wahlberg literally falls asleep in the middle of a car chase; the beat is credible enough on its own to forget that his character has been drugged. The dynamics between the Morgans aren't quite so convincing, as at no point does it seem like these people have ever met each other before, let alone that they're related by blood. The closest thing we get to a real human connection sparks from the relationship between Dan and his daughter's new boyfriend Omar (Reda Elazouar), who gets swept along for the ride and can be found loitering in the background during most scenes; maybe it's just because Wahlberg delivers every line to every character in every movie as if he were trying to big time his teenager daughter's new boyfriend, but these two have an errant chemistry that “The Family Plan 2” is able to make good on to legitimately humorous effect before the end. “The Family Plan 2” is now streaming on Apple TV.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UPDATED, Friday AM: Universal's Wicked: For Good has officially rung up $30.8 million, according to Universal this morning, and that's total previews from Monday to Thursday night. It marks the best overall previews for any movie in 2025 to date, topping Disney/Marvel Studios' Fantastic Four: First Steps‘ $24.4M. — $18.2M from Thursday alone from shows that began as double feature and standard previews as early as 11 a.m., then 2 p.m. for Wicked: For Good at 3,350 theaters (close to what we were seeing late last night). — Monday Amazon Prime screenings generated $6.1M at 1,050 theaters. — Wednesday advance screenings generating another $6.5M from 2,300 theaters. Overall previews for Wicked: For Good are bigger than Barbie ($22.3M before a $162M opening weekend, 68% female-skewing movie) and under that of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ($36M, $187.4M three-day total). In Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits, I'm hearing Wicked: For Good is an awesome 82% definite recommend and 92% positive. As we told you previously, Fandango reported that the Cynthia Erivo-Ariana Grande sequel was the best advance ticket seller ever for a PG-rated movie, and also the best pre-seller year-to-date. Wicked: For Good arrives as a much-needed boost for the post-Labor Day frame box office, which through Monday was behind 2.2% from the same period a year ago per Comscore with $1.29 billion (and down 31% compared to the post-Labor Day to November 18 period of 2019). While the pre-Thanksgiving weekend last year with Wicked minted north of $202 million for all movies, that frame also had the R-rated, male-skewing Gladiator II, which debuted to $55M. Even without a Gladiator II-like movie in the mix this weekend, some believe Wicked: For Good can make up the difference in its potential overperformance. Most holdovers in the top 10 a year ago dropped 50% or steeper. We'll see what can survive, but again, the upcoming holiday week will make up for any deficiencies this weekend. Stage 6 Films and Screen Gems have the R-rated action/thriller Sisu: Road to Revenge, which grossed $575,000 for its Thursday night previews starting at 4 p.m. from 1,925 locations. PREVIOUSLY, Friday at midnight: Sources tell us that Universal's Wicked: For Good is coming in around $20M-$22M on Thursday night, and when you fold in Amazon sneaks and Wednesday premium fan shows, that figure is substantially higher. Again, these are industry estimates so as we always say, take them with a grain of salt until Universal officially reports in the AM. Wicked‘s total previews a year ago were $19.2M. Despite the notion that some are projecting a $175M+ weekend for Wicked: For Good, word to the wise is that the sequel could be frontloaded just like the last film, which skewed 72% female, with 57% between ages 18-34, in Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits. The word is out already among the fans that Wicked: For Good is slightly better (or about the same) as Wicked with a Rotten Tomatoes Audience score that's 97%, compared with last year's 95%. Wicked: For Good is bound to make most of its bank stateside just like the last one, which saw 63% of its $758.4M global gross coming from North America. The forecasted worldwide start is well north of $200M+. What's obviously expected for Wicked: For Good is that it's going to break a whole other round of opening records. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. So basically, a full day of shows on Thursday, plus screenings on two of the week days before Friday…ya'll really need to redefine your idea of what “previews” mean. Because factually, this movie opened on Thursday. Pretty disappointing that $30M for a studio sequel is the top of 2025. The box office is still clearly struggling. Though the first Wicked was a masterpiece and an exquisite demonstration of unified talents, I do agree with some critics/viewers that the two films could have been managed in one full arc, keeping the integrity of the musical cohesive and smooth. I do believe Chu's vision was really highlighted in the first film. Regardless, I was happy to steal myself away for both early-viewings. I stream part 1 and was considering going to the theater for part 2 but after the over the top Cynthia/Ariana promotion which has turned me off I will wait for streaming. Just got an ick factor right now. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Country superstar Carrie Underwood is on a mission. Not just to find the next “American Idol,” but to rid the nation of a viral sensation that's driving parents and teachers crazy. Elementary and middle school kids across America have inexplicably become obsessed with any mention of the numbers six and seven together — whether someone's counting, stating the temperature, giving a score, you name it. Like many parents, Underwood has had enough of the viral trend. In a new promo for season 24 of “American Idol” released on November 20, 2025, the mom of two boys revealed her genius plan for putting the trend to rest. Underwood shares two boys with her husband Mike Fisher — 10-year-old Isaiah and six-year-old Jacob. But in the newest “American Idol” promo posted on social media, Underwood revealed she has a plan for squashing the trend once and for all. Filmed while talking to educator Uzziah Hutchinson as he auditioned for her, Luke Bryan, and Lionel Richie, Underwood sympathized with him as he said he hears “6-7” from his students “all day long.” “Here's how we stop that Uzziah,” she told him. Another fan wrote, “My bus of students is about to feel the pain lol ❤️ this! “Oh 100% I just did it and my son gave me a dirty look,” someone else commented.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meanwhile, in one of the great miracles of human existence—familiar to many, yet special every time—you have settled down with a companion who loves, nurtures, and understands you. So when an alien-controlled hive mind with seemingly limitless resources and capabilities asks what it can do to make you happy, what can you say, exactly? Nearly everything that made your life satisfying has just been wrenched away by the Joining. Honestly, their incessant cheeriness and solicitousness feels a lot like the counselors at “Camp fuckin' Freedom Falls.” The whole situation is impossible, bordering on hopeless. This week's Pluribus is called “Please, Carol” (a title that will acquire a mortifying resonance by the end); and it's an episode that really chews into the meat of what this series is about, at least when it comes to Carol's all-too-human tenacity. There are two moments in particular I want to spotlight, because while they're brief, they both speak to the larger question of What Carol Wants And Why It Matters. In one of those moments, Carol pulls out a whiteboard in her home office, containing notes for her next Wycaro novel. She almost wipes the board, but can't quite bring herself to do it. In the second moment, later in the episode, after injecting herself with sodium thiopental (colloquially known as “truth serum”), Carol reads aloud from one of her books and remarks that it would make a good movie. Wycaro will likely never be adapted into a major motion picture or TV series. From what we've seen, the Joined do not consume popular culture. There's a fantastic scene—both poignant and puckish—in which Carol reckons with her new reality. She asks for help from a Joined individual named Lawrence J. Cless (Larry to his friends). (Larry's played by Jeff Hiller, the Emmy-winning comic character actor, who has a kookily sunny energy.) Carol asks Larry what he—or, more accurately, the collective—thinks about her books. When asked how the Wycaro series compares to William Shakespeare, Larry chirps, “Equally!” But he touches a nerve when he reminds Carol about Moira, one of her most devoted fans, and says, “You gave her something to live for.” They access Helen's memories and share what she really thought about Carol's books. In short: She thought they were “harmless.” As for Carol's unpublished passion project, Bitter Chrysalis? “Please, Carol” is credited to screenwriter Alison Tatlock and director Zetna Fuentes. They and the rest of the Pluribus team do a remarkable job of building this episode's story through a combination of seemingly digressive dialogue scenes, like the one between Larry and Carol, and long dialogue-free sequences in which we get to watch our hero think through a situation. This was a hallmark of Vince Gilligan's Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, too: seeing Walt, Mike, Jimmy, or Carol piece together a plan, using ideas we often saw occurring to them in real time. Here, Carol's curiosity about everyone's opinion of the Wycaro franchise serves two purposes. First, as I noted up top, it socks Carol in the gut. But also: While pushing Larry to admit what the Joined know about Helen's tastes, Carol realizes they can't lie to her. The second half of this episode turns into a fun, intense caper thriller, as Carol plots how to exploit the Joined's radical honesty. First, she goes to see Zosia in the hospital and asks outright if there's a way to reverse the formula that linked nearly all of humanity as one happy mass. But no, Zosia can't tell Carol how to do it. There is a hard limit to how truthful the Joined will be. On to Plan B: Carol raids the hospital's pharmacy, swiping sodium thiopental and disguising her theft by brazenly asking a concerned doctor if the collective can get her some heroin and a hypodermic. I'm writing all of this as though it's obvious at the moment what Carol is up to; but what makes these sequences so enjoyable is that the viewer is expected to piece together what's actually happening. The self-dosing scene in particular initially seems bizarre and comical, as Carol gets stoned out of her head, hilariously slurs her words, weeps over Helen, and then admits she's horny for Zosia. But we soon realize the Zosia lust is crucial, because it proves the drug can make a person say something out loud that she wouldn't otherwise admit. But even though Carol wheels Zosia to a remote part of the hospital grounds, it doesn't take long before swarms of people find them and intervene. It's also a reminder that while all these interconnected people on Earth seem friendly, they are alien. Before dosing Zosia, Carol has a conversation with her in which Zosia defends the Joined's plan to convert Carol as soon as possible, saying, “You want to change us, too, don't you?” and adding, “We know what it feels like to be you, but you've never been us.” Zosia strikes a compassionate note, but her meaning's plain: This is not a “live and let live” type deal. This is why I've become less bothered by Carol never asking The joined about their long-range goals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stray Kids, however, are going gangbusters. In late August, the boyband landed their seventh No. All seven of the pop outfit's entries on the national albums tally have debuted at No. With KARMA, their most recent release, they extended that record. 5 Seconds of Summer Shines on ARIA Chart With 'Everyone's A Star!' 1, Stray Kids surpassed BTS, Linkin Park and Dave Matthews Band for the most leaders among groups on the all-genre Billboard 200 this century. Among K-pop bands, BTS is in second place, with six No. ATEEZ is a distant third with two No. In Korea, Karma became the first K-pop album of the year to surpass 3 million copies in first-week sales. Fast forward a couple months and the release today (Nov. 21) of Stray Kids' new EP (or “special album”), DO IT, via JYP Entertainment. On the live front, Stray Kids have also been bagging bar-setting numbers. The band played the final show of the Dominate World Tour at Rome's Stadio Olimpico on July 30, completing a 2025 run that visited Latin America, Europe and North America, setting Boxscore records for revenue and attendance in each region. With the five-track DO IT, Stray Kids can, well, do it again on the Billboard 200.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus, new seasonal sets from Brad Paisley, Trisha Yearwood and Herb Alpert arrive. Michael Bublé's evergreen Christmas album returns to No. 1 on Billboard's Top Holiday Albums chart (dated Nov. 22), rising 2-1. Also on the chart, new projects from Brad Paisley, Trisha Yearwood and Herb Alpert all debut. 5 Seconds of Summer Shines on ARIA Chart With 'Everyone's A Star!' Each units equals one album sales, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The Top Holiday Albums chart will continue to be published on a weekly basis through early January of 2026, when it will jingle away until the next holiday season. Paisley's Snow Globe Town debuts on the list at No. 15, marking his second charting project on the tally. Snow Globe Town includes eight newly-penned songs and a selection of classic holiday favorites like “The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On an Open Fire)” and “Jingle Bell Rock.” Snow Globe Town also enters at No. 14 on Top Current Album Sales and No. 36 on Top Holiday Albums, and the project includes new takes on classics like “My Favorite Things,” “Pure Imagination” and “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.” The album also boasts a new original track, “Merry Christmas, Valentine,” co-written and performed by Yearwood and Garth Brooks. The project, which marks Alpert's third holiday set, also bows at No. Christmas Time Is Here includes the legendary trumpeter, composer and record label executive's takes on “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” “Santa Baby” and “Winter Wonderland.” Alpert's first seasonal project, 1968's Christmas Album, reached No. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The success of their marriage involves having a realistic outlook. The former Hallmark actress and current Great American Family star is aware that, like any relationship, there will be highs and lows, and she has revealed how they navigate any challenges that arise in their marriage. In an episode of the “Stay True” podcast on Monday, November 17, the “Full House” actress discussed her marriage to Bure. She also discussed how essential it was to have flexibility in marriage and how having children put pressure on the relationship. “And the rhythms are going to keep changing.” Cameron Bure continued, “So having flexibility not only in schedule but with each other as husband and wife, because that's the first thing that's going to go. Your marriage gets put to the test because first of all, you have kids that come in and they demand all of you. Then they get a little older, and then they pit you against your husband, and you don't even realize it.” Cameron Bure discussed what she meant about the children pitting her and her husband against each other by giving a relatable example. And he's like, ‘Well, I didn't know that. In the interview, Cameron Bure also discussed what she found worked for her and her husband, helping them keep their 29-year marriage strong. She spoke about finding “rhythms” and the importance of spending time together. She also stressed how important it is to have “time with you and your husband are going to be regardless, of career, but just in terms of children.” Cameron Bure continued to offer advice. “If I could lend you some advice that would be it is that you have to prioritize the relationship,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With so much bad news going around, it pays to appreciate the good stuff every once in a while, like a cold glass of water, that first snowfall, or Chris Elliott's groundbreaking comedy Get A Life finally making it to streaming. Celebrating its 35th anniversary this year, Get A Life, the anti-sitcom that allowed Elliott to graduate from Handsome Boy Modeling School, is making its way to Shout Factory's FAST streaming channel, Shout! All 35 episodes, newly upscaled and enhanced for televisions made after 2007, will feature the series' original music, which kept the show off DVD for more than 20 years. As a bit of housewarming, Shout is hosting a weekend-long marathon on December 6 and 7, giving viewers as much doomed 30-something paperboy as they can handle. Get A Life was the brainchild of Chris Elliott, Adam Resnick, and David Mirkin, but quickly became the blueprint for a new generation of comedy. Having worked together on Late Night With David Letterman, Elliott and Resnick teamed with Mirkin, who had worked on Newhart and The Simpsons, for the series, which posed as a typical multi-camera sitcom but often veered into surreal and disgusting diversions, typically ending with Elliot's demise. We've long been fans of the series. Decades before Community, Get A Life deconstructed both the sitcom genre and entertainment as a whole in ways both silly and surreal. And well before the rise of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Eastbound & Down, and other sitcoms featuring sociopathic antiheroes, Get A Life featured a protagonist who wasn't just goofy or a little misguided, but completely insane, a horrible, narcissistic human being.” TV's YouTube and Twitch channels, starting December 6. The complete series will be available to stream beginning December 8.
