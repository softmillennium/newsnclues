                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Carpenter's Antarctica-set sci-fi classic clearly had a significant influence on "Alien: Earth". When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. On the other they can check out a nihilistic horror about a dozen stir-crazy men at an Antarctic research station, who find themselves fighting for their lives — and the future of planet Earth — when an unwelcome visitor from outer space comes to stay. The first film was, of course, "ET: The Extra-Terrestrial", which went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time — a title it held until its director, Steven Spielberg, broke his own record with "Jurassic Park" a decade later. The other was John Carpenter's "The Thing", a Universal stablemate that turned out to be a major critical and commercial disappointment. But time has ultimately been kind to "The Thing", which now sits just behind "Alien" in the pantheon of sci-fi horror movies. Every so often, a movie director finds themselves on a golden run of movies, as Rob Reiner did with his unbroken sequence of "This is Spinal Tap", "The Sure Thing", "Stand by Me", "The Princess Bride", "When Harry Met Sally…", "Misery", and "A Few Good Men". Heading into "The Thing", John Carpenter had been on an all-killer, no-filler run of his own, thanks to "Assault on Precinct 13", "Halloween", "The Fog", and "Escape from New York". (You could even add his lo-fi debut, "Dark Star", to that list, depending on your tolerance for aliens who look like beach balls.) This string of indie hits was enough for Universal to give Carpenter his first studio movie, a remake — or reimagining, to use the modern parlance — of 1951's "The Thing from Another World". The studio had been eyeing up a new spin on John W Campbell's 1938 novella "Who Goes There?" since the mid-'70s — "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" director Tobe Hooper developed a version inspired by "Moby-Dick" — but "Alien"'s chest-bursting success had pushed it further up the to-do list. Although Carpenter was a big enough fan of "The Thing from Another World" to have characters in "Halloween" watching the black-and-white classic on TV, he certainly didn't fancy covering old ground. "But I re-read the novella and thought, 'You know, this is a pretty good story here,'" he said in an interview with Syfy Wire. With no internet, their only entertainment comes from booze, ping-pong, rudimentary video games, and VHS tapes of hokey old game shows. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! The 12 doomed men would be played by a mixture of character actors and up-and-comers — Childs was the first credited movie role for future Emmy-winner Keith David, who's since gone on to star in "Armageddon", "Pitch Black" and loads more. The most recognizable faces were arguably future "Cocoon" star Wilford Brimley and Kurt Russell, who'd worked with Carpenter on a 1979 TV movie about Elvis Presley and, more famously, "Escape From New York". But, as brilliantly cast as they were, this group was always going to be creature fodder, their on-screen life expectancies severely limited. Not that it sets off any alarm bells the first time we see it, having taken the form of a very cute dog, mercilessly hunted down by a pair of angry Norwegians. A subsequent trip to the Norwegians' smouldering base reveals death, destruction, and a hideously distorted corpse — though they probably should have left that particular discovery where it was. In order to realize his vision in this pre-CG era, Carpenter turned to prosthetics wunderkind Rob Bottin, who'd cut his teeth with Rick Baker before going solo on the 1981 werewolf movie that wasn't set in London, "The Howling". Bottin reportedly had an unprecedented effects budget to work with, and gave himself one of the broadest briefs imaginable. After all, he was the one who suggested that the Thing (no other name is provided) could take on any form, whether an Earth-based host or some alien creature it had encountered on its previous travels. The job proved so vast that Bottin ended up in hospital with exhaustion. From his suffering came a pinnacle in the history of in-camera movie effects, a "how on earth did they do that?" Carpenter also knew how to accentuate the magic Bottin was unleashing on-set. During the film's most famous sequence, in which a flatlining patient's chest turns into a set of giant jaws, the director substituted Dr Copper actor Richard Dysart for a real-life amputee in a mask — Carpenter reasoned that nobody would be looking at the actor's face when the character's arms are shockingly bitten off. Then, as the victim's disembodied head sprouts legs and eyes before scuttling away, you can't help but echo Palmer (David Clennon)'s now-iconic remark: "You gotta be f***ing kidding". The visuals are supported by impeccable work from supervising sound editor David Yewdall, who used animal noises manipulated and distorted beyond recognition to ensure that closing your eyes would offer little protection from the horrors unfolding on screen. With its new menagerie of extra-terrestrial pets — particularly the chillingly aware eye creature, Trypanohyncha Ocellus — "Alien: Earth" has clearly been heavily inspired by "The Thing". Indeed, in both cases, the creatures' shared penchant for literally burrowing under your skin is laser-targeted on the fear centers of your brain. It seems that critics and audiences were unprepared for the horrors Carpenter was sending their way, with many reviews simultaneously applauding Bottin's effects work while declaring them excessively gruesome. Carpenter's career also seemed to suffer in "The Thing"'s aftermath, as Universal slashed the budget on his planned Stephen King adaptation, "Firestarter", prompting the director to quit and make "Christine" for rival studio Columbia instead. Forty-three years on, however, it's widely regarded as a classic. It certainly has the best ending, as the last men standing (we won't spoil their identities here) "wait here for a little while, [to] see what happens". "I just feel like it's a secret that must be kept. The gods came down and swore me to secrecy." Richard's love affair with outer space started when he saw the original "Star Wars" on TV aged four, and he spent much of the '90s watching "Star Trek”, "Babylon 5” and “The X-Files" with his mum. After studying physics at university, he became a journalist, swapped science fact for science fiction, and hit the jackpot when he joined the team at SFX, the UK's biggest sci-fi and fantasy magazine. He has met five Doctors, two Starfleet captains and one Luke Skywalker, and once sat in the cockpit of "Red Dwarf"'s Starbug.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Podcaster and comedian Theo Von kicked up a bevy of mockery this week after his appearance on Joe Rogan's popular podcast went viral for all the wrong reasons, even being compared to a scene from the satirical comedy Arrested Development. Von stepped in it while defending the validity of conspiracy theories with Rogan. At one point during their conversation, Von told a story about a building being built near Hollywood that he claimed housed both a major talent agency and the CIA. He recalled a construction worker telling him the high-rise would have talent agency offices and as well as CIA, which he suggested was evidence they work hand in hand to deceive the public. Critics, however, were quick to point out the worker likely meant CAA – the LA-based sports and talent agency, Creative Artists Agency. Rogan began the exchange by saying it really irks him “when smart people are completely unwilling to recognize that conspiracies are not just real, but they're also not rare, they're very common.” “They're common, and people get away with them, especially when they're in positions of extreme power, like running intelligence agencies,” Rogan began, adding: Like, they can do it because they're allowed to, because they are a three-letter organization and they have ultimate power to do a lot of really gross things that are in the nature or in the interest of national security. So this is the whole idea behind it. This is the best move for national security. This is how we keep America safe.' Why is it our FBI and CIA are working against us? They're just tricking us about it,” Von replied. “They're tricking some people on purpose,” Rogan added. “But why is that even their goal? So this is the problem with your career. This has been explained to me by a lot of people that are experts and people that know. John Kiriakou explained it this way: Your reputation is based on how successful you have been arresting people, cracking cases. They basically set up an escape room and they're like, ‘I don't know how to get out of here.' And they pretend that they're just like a regular wizard that stumbled into the escape room. But no, you set the whole thing up. Well, it's the same as like a bunch of those stories. Oh, I think it's the same even with Hollywood,” Von replied, launching into an anecdote: And, you know, I remember one day I was walking in the Century City Mall over there. I was like, ‘What are you all building?' And he's like, ‘You're not even gonna believe this? Just happened to be that's what you're building?' He's like, ‘Yep, that's what we're building.' I don't think he was lying to me. “Right, but I think that this starts to happen. Things get—whether they're fiction or whatever goes on—you don't even know a lot of times what's a news story. “Oh yeah, but then you see movies and stuff come out later about it. So it's like you're almost creating your own news to then make a ‘based on a real story.' You know what I'm talking about?” Von declared. Don't get your news or worldview from charismatic know-nothings! Do get some laughs at their expense.” Theo Von is the perfect encapsulation of a conspiracy podcaster, just a moron all the way through.” The post Theo Von Savagely Mocked for Flub While Defending Conspiracy Theories With Joe Rogan first appeared on Mediaite.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An editorially independent publication supported by the Simons Foundation. But in general, research mathematicians don't need to think about it when they're solving their problems. This small community of mathematicians never stopped studying the fundamental nature of sets — particularly the strange infinite ones that other mathematicians ignore. In 2023, a mathematician named Anton Bernshteyn published a deep and surprising connection between the remote mathematical frontier of descriptive set theory and modern computer science. He showed that all problems about certain kinds of infinite sets can be rewritten as problems about how networks of computers communicate. There's no reason why their problems should be related, much less equivalent. “This is something really weird,” said Václav Rozhoň, a computer scientist at Charles University in Prague. “This whole time we've been working on very similar problems without directly talking to each other,” said Clinton Conley, a descriptive set theorist at Carnegie Mellon University. “It just opens the doors to all these new collaborations.” Bernshteyn was an undergraduate when he first heard of descriptive set theory — as an example of a field that had once mattered, then decayed to nothing. More than a year would pass before he found out the professor had been wrong. In 2014, as a first-year graduate student at the University of Illinois, Bernshteyn took a logic course with Anush Tserunyan, who would later become one of his advisers. “She should take all the credit for me being in this field,” he said. “She really made it seem that logic and set theory is this glue that connects all different parts of math.” Descriptive set theory dates back to Georg Cantor, who proved in 1874 that there are different sizes of infinity. Anush Tserunyan sees descriptive set theory as the connective tissue that holds different parts of mathematics together. At the time, mathematicians were deeply uncomfortable with this menagerie of different infinities. “It's hard to wrap your head around,” said Bernshteyn, who is now at the University of California, Los Angeles. Partly in response to that discomfort, mathematicians developed a different notion of size — one that described, say, how much length or area or volume a set might occupy, rather than the number of elements it contained. This notion of size is known as a set's “measure” (in contrast to Cantor's notion of size, which is a set's “cardinality”). Georg Cantor discovered that mathematical infinity can come in many different shapes and sizes. To study more complicated sets, mathematicians use other types of measures. Descriptive set theorists ask questions about which sets can be measured according to different definitions of “measure.” They then arrange them in a hierarchy based on the answers to those questions. At the top are sets that can be constructed easily and studied using any notion of measure you want. “The word people often use is ‘pathological,'” Bernshteyn said. This hierarchy doesn't just help set theorists map out the landscape of their field; it also gives them insights into what tools they can use to tackle more typical problems in other areas of math. Mathematicians in some fields, such as dynamical systems, group theory and probability theory, need information about the size of the sets they're using. A set's position in the hierarchy determines what tools they can use to solve their problem. Their job is to take a problem, determine how complicated a set its solution requires, and place it on the proper shelf, so that other mathematicians can take note. Bernshteyn belongs to a group of librarians who sort problems about infinite sets of nodes connected by edges, called graphs. Most graph theorists don't study these kinds of graphs; they focus on finite ones instead. But such infinite graphs can represent and provide information about dynamical systems and other important kinds of sets, making them a major area of interest for descriptive set theorists. Start with a circle, which contains infinitely many points. Pick one point: This will be your first node. Then move a fixed distance around the circle's circumference. If you move one-fifth of the way around the circle each time, it'll take five steps to get back where you started. In general, if you move any distance that can be written as a fraction, the nodes will form a closed loop. But that's not all: This infinitely long sequence forms only the first piece of your graph. You'll end up building a second infinite sequence of connected nodes, totally disconnected from the first. Do this for every possible new starting point on the circle. Mathematicians can then ask whether it's possible to color the nodes in this graph so that they obey certain rules. Using just two colors, for instance, can you color every node in the graph so that no two connected nodes are the same color? Look at the first piece of your graph, pick a node, and color it blue. Do the same for every piece in your graph: Pick a node, color it blue, then alternate colors. Ultimately, you'll use just two colors to achieve your task. But to accomplish this coloring, you had to rely on a hidden assumption that set theorists call the axiom of choice. It's one of the nine fundamental building blocks from which all mathematical statements are constructed. According to this axiom, if you start with a bunch of sets, you can choose one item from each of those sets to create a new set — even if you have infinitely many sets to choose from. You chose one item from each set — the first point you decided to color blue in each of the pieces. All those blue points formed a new set. Which leads to a problem when you color the rest of the nodes in alternating patterns of blue and yellow. You've colored each node (which has zero length) separately, without any understanding of how nodes relate to one another when they come from different pieces of the graph. Mathematicians can't say anything useful about them. And so they want to figure out a way to color the graph in a continuous way — a way that doesn't use the axiom of choice, and that gives them measurable sets. Soon, you'll have made it almost completely around the circle — meaning that you've assigned a color to all the nodes in your graph except for the ones that fall in a small, leftover segment. Say the last arc you colored was yellow. How do you color this final, smaller segment? You can't use blue, because these nodes will connect to nodes in the original arc you colored blue. You can calculate the lengths of these sets. Descriptive set theorists therefore place the two-color version of the problem on the lowest shelf in their hierarchy (for unmeasurable sets), while the three-color problem goes on a much higher shelf of problems — ones where lots of notions of measure can be applied. Then, shortly after he finished his degree, he stumbled on a potential way to shelve them all at once — and to show that these problems have a much deeper and more mathematically relevant structure than anyone had realized. From time to time, Bernshteyn enjoys going to computer science talks, where graphs are finite and represent networks of computers. Nearby routers can interfere with each other if they use the same communication frequency channel. So each router needs to choose a different channel from the ones used by its immediate neighbors. But there's a catch: Nodes can only communicate with their immediate neighbors, using so-called local algorithms. First, each node runs the same algorithm and assigns itself a color. It repeats this step until the whole network has a proper coloring. Computer scientists want to know how many steps a given algorithm requires. For example, any local algorithm that can solve the router problem with only two colors must be incredibly inefficient, but it's possible to find a very efficient local algorithm if you're allowed to use three. One of the thresholds, he realized, sounded a lot like a threshold that existed in the world of descriptive set theory — about the number of colors required to color certain infinite graphs in a measurable way. To Bernshteyn, it felt like more than a coincidence. It wasn't just that computer scientists are like librarians too, shelving problems based on how efficiently their algorithms work. It wasn't just that these problems could also be written in terms of graphs and colorings. Perhaps, he thought, the two bookshelves had more in common than that. Perhaps all the books, and their shelves, were identical, just written in different languages — and in need of a translator. He wanted to show that every efficient local algorithm can be turned into a Lebesgue-measurable way of coloring an infinite graph (that satisfies some additional important properties). That is, one of computer science's most important shelves is equivalent to one of set theory's most important shelves (high up in the hierarchy). He began with the class of network problems from the computer science lecture, focusing on their overarching rule — that any given node's algorithm uses information about just its local neighborhood, whether the graph has a thousand nodes or a billion. To run properly, all the algorithm has to do is label each node in a given neighborhood with a unique number, so that it can log information about nearby nodes and give instructions about them. That's easy enough to do in a finite graph: Just give every node in the graph a different number. The computer scientist Václav Rozhoň has been taking advantage of a newfound connection between set theory and network science to solve problems he's interested in. If Bernshteyn could run the same algorithm on an infinite graph, it meant he could color the graph in a measurable way — solving a graph-coloring question on the set theory side. There's no way to uniquely label all their nodes. But that was fine so long as nearby nodes were labeled differently. Was there a way to assign labels without accidentally reusing one in the same neighborhood? Bernshteyn showed that there is always a way — no matter how many labels you decide to use, and no matter how many nodes your local neighborhood has. “Any algorithm in our setup corresponds to a way of measurably coloring any graph in the descriptive set theory setup,” Rozhoň said. The proof came as a surprise to mathematicians. Mathematicians are now exploring how to take advantage of Bernshteyn's discovery. In a paper published this year, for instance, Rozhoň and his colleagues figured out that it's possible to color special graphs called trees by looking at the same problem in the computer science context. “This is a very interesting experience, trying to prove results in a field where I don't understand even the basic definitions,” Rozhoň said. Mathematicians have also been working to translate problems in the other direction. In one case, they used set theory to prove a new estimate of how hard a certain class of problems is to solve. Bernshteyn's bridge isn't just about having a new tool kit for solving individual problems. It has also allowed set theorists to gain a clearer view of their field. There were lots of problems that they had no idea how to classify. In many cases, that's now changed, because set theorists have computer scientists' more organized bookshelves to guide them.

Swap out those god-awful, cheap plasticky looking character models because you have me absolutely sold on everything else this game has to offer. Yep, the Genshin developer is making another game—after only recently announcing Petite Planet while also working on Honkai spin-off Nexus Anima—and this time it's all the usual HoYo gubbins served up on a Control-esque platter where you appear to be working for a paranormal government agency while black goopy mindrot takes over people's mental health. That last part is perhaps a little too on the nose, HoYo. That feeling lasted about two entire seconds though when the demo flung a plastic-faced, doe-eyed protagonist in my face. It's a weird juxtaposition to Varsapura's environment design which I actually do quite like—dare I go so far as to say the character models look painfully cheap, something you'd nab out of an asset store than the interestingly designed protagonists I've become accustomed to in the likes of Honkai: Star Rail and Genshin Impact I think part of that plainness is a consequence of HoYo clearly trying to lean into realism a little more here—for starters, a huge amount of the open world appears to be based on Singapore with certain buildings and street names making an appearance—but you can't do that and then slap a pair of giant twinkling eyes on a brown-haired Jane Doe. It's a shame because I really do like everything else that Varsapura has going on. Some light horror elements abound when the protag is pulled away to meet a mysterious shadowy figure (HoYo really pushed the boat out by naming him "Mr. Combat-wise, it does bear a lot of similarities to Zenless Zone Zero—swapping characters to combo their ultimates and abilities together, zipping around and dodging oncoming attacks. I am, admittedly, rather smitten with the bizarre weapon choices HoYo has opted for here, though: the protagonist wields an umbrella, her ultimate a Persona 3-style suicide to make it rain. Secondary character and patrol officer Sayuki, meanwhile, literally wields stacks of paperwork. She smacks enemies around with a single document-stuffed file folder, with her ability letting her drop a giant stack down on top of enemies. After showing plenty of combat—including stealth elements with abilities that can temporarily stun enemies—Varsapura opens up into the open world where the two girls are heading to a crime scene in a comically small clown car-ass police vehicle. As much as I love both HoYoverse creations and gacha games, I do tend to try and maintain a healthy scepticism about them. But off-putting models aside, I am picking up what Varsapura is putting down—giant stacks of paperwork an' all. Mollie spent her early childhood deeply invested in games like Killer Instinct, Toontown and Audition Online, which continue to form the pillars of her personality today. She can often be found causing mischief in Final Fantasy 14, using those experiences to write neat things about her favourite MMO. When she's not staring at her bunny girl she can be found sweating out rhythm games, pretending to be good at fighting games or spending far too much money at her local arcade.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The internet is buzzing once again, reigniting an old debate about extraterrestrial visitors. Following the resurfacing of a famous prophecy by the late Baba Vanga, a new, viral theory suggesting an 'alien ship' has captured global attention. He stated that the object, which NASA and other space projects worldwide have monitored, is believed to be older than our planet, with an estimated age of 5 to 8 billion years. Whitesides made it clear that nothing proves the internet whispers claiming the celestial body is an extraterrestrial spacecraft travelling through our Solar System. Today, NASA released new images of 3I/ATLAS, the comet that has been making headlines.As a member of @sciencedems, I received a special briefing on this subject, and want to share the top three things you need to know. Since its discovery on 1 July 2025, the comet has generated significant interest, prompting NASA to organise an observation effort across the entire Solar System. 3I/ATLAS has garnered significant attention because one researcher proposed that it was not a comet but an extraterrestrial device, citing its path, material composition, and several other factors. Speaking at a news briefing in Greenbelt, Maryland, Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, referred to the celestial object as 'our friendly solar system visitor.' She commented on the worldwide interest: 'It's natural to wonder what it is.' Thank you to Dr. Nicky Fox and Dr. Tom Statler from @NASA for sharing their insights on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS! We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet.' Nevertheless, none of these assertions has been substantiated, and there is no recorded proof showing she made a specific reference to this interstellar body. Baba Vanga foresaw a world covered in darkness following an alien invasion during one of her visions. She added in another prediction that the Earth's orbit could 'change'. If this were to happen, the climate on Earth would change massively. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, in a draft paper called 'Is the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Alien Technology?,' suggested the object might indeed be an alien spacecraft. Loeb highlighted several irregularities, including the object's orbit being aligned to within 5 degrees of Earth's ecliptic plane, a phenomenon he judged statistically rare, occurring by chance only once in every 500 instances. 'As of now, I assign a 30–40% likelihood that 3I/ATLAS does not have a fully natural origin, based on its seven anomalies that I listed here,' Loeb writes in earlier blog posts. However, Loeb also offered a balanced view, acknowledging the most straightforward explanation: 'As of now, 3I/ATLAS appears most likely to be a natural comet.' 'But the remote possibility of an Oberth manoeuvre must be considered seriously as a black swan event with a small probability, because of its huge implications for humanity,' he added. NASA has officially responded, confirming that, for now, the mysterious 3I/ATLAS is just an exceptionally old comet, moving silently through our Solar System.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 31-minute Varsapura gameplay demo from Hoyoverse shows off the noir open world and rapid action, with hints of Control and LA Noire. Set in what appears to be modern-day Singapore with a mixture of paranormal investigation, dialogue choices, stealth sequences, and combat that takes notes from Zenless Zone Zero against a shadowy foe powered by the 'Mindrot,' it's already grabbed my attention. Fortunately, we're told, "Applicants can exit the scenario at any time by thinking: 'Requesting intervention.'" More directly pressing are the shadow creatures it spawns, which our character battles with umbrella-based attacks (a real Hoyoverse favorite of late, between ZZZ's Vivian and Yuzuha, but I love playing as both so I won't complain). The battle system looks familiar enough that you probably know what to expect if you've played Zenless Zone Zero or Genshin Impact. You can swap between party members mid-combat, and some of the voice lines indicate specific enemy weaknesses. I'm particularly taken by Sayuki, who bashes foes with stacks of files, sending papers flying everywhere. However, Hoyoverse looks to have a few fresh tricks up its sleeve as well. Shadow, the player character reveals why they want to join SEAL: "I'm looking for my killer - not the most altruistic goal." It looks like we'll have a bit more narrative control than the Hoyoverse standard of 'two options with one outcome,' too. During the conversation, there are options marked with colored tags including 'Empathy,' 'Persuasion,' and 'Deception,' along with a standard response to just provide an up-front answer. There's also a stealth sequence where the lead floats up onto rooftops with her umbrella and uses abilities to stun and assassinate patrolling foes. The more realistic art style is somewhat at odds with the anime character design, but I could see myself getting used to it pretty quickly. While Hoyoverse doesn't have much else to say for now, it does add that "upon entering Varsapura, the protagonist's appearance shifts to match each viewer's preferences," suggesting that we'll have the ability to fully customize the look of our main character. Its other statements refer to the studio "currently recruiting individuals with exceptional perceptual acuity and high cognitive stability," a nod to the fact that it's hiring for more developers to work on the project. I'll certainly be watching this one with close interest. He wants to play everything that comes out, but keeps finding himself back on old favorites.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We'll keep digging -- no matter who wants the truth buried. Become a HuffPost member and fuel reporting they can't silence. The report, which references analysis from Cornell University researchers Harold Triedman and Alexios Mantzarlis, noted that Grokipedia cited a neo-Nazi website called Stormfront as a source 42 times, the conspiracy theory website InfoWars 34 times and the white nationalist website VDare 107 times. Triedman previously worked for the Wikimedia Foundation and continues to do contract work for an affiliate of the organization, though he noted this research was independent. Although the researchers' paper was a preprint, NBC News corroborated several findings. Stormfront was created by a former Ku Klux Klan leader and is described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as what may be the “Western world's most popular forum for so called ‘white nationalists. '” Infowars has been criticized for spreading conspiracy theories on a number of subjects, including the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school. Wikipedia, conversely, doesn't “treat those sources as credible,” NBC reported. The researchers' analysis adds to scrutiny of Grokipedia, which Musk launched a few weeks ago to counter what he's described as Wikipedia's “woke” bias. Already, the site's been observed pushing far-right talking points in its content, according to Wired, and it's also been mocked for offering a more flattering portrayal of Musk compared to the entry on Wikipedia.</p>
