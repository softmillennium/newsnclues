                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most digital asset treasuries (DATs) have suffered declines in their net asset value (NAV), making it difficult to raise funds for new investments or to attract new retail investors, leaving existing shareholders “trapped” with growing paper losses, according to 10x Research founder Markus Thiele DATs are also facing significant pressure from the MSCI stock market index, which is considering excluding corporate crypto treasuries with a balance sheet comprising more than 50% of crypto assets. Elsewhere, Bitcoin BTCUSD sank to a six-month low of $82,000 on Friday, a level last seen in April when the markets were recovering from US President Donald Trump's Liberation Day tariff announcement, TradingView data shows. BitMine sits on $3.7 billion loss as DAT “Hotel California” meets BlackRock's staked ETH ETF Concerns are mounting over the sustainability of corporate crypto-treasury firms as BlackRock moves forward with a staked Ether fund that analysts say could compete directly with existing digital-asset treasuries. BitMine Immersion Technologies, the world's largest corporate Ether holder, is currently down $1,000 per purchased ETH, implying a cumulative unrealized loss of $3.7 billion on its total holdings, according to a Thursday research report from crypto insights company 10x Research. The decline in net asset value (NAV) across these firms is making it difficult to attract new retail investors while leaving many existing shareholders effectively “trapped” unless they sell at a steep loss, 10x Research founder Markus Thielen wrote in a LinkedIn post. “When the premium inevitably shrinks to zero, as it is doing now, investors find themselves trapped in the structure, unable to get out without significant damage, a true Hotel California scenario,” he said. He added that, unlike exchange-traded funds (ETFs), digital-asset treasury companies, or DATs, “layer on complex, opaque, and often hedge-fund-like fee structures that can quietly erode returns.” Values below 1 make it much harder to expand capital and holdings. SEC to hold privacy and financial surveillance roundtable in December The US Securities and Exchange Commission's Crypto Task Force has scheduled a roundtable discussion centered on privacy and financial surveillance for December, as a renewed focus on privacy grips the cryptocurrency industry. Like other SEC roundtables, crypto industry executives and SEC officials will discuss common pain points and solutions, but no hard policy proposals will be submitted. When those in charge start being hostile to privacy protections, it is a major red flag,” said Naomi Brockwell, founder of the Ludlow Institute, an organization advocating for liberty through technology. Coinbase has launched Ether-backed loans for US users, allowing customers to borrow USDC against their ETH holdings without selling, in a new offering powered by Morpho and running on Base. The exchange said the product is available across most US states, except New York, with variable rates and liquidation risk tied to market conditions. The new product is being launched in collaboration with Morpho, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol. According to Dune data, Coinbase's onchain lending markets have processed more than $1.25 billion in loan originations, backed by about $1.37 billion in deposited collateral. Roughly $810 million in loans is outstanding, with more than 13,500 wallets holding active borrow positions. In a Wednesday blog post, the group said DeFi infrastructure could potentially save unbanked and underbanked people around the world about $30 billion annually by reducing remittance costs. The organization cited examples of workers sending funds home and paying fees to do so, which could be reduced “by up to 80%” with DeFi. “Nothing is free, and DeFi doesn't eliminate costs entirely, but by removing intermediaries and leveraging software rather than outdated financial systems, we can dramatically reduce the cost of financial services for everyday people and give them greater control of their finances.” Mastercard taps Polygon to turn clunky crypto addresses into simple usernames Mastercard is expanding its Crypto Credential program to self-custody wallets, allowing users to send and receive cryptocurrencies using verified, username-style aliases instead of long wallet addresses. “By streamlining wallet addresses and adding meaningful verification, Mastercard Crypto Credential is building trust in digital token transfers,” said Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of blockchain and digital assets at Mastercard.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's down more than 33% from its all-time high above $126,000 in early October, which officially pushes the digital unit into bear market territory defined as at least 20% lower than the record high. Bitcoin's now down about 10% this year, and likely will see more selling which could mean its first annual loss since 2022, experts said. "It seems early in the selloff process," said Hyunsu Jung, chief executive of publicly traded crypto-treasury company Hyperion DeFi. A whirlwind of factors have contributed to crypto's downfall, analysts said. Cryptocurrency tends to trade in line with the riskier growth stocks like in artficial intelligence and technology, which also have been battered lately amid high valuation worries and an uncertain economy. Global interest rate uncertainty and moves to cash by corporate digital asset treasuries and other large crypto holders like investment firm Blackrock are also weighing on crypto, Jung said. That initial sell-off pushed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin through several technical support levels on price charts that triggered a cascade of sales among trend followers, exacerbating the decline. Specifically, key signals that prompted more selling according to Tom Essaye, founder and president of Sevens Report Research, include: The sharp decline could force even more sales, some analysts warned. It's "reawakened concerns about a further wave of forced selling, amid worries that retail investors might need to liquidate other assets to meet margin calls," Deutsche Bank economist Jim Reid said. Once the dust settles - and no one can say yet when that might be - investors with iron stomachs may want to tip toe in, some experts said. After sifting through corporate 13Fs, or a required Securities and Exchange Commission form for institutional investment managers who oversee at least $100 million in assets under management, LPL Financial's portfolio strategist George Smith found "a large increase in cryptocurrency-related products and blockchain mining firms (underscoring) the growing institutional appetite for digital assets." That could bode well for cryptocurrency because institutional investors are often considered "smart money." Again,"no one should ever invest beyond their risk tolerance," said David Namdar, chief executive of CEA Industries, the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency Binance Coin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this year, at Hong Kong's Bitcoin Asia, there was a growing sense of frustration with Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies and their lagging performance against the asset they fill their coffers with. “Just buy an ETF,” is how Strive Asset Management CEO Matt Cole put it on stage during a panel at the conference. They are an expression of Japan's tax incentives, which punish direct crypto gains but reward equity gains with lower rates and loss offsets. Crypto profits in Japan are treated as miscellaneous income, lumped with salary and other earnings, and taxed at progressive rates that can reach 55% for the highest earnings. Investors who want Bitcoin exposure without the 55% tax bill have little choice but to bid up the shares of companies that hold BTC. At the same time, the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Japan Exchange Group are growing increasingly uneasy with the volatility their own tax regime helped fuel, CoinDesk previously reported, as they have begun warning companies about backdoor listing tactics, tightening audits, and signaling that the DAT model may expose retail investors to risks they do not fully understand. Similar conversations are happening elsewhere in Asia, with regulators in Hong Kong, India, and Australia reportedly concerned about the structure and are discouraging listed companies from going through with the strategy. Back in Japan, DAT's might soon be losing their luster as the country's tax authority mulls a change to the tax treatment of crypto. If this happens, without the tax edge, Tokyo-listed DATs will quickly lose their luster. “Just buy an ETF” may end up being the advice that works in Japan too. Tom Lee's company could trap shareholders amid low staking yields, hefty embedded fees and vanishing NAV premium, 10x Research founder Markus Thielen warns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rising cryptocurrency adoption is now one of the strongest forces accelerating the worldwide rollout of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), reveals a new global analysis. The research examines how digital asset use, financial inclusion gaps, governance conditions, and technological infrastructure influence a country's position in the global CBDC race. It uses a combination of panel regressions, ordered logistic models, dynamic GMM estimation, and margins analysis to determine how the Cryptocurrency Adoption Rate (CAR) affects a nation's likelihood of moving from early CBDC research to full-scale launch. The findings show that cryptocurrency adoption has become a decisive global catalyst. When matched with the IMF's CBDC track database, a clear relationship emerges. Nations with high CAR levels tend to move away from the earliest category, no plan or cancelled CBDC exploration, and increasingly occupy the development, pilot, or launch stages. This pattern remains stable even when controlling for macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rates, exchange rate volatility, and governance quality. In contrast, the probability of advancing to pilot or launch grows substantially. These outcomes hold even after adjusting for year effects, regional differences, economic size, and institutional strength. The authors explain this phenomenon using Diffusion of Innovation theory. Cryptocurrencies represent a technological innovation that spreads rapidly through societies when traditional banking systems struggle to meet public demand. As adoption intensifies, central banks perceive greater pressure to respond with their own digital currencies to preserve monetary sovereignty, stabilize payment channels, and prevent dependence on unregulated private digital assets. As crypto activity expands, regulatory legitimacy becomes a growing concern. This institutional motivation is particularly strong where governments lack robust mechanisms to regulate or monitor the movement of digital capital. The net effect is clear: cryptocurrencies are no longer merely a parallel financial system but have become a structural driver of state digital currency innovation. In low-income and lower-middle-income countries, CAR exhibits a powerful, positive influence on CBDC acceleration. The association remains significant even after controlling for digital infrastructure and macroeconomic variables. These countries often face limited financial access, weak traditional banking systems, and fragmented payment networks. On one hand, it signals the public's willingness to adopt digital financial tools. The study finds that CBDCs in these regions are framed as tools for financial inclusion, allowing governments to extend formal financial services to populations historically left out of banking systems. Here, crypto markets tend to reflect rising economic activity, higher internet penetration, and more complex financial needs. Central banks in these economies often pursue CBDCs to modernize payment infrastructure, accommodate digital commerce, and reduce reliance on cash. In high-income economies, the relationship between CAR and CBDC advancement weakens significantly. The authors report minimal statistical significance in this segment. Their interpretation is that wealthy nations are not developing CBDCs as a defensive response to cryptocurrency adoption but as strategic upgrades to long-standing financial systems. In these markets, CBDCs are linked to goals such as enhancing cross-border payment efficiency, strengthening monetary policy transmission, reducing settlement times, and preserving long-term competitiveness as global payment rails evolve. The study's heterogeneity analysis thus reveals a global divide: in developing economies, CBDCs are a reactive and corrective measure; in advanced economies, they are proactive instruments for future-proofing national financial infrastructure. The authors evaluate a wide range of variables, including inflation, governance quality, financial inclusion, mobile connectivity, and economic freedom, to determine which conditions best predict a country's CBDC trajectory. One of the most influential conditions identified is financial inclusion. Countries with low financial inclusion rates show the strongest responsiveness to CAR. This trend underscores a critical insight: CBDCs are increasingly viewed as digital public infrastructure for serving unbanked and underbanked populations. Nations with higher mobile connectivity and better digital literacy tend to advance more quickly through the CBDC development cycle. This suggests that the move toward CBDCs is not only a function of technical capability but also a policy response to structural market pressures created by decentralized digital currencies. Inflation and interest rates are not consistently associated with CBDC advancement across models, which contradicts the assumption that unstable monetary environments directly push governments to adopt CBDCs. Instead, the study finds that institutional and technological factors matter more than short-term macroeconomic fluctuations. Both pathways illustrate how governance interacts with national priorities, regulatory gaps, and market pressures. These patterns grow more pronounced during 2022–2024, suggesting that the global digital currency ecosystem has rapidly matured. Overall, crypto adoption, financial inclusion, and technological readiness operate as reinforcing forces, jointly accelerating CBDC development in many parts of the world.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BitMine Immersion Technologies, the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, reported $328 million in full-year income on Friday while declaring its first dividend, but its share price fell amid concerns about digital asset treasury strategies and ETH's recent price drop. The company that owns $9.6 billion worth of Ethereum plans to pay common stockholders a dividend of one cent per share next month, according to an SEC filing. BitMine shares recently changed hands around $24.65, a 5.3% decrease on the day, according to Yahoo Finance. Lee linked the current route to a drop in market liquidity on Oct. 10 last month, when $19 billion worth of leveraged positions were liquidated in the crypto market. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum can be natively staked, allowing firms like Bitmine to grow their holdings by validating transactions and earning rewards. But the company hasn't staked any of its Ethereum holdings in a material way yet. Along those lines, the company said it's selected three pilot partners “to conduct a live test of their staking capabilities using a small portion of our ETH.” BitMine's stock price has underperformed Ethereum as the digital asset's price has fallen 28% over the past month to a four-month low of $2,700, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. When BitMine first purchased Ethereum, it was valued around $3,600 in July. BitMine currently owns 192 Bitcoin, as well as 3.55 million Ethereum, the latter of which was purchased at an average cost of around $3,120, according to a previous press release.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>November 21, 2025 – Bitcoin (BTC) is currently navigating a period of significant price decline, plummeting to its lowest levels since April 2025 and erasing all of its 2025 gains. This sharp downturn is not an isolated event, but rather a complex interplay of macroeconomic pressures, a pervasive "risk-off" sentiment across global markets, and growing apprehensions surrounding the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a staggering contraction, with over $1 trillion wiped from its total valuation in the past six weeks, as investors re-evaluate their exposure to speculative assets amidst an increasingly uncertain economic landscape. The immediate implications are clear: heightened volatility, investor fear, and a broad reassessment of risk across both digital assets and high-growth technology equities. Bitcoin's underperformance compared to the broader stock market, which has also faced declines but less severely, underscores its sensitivity as a higher-risk asset in the current environment. This confluence of factors paints a challenging picture for the crypto market in the short term, demanding close attention from investors and industry participants alike. Several critical factors have converged to create this perfect storm for Bitcoin: The recent decline in Bitcoin and escalating AI concerns in late 2025 signify a broader market reassessment of speculative assets and high-growth technologies. These events are driving a "risk-off" sentiment, highlighting the interconnectedness of tech and crypto markets, and prompting accelerated regulatory efforts. Both periods were characterized by rapid innovation, significant speculative investment, and hype surrounding transformative technology. Overvaluation, media hype, and FOMO fueled investor enthusiasm. The current crypto decline and AI bubble fears suggest a similar risk of significant price corrections. However, key differences exist: blockchain technology offers diverse applications beyond digital currencies, the crypto market has shown resilience, and both crypto and AI are facing increasing regulatory scrutiny. Moving forward, the market will likely remain characterized by volatility and a continued "risk-off" sentiment in the short term. Investors should closely watch for shifts in Federal Reserve policy, institutional investment flows into Bitcoin ETFs, and concrete developments in AI profitability and ethical governance. The long-term outlook for both Bitcoin and AI remains promising due to their foundational technological innovations and transformative potential, but the path ahead will undoubtedly require careful navigation through economic headwinds and evolving market sentiment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a Master's degree in science journalism from City University, London, she is passionate about exploring complex topics in the world of technology. Monad is getting a lot of attention ahead of the Monad crypto launch, partly because its ICO is happening exclusively on Coinbase. Most L2 tokens are far below their ATH, which makes people question whether Monad can avoid the same path. Monad is one of those crypto projects everyone has heard about by now. The project expanded quickly throughout 2025, and some believe Monad has real potential, while others expect it to follow the usual L2 pattern of early hype, rapid growth, and a slow decline. Matas Čepulis, Founder and CEO of LuvKaizen, told Cryptonews that Monad reminds him of projects like Sei (SEI), Sui (SUI), and Avalanche (AVAX). $250 million raised or something, but it all ends at some point with minimum TVL and no revenue. Token performance does not work in their favour either. According to CoinPaprika, most L2 tokens are down around 90% from their all-time highs (ATH) or even lower. In the crypto community, this drop is usually called death. Compared to others, they are down 67% and 64% from ATH. It is worth noting that both are fairly new. Mantle is supported by Bybit, which keeps adding various passive-income options. Zora is more speculative, but the project created a lot of hype at launch and still attracts attention from time to time. The bigger problem is simple: there are too many L2s. But the boom in DeFi and Web3 created an environment where chains appeared faster than anyone could track, and most of them were not offering anything new. Some users see a big future for it, especially around its NFTs and trading cards, which generated plenty of attention even though the NFT sector has struggled for years. This alone gives the project more liquidity and visibility than most new chains receive at launch. The $MON sale is now live on Coinbase.Yes, including for US users.pic.twitter.com/XOMagpQCCS During market corrections traders look for new opportunities, and with Monad gaining attention, it naturally fits certain speculative strategies. One realistic scenario is a quick sell-off shortly after the Monad crypto launch. There could be a brief spike followed by early investors securing profits. The classic hold strategy stopped working in many cases, and traders entered aggressively and exited quickly, like what happened with the recent Uniswap (UNI) rally. They usually notice growth after it has already taken place. Čepulis also noted that many people who had been farming Monad for months may end up receiving very little: Yappers and KOLs maybe got their part, but I feel really sorry for small accounts who were pushing daily and got really nothing out of it. On X, there are plenty of accounts actively promoting Monad, which raises questions about how the supply will circulate once trading begins. It is still unclear what will happen to users who receive tokens through the ICO rather than farming. It's kind of hard to be bearish on @monad ICO. No way they let it fail– $1b will be sent back from MegaETH ICO today– Solomon raised $100m a few days ago on basically vaporware@polymarket pricing in:a) 91% odds of raising > $200mb) 35%… pic.twitter.com/r0k1EQ0I1z Traders in the current market often prioritise quick profit-taking over long-term utility, which increases this risk.

Looking past the market noise, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is about to usher in a new dawn for Bitcoin, and like Zcash (ZEC), it could turn early investors into millionaires. For sure, the CoinMarketCap fear and greed index is flashing red for ‘extreme fear', but if you follow the sheep, you always end up getting slaughtered. The smart move is to start dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin at these lows. Bitcoin has fallen 34% from its all-time high of $126,000, which by any measure puts it in bear market territory. Despite the blood on the screen, there are strong signals of a bright new dawn for Bitcoin, driven by technical fundamentals – crypto could be getting back to focusing on on-chain utility and not how many institutions are stacking Bitcoin via investments in ETFs or digital asset treasury (DAT) stocks, like Michael Saylor's Strategy. However, while Bitcoin has been in free fall, privacy coin Zcash (ZEC) is surging, with its price up 178% over the past month. For instance, the Winklevoss twins' new DAT vehicle, Cypherpunk Technologies (formerly Leap Therapeutics), announced on November 12 that it would start hoarding ZEC. In another boost for ZEC bulls, Binance has launched a ZEC/USDC perpetual contract with 75x leverage, further fuelling institutional interest. Zcash is built on the Bitcoin codebase and uses zero-knowledge proofs to mask transactions. Sentiment soured on privacy coins like Monero and Zcash when the Financial Action Task Force travel rules were introduced, which had the effect of encouraging institutions to steer clear because of regulatory risk. That sentiment appears to have changed markedly, probably influenced by the pro-crypto mood music in Washington. In its latest dev update, the team lays out its plans for onboarding a special type of builders “who care about speed and security, composability and credibility”. The dev team reports that they have already seen early interest from “teams working on DeFi primitives, data protocols, and wallet tooling who want to build within a Bitcoin-based environment but need the power of parallel execution”. Bitcoin Hyper frees up BTC to realize its original mission as digital cash. In other words, a significant narrative shift is underway, which extends the rationale for buying Bitcoin beyond its store of value properties. With the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2 deployed, the Bitcoin security layer will have an ecosystem of Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) applications built on top of it. Settlement occurs on the Bitcoin base security layer, ensuring asset integrity. Demand for HYPER will boom as Layer 2 usage grows, underpinning its self-expanding value proposition. You can buy using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card. Interested parties can find HYPER listed in the app's Upcoming Tokens section, making it straightforward to buy, track, and claim once live.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Currency changes between the Indian rupee and world rates can alter the prices of Bitcoin among retail investors. This might provide a clue on how global trends can impact local preferences towards cryptocurrency. The movement of volatile foreign currencies versus the prices of digital currencies is a subtle puzzle among Indian crypto investors. Market capitalisation is ₹198,386.28 billion, with a trading volume of over ₹3,901.21 billion in the last 24 hours, based on a circulating supply of 19.92 million BTC. These figures illustrate how small currency fluctuations can significantly impact the rupee value of crypto assets. Local prices are based on the global price movement of Bitcoin and the dollar-rupee rate adds extra volatility. The observers who observe rising markets assert that macroeconomic activity in currencies and correlation across assets meaningfully affect local valuations in crypto. The patterns in the information show that high-risk nation investors with high-currency-denominated assets experience more notable price changes than investors in safer nations with stable exchange rates. The effect often creates a perception gap between international requirements and local valuations. For instance, when foreign liquidity is high and Bitcoin moves more in dollar terms, investors in nations with falling currencies often document even more spectacular rises, fueling more speculative interest. The losses in these instances can be too significant, inciting sell-offs more vigorously than in developed markets. Analysts observe that the interaction of such dynamics illustrates how macroeconomic context cannot be disaggregated in crypto analysis: in the context of currencies, no stability can be presupposed. For Indian investors, seeing their portfolio values swing dramatically while overseas prices remain relatively stable can induce distortion in their perception of performance. A dull local appreciation in rupee terms can stifle exhilaration, while rupee weakness can overestimate the upside—infecting speculative frenzy. Moreover, Market observers note that discrepancies in USD-based valuations versus local currency conversions often take domestic investors by surprise, as the gap between overseas headlines and local account statements can be substantial. The point underlined is that perception of gain or loss is as much brought on by crypto volatility as movement in the currency in which return calculations are made. Seeing the influence of currencies in perspective is critical. Adoption in broader terms, global volume patterns and the innovation cycle predominantly dictate Bitcoin's valuation in any given currency. Although the rupee contributes to local sentiment, its long-term direction is ultimately determined by underlying factors. Analysis conducted by Binance highlights the importance of combining technical information with macro observations to create a comprehensive perspective. From live Bitcoin-to-INR conversions to a broader macroeconomic context, the data demonstrates that currency strength must always be accounted for when interpreting blockchain-asset performance regionally.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cryptocurrency arena is currently grappling with a seismic shake-up, as once-revered meme coins like DOGE and SHIB plunge dramatically, while NFTs face a crash reminiscent of market lows from months past. Chaos reigns, leaving investors floundering in a sea of uncertainty as the digital asset landscape shifts before their eyes. In this environment, grasping the wide-ranging implications of these staggering losses is no longer optional; it has become essential. With meme coin valuations plummeting, caution has emerged as the industry's new ethos in investment strategy. This seismic shift not only underscores the inherent risk of these speculative assets but also paints a cautionary tale about how swiftly soaring valuations can evaporate, leaving a trail of losses in their wake. This cascading decline is inexorably linked to larger market currents affecting heavyweight cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin recently saw its price dip below $102,000—a clear signal of wary investor sentiment—and Ethereum has struggled to maintain ground beneath the $3,500 threshold, hindered by shrinking DeFi volumes. The wild swings observed in meme and NFT markets signal an urgent call for regulatory evolution. Experts anticipate that this current turmoil will trigger essential changes aimed at bolstering transparency and compliance in the cryptocurrency space. For nascent Web3 startups, adaptability in the face of regulatory flux is not just advisable; it's vital. Those companies that can implement robust frameworks for compliance and risk management may find themselves better equipped to weather market storms and foster sustainable growth. Reflecting on historical patterns offers invaluable insights particularly relevant in today's climate. Retail enthusiasm for meme coins like DOGE and SHIB surged in the previous cycles due to compelling narratives, echoing earlier market excitement. Yet, the present landscape compels a shift toward more prudent financial strategies. As the current landscape presents myriad challenges, how can investors safeguard their holdings against further volatility? One pivotal strategy involves integrating comprehensive treasury management practices with stringent compliance measures. By embracing sustainable investment practices and exploring decentralized frameworks, they can mitigate risks associated with abrupt market changes. Embracing a more tactical, risk-aware investment philosophy, and preparing for the regulatory landscape's evolution positions participants better to navigate the stormy waters of cryptocurrency. In a domain defined by uncertainty, knowledge and strategic foresight have never been more vital. OneSafe brings together your crypto and banking needs in one simple, powerful platform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Citi and Swift successfully test synchronized fiat-to-digital currency payments using USDC on Ethereum. A new front for global digital asset settlements? Citi and Swift have successfully completed a trial demonstrating the feasibility of settling payments between fiat and digital currencies. The trial utilized a Payment-versus-Payment (PvP) workflow, ensuring synchronized settlement of both currency types in real-time. By incorporating blockchain technology into existing financial systems, this trial marks a significant step forward in bridging the gap between fiat and digital assets. This system ensures that both fiat and digital currencies settle simultaneously, removing execution risks. The trial leveraged Swift's existing infrastructure, enhanced with blockchain connectors, orchestrators, and smart contracts to accommodate digital currencies. This system ensured that the transaction was finalized without errors, proving that both fiat and digital currencies can work together in real-time. They used USDC + blockchain + Swift's messaging system to prove real interoperability is possible. This trial proves that financial systems can integrate blockchain technology while maintaining the security and reliability needed for large-scale, cross-currency payments. While stablecoins are primarily for cross-border payments, settlement typically requires conversion into fiat currency, which has posed challenges. By integrating stablecoins into existing financial systems, Citi and Swift are helping to reduce the need for conversion. Citi and Swift's efforts prove that blockchain technology can enhance traditional financial systems, making digital asset settlements more secure and efficient. This approach demonstrates that scalable solutions for digital asset payments are feasible and usable by major financial institutions.

This will ensure the widespread use of digital assets in mainstream finance. Hence, as institutions implement these solutions, the future of crypto payments looks promising. This is with faster, more secure transactions on the horizon.</p>

Robinhood Markets (HOOD Quick QuoteHOOD  -  Free Report)     is leading a transformative shift toward a permissionless financial future with its ambitious three-phase tokenization plan. Warner, chief strategy officer at Offchain Labs, disclosed this in an interview with CoinDesk on the sidelines of Devconnect in Buenos Aires.HOOD's end goal is to make tokenized assets fully permissionless, withdrawable from Robinhood's platform and interoperable across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and applications. This vision promises to revolutionize not only the company's revenue model but also the broader financial ecosystem.The first phase, already underway in Europe, introduced tokenized stocks on a blockchain foundation, with users able to trade nearly 800 publicly listed securities. In phase two, Robinhood intends to leverage its Bitstamp acquisition to enable 24/7 trading of tokenized stocks, breaking free from legacy market hours. This will allow retail clients to withdraw and use them as collateral or trading assets in external DeFi apps.Robinhood's roadmap fundamentally dismantles traditional financial gatekeeping. Tokenized, permissionless equities will evolve into programmable, always-on assets, enabling fractional ownership, instant settlement and global access. This broadens the addressable market, deepens engagement and creates new fee and yield streams, from token transfers, yield-generating DeFi integrations to global retail investor participation. By embedding programmability and portability into asset ownership, the company positions itself as both a disruptor in finance and a beneficiary of new, blockchain-native revenue channels.As the company executes this vision, it may spark a domino effect across brokerages and asset managers, accelerating the rise of a decentralized, permissionless financial economy. Two of Robinhood's closest peers are Interactive Brokers (IBKR Quick QuoteIBKR  -  Free Report)     and Charles Schwab (SCHW Quick QuoteSCHW  -  Free Report)    . Interactive Brokers is expanding its product suite aggressively. It has added daily options on European indices and broadened crypto trading capabilities, including stablecoin funding and staking. Interactive Brokers also launched "Connections," a proprietary feature integrating global markets to provide clients access to stocks, options, futures, currencies and bonds across more than 160 markets worldwide. Meanwhile, Schwab has launched the Schwab Alternative Investments Select platform, offering retail clients with more than $5 million in assets access to a curated selection of private equity, hedge funds, private credit and real estate investment funds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoiners viewed US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's appearance at the opening night of the Bitcoin-themed bar as “a sign” for Bitcoin. The Bitcoin community lit up on Thursday after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made an unannounced appearance at the launch of Washington's new Bitcoin-themed bar, Pubkey. “Having the Secretary of the Treasury at the Pubkey DC launch seems like a moment I could easily look back on and say ‘wow, it was all so obvious,” Bitcoin (BTC) treasury company Strive chief investment officer Ben Werkman said in an X post on Thursday. Steven Lubka, Nakamoto's vice president of investor relations, called it “the sign you have been waiting for.” Bessent has been seen as crypto-friendly since his Treasury nomination drew attention in late 2024. He has previously said that the US should aim to be a global center for digital assets and has backed several of this year's crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act. It was only in August that Bessent clarified that his department was still exploring budget-neutral ways to buy Bitcoin for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Eventually, traders look back and realize it mattered,” crypto trader MacroScope said in an X post on Thursday. After reaching an all-time high of $125,100 on Oct. 5, Bitcoin has slipped into a downtrend, trading at around $85,500 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has been tumbling in recent weeks as investors have become increasingly concerned about high valuations in the stock market. It's been a fairly volatile month for the crypto world, and that's evident with the recent decline in Bitcoin (BTC 3.50%). With high valuations, uncertain economic conditions, and worries that tech stocks may be in a bubble, there's no shortage of possible reasons for this recent apprehension in the markets. Bitcoin has been hovering above the $90,000 mark, and the last time it fell below that was back in April. Could this drop in value create a good opportunity for investors who may have missed out on the cryptocurrency's incredible gains to buy in at a reduced price? There's been plenty of excitement around Bitcoin this year as President Donald Trump has been in favor of setting up a Bitcoin reserve and enacting crypto-friendly policies to help facilitate its growth. More corporations are also open to holding Bitcoin. According to bitcointreasuries.net, there are now 12 companies that hold more than 11,000 Bitcoins, including Strategy, Tesla, and Trump Media & Technology Group. One of the biggest Bitcoin bulls, Cathie Wood, who runs Ark Invest, believes that the price of Bitcoin may reach well over $1 million by 2030. Previously, her bull case was as high as $1.5 million, although she recently reduced that by $300,000 due to the growth of stablecoins and their potential to take some market share, particularly in emerging markets. If you're a believer in the cryptocurrency's sky-high potential, then buying now could indeed be a no-brainer move. What I find particularly telling about Bitcoin's recent decline is that it comes at a time when there is growing concern about the economy, at least in the near term. There are also doubts about whether a December rate cut will happen, which investors were previously feeling confident about. Rate cuts are generally good news for growth stocks and speculative assets like Bitcoin. Although many crypto bulls believe that Bitcoin is a type of "digital gold," I believe the evidence suggests that's not the case at all. Not only is it not a safe haven investment, but it acts more as a gauge of the appetite for speculation in the market. When investors are willing to buy risky stocks and aren't worried about valuations or economic conditions, Bitcoin does well. And when the opposite is true, such as in 2022 when the markets crashed, Bitcoin experienced a massive 65% decline. The drop in Bitcoin's value in recent weeks doesn't make the digital currency any less risky of an investment overall. If you're concerned about valuations or the stock market as a whole, buying Bitcoin isn't the solution. This asset has shown in the past that when times are tough, it can crash at a much faster rate than the overall market. David Jagielski, CPA has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.
