The new language contradicts decades of evidence-based research that has found zero link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The original version of the page had included a “key points” header stating that, “Studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD),” and that, “No links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and ASD.” The site also claims that “studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities.” Cassidy had expressed qualms about supporting the HHS nominee, but Kennedy assured him during that time that he would not change vaccine policy. Coupling his message with false anti-abortion language, the senator stated yesterday that he was “concerned” that “energy is going into promoting disproven claims about vaccines.” Kennedy has held anti-vaccination views for many years, and his peddling of falsehoods regarding public health is widely documented. Since beginning his tenure as head of HHS, Kennedy has indicated little understanding of how infectious diseases actually work, and how vaccines play a role in preventing their spread. Kennedy also falsely — and dangerously — claimed that measles vaccines are less effective than direct exposure to the virus when it comes to developing immunity. That's a sharp increase from the year before, when only 285 measles cases were identified in just 16 outbreaks. Kennedy has taken other anti-vax positions at the CDC. This past summer, he dismissed the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel that advises health agencies on matters relating to vaccines. Vaccination is essential to protect individuals and communities from preventable diseases, making it a fundamental element of public health,” American Medical Association trustee Sandra Adamson Fryhofer said. “The AMA is deeply concerned that perpetuating misleading claims on vaccines will lead to further confusion, distrust, and ultimately, dangerous consequences for individuals and public health.” Michael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, similarly panned the CDC's decision to peddle falsehoods on vaccines. “Today is a tragic day for public health,” Osterholm said. “Ideology has replaced science as the means for addressing life-saving research and best practices that save lives.” Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power, cut against the mainstream narrative and uplift the movements resisting fascism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Darfur's governor said this week that 27,000 people were killed in the days following RSF's el-Fasher siege last month. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. The paramilitary group swept through the city searching for civilians to kill, conducting field executions and invading a hospital, killing everyone inside. UN officials estimate that 2,000 people were killed, though other estimates have been far higher, with Darfur's governor Minni Arko Minnawi saying that 27,000 people were killed in three days following the siege. RSF forces then moved to dig mass graves to dump the bodies in, Yale University experts said, based on satellite imagery. “They turned the city into a killing field, going house to house rounding up people to torture and murder because of their ethnicity,” said Van Hollen in remarks on the Senate floor. “We have not effectively used our leverage and influence to end the war. “Applying a blanket ban on the export of U.S. defense articles to the UAE leaves our partners in the region unequipped to deter any act of aggression and sends a message of weakness to our adversaries, like Iran and its terrorist proxies,” Enrst said, calling instead for diplomatic solutions for “stabilizing Sudan.” “I'm very disappointed that our colleagues cannot join together in a bipartisan manner to just use a little bit of American influence to try to stop a genocide in Darfur,” he said. Ernst's objection comes despite widespread consensus that the RSF is committing genocide in Sudan. “Something needs to be done to cut off the weapons and the support that the RSF is getting as they continue with their advances,” said Secretary of State Marco Rubio last week, per Reuters. President Donald Trump has also signaled interest in ending the slaughter. It has become the most violent place on Earth and, likewise, the single biggest Humanitarian Crisis,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, after his meeting with Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “We will work with Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and other Middle Eastern partners to get these atrocities to end, while at the same time stabilizing Sudan.” Trump ignores the fact that his administration has put millions of peoples' lives at risk with his dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which last year provided 44 percent of Sudan's humanitarian aid budget.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The embattled former police chief of Vallejo, a San Francisco Bay Area city that has attracted national attention over police violence, has said that he endured a steady procession of racist remarks from colleagues and online harassment and threats that ultimately led him to resign. But even after resigning, the threats still came by mail to his home and a second property he owned outside the state. “They were hostile, toxic,” Williams testified in a deposition on Wednesday. Williams made the statements as part of a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Vallejo police department brought by Deyana Jenkins, whom officers pulled from a car and tased during a traffic stop in 2019. The incident occurred months after six Vallejo police officers shot her uncle, Willie McCoy, a 20-year-old rapper, 55 times while he was asleep in his car. The deposition, first reported by the Vallejo Sun, offers a window into what Williams describes as a pattern of hostile, threatening and retaliatory behavior that ended his brief attempt to impose accountability on a department known nationally for unchecked violence and resistance to reform. Vallejo police officers have repeatedly drawn concern over their practices, perhaps most notoriously for the ritual of “badge bending”, in which officers reportedly fold back a tip on their badges after killing someone on duty. Williams took over the department in 2019 with a mandate to reform it. But Williams said he experienced harsh backlash for his efforts to impose accountability on the department's use of force. In his deposition, Williams said a colleague made several disturbing statements, including: “This Black Jesus can't save us.” He described “racial hostilities or comments” made to him by a former police captain. Williams also said the city attorney threatened him, but did not describe how. The Vallejo police department did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for comment. Williams also received several anonymous threats, through the post and online. Three weeks before resigning in October of 2022, he received a “Halloween card threat” that said “quit today” and emitted a deafening screech that “filled the hallway” and kept blaring until the battery ran out. But an arbitrator reinstated Tonn in 2023, after Williams left the force. But the city failed to act, and Malone appeared uninterested in helping him, Williams testified. “One of the things that I guess exacerbated my concerns was [Malone's] statement that this is not going to stop – or ‘They're not going to stop until I fire you or you quit,'” Williams said in the deposition. “And he said that over half a dozen times.” The VPOA did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for comment. “There was racial animus, retaliatory things that were happening that just made it unbearable or impossible for me to perform my duties in a safe environment.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Minister of Transport Steven MacKinnon said Friday he has requested a meeting with Nutrien's project team to “convince them to change their mind.” “Saskatchewan potash should be moved out of a Canadian port,” he said at a press conference Friday in Brampton, Ont. Mr. MacKinnon said he met with Nutrien chief executive officer Ken Seitz on Thursday. He did not offer specifics on what incentives Ottawa will offer the company, but said the federal government is committed to investing in port infrastructure, specifically in Saint John, N.B., and the Port of Vancouver. On Wednesday, Nutrien announced plans to build an export terminal with capacity for five to six million tonnes of potash a year in Longview, Wash. Should the investment be finalized, by 2031 the amount of potash mined by Nutrien and sent to overseas markets via U.S. ports will match that of Canadian ports. Within Canada, only Vancouver and Prince Rupert fit Nutrien's criteria: a deep-sea port with rail infrastructure. Potash is a critical mineral essential to all major agricultural production worldwide. Potash is Canada's fifth-largest export, and Nutrien is forecasting global demand to climb from 72 million tonnes annually to 80 million tonnes by the end of the decade. This growth will be driven by fast-growing markets in Asia, including China, India and Japan. Nutrien assessed options across the Pacific Northwest based on a matrix of 30 criteria, Nutrien's chief commercial officer Chris Reynolds told The Globe on Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ideologically opposed president and New York City mayor-elect will meet after months of combative rhetoric Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect, are scheduled to meet at the White House this afternoon in an encounter between two ideologically opposed leaders with conflicting visions for the nation's largest city. For Mamdani, a leftwing state assemblymember until his shock primary victory, the sit-down presents an early test of his ability to negotiate with a president who controls vast federal resources that the city depends upon. Mamdani's team made the first move in reaching out for a meeting, all while Trump earlier threatened to withhold federal funding from New York if Mamdani took office, though he has since suggested a more conciliatory posture, telling Fox News: “I'm so torn, because I would like to see the new mayor do well, because I love New York.” Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have signaled plans to escalate operations in New York City, while a number of rightwing congressional Republicans suggested investigating whether Mamdani's citizenship is valid, despite his naturalization in 2018 after immigrating from Uganda as a child. When asked on Thursday whether he feared receiving hostile treatment similar to the contentious Oval Office meeting between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine's president, earlier this year – where Trump accused Zelenskyy of “gambling with world war III” – Mamdani brushed aside concerns. “I'll stand up for New Yorkers every single day,” he replied. His promises include free public buses, government-run grocery stores, rent freezes for more than 1m stabilized units, and the city's first universal childcare program. “I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case,” Mamdani said on Thursday. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, similarly said Trump's willingness to meet was evidence of his openness to dialogue across political divides. Trump got directly involved in the mayoral election, dismissing the candidate from his own party, Curtis Sliwa, as a lightweight and instead endorsing Andrew Cuomo, the Independent, formerly Democratic governor, while branding Mamdani a “little communist”. Among New York voters, Trump garnered only 27% approval compared with 70% disapproval in CNN's exit polling from the mayoral election. However, 10% of Trump's 2024 voters also cast ballots for Mamdani, suggesting there is indeed overlap in their populist economic messaging, despite their vast ideological differences.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. President Volodymyr Zelensky officially addressed the Ukrainian public on Nov. 21, responding to growing concerns over a new peace proposal that reportedly reflects Russia's longstanding demands. Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine's position would be based on national priorities and ongoing dialogue with key allies. We will pursue a calm dialogue with America and all of our partners. There will be a constructive search for solutions with our main partner," he said. The speech also focused on domestic unity and effective governance. The parliament of a country at war must work in unity. Earlier this week, Trump approved a new peace framework, which Kyiv officials say resembles many of Moscow's long-standing demands — including territorial concessions, reductions to Ukraine's military, and limits on international alliances. The President is expected to discuss available diplomatic options and key conditions for peace in upcoming talks with President Trump. Zelensky later said he had spoken to U.S. Vice President Vance and U.S. Army Secretary Driscoll, and had "discussed many details of the American side's proposal to end the war." "We agreed that we will work together with America and Europe at the level of advisors to make the path to peace truly workable," he added. Elsewhere on Nov. 21, a senior U.S. official on Nov. 21 contradicted a claim earlier made by Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, that he had not approved or changed any clauses of the new U.S. peace plan. Umerov's statement earlier in the day came in response to allegations that he might have manipulated the clause that could lead to criminal action being taken against Ukrainian officials found guilty of corruption. A draft version of the 28-point peace plan drafted by the U.S. as part of a new push to pressure Ukraine into accepting an unfavorable end to Russia's all-out war reportedly originally proposed an audit of all international aid to Ukraine. But the language was later reportedly changed to offer "full amnesty for actions during the war" to all parties involved. Tania Myronyshena is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent. Before joining the Kyiv Independent, she worked as a freelance journalist with a focus on cultural narratives and human stories. in publishing and editing from Borys Hrinchenko Kyiv University. The draft reportedly originally proposed an audit of all international aid to Ukraine, but the language was later changed to offer "full amnesty for actions during the war" to all parties involved. European leaders pushed back on Nov. 21 against parts of a new and controversial U.S. plan for peace in Ukraine. In Kharkiv, a city living under constant Russian fire, students are shaping Ukraine's future from underground classrooms and makeshift labs. President Volodymyr Zelensky was responding to growing concerns over a new peace proposal that reportedly reflects Russia's longstanding demands. Ukraine's forces say they are holding defensive lines in Pokrovsk, even as the Ukrainian mapping site DeepState shows Russian troops advancing. Ukraine's chief anti-corruption prosecutor Oleksandr Klymenko said on Nov. 13 that his office was investigating allegations that Andriy Synyuk, the deputy chief anti-corruption prosecutor, had leaked information in the Energoatom case. The Russian attack on Ternopil killed at least 28 people, including three children, and injured 94 others, among them 18 children, according to Ukraine's Emergency Service. Russian forces launched an overnight attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia on Nov. 20-21, killing five people and wounding eight others, local officials said.

MOFA's comments came after the CPTPP commission  concluded its meeting in Melbourne, Australia, earlier yesterday, where member states agreed to start Uruguay's  accession process. "We have decided to commence an accession process  with Uruguay, and will commence with the others in 2026,  if appropriate," said the statement, which made no mention  of Taiwan or China. In its statement, MOFA said it would continue efforts to  show CPTPP members that Taiwan meets the high standards  required by the bloc, which currently has 12 members and  represents approximately 15 percent of the global economy,  and to secure their support for its membership. The ministry also highlighted Taiwan's commitment to  align its trade practices and regulations with international  standards and noted that the island has signed trade or  investment agreements with multiple CPTPP members,  including Singapore, New Zealand, and the United  Kingdom. Taiwan and Japan have a mutual interest in trade, culture and engineering, and can work together for stability, Cho Jung-tai said                                        Taiwan and Japan are two like-minded countries willing to work together to form a “safety barrier” in the Indo-Pacific region, Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) yesterday said at the opening ceremony of the 35th Taiwan-Japan Modern Engineering and Technology Symposium in Taipei. Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai (陳其邁) on Monday announced light shows and themed traffic lights to welcome fans of South Korean pop group Twice to the port city. It would be the group's first performance in Taiwan since its debut 10 years ago. The all-female group consists of five South Koreans, three Japanese and Tainan's Chou Tzu-yu (周子瑜), the first Taiwan-born and raised member of a South Korean girl group. Beijing's claim that the next Buddhist leader must come from China is a heavy-handed political maneuver that will fall flat-faced, experts said                                        China's requirement that the Dalai Lama's reincarnation to be born in China and approved by Beijing has drawn criticism, with experts at a forum in Taipei yesterday saying that if Beijing were to put forth its own Dalai Lama, the person would not be recognized by the Tibetan Buddhist community. Temperatures in some parts of Taiwan are expected to fall sharply to lows of 15°C later this week as seasonal northeasterly winds strengthen, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) said today. It is to be the strongest cold wave to affect northern Taiwan this autumn, while Chiayi County in the southwest and some parts of central Taiwan are likely to also see lower temperatures due to radiational cooling, which occurs under conditions of clear skies, light winds and dry weather, the CWA said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine / Facebook) Ukraine plans to effectively dismantle one of the main structures that has brought foreign volunteers into its ranks, the International Legion under the Ground Forces, according to sources, leaving legionnaires worried they will lose the unit's hard-won identity and be scattered into unfamiliar structures in a way they say could cost lives. “Our biggest worry is just that we'll be moved around and units will be pulled apart, and we'll basically be funneled into where they feel like they need to put us in order to make this work,” a soldier who has fought with the Legion for a year and a half told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity. “This is (about a thousand soldiers) being moved into different areas, falling under their command, and with that kind of change will come mistakes. The officer, along with several legionnaires interviewed, said they are speaking out in an effort to preserve the Legion in its current form, arguing there is no need for a change. Colonel Valentin Manko, accused in October of breaching operational security on TikTok and criticized by Ukrainian journalists and volunteers for posting videos with inaccurate or overly optimistic battlefield assessments, heads the newly created Assault Forces, to which the Legion battalions could become subordinate. In a Nov. 16 Facebook post, however, the Ground Forces said its system of working with foreign volunteers is changing to provide “better integration, equal opportunities with Ukrainian soldiers, and more rational use of human resources.” Knowing how to work with foreigners comes with experience, Colonel Ruslan Myroshnychenko, a former commander of the 2nd battalion who goes by the call sign “Santa,” said. Calling the planned change “absurd,” Myroshnychenko said that hard-won trust is at risk, especially for foreigners who left their home country and stood up to fight despite “a high probability to die.” “All everyday affairs are built on trust,” Myroshnychenko told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian assault units, which would each take on a Legion battalion, would have to learn these practices from scratch, the officer said. The envisioned change would also add an unpredictable factor for the Ukrainian assault units that would work closely with legionnaires, since foreign volunteers have varying degrees of military experience and preparedness for war. Not everyone appears to have been informed of the change. A Brazilian volunteer soldier in the first battalion, who has served with the Legion for two years, said he had received no information and needed to speak with his commanders. “Any time that you send an assault with people who are unprepared, all you're doing is setting people up for failure.” The soldiers said they worry that new commanders may not know how to work with such a diverse group of foreigners with varying levels of military experience or accommodate their needs, such as translation. They stressed that the uncertainty could push volunteers either back to their home countries or to other units, since foreigners can break their contracts at anytime after the six-month mark. Although the exact details of the reorganization remain unclear, soldiers said they expect to be transferred to assault units and are unsure whether new commanders will prioritize their safety. “I don't want to be put into something that I'm unprepared for,” the same soldier said, explaining that it is not the assault factor that is concerning, but more the uncertainty. And any time that you send an assault with people who are unprepared, all you're doing is setting people up for failure.” Although the Legion has a poor reputation among many Western soldiers and veterans who have fought in Ukraine, often attributed to a lack of professional experience among some members and poorly planned missions, the legionnaires insist that, like any other unit, it has its strengths and weaknesses. For many, the Legion is a family away from home that they have built over the years and take pride in being part of. “There is a different bond of friendship and camaraderie within military teams, and that should be preserved,” the soldier from Brazil said. And there are many other stories we have shared over these years of combat.” The legionnaires described the Legion as an ideal entry point for newcomers, especially those without prior military experience, to integrate with the Ukrainian army and learn crucial lessons before potentially moving to another unit. Now thrown into limbo, the soldiers are split on whether they will stay or opt for another unit. One interviewee said their immediate friend circle has decided to stay as long as they would be working with the same people, while another said they were unsure. Another soldier, an American who served in the Legion during the 2022 Kharkiv offensive but who has now moved to another unit, was more blunt. "If they do this, a lot of people will die," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump has given Ukraine less than a week to accept his plan – widely seen as favoring Russia – to end the war, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country faced “one of the most difficult moments” in its history. But Thursday is it,” the president said in a radio interview with Fox News. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. The 28-point plan put forward by Trump puts pressure on Kyiv to cede territory, limit the size of its military and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war, all long-standing Kremlin demands. Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a security council briefing late Friday that he had received the US-proposed plan for Ukraine, saying: “I believe it could serve as the basis for a final peace settlement.” In his video address, Zelensky said, “The pressure on Ukraine is now at its most intense. Zelensky spoke with US Vice President JD Vance on Friday about the plan. In a joint call with Zelensky earlier Friday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer “agreed to continue to pursue the goal of safeguarding vital European and Ukrainian interests in the long term.” This includes “ensuring that the line of contact is the starting point for an understanding and that the Ukrainian armed forces remain capable of effectively defending Ukraine's sovereignty,” a German government press office statement said, differing from the US proposal which calls for Ukraine to withdraw from some of its own territory. Trump appears to be giving Russia almost everything it wants, with much of the text resembling the maximalist positions Moscow held during talks in Istanbul in 2022, shortly after the invasion and when its forces held more of Ukraine. The draft plan's veracity was confirmed by a US official. The plan would have Russia-occupied Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk be recognized “as de facto Russian, including by the United States,” a previous red line for Kyiv. The plan calls for Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the parts of eastern Donetsk that they currently control, “and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation.” The draft plan includes a commitment that Ukraine will not join NATO, that NATO will not station troops in Ukraine, limits the size of the Ukrainian armed forces to 600,000 personnel and calls for Ukrainian elections within 100 days – something that would be extremely challenging to organize. In the Fox News interview on Friday, Trump said that Putin is “not looking for more war” and is “taking punishment,” despite the plan appearing to offer major concessions to Russia. Zelensky said that he would work around the clock to find a path forward on the plan, while saying he would not betray his country. “I will present arguments, I will persuade, I will offer alternatives, but we will definitely not give the enemy any reason to say that Ukraine does not want peace, that it is disrupting the process, and that Ukraine is not ready for diplomacy,” Zelensky continued. CNN's Samantha Waldenberg, Jennifer Hansler, Darya Tarasova, Kevin Liptak and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia will react to the United States' peace plan for Ukraine once it sees something concrete, refusing to comment on "conflicting" reports about it that have come out in the media, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. "For several days now, Western media outlets have been releasing various leaks and drafts – whatever this could be called – with different details, in different sequences, under various labels," she said, referring to the US plan. "We have official channels of communication with Washington. The Foreign Ministry has received no information, plans or drafts." "We are open to discussing issues of the settlement of the situation in Ukraine which have been and are part of our dialogue at various levels," she noted. "We have received nothing resembling what was published in the Western media," she reiterated. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff were in contact with both Russia and Ukraine regarding the peace plan floated by Washington. Under the US peace plan, details of which were leaked to the Western media, the United States and other countries would recognize Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, Donbass and other territories Ukraine will have to cede. In exchange, Kiev will be granted security guarantees from the United States and Europe. The Ukrainian army will be heavily reduced and stripped of long-range weapons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A grizzly bear attacked a group of schoolchildren and teachers on a walking trail in British Columbia, Canada, injuring 11 people, two of them critically. The attack happened Thursday afternoon in Bella Coola, 700 kilometers (435 miles) northwest of Vancouver. Remain indoors and off the highway,” the First Nation said in a social media post. Two people were critically injured and two had serious injuries, Emergency Health Services spokesman Brian Twaites said. Parent Veronica Schooner said a lot of people tried to halt the attack but one male teacher “got the whole brunt of it” and was among the people taken by helicopter from the scene. Schooner's 10-year-old son Alvarez was in the class of fourth- and fifth-graders that was attacked and was so close to the animal “he even felt its fur,” she said. “He said that bear ran so close to him, but it was going after somebody else,” Schooner said. She added that some children were hit with bear spray as the teachers fought off the bear and Alvarez was limping and his shoes muddy from running for safety. Her son's thoughts, however, were with his classmates. “He keeps crying for his friends, and oh my goodness, right away he started praying for his friends,” she added. Acwsalcta School, an independent school run by Nuxalk First Nation in Bella Coola, said in a Facebook post that the school will be closed on Friday and counseling made available. We are so grateful for our team and our students,” the post said. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.</p>

Violent protests broke out during the country's presidential and parliamentary elections.Thomas Mukoya/Reuters The author of this piece is a Tanzanian journalist whose identity The Globe and Mail is protecting. The gunfire erupted so suddenly, it left no time to think. I was in a neighbourhood on the outskirts of Dar es Salaam, near the 6 p.m. curfew hour, searching for food for my family, when a white Toyota Land Cruiser screeched to a halt. Gunmen in black uniforms leapt out with automatic rifles and opened fire indiscriminately. A third fell near the pavement, wailing, his legs useless. Tanzania charges 145 people with treason for protests during disputed election I could barely breathe, stunned at the sight of people hunted like animals. I ran blindly, branches lashing my arms, lungs burning, until I reached a patch of bush near a dry drainage channel. I dove into a thicket, thorns scraping my shins, soil in my palms, crawling deeper until I was concealed. A low-hanging branch had knocked my glasses off, the frames shattered, lenses cracked. I could see only a few metres ahead. Gunfire cracked intermittently, near enough to make my ears ring. Without my high blood pressure medication, each thump of my pulse felt like a warning that I might not survive. Their unfamiliar foreign accents seemed to confirm the suspicions that Tanzania had recruited Ugandans to reinforce its police force. Later, two sharp whistles rang out: military signals. My phone battery had died during the chaos. At one point, a scream erupted and ended abruptly. People protest in the streets of Arusha.The Associated Press Two days earlier, Oct. 29, was election day in Tanzania. Many people weren't bothering to vote. There was a heavy security presence in the streets, and a palpable fear in the air. Everyone knew that President Samia Suluhu Hassan would be declared the winner, and protests were likely to erupt. My neighbourhood usually hummed with motorcycle taxis, vendors chopping vegetables, children shouting to one another. But that morning, an eerie silence reigned. In a nearby township, I saw a lorry crawling down the road, packed with perhaps 150 to 200 people. They sat like prisoners of fate, and the rumours we had been hearing – of people being ferried to vote multiple times – felt painfully real. Canada, allies raise doubts over Tanzanian election as president claims landslide victory At the polling stations, there were no voters, only bored election officials and heavily armed police in riot gear. The country seemed to hold its breath. Social media exploded with videos of protests across the city. Tear gas rolled through neighbourhoods like a grey storm. Facebook was gone, X dead, WhatsApp disconnected. Our usual tools – virtual private networks that can bypass a shutdown – were useless. At home, the crisis hit even harder. My daughter needed medicine, but a sunset-to-sunrise curfew had been introduced on election day, and many businesses were entirely closed, fearing violence. Despite the danger, I had to venture out on Oct. 31 to find food and medicine – not realizing it would put me directly in the line of fire. Riot police officers disperse protesters at the Namanga One-Post Border crossing point between Kenya and Tanzania.Thomas Mukoya/Reuters By dawn on Nov. 1, after the longest night of my life, I eased myself from the bush. The city was unrecognizable: shops shuttered, stalls overturned, people hiding behind curtains. There were rumours of disappearances and bodies in the streets. As I walked home, shaken and half-blind, I carried the heaviest truth I have ever known: This time, the violence didn't happen to other people. My youngest daughter recognized me first, letting out a sound that was half-sob, half-scream, and ran into my arms, nearly knocking the wind out of me. She clung to me, repeating, “Baba, we thought you died … We thought they killed you.” Even in the safety of home, my body still trembled. But in their relief and raw love, I saw the truth: The night had changed everything. Mourners gather for the funeral of someone who died during the post-election violence, in Arusha, on Nov. 4.The Associated Press When the authorities finally lifted the internet shutdown, dozens of videos from across the country began to emerge, showing police firing at crowds and bullet-riddled bodies piled up in hospitals and mortuaries. Hundreds of people – perhaps thousands – were killed in the crackdown, according to human-rights groups. Ms. Hassan has promised an investigation, but few expect it to lead anywhere. Protesters are trying to organize another national demonstration on Dec. 9, the country's Independence Day. Many of Tanzania's young generation are still determined to remove Ms. Hassan from power. What happened after the elections was not only unprecedented but a turning point in Tanzania's history. I have covered moments of tension before, but never have I seen such deliberate force used against unarmed citizens whose only crime was demanding their voices be heard. The rupture has shaken the country's sense of stability and exposed a deeper fragility beneath our democratic façade. For Tanzania to move forward, honesty must come first. Authorities must publicly condemn the killings and acknowledge that those who died were Tanzanians whose rights deserved protection. Security commanders implicated in the violence should face justice, and all those detained must be released unconditionally. I believe only an independent international investigation can restore public trust. The donor community, including Canada, must put sustained pressure on Tanzanian authorities to respect human rights and democratic norms. Silence now would only embolden further abuses. As history shows, bullets do not silence people. Violence only sows the seeds for more resistance. Tanzania deserves a different future, and the world must stand firmly with its citizens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Europe wishes to join talks on resolving the Ukraine conflict. However, it's not about the European Union as a whole but individual countries — France, the United Kingdom and Germany, a European diplomatic source told Izvestia. Meanwhile, a US-drafted 28-point peace plan has surfaced in the media, which particularly provides for Russia's control over Donbass, a major reduction in the Ukrainian army's size, and Ukraine's move to abandon long-range weapons. Brussels has distanced itself from Washington's initiative, saying the option under discussion actually means capitulation for Ukraine. "The EU could send more money to Ukraine, while its members could promise defense, financial, diplomatic, and other kinds of support to Kiev. They could even deploy troops to the [western Ukrainian] city of Lvov or promise Zelensky to establish a no-fly zone using NATO countries' air defenses," he added. Western media reports of a new peace proposal on Ukraine being in the works may be a signal of bargaining on the part of the White House, political scientist Alexander Nemtsev told Vedomosti. A tentative document was outlined during talks between the Russian and US presidents in Anchorage back in August, but there has been no progress in its implementation since, the expert went on to say. However, after a major corruption scandal broke out in Ukraine, Washington moved to pressure the Kiev leadership using the media as a tool, Nemtsev noted. "The US administration probably finds it important to demonstrate Trump's foreign policy achievements with regard to Ukraine," the expert added. Meanwhile, Oleg Barabanov, program director at the Valdai International Discussion Club, believes that Kiev will not agree to engage in negotiations. Defense cooperation is part of a broader partnership between Moscow and Bangui. Cooperation on humanitarian issues is also important: in 2024, Russia provided 50,000 metric tons of wheat to the Central African Republic free of charge, making it possible for the country to meet its annual demand for grain. Cooperation with Bangui is in line with Moscow's policy aimed at strengthening ties with the countries of the Global South, of which "the export of security" is a key element. This means a comprehensive approach covering military training, measures to ensure food security, knowledge transfer and the development of administrative systems. In short, it is about providing support to enhance the stability of states. According to him, the Central African Republic fits well into the overall vector of Russia's Africa policy, which is focused on strengthening security, boosting partnerships, and promoting long-term cooperation. Tokyo has no plans to abandon Russian gas purchases, a spokesperson for the Japanese embassy in Moscow told Izvestia. The Japanese have already taken note of the fact that Russia's liquefied natural gas (LNG), targeted by sanctions, is provided to China at 20-30% below the market price, Olga Dobrinskaya, senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of China and Contemporary Asia, pointed out. Tokyo sees the strengthening of sanctions as a factor creating even more favorable conditions for China as the main buyer of Russian hydrocarbons. US President Donald Trump asked Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi during his recent visit to the country to stop importing Russian energy. Besides, US lawmakers are promoting a bill imposing tariffs of up to 500% on the countries purchasing Russian oil and gas. The move would be primarily directed against India, China, and Brazil, but US allies such as Japan and South Korea could also be hit by those sanctions. Still, Washington is unlikely to introduce additional restrictions on Japan over its energy imports from Russia, Oleg Kazakov, senior researcher with the Center for Japanese Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of China and Contemporary Asia, believes. However, increasing pressure from the US and Washington's desire to focus Tokyo on participating in a planned LNG project in Alaska are creating a less favorable environment for future Russia-Japan cooperation, Kazakov noted. Still, Japan currently has no real alternative to Russian LNG, Dobrinskaya stressed. There is hope for a shift in relations between Moscow and Tokyo, but everything will depend on the specific steps that Tokyo takes, the analyst pointed out. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi announced intentions to pursue a policy aimed at resolving "the territorial issue" and signing a peace treaty with Russia, but it remains to be seen what direction relations will take. Kosovo's ruling Self-Determination party led by Prime Minister Albin Kurti failed to form a government in the nine months since the February election, and snap parliamentary elections will now be held there. Experts warn that it could further worsen the image of Kosovo, whose current leader has already seriously damaged relations with the West, Kommersant writes. If a candidate fails to secure the necessary majority, parliament will once again be dissolved and another election will be called. Kosovo appears on the international stage as a failed state due to a lack of political agreements that are vital for democracy, said Albert Krasniqi, an expert at the Pristina-based non-profit organization Democracy Plus. Experts believe that perhaps the most important reason behind Kosovo's numerous problems is that Kurti has significantly deteriorated relations with the West. His government accelerated the replacement of Serbian licence plates with Kosovo plates, banned the use of Serbian dinar in northern Kosovo, which is predominantly inhabited by Serbs, and closed branches of Serbian banks and other organizations there. All this led to the suspension of normalization dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, which the West has been actively promoting. Earlier, the US threatened to sever "partnership relations" with Pristina for the first time since Kosovo declared independence in February 2008. The latest US sanctions, which target Russia's two biggest oil companies - Rosneft and Lukoil - are seen as the cause, Rossiyskaya Gazeta reports. Although it has been just a month since the sanctions were announced, and restrictions on Rosneft come into effect on November 21 and Lukoil has been granted a respite until December 13, the media has done its job, creating a kind of panic on the market. Making things more complicated is the fact that Russia does not release official statistics on oil exports, and those interested have to rely on foreign sources. However, they have not indicated a collapse in Russian oil exports over the past month. Daniil Tyun, head of client relations at the AMCH company, points out that the US is increasing pressure on Russian oil, but it is doing it by using prices as a tool, not by causing supplies to collapse. Freedom Finance leading analyst Natalya Milchakova emphasizes that the government maintains its 2025 oil output forecast at 510 million tons. Russian oil exports are most likely expected to fall by 2-3% in 2025. They will actively develop workarounds to sell oil, using shadow fleet vessels and routes through third countries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Karoline Leavitt said the derogatory comment was made in a moment of frustration with reporters who ‘spread fake news' The White House has defended Donald Trump's outburst at a female reporter who he told to be “quiet, piggy” after she asked him about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Karoline Leavitt, Mr Trump's press secretary, said the US president's derogatory comment to Catherine Lucey, Bloomberg's White House correspondent, was made in a moment of frustration with reporters who “spread fake news about him”. Ms Lucey had accompanied Mr Trump on board Air Force One on Friday and during a press gaggle, asked a question about the Epstein files as the US president was coming under increasing pressure from his own party to release the tranche of documents. “If there's nothing incriminating in the files, sir, why not act?” she asked. His statement was condemned as “disgusting” by figures across the political spectrum, including CNN's Jake Tapper and former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson. A White House official told MS NOW (formerly MSNBC) earlier this week that Ms Lucey had “behaved in an inappropriate and unprofessional way toward her colleagues on the plane”. Congress overwhelmingly passed the resolution, which Mr Trump signed on Wednesday night. “The president is very frank and honest with everyone in this room. “I think it's one of the many reasons that the American people re-elected this president, because of his frankness, and he calls out fake news when he sees it.” Ms Leavitt said that Mr Trump, who often meets with journalists several times a day, “gets frustrated” with reporters who “lie about him” and “spread fake news about him and his administration”. The US president was named in a batch of files released last week which included emails alleging he “knew about the girls” and spent “hours” with Virginia Giuffre. Mr Trump also verbally attacked Ms Lucey a second time on the tarmac at West Palm Beach Airport and suggested Bloomberg should sack her. I don't know why they even have you,” he said after Ms Lucey had asked about Tucker Carlson's interview with the white nationalist Nick Fuentes. We remain focused on reporting issues of public interest fairly and accurately.” Mr Trump also launched into a three-minute tirade at Mary Bruce, the chief White House correspondent for ABC News, who he called a “terrible person and terrible reporter” when she asked why he waited for Congress to release the Epstein files instead of taking action himself.</p>
