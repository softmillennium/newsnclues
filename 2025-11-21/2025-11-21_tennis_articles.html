                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lauren Davis bids farewell to professional tennis after a successful career highlighted by two WTA titles and multiple Top 10 wins. She leaves the sport with no regrets, grateful for the memories and lessons tennis has provided. 26 Lauren Davis is saying goodbye to professional tennis. The 32-year-old American announced her retirement from the sport on Thursday in a heartfelt Instagram post. In a lengthy caption alongside a carousel of photos that showcased highlights of her career, the Gates Mills, Ohio native recalled her journey to the top of the sport, which began when she relocated to Florida at the age of 16 "to chase a dream in [her heart]" to train at former World No. 3, Davis was "one of the shortest players on tour" at 5-foot-2 when she turned professional less than a year later. "But I never let that limit me," she said. "I saw it as an opportunity to be an anomaly -- and hopefully to inspire others along the way. A two-time title-winner on the Hologic WTA Tour, Davis reached the third round of a Grand Slam on six occasions -- though she never broke through to a second-week showing. She came the closest at the 2018 Australian Open, where she failed to convert three match points in a titanic tussle with eventual finalist and World No. "The lifestyle wasn't always easy, but it brought my family and me so much joy and fulfillment. Tennis helped shape me into the woman I am today. It has prepared me to step into a beautiful life after my career. "I'm deeply proud of myself for showing up day after day for the past 15 years and giving it everything I had. I can truly say I have no regrets—I left my heart out there every single time. From practicing against the wretched ball machine at Mayfield Racquet Club to going toe-to-toe with world No. 1s at the Slams, it has been an honor to play the sport I've loved for so long." Lauren Davis bids farewell to professional tennis after a successful career highlighted by two WTA titles and multiple Top 10 wins. She leaves the sport with no regrets, grateful for the memories and lessons tennis has provided.</p>
