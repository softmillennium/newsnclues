                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google has confirmed that hackers have stolen the Salesforce-stored data of more than 200 companies in a large-scale supply chain hack. On Thursday, Salesforce disclosed a breach of “certain customers' Salesforce data” — without naming affected companies — that was stolen via apps published by Gainsight, which provides a customer support platform to other companies. In a statement, Austin Larsen, the principal threat analyst of Google Threat Intelligence Group, said that the company “is aware of more than 200 potentially affected Salesforce instances.” The hacking group claimed responsibility for hacks affecting Atlassian, CrowdStrike, Docusign, F5, GitLab, Linkedin, Malwarebytes, SonicWall, Thomson Reuters, and Verizon. Contact Us Do you have more information about these Salesforce and Gainsight data breaches? CrowdStrike's spokesperson Kevin Benacci told TechCrunch in a statement that the company is “not affected by the Gainsight issue and all customer data remains secure.” CrowdStrike confirmed to TechCrunch that it terminated a “suspicious insider” for allegedly passing information to hackers. TechCrunch reached out to all the companies mentioned by Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters. Hackers with the ShinyHunters group told TechCrunch in an online chat that they gained access to Gainsight, thanks to their previous hacking campaign that targeted customers of Salesloft, which provides an AI and chatbot-powered marketing platform called Drift. In that earlier case, the hackers stole Drift authentication tokens from those customers, allowing the hackers to break into their linked Salesforce instances and download their contents. “Gainsight was a customer of Salesloft Drift, they were affected and therefore compromised entirely by us,” said ShinyHunters. On Thursday, Salesforce said there is “no indication that this issue resulted from any vulnerability in the Salesforce platform,” effectively distancing itself from its customers' data breaches. “Salesforce has temporarily revoked active access tokens for Gainsight-connected apps as a precautionary measure while their investigation into unusual activity continues,” according to Gainsight's incident page, which said Salesforce is notifying affected customers whose data was stolen. The Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is a collective of English-speaking hackers made up of several cybercriminal gangs, including ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and Lapsus$, whose members use social engineering tactics to trick company employees into granting the hackers access to their systems or databases. In the last few years, these groups have claimed several high-profile victims, such as MGM Resorts, Coinbase, DoorDash, and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yet it may be falling behind states like Illinois, Montana, and Colorado that are pushing forward on quantum. Washington needs more speed and a better strategy to help bolster the region's quantum ecosystem, according to panelists who spoke this week in Seattle at a Tech Alliance event focused on quantum technologies, which aim to solve complex problems and power new innovations faster than traditional computers. “It takes a political will to recognize the needs of this state.” But financial woes pose a roadblock with the state facing revenue declines. “Big new significant investments at this time [are] going to be very hard,” he said, while suggesting the state focus on coordination and workforce strategy in the short-term. “We don't have to make a huge capital investment — but you can still really advance the cause,” he said. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker recently earmarked $500 million for a quantum campus near Chicago. States including Montana, Maryland, Colorado are moving forward on strategy and workforce investment. Washington state had budget language for a quantum strategy in 2025, but it was vetoed due to fiscal constraints, with the Department of Commerce directed to pursue partnerships and policy recommendations. Laura Ruderman, CEO of Tech Alliance who moderated the panel discussion this week, suggested that the near-term prescription isn't to build a new initiative but rather scaling what already exists. “We need to fund NQN,” she said, referencing the Northwest Quantum Nexus, which was founded in 2019 by UW, Microsoft, and PNNL. Margaret Arakawa, CMO of quantum giant IonQ, which recently opened the first dedicated quantum computer manufacturing facility in the U.S. near Seattle, said Washington's leaders need to show up publicly and enlist private funding partners. She said states that are winning have governors who make quantum a visible priority and then bring industry in to co-invest. “Please let it happen now, and don't wait,” Arakawa urged.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We want to talk with you quickly about something important. A growing number of scammers are impersonating TechCrunch reporters and event leads and reaching out to companies, pretending to be our staff when they absolutely are not. Judging by the increased number of emails we're receiving, asking, “Does this person really work for you?” it appears to be happening more actively at the moment. Here's an example of the most common scheme we've been tracking: Impostors impersonating our reporters to extract sensitive business information from unsuspecting targets. In several cases we know about, scammers have adopted the identity of actual staff members, crafting what looks like a standard media inquiry about a company's products and requesting an introductory call. Sharp-eyed recipients sometimes catch discrepancies in email addresses that don't match our real employees' credentials (see a list of bogus email addresses below). Indeed, the schemes evolve quickly; bad actors keep refining their tactics, mimicking reporters' writing styles, and referencing startup trends to make their pitches increasingly convincing. In fact, former colleagues at Yahoo say these attempts align with a persistent threat actor they've been tracking who has historically engaged in TechCrunch impersonation to facilitate account takeover (ATO) and data theft, targeting cryptocurrency, cloud, and other tech companies using various pretexts. As for what to do about it, if someone reaches out claiming to be from TechCrunch and you have even the slightest doubt about whether they're legitimate, please don't just take their word for it. If the individual's name isn't on our roster, you've got your answer right there. If you do see someone's name on our staff page, but our employee's job description doesn't square with the request you are receiving (e.g., a TechCrunch copy editor is suddenly very interested in learning about your business! If it sounds like a legitimate request but you want to make doubly certain, you should also feel free to contact us directly and just ask. You can learn how to reach each writer, editor, sales executive, marketing guru, and events team member in our bios. By being vigilant about verification, you're not just protecting your own company — you're also helping preserve the trust that legitimate journalists depend on to do their jobs. And for your future reference, here's a list of some of the TechCrunch impersonating domains that we've seen created within the last few months: email-techcrunch[.]comhr-techcrunch[.]cominterview-techcrunch[.]commail-techcrunch[.]commedia-techcrunch[.]comnoreply-tc-techcrunch[.]comnoreply-techcrunch[.]compr-techcrunch[.]comtechcrunch-outreach[.]comtechcrunch-startups[.]infotechcrunch-team[.]comtechcrunch[.]aitechcrunch[.]biz[.]idtechcrunch[.]bztechcrunch[.]cctechcrunch[.]chtechcrunch[.]com[.]pltechcrunch[.]gltechcrunch[.]gstechcrunch[.]idtechcrunch[.]ittechcrunch[.]latechcrunch[.]lttechcrunch[.]net[.]cntechcrunch1[.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Peter Lee first started his research for a project to convert his replica 1955 Porsche 550 Spyder to electric, he used the AI model Davinci-003 (OpenAI's early Chat GPT-4) for help with the engineering design. The head of Microsoft Research doesn't just hear it from artificial intelligence. Now in the midst of converting another classic — a 1968 Ford Mustang GT Fastback — Lee is used to plenty of human car fanatics expressing their displeasure with his hobby. “One guy actually told me I'm never going to heaven.” Frustrated by fuel system issues with the Porsche in 2020, Lee connected with Marc Davis, founder of Moment Motor Co. in Austin, Texas, a shop that “transforms vintage head-turners into modern electric cars.” Moment is dedicated to “preserving the art and beauty” of classics like those owned by Lee. Some classic car lovers are quick to criticize EV conversions for messing with the original gas-powered intent of manufacturers, pointing out that the cost alone makes it irresponsible. Davis said Moment's work generates “plenty of vomit emojis” from purists on the company's social media posts. “I personally believe what we're doing is preservation,” he said, pointing to projects in which people bring new life to a car that was their all-time favorite or something that their dad drove. (This Bloomberg video shows how the conversion process works.) Lee is drawn to many of the benefits of going electric — no gas or oil to worry about, modern components, and explosive torque. It's really a wonderful, wonderful thing,” Lee said, adding that speeds in the Porsche, which is a replica of the model in which Hollywood icon James Dean died, can be “a little scary.” With the Mustang, Lee is involved in decisions big and small, from what type of shift knob he might like, to whether to retain the solid rear axle. When it's done, the Mustang will be a unique build, and one that Lee says will demand plenty of attention on the car show circuit. Asked whether he has a third vehicle in mind to convert next, Lee laughed before considering his growing collection and his desire to possibly change over an old pickup truck. “The thing I've always loved about cars, and why I love to work on cars, is you actually finish something,” he said. Lee is also a believer in the growing business potential of converting classic cars to EV and he thinks it would be a thrill to be involved on the side with a company that's doing such work. “The whole idea of beautiful, classic-looking cars that have all the modern conveniences of being EV —  I think that's going to be a bigger and bigger thing,” he said. The lessons he brings back to work: Lee has wanted to combine his passion around cars with his day job forever. Today, car technology and auto racing have become so technical that he now has fellow researchers at Microsoft who are generally interested as well. He called cars “a great laboratory” for trying to understand action models — the AI systems designed to predict and determine the next best action an agent (like a robot or software) should take to achieve a specific goal. At Microsoft Research, advancements in car software provide interesting ways to think about the architecture of an action model or training paradigms, with learnings that could impact what's happening on your own computer. “I think you'll see those things pop up even in your plain old Windows desktop over time.” Do you have an out-of-office hobby or interesting side hustle that you're passionate about that would make for a fun profile on GeekWire?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And discovering a Facebook group called “Team Jacob Forever” was one of the best finds. Available on iOS and Android devices, the app lets users form clubs centered on their favorite books, TV shows, and movies, creating niche communities where people can discuss their specific interests without judgment. For instance, users can dive into clubs for fantasy reads and gossip about Violet and Xaden in Rebecca Yarros' “The Fourth Wing,” or reminisce about the early days of “Grey's Anatomy.” The app was created by Nyleena Aiken after she started a book club with her sisters and struggled to find books that interested everyone. She realized that many people likely face the same challenge and would benefit from an app dedicated to creating groups centered on a single specific title at a time. “Looking at our competitors, there are many large groups with little interactivity,” Aiken explained to TechCrunch. “Phictly keeps discussions focused and aligns with everyone's fast-paced lifestyle, allowing users to fit conversations into their schedules.” Key features of Phictly include a cap of 20 members per club to keep discussions intimate, and users can also set the pace for their clubs based on their reading or viewing habits. Another notable feature allows users to post spoilers while hiding them until others reach that part of the story. The app will eventually expand to include clubs focused on video games.

This is a reminder - never sell out your baby unless you're willing to see it squeezed for every penny, community be damned. Now, I imagine the bias pushing everyone to learn on arduino is even more intense? Who out there is programming these chips in pure C using open source compilers and bootloaders?Edit: Of course there's other platforms like Esp32; teensy; seed.

Most vendor lock-in isn't "it's impossible to do the thing" but "it's hard enough to do the thing any other way, so this is effectively the only practical way to do it" I put together a simple setup to skip the arduino ide on an AVR design, but still be able to use their serial.println and other utilities.

The main feature of classic Arduino boards has always been a thin abstraction layer on bare metal. Not all platforms give you the right to do this. Also, because you might want to continue to sell the same thing for years, and the board designs were open-sourced, you could buy the same part for years and years. I'm not sure what the value proposition is overall, though. MCUs are lower power, have less overhead, and can perform hard real-time tasks. Most of what Arduino focuses on are MCUs. There are a large number of Arduino and third-party high-level libraries provided through their package management system that make it really easy to use sensors and other hardware without needing to write intermediate level code that uses SPI or I2C. The Pico C/C++ SDK is lower level and doesn't have a good library / package management story, so you have to read vendor data sheets to figure out how to communicate with hardware and then write your own libraries.It's much more common for less experienced users to use MicroPython. It has a package management and library ecosystem. But it's also harder to write anything of any complexity that fits within the small RAM available without calling gc.collect() in every other line.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During a 911 emergency, everyone is rightly expected to get out of the way of first responders driving to the scene. But these vehicles still need to follow roads, which most likely do not provide a straight shot to their destination. A Duke Health project is using drones to deliver treatment devices during real medical emergencies in Clemmons, North Carolina. Described as a “first-of-its-kind study in the U.S.,” the drones carry automated external defibrillators (AEDs—devices used to re-establish an effectual heartbeat rhythm in individuals experiencing cardiac arrest) to bystanders before EMS (emergency medical services) can get there, with the goal of decreasing cardiac arrest response times. Minutes later, the drone appears in the sky—not a bird, not a plane, not Superman—a drone and an AED,” Bobby Kimbrough, Forsyth County Sheriff and a partner on the project, told reporters on Wednesday, as reported in a Duke University statement. It's just that the drone arrives, and when EMS gets there, they pick it up and keep moving,” he added. That's what the study is hoping to measure, anyway. Monique Starks, Duke Health cardiologist and study lead, said that the estimated median time for the drone's arrival is around four minutes, which would bring response times down from a 6- to 7-minute average. After all, drones don't have to follow road routes. While 2 to 3 minutes might not sound like much, given that an individual experiencing cardiac arrest needs to receive help within 10 minutes, according to Starks, the difference could save lives, especially in rural areas where the response time can be even longer. “We know in the United States that it's [if] a patient can be shocked within two to five minutes, we could see survival of 50 to 70%, but we see survival of 10%, and that's because we largely rely on first responders and EMS getting to the scene before an AED is available,” Starks continued. “In the United States currently, only 1 to 4% of cardiac arrest cases will have a bystander or community member apply an AED,” because cardiac arrests mostly take place in people's homes, she explained. The ongoing study goes to show that while rapidly advancing technology is scary and carries enormous risk, it does also have the potential to save lives.

It's like getting a glimpse of eudaimonia, only to have it rudely interrupted by the reality of Apple Photos misreading every lens in your collection. I should probably just give up and let it all be a mess. The only thing that freed me from metadata obsession when it came to my music collection is that I switched to streaming services. So yeah, I think "Stripping all EXIF metadata doesn't change an image" deserves an entry as a "falsehood programmers believe about...". Would love to see a good rundown of when you should rely on different approaches? Another thread pointed out that you should also use the color space metadata. This is only true for cross-origin images, no? It's shame that after so many years of development we ended up with such horrible formats like jpeg and mp4. JPEG rotation only has to be lossy when the image is not evenly divisible into macro blocks - rather than transcoding just rotate the macro blocks, and where they're placed. You can also have other situations where this is useful like a primarily hardware pipeline that doesn't support rotation, but you can mark the rotation at the end. Although this is probably less of an issue for PNG than formats that typically come out of cameras and scanners. I have to imagine there is a performance impact to waiting until you've downloaded the entire image _just in case_ there's some metadata telling you to rotate it right at the end of the stream. "Instead of either saying: "yes you must rotate it" or "no you shall not rotate it" to make everyone do the same thing. And if it were yes, they should also have made this a mandatory chunk since now they made it optional to read. Instead of either saying: "yes you must rotate it" or "no you shall not rotate it" to make everyone do the same thing. And if it were yes, they should also have made this a mandatory chunk since now they made it optional to read. Cameras should have just rotated the actual image pixels when saving, instead of cheating. If that's too slow, implement it in hardware, or schedule a deferred process and don't let the images be exported until that's done. No, it was an elegant hack given all the constraints which mostly no longer exist on modern hardware (although I wouldn't be so sure about really small embedded systems).Sure, modern cameras will have no issues loading the full JPEG into memory, but how would you have implemented this in cameras that only have enough for exactly one line's worth of compression blocks?> or schedule a deferred process and don't let the images be exported until that's done.Good luck doing this on a battery-powered camera writing directly to an SD card that's expected to be mountable after removing it from the camera without an intransparent postprocessing step.

The way I've seen it implemented at a small company I worked at before was to explicitly endorse the "20% time" idea that Google made famous, where you may choose your own priorities for a fraction of your working time regardless of the bug tracker priority order. Even if in practice you don't actually have that spare time allocated in your schedule, it does give you some cover to tell your manager why you are prioritizing little UI papercuts over product features this week. It's hard to see the difference from the outside without actually digging into it first, but in my experience while there's plenty of "easy" bugs that aren't actually easy, there's also plenty of easy bugs that are actually easy and that apparently everyone else assumed they're not, or else they would have been fixed already :P They're fixed costs that have to be paid no matter how small an issue is.I work at a BigCo, and occasionally get comments from developer friends about "Hey, why doesn't BigCo fix this obvious bug I reported! I work at a BigCo, and occasionally get comments from developer friends about "Hey, why doesn't BigCo fix this obvious bug I reported! Well, could be many reasons, "priorities" is usually the reason I see as the top reason for things like that to not be fixed immediately, rather than "we looked into it and it was hard". Second most popular reason is "workaround exists", and then after that probably something like "looks easy but isn't".I think the solution would be to stop consider "easy-but-isn't" as easy bugs, even if they might appear so. I think the solution would be to stop consider "easy-but-isn't" as easy bugs, even if they might appear so. If all you are doing is chasing the highest priority stuff, you're going to miss important things because priority isn't an exact science either. This is a perfect expression of something I like to call Chesterton's Inertia. It's exactly the same as Chesterton's Fence.What happens is that there is a mess on the floor, and somebody walks around it, maybe just because they were in a hurry, or maybe they didn't even see it. What happens is that there is a mess on the floor, and somebody walks around it, maybe just because they were in a hurry, or maybe they didn't even see it. Or tragic, but I rather see drama than joy with this approach. The main thing with bugfixing is, that it can affect a whole lot of other areas, or introduce completely new bugs. So both teams then fighting over changes ..Now a really trivial bug with no side effects, sure thing, no issue, but like a sibling commentor has said, the really trivial bugs are usually fixed already. And quick fixes of seemingly trivial things can induce a world of pain for someone else.In other words, I think project management and prioritising things remain hard, with no magic bullets solutions avaiable. (But I wpuld also prefer a stronger emphasis on quality control in general, vs new feature) Now a really trivial bug with no side effects, sure thing, no issue, but like a sibling commentor has said, the really trivial bugs are usually fixed already.

Which is why some random selection of "easy" issues should make it to work queues. Working on two or more big features at the same time is not possible. But throwing in some pebbles and dev can take on it.

Taiwan National Science and Technology Council Minister Wu Cheng-wen said that the U.S. is not pushing through with its threat of a 300% tariff on chips, at least for those coming from the island. At the moment, U.S. President Donald Trump has applied a 20% tariff on Taiwanese goods, except for semiconductor imports. “They understand that punishing Taiwan is not in their interests,” Wu told the Financial Times. Taiwan currently has three science parks and ten technology industrial parks that make it easier for companies to focus on innovation instead of red tape. Aside from that, they also have a fixed lease rate, so companies do not have to worry about skyrocketing rental prices just to stay inside these zones. Aside from helping the U.S. revive its chipmaking industry, an unnamed U.S. government official suggested that the new trade agreement would also result in a US$400 billion investment commitment from Taiwan. This will be much easier for the island, as TSMC is already investing $165 billion in Arizona to build new fabs and even an R&D center. Other Taiwanese companies, like GlobalWafers, are also spending billions of dollars to expand their presence within the United States. This move might seem like an erosion of the island's leadership in semiconductor manufacturing, but it's also taking steps to develop a second “silicon shield.” Taiwan has allocated US$3 billion to turn it into an “AI island” while the government is also focusing on building up other industries, like drones, robotics, and medical technology. More importantly, it has restricted the export of TSMC's most advanced process technologies to help keep it secure — at least in the near future.

The power-packed portable play powerhouse is a pretty performant bit of kit, as we found out in our review. This was a feature exclusive to the ROG unit, but as of today, Microsoft will make it available to "all gaming handhelds currently in the market". Additionally, the blog post on the Xbox site says that FSE ought to become available for testing in "more PC form factors," probably meaning home-theater and console-like PCs. Interested testers can enroll their Windows computers in the Xbox/Windows Insider program to give FSE a spin soon. This new development should brighten the day of owners of other Windows handhelds, such as the Lenovo Legion Go, MSI Claw 8 AI+, and AYANEO 2/Next machines. Particularly proficient power users could already force-enable FSE with a handful of registry hacks, provided they're running Windows 11 version 25H2. If you've never tried it, FSE consolidates all your games from multiple online storefronts, like Windows Store, Steam, Epic Games, and Battle.net, into one place. On the performance side, it's also a small step beyond simply activating Game Mode in Windows, as booting into FSE instead of Explorer should skip at least some RAM-hogging components. If you're really hardcore about performance optimization, as an alternative, you can try installing Bazzite Linux or a variant thereof and reportedly enjoy even higher, more stable FPS in many titles. Steam has had its Big Picture Mode for ages now, and it was an easy argument to make that such an interface should be a baseline feature of any gaming PC, handheld or otherwise.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It turns out that when an AI-friendly super PAC with $100 million in backing from Silicon Valley bigwigs identifies you as its first target, it ends up generating a lot of attention. “I want to thank [the PAC] for their partnership in raising up the issue of how we regulate an incredibly powerful technology so that the future is one that benefits all of us,” says Alex Bores, a New York Assembly member and Democratic congressional candidate, in an interview with WIRED. “I couldn't imagine a better partner this week.” Earlier this year, Bores and New York state senator Andrew Gounardes coauthored the RAISE Act, a bill that would empower New York's attorney general to bring civil penalties of up to $30 million against AI developers like OpenAI and Google if they fail to publish safety reports around their technology. It's one of a handful of state AI safety bills across the country that attempt to regulate AI developers—even as the Trump administration readies an executive order aimed at thwarting state-level AI laws. In addition to backing from venture capital powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz, the recently formed PAC is also funded by OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman and Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale. Brockman and Lonsdale did not respond to WIRED's request for comment. “Assemblyman Bores has advanced exactly the type of ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York's, but the entire country's, ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation,” said the PAC's leaders, Zac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, in a statement to WIRED. They added that the PAC will “aggressively oppose policymakers and candidates in states across the country” that jeopardize Americans' “ability to benefit from AI.” But they declined to share their next targets. Bores believes the AI industry is threatened by his technical chops. The New York lawmaker holds a masters degree in computer science from Georgia Tech. He also worked as an engineer at Palantir for four years before quitting in 2019 over a contract the company renewed with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Maxwell Zeff: WIRED reported yesterday on an executive order Trump is considering to challenge states that have passed AI laws. There's also a renewed effort among House Republicans to ban state AI laws. Alex Bores: I agree that the best solution is a federal one, but it has to be an actual solution. And if they're not, states have a natural role as the laboratories of democracy. The executive order draft that WIRED obtained indicates that Trump may soon create a group within the DOJ to litigate with states over AI laws. A lot of people now know you for your views on AI safety. Is this issue worth staking your political career on? On Sunday, I had my annual town hall with constituents. There were a few questions about AI, but there were also questions on infrastructure, health care, and the broader economy. So the RAISE Act is sitting on [New York governor] Kathy Hochul's desk. The bill has some pretty serious penalties for AI companies that don't follow New York's rules on safety. Why is it important to have these kinds of fines? However, there's also economic pressures that could cause them to change their mind. The bill largely just enforces what they've already committed to, and the penalties make sure there's an economic incentive to not skimp on safety. You might be the first political target of this AI super PAC book, but you likely won't be the last. What kind of example do you want to set for other lawmakers that might be targeted by Leading the Future, and what message do you want to send to the companies behind this? The people funding this have a huge amount of money, but represent a small minority's opinion on what needs to be done. They don't represent Silicon Valley or AI innovation at large. They are hoping a bunch of money can scare people into selling out their constituents. I could see some voters asking, “What is this guy doing fighting with companies on the other side of the country, rather than focusing here in New York?” How does AI safety fit into your message to New Yorkers?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trial data out this week shows that Pfizer's mRNA-based flu vaccine performed markedly better than a traditional shot. The vaccine appears to cause slightly more side effects than others, but there's a bigger concern: It's uncertain whether it will be approved in the U.S., given the government's current skepticism and fearmongering around mRNA vaccine technology. People were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the experimental vaccine, dubbed modRNA, or Fluzone, a widely used inactivated flu vaccine made by Sanofi Pasteur. Both vaccines covered the four most common types of flu predicted to be circulating that season: two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses. Overall, the modRNA vaccine was 34.5% more effective at preventing flu-like illness. Moderna's Super-Vaccine for Flu and Covid Works—Now Politics Could Sink It That added protection may come with some tradeoffs, however. People given modRNA reported more local reactions (70.1% vs. 43.1%) after their shot, such as injection site pain. They were also more likely to report systematic adverse events in general, such as fever (5.6% vs 1.7%). This finding makes sense, since a vaccine's adverse events are often linked to the immune response it generates. So a stronger immune response tends to cause more side effects. But while adverse events were more common in those who took modRNA, these events were still usually mild or moderate in severity. All that said, the most serious hurdle to modRNA's approval isn't its potential side effects. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, and his allies have systemically undermined vaccines during the second Trump administration. Just this week, for instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its website to boost the debunked myth that they cause autism. But as much as Kennedy and his buddies may mistrust vaccines in general, they have an especially strong hatred for mRNA vaccines, the newest type of vaccine that first saw wide use during the covid-19 pandemic. CDC Website Now Boosts Debunked Link Between Vaccines and Autism These unsupported fears of mRNA vaccines have had real-world consequences. In May, Moderna delayed the approval application for its combination flu/covid-19 vaccine (which also seemed to show greater protection against flu) after the FDA asked for more data. Contrary to claims from the anti-vaccination movement that mRNA vaccines are worse or more dangerous than other vaccines, this technology could actually strengthen our defenses against seasonal flu, and not just in terms of improved effectiveness. That shortened lag could then prevent unexpected strains from causing a mismatch with the vaccine (a disastrous situation that's now happening this winter). Moderna has said that it will seek approval for its stand-alone flu shot next year. And given these latest results, Pfizer will undoubtedly apply for approval of its modRNA vaccine, too. Typically, both vaccines would seem to have an excellent chance of approval. "This represents a new and devastating turn by the CDC." Studies show that people who commit mass shootings aren't more likely to be taking antidepressants.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hacker conferences—like all conventions—are notorious for giving attendees a parting gift of mystery illness. To combat “con crud,” New Zealand's premier hacker conference, Kawaiicon, quietly launched a real-time, room-by-room carbon dioxide monitoring system for attendees. To get the system up and running, event organizers installed DIY CO2 monitors throughout the Michael Fowler Centre venue before conference doors opened on November 6. Attendees were able to check a public online dashboard for clean air readings for session rooms, kids' areas, the front desk, and more, all before even showing up. "What they did is fantastic," Jeff Moss, founder of the Defcon and Black Hat security conferences, told WIRED. "CO2 is being used as an approximation for so many things, but there are no easy, inexpensive network monitoring solutions available. Kawaiicon building something to do this is the true spirit of hacking." Elevated levels of CO2 lead to reduced cognitive ability and facilitate transmission of airborne viruses, which can linger in poorly ventilated spaces for hours. In fact, the Australian Academy of Science described the pollution in indoor air as “someone else's breath backwash.” Kawaiicon organizers faced running a large infosec event during a measles outbreak, as well as constantly rolling waves of Covid-19, influenza, and RSV. It's a familiar pain point for conference organizers frustrated by massive gaps in public health—and lack of control over their venue's clean air standards. In early October, organizers deployed a small fleet of 13 RGB Matrix Portal Room CO2 Monitors, an ambient carbon dioxide monitor DIY project adapted from US electronics and kit company Adafruit Industries. Kawaiicon tested its CO2 monitors in collaboration with researchers from the University of Otago's public health department. “The best part is seeing folks pick up new skills and really understand how we measure and monitor air quality in the real world (like at a con during a measles flare-up)! Its cathedral-like acoustics posed a challenge to Kawaiicon's air-hacking crew, which they solved by placing the RGB monitors in stereo. “The things we had to consider were typical health and safety, and effective placement (breathing height, multiple monitors for multiple spaces, not near windows/doors),” a Kawaiicon spokesperson who goes by Sput online told WIRED over email. “Being a tech-leaning community it is easier for us to get this set up ourselves, or with volunteer help, but definitely not out of reach given how accessible the CO2 monitor tech is.” Kawaiicon's attendees could quickly check the conditions before they arrived and decide how to protect themselves accordingly. At the event, WIRED observed attendees checking CO2 levels on their phones, masking and unmasking in different conference areas, and watching a display of all room readings on a dashboard at the registration desk. “Everyone who occupies the con space we operate have a different risk and threat model, and we want everyone to feel they can experience the con in a way that fits their model,” the organizers wrote on their website. “We think this is important so folks don't put themselves at risk having to go directly up to a monitor to see a reading,” Kawaiicon spokesperson Sput told WIRED, “It also helps folks find a space that they can move to if the reading in their space gets too high." It's a DIY solution any conference can put in place: resources, parts lists, and assembly guides are here. “Masks are encouraged, but not required,” Kawaiicon's Health and Safety page stated. “Free masks will be available at the con if you need one.” They encouraged attendees to test before coming in, and for complete accessibility for all hackers who wanted to attend, of any ability, they offered a full virtual con stream with no ticket required. Trying to find out if a venue will have clean or gross recycled air before attending a hacker conference has been a pain point for researchers who can't afford to get sick at, or after, the next B-Sides, Defcon, or Black Hat. But they're not here for debates about beliefs or anti-science trolling. “We each have our different risk tolerance,” the organizers wrote. “Just leave others to make the call that is best for them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First released in late 2023, the product is a lightweight wearable with two electrode pads that sit against the inner wrist. The gadget would likely have stayed in relative obscurity if the company that makes it had not attended a recent Chinese trade show, whereafter it suddenly went viral. “The purpose of inventing this eCoffee Energyband is not to replace coffee. Coffee is great, but it's not always suitable for the afternoon or evening. On Chinese ecommerce websites, including JD and Taobao, the device appears to be sold out as of now, with hundreds of mixed reviews from buyers. The website lists its normal price at $130, with a holiday promotion going on right now that knocks 30 percent off the price. But on Chinese social media, the wristband has been met with overwhelming sarcasm and skepticism. The young generation in China is increasingly recoiling from workplace burnout. Instead of taking a rest when I feel tired, I'll just electrocute myself instead,” Chinese comedian Ma Xiaoyang said in a standup performance in early November, posted on her Xiaohongshu feed. She also compared it to the torture tactics that scam compounds in Southeast Asia famously use on human trafficking victims, “Now you can experience what it's like to live at a scam compound anytime you want. To be fair, much of the online pushback has less to do with whether the gadget actually works but with what it represents. Unlike some of its Western predecessors (like an alarm clock that shocks you to wake you up), the wristband is not just an electric shock machine. Experts tell WIRED that they believe it actually can stimulate the nervous system if worn correctly. But those experts question whether that stimulation comes with the claimed benefit of keeping you awake. WAT Medical did not respond to WIRED's request for comment. “I think that it would require some rigorous and carefully conducted clinical studies to really demonstrate this,” says Omer Inan, a professor at Georgia Institute of Technology, who has experience engineering similar devices stimulating the nerves on the wrist. “There are many challenges to this type of stimulation, and the specific concept of increasing cerebral blood flow and neurotransmitter levels would really need to be supported by evidence.” The web page for eCoffee lists academic research, proprietary patents, and medical trials, all of which build an image of a scientifically proven solution. But some of that evidence falls apart on closer inspection. The same page also boasts a clinical study the company has conducted with Naval Medical University in China where researchers tested a similar wristband by the company on patients who'd feel nausea after surgery. But online information shows that Leylek specializes in aesthetic gynecology, and not the nervous system. Leylek did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Stimulating this nerve leads to the body staying more alert. A part of that process is backed by science. For example, it's true that stimulating the vagus nerve could help people concentrate, says J. Douglas Bremner, a professor of psychiatry and radiology at Emory University School of Medicine, whose peer-reviewed research is cited by eCoffee on its website. Bremner's research uses a device on the neck to stimulate the vagus nerve of patients with stress-related psychiatric disorders and found positive results. She says it's unclear if wristbands could achieve similar results as more conventional stimulating devices applied on the ear or the neck. But that work  is still ongoing, and he doesn't know the full picture yet. It's possible that devices like eCoffee could have a similar effect to the brain and the body, but it's not proven yet, Bremner says. The lack of scientific evidence for effectiveness also means such gadgets are increasingly pushed to the public as not medical treatment, but a lifestyle tool. Think of it as a more sophisticated (and certainly more expensive) stress ball, which also helps some people concentrate on work. Bremner says there have been startups in the US working on wearable gadgets that stimulate the nervous system through electrical signals. But these companies have had difficulty getting FDA approval to use them in clinical settings, so instead they are pivoting to market the same device as lifestyle enhancement gadgets that reduce stress. Since these devices don't claim they have a medical benefit, it's much harder for consumers to really know whether they are effective, like this review of another wristband that says it can “activate your vagus nerve” through vibrations. Centanni has seen another device marketed to menopausal women with the goal of relieving hot flashes, but without good data proving its efficacy, she suspects there's merely a placebo effect that makes the wearer feel it's working. Meanwhile, the company behind eCoffee has taken the idea of stimulating wrist nerves in several directions to arrive at some novel applications. WAT Medical makes a wristband that claims to prevent nausea and vomiting, and another one that claims to suppress appetite and therefore “reduce obesity.” Inan, who has worked on wrist nerve stimulating devices, says he has never heard of similar gadget ideas in the West. “I am not sure there is any direct connection to these aspects,” he says.

For a few years now, Amazon drops all its Black Friday deals starting the Friday before Thanksgiving weekend: This approach helps the retail giant avoid the chaos of a single-day sales spike and gives customers time to browse at their own pace. As the perfect holiday season gift, both the PS5 Standard and Digital Edition models are expected to vanish quickly, and this year's discounts are nothing short of spectacular. Inside, it has an AMD Ryzen Zen 2 processor with eight cores that reach speeds of up to 3.5GHz. It pairs with an AMD RDNA 2 GPU which provides 10.28 teraflops of graphics power at 2.23GHz. This results in games loading in seconds thanks to the ultra-fast 1TB SSD which gives you 25% more storage than the original model. The console features 16GB of GDDR6 video memory operating at a bandwidth of 448GB/s, and allows your games to run smoothly, even in the most demanding scenes. You'll enjoy gaming in impressive 4K resolution with ray tracing, creating realistic reflections and lighting that make virtual worlds feel real. The PS5 Slim supports HDMI 2.1 with variable refresh rate technology, syncing your TV's refresh rate to the console's output. This helps eliminate screen tearing and provides smoother gameplay. The console perfectly handles 1440p screens, and offers a balance between 1080p and 4K for players who want higher frame rates instead of maximum resolution. Sony has improved the cooling system, adding five heat pipes for better thermal management, and allows the console to run quietly at just 33.6 decibels. The adaptive triggers vary in resistance depending on your actions in-game, offering everything from a gentle squeeze to the firm resistance of pressing emergency brakes. The Standard model has a disc drive for buying physical games, watching 4K Blu-ray movies and sharing titles with friends. If you start with the Digital Edition and later want physical media, Sony offers an attachable disc drive for $79.99, but it's more economical to buy the Standard model from the start. These Black Friday prices offer real value for anyone ready to jump into current-generation gaming or looking to upgrade from a PS4. The PS5 Slim has everything that makes modern gaming exciting, from near-instant load times to visually stunning games, all in a compact package that fits seamlessly into your entertainment center. Since these consoles often sell out quickly during big sales, it's wise to shop sooner to avoid missing out.</p>
