                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team and head coach Mauricio Pochettino have made a powerful statement. The recent upturn in results, highlighted by this week's 5-1 demolition of Uruguay, has led to a completely different feel about the squad and its chances at next summer's World Cup. We saw it in the opening half hour against Uruguay when players were flying around the field and ripping apart a South American opponent. We saw it previously, too, in the late-game brawl against Paraguay days earlier. He has pushed these guys to another level, and the team now truly looks like it believes it can beat anybody. We'll find out in the summer – and perhaps a few months prior in friendlies against top European competition – but you now feel the U.S. has a fighting chance of making a serious impact in the World Cup. The dismantling of Uruguay was so far removed from those painfully soulless defeats to Turkey and Switzerland back in June that at times it felt unreal. As I watched the goals flying in during that first-half blitz against Marcelo Bielsa's side, I found myself checking the team sheet to make sure that this really was a recognized Uruguay squad. I suspect the coach was being diplomatic with that final part of his statement, I think he was saying that the reality he found with the USMNT was much, much worse than even critical fans and pundits realized. When Pochettino began experimenting with his roster, calling up a host of players – some of whom had fans and pundits scratching our heads – we presumed he simply hadn't been happy with the technical level that he had found when he took over the team. He wasn't trying to finesse a slightly better range of options for the World Cup. No, he was blowing up what existed before, he was smashing the sense of entitlement that some may have had, he was creating a new environment and setting new standards. He was deliberately destroying a team culture that he knew wasn't strong enough to achieve his goals. After a while, we started to realize that his roster selections were sending a message to the so-called established players. Reminding them that they couldn't take their places for granted. But even this didn't fully grasp what the Argentine was undertaking. It wasn't just a subtle message to some players who might have been feeling too comfortable, a signal that would result in them being eventually recalled with a little more humility. It's hard to imagine that Pochettino is now going to discard those players he has called up in recent windows and who have responded so well. After watching Pochettino snap over rather harmless questions regarding the squad's “regular” and more experienced players, I am even more convinced of that. I have always said this team needed a coach from Europe who could raise the demands and level of expectations. An American coach attempting Pochettino's strategy – playing MLS guys ahead of Europe-based players, leaving out more-established stars – would not have treaded through the backlash so defiantly. Pochettino, however, can step in and say, “I don't care who you are.” He can command respect because of his CV: he reached a Champions League final and has coached the best players in the world, including Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappé, Neymar, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. When talking to players like Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah and Weston McKennie, Pochettino can draw a line in the sand. If the players thought they were getting the smiling, friendly, ‘players' coach' that Pochettino was presented as when he took over, they now know that there is another side to him. “Big balls … he showed great character,” was Pochettino's assessment then. Pochettino's strategy over the last year took fortitude, too. There was no guarantee that the players he turned to would have delivered in the way that they have. There was no certainty that the players would have responded to his disruption of the culture by creating a new one. The way he has handled Gio Reyna is another element of his strategic approach. Reyna was left off rosters, giving him time to sort out his club future. After the 2022 World Cup drama, Reyna faced significant backlash, but his attitude appears to have changed significantly. While his quality might still be lacking due to injuries and a lack of confidence, Pochettino decided that now was his chance to come in and perform. And with his displays in this window – an early goal vs. Paraguay, an assist off the bench vs. Uruguay – Reyna went from being on the outside to putting himself right back in contention for the 26-man World Cup roster. Giving the team fight and spirit isn't just some exercise in machismo, it's actually fundamental to creating the edge that winning teams have. When you have a number of talented and athletically gifted players, having more intensity and being up for it more than your opponent is what truly separates teams. If a team is consistently winning second balls, challenges and aerial duels, it will generate more chances and be more dangerous. The results of this radical overhaul are clear in the emergence of players who have improved with every camp. We've seen significant gains from players like Arfsten, Freeman, Berhalter and Tanner Tessmann. It would be nuts now to say that Berhalter is not going to be in the World Cup roster. The final roster decisions will be complex, particularly in midfield, where you now have major improvement from players like Brenden Aaronson, Cristian Roldan and Tessmann. But whatever that final 26-man roster looks like, the mentality and culture of this team are now set. The USMNT is on a path that instills confidence, rather than concern. Former US men's national team forward Charlie Davies is a contributor at The Athletic delivering hard-hitting opinion columns, straight-talking podcast appearances, and insightful explainer videos. Charlie made 17 appearances for the USMNT between 2007-09 and was pivotal in helping the team qualify for the 2010 World Cup, before his career was impacted by a serious car accident.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Next summer's edition of soccer's marquee event will include 48 teams (the biggest field ever) and will be co-hosted by three countries: the U.S., Canada and Mexico. All eyes will be on Christian Pulisic, the 27-year-old winger who plays at Italian powerhouse AC Milan. Pulisic has also previously played at Chelsea (where he won a Champions League trophy) and German club Borussia Dortmund. Other players to watch are midfielders Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams. Both are also veterans of the 2022 World Cup and are expected to help both defend and distribute the ball from their positions. Chris Richards, who has emerged as a solid center-back for English club Crystal Palace, is turning into the Americans' best defender. A native of Argentina who played at the World Cup for his country in 2002, Pochettino has coached for some notable clubs in Europe. His first managerial job was at Spanish club Espanyol (where he had been a player) before moving to England and taking over at Southampton. He then led Tottenham Hotspur to the 2019 Champions League final (losing to Liverpool) before taking on the job at Paris Saint-Germain for two years. With the USMNT, Pochettino has a record of 13 wins, 7 losses, and two draws. The three group stage games will be as follows: Round of 32 match – July 1 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. (San Francisco Bay Area) Round of 16 match – July 6 at Lumen Stadium in Seattle Round of 16 match — July 7 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta Quarterfinals match – July 11 at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo. Round of 32 match — June 29 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. Round of 16 match — July 4 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia Quarterfinals match – July 9 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. Round of 16 match — July 4 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia This scenario doesn't have them playing on July 4 but still advancing as a third-place team: Round of 32 match — July 3 at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo. Round of 16 match — July 7 at BC Place in Vancouver, Canada Quarterfinals match – July 11 at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo. The USMNT has appeared 11 FIFA World Cups, qualifying in 1930, 1934, 1950, 1990, 1994 (hosts), 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2022. Since no third-place match was held that year, FIFA officially lists the United States as finishing in third place.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soccer, particularly men's soccer, in the United States occupies an idiosyncratic space in the nation's sports landscape. Meanwhile, the US Men's National Team doesn't really have a comparable counterpart when it comes to sports in the US and, in fact, is not the most popular men's national team in the country. Perhaps Olympic basketball, or the Olympics more broadly, compares but that's more of an American all-star team that shows up every four years expected to win a gold medal while the USMNT plays regularly in games of varying importance until the World Cup which it is not expected to win. Recent comments from Mauricio Pochettino highlight this when the manager called for fans to support the team saying, “In Argentina, Argentina is more important than any name. So we need our fans to follow and support the national team. We need to build that relationship.” This comes after he practically begged fans to support the team after a loss to South Korea in September. Landon Donovan called supporter chants in the US boring and told the Unfiltered Soccer Podcast, “Chanting something like, ‘Timmy Howard.' It's like, guys, do something fun. If you scroll through social media or Instagram and come across fun or famous chants in the U.K., they're so creative and brilliant whether you like it or not.” Indeed, two World Wars and one World Cup is the height of creativity. However, these views aren't new and have been parroted by fans, coaches, players, and pundits for over a decade. They come from a place of unrealistic expectations and the assumption that because the United States is doing something it must be the best at it and reflect an unease Americans have when that is not the case. There will be hype, media coverage, and players will have a chance to turn into legends. And yet, with just months to go before the tournament kicks off, the manager is pleading with fans to pay attention to the team. Growing the sport and an identity around it is an ongoing process and the US Soccer Federation announced its “Pathway Strategy” to grow the game by making it more accessible to youth players and try to foster a common philosophy amongst clubs so that young players can be successful in the sport. All of this speaks to a country that is forging its own identity within the sport and navigating a unique sports entertainment market compared to nations where soccer is the national sport. The chants won't sound like they do in England, the support won't be the same as it is in Argentina, the development won't be the same as it is in Iceland or France or Germany, and there isn't promotion and relegation to solve all of these problems. Expecting that the United States men will be an exceptional force that galvanizes supporter passion in a very short modern history compared to countries that don't have generational attachments to other national pastimes reflects vain presumptions that discount how expansively the sport has developed. Ultimately, the support for the team and its identity will emerge on its own and cannot be outsourced to another country. The World Cup roster picture is getting clearer but key players will miss the November games Instead of rehashing the past, he should look to rebuild his career. Talented young players are pushing the USWNT forward Playing against all those college graduates paid off Key positions are up for grabs</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - JUNE 24: Christian Gray #4 of Auckland City FC celebrates the team's first goal during the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 group C match between Auckland City FC and CA Boca Juniors at GEODIS Park on June 24, 2025 in Nashville, Tennessee. They all scored in last summer's FIFA Club World Cup. “Scoring goals has always been there for me, but maybe not as much as I'd like at times,” stated Gray in an exclusive World Football Index interview. Despite starting off as a striker and then a midfielder, Gray would eventually follow in his father's footsteps by playing as a center back for Wellington College before launching his senior career with Waitakere United in 2016. Unlike New Zealand's only two professional clubs (Auckland FC and Wellington Phoenix), who play in the Australian league and are thus banned from competing in Oceanian and Asian continental competitions, Auckland City are an amateur side that plays in the New Zealand top-flight. They've been allowed to form a regional and continental dynasty, winning 10 league titles (including last year's edition) as well as 13 OFC Champions League titles, including the last four. “We currently have two professional teams in New Zealand that are playing in the Australian league, but early next year, there will be two more teams from New Zealand playing in a professional Oceania league. I think we'll see top-level players from around the world, including some All Whites players, who come to play in it. Whether or not we have the infrastructure and resources to build a professional league, I'm not sure, but there's definitely a lot of talent and potential in this country.” As a result of their regional stranglehold, Auckland have competed in more FIFA Club World Cups than any other team in world football. But despite conceding early on, Auckland were able to weather the storm and pull level after halftime as Gray headed home from a corner kick. Auckland would hold on for a memorable 1-1 draw in Nashville, prompting various pundits like Leonardo Bertozzi and Paulo Vinicius Coelho to declare it one of the greatest upsets in the history of the tournament. He then returned to New Zealand, where he spent several months doing his 9/5 job as a soccer coach / PE teacher before traveling to Egypt to face off against Pyramids in the FIFA Intercontinental Cup. “[My goal] was all over the media in New Zealand, so even the non-football people were aware of what was going on. I came back in the holidays and didn't see any of my students at school for a couple of weeks, but from what I understand, they were quite inspired and buzzing over what happened after watching me on TikTok, Instagram and other outlets. There's definitely a lot of awareness around what happened…maybe not as much as it would've been in Argentina or Brazil, but I did notice that everyone was aware of it.” Gray followed his Boca heroics with goals in back-to-back games vs. Western Springs and Eastern Suburbs before coming undone in 3-0 defeats to Pyramids and Birkenhead United, scoring an own goal in the latter. He was able to keep things neat and today at the back as Auckland beat Western Suburbs and Wellington Olympic, before contributing an 87th-minute equalizer to secure a draw vs. Auckland FC's reserves. “First of all, I'm keen to play as much as possible, stay available and stay injury-free, and maybe score some more goals. As a team, I think it would be a cool way to finish off 2025 with the National League title, considering the year we've had, and I think that's the expectation for us. It's now back to normal for us as we have one game a week. For 10 weeks in the winter season, we were away for long periods of time and had a lot of midweek games, but now, we're back to a consistent schedule with the National League. As he prepares to turn 29 years of age, Christian Gray is enjoying the best form of his entire career and emerging as one of the first names on Auckland's team sheet, leading the team with 58.2 accurate passes per 90 (84% accuracy) and 4.2 clearances per game, as well as ranking second to Adam Mitchell (5.0) with 4.4 accurate long balls per game. It's precisely why, despite approaching his 30s, he is still hopeful of playing professionally and earning a maiden call-up to the All Whites. If I keep taking my opportunities, then the position's there. It's actually quite a competitive position in our team as we have a few players that can play center back. So when you've got the opportunity to play, you've gotta hang on to it because if you get injured or don't perform, then it might be quite hard to get that spot back.” With three matches remaining in the regular season, Auckland City currently sit sixth in the table, level on 11 points with Christchurch United and Auckland FC's reserves (with a game in hand on both), and two behind third-placed Miramar Rangers. More importantly, they currently find themselves four points behind Wellington Olympics and five behind league leaders Western Springs, with the top two sides set to face off in a winner-takes-all playoff match to determine the national championship. In order to come away with another championship, Auckland City need to win their next three matches vs. Wellington Phoenix's Reserves, Western Springs AFC, and Coastal Spirit, but they also need a lot of luck to go their way. Above all, though, they'll need Christian Gray to continue banging in the goals. You must be logged in to post a comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (Nov. 21, 2025) – Twenty players have been called up to the U.S. Under-20 Women's National Team for training camp and matches to be held on the coast of southeast Spain that will run from Nov. 24-Dec. 3. This camp will be the second for new U.S. U-20 WNT head coach Vicky Jepson, but it will mark her first international matches at the helm. Zoe Matthews of the Houston Dash is currently playing in Spain with Dux Logrones. Midfielder Ashlyn Puerta has scored a remarkable nine goals in 10 games for Sporting Club Jacksonville so far this season. Four of the six NWSL players – Katie Scott (Kansas City Current), Mary Long (Kansas City Current), Ainsley McCammon (Seattle Reign) and Kennedy Fuller (Angel City FC) – played in the 2024 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, and Current forward Alex Pfeiffer would have if not for a knee injury. Texas forward Amalia Villarreal, who scored eight goals and two assists for the Longhorns this season, played in the 2022 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. The 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup will take place next year in Poland from Sept. 5-27. Goalkeepers (2): Charlotte Burge (Carolina Ascent FC; Virginia Beach, Va.), Kealey Titmuss (Penn State; Grand Blanc, Mich.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Conference semifinals are set to serve up plenty of drama this weekend, with Inter Miami hoping to stay alive and one of Thomas Muller or Son-Heung Min going home The first round didn't deliver much in terms of upsets, but there was more than enough drama to whet the appetite. And even if pausing the postseason to avoid clashes with international soccer was the right call, it still felt like something of a buzzkill to see MLS go dormant for a couple of weeks. But hey, they're here again - and the bracket looks remarkably good. What we have now are two star-studded semifinals and two more matchups that offer plenty of intrigue in their own right. Inter Miami vs. FC Cincinnati is a total toss-up, especially with Lionel Messi's side heading into a brutally tough venue to face Evander and Co. The Vancouver Whitecaps vs. LAFC clash should be a shootout between two global greats in Son Heung-min and Thomas Müller. Anders Dreyer and Hirving “Chucky” Lozano's San Diego FC are clear favorites against Eric Ramsay's Minnesota United, but the Loons are a nightmare to play against - and they match up well. And then there's the Supporters' Shield winners, the Philadelphia Union, who now have to prove that their league-best record holds weight with rivals NYCFC coming to town. Making any sort of picks is a fool's errand - which is why GOAL U.S. writers went ahead and did it anyway in another edition of… The Rondo. Cincy has the firepower to go toe-to-toe with anyone, and Miles Robinson told GOAL this week that they feel that way internally, too. Even so, it's Messi, and he isn't just anyone. If they lose, you'd hope the front office changes things and makes some smart decisions. They're heading towards a rebuild regardless, with this being some of the Barca boys' last dance. They are the team to watch this offseason, no matter how their MLS Cup journey ends. Vancouver hit a bit of form ahead of the playoffs, and LAFC just looked electric against an admittedly poor Austin. In a one off, though, it's silly to bet against Son. RT: Vancouver will be rocking, and that's going to be really, really coo,l but no one has shown the ability to stop Son and Bouanga just yet. You might stop one, but not both, which means goals are on the menu. The Caps have a shot, but they'll need to be almost perfect. They should contend, both now and in the future. This isn't a “oh nice we made the playoffs signing." This is a “we better win MLS Cup” deal. So far, they've shown that potential, but in this one-game format, who knows what happens? TH: If it were anyone but Minnesota United, the answer would have to be no. But the Loons are set up to be difficult to break down, and have beaten San Diego on their patch before. The expansion franchise made things far too tricky against Portland, too, and look far more vulnerable than many might have expected. A Minnesota win wouldn't be an immense surprise. RT: Of course, because everyone is in these one-game clashes. That's enough sometimes, so San Diego should be challenged, at the very least. TH: Not at all, but there's far less chatter about them than you'd expect for a Supporters' Shield winner. NYCFC are down two big names in Andrés Perea and Alonso Martínez, and the Union will go into that fixture as clear favorites. Whether they can beat Miami and Cincinnati in a one-off, though, is far less certain. The off-field reports about their Sporting Director Ernst Tanner are no help, but those aren't directly related to the players themselves. They'll have to push that to the side and just play, which is easier said than done but entirely possible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two days after the U.S. men's national team took apart his Uruguayan squad in an international friendly, head coach Marcelo Bielsa admitted that he was "ashamed" of the loss. But he said that he will continue to coach the team through next year's World Cup. Two days after the U.S. men's national team took apart his Uruguayan squad in an international friendly, head coach Marcelo Bielsa admitted that he was “ashamed” of the loss. There had been speculation that he might resign in the country's worst defeat since a 4-0 loss to Colombia in 2012. “My inclination to hold a press conference after losing 5-1 to the United States stemmed from the need to explain, especially after a defeat like that, which always generates concern,” Bielsa said at a presser on Thursday, according to ESPN.com. “Losing 5-1 is certainly not something that can be ignored. There's a term for it that's meant to be private, but one feels ashamed when results like this occur. “What one does is analyze it personally and then share the questions that arise to explain such a negative performance with [sporting director] Jorge [Giordano], who is a specialist, and what he has to say has the added benefit of his specific professional knowledge.” Bielsa was named head coach in May 2023. Front Row Soccer editor Michael Lewis has covered 13 World Cups (eight men, five women), seven Olympics and 28 MLS Cups. He has written about New York City FC, New York Cosmos, the New York Red Bulls and both U.S. national teams and has penned a soccer history column for the Guardian.com.</p>

Notable global stars who featured on the poster included Lionel Messi, Erling Haaland, Harry Kane, Kylian Mbappé, James Rodríguez, Son Heung-Min, Vinícius Jr., and others. African players on the poster included Achraf Hakimi of Morocco, Sadio Mané from Senegal, Mohamed Salah from Egypt, and Jordan Ayew of Ghana, among others. Ghana, Nigeria and Ivory Coast can host the FIFA World Cup - Sports minister Kofi Adams It is worth noting that FIFA selected one player from each of the qualified countries to be featured on the poster, which was intended for publicity before and during the tournament. The new FIFA poster now features Cristiano Ronaldo, En-Nesyri's goal that beat Portugal, and Messi holding the World Cup. The 2026 World Cup will kick off in June 2026, with 48 countries competing for the most prestigious trophy in football.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Similar policies and strategies were also implemented for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games, which had its own temporary bylaw. To ensure operational readiness, event security, and compliance with FIFA's branding requirements, the City says it must temporarily modify its regulatory framework. These changes include streamlined permitting for temporary event structures, enhanced noise flexibility, expedited graffiti removal, and limits on unlicensed commercial advertising — targeting issues such as ambush marketing by businesses and organizations that are not official FIFA sponsors and partners — during the event. Under the proposed changes, temporary structures such as tents, modular buildings, and media platforms could be erected more easily beginning Jan. 1, 2026, ahead of the main event window of May 13 to July 20, 2026. Crowds for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in downtown Vancouver. To help maintain a clean and welcoming city image, the report calls for faster response to graffiti — requiring removal within 24 hours of notice — and grants the City authority to remove offending markings at the owner's expense if they do not comply. A similar approach would apply to unauthorized commercial signage infringing on FIFA's brand protection rules, though residential privacy protections remain in place. Noise regulations would be relaxed to support overnight servicing, international broadcast requirements, and extended event programming. City sites include Killarney Community Centre/Killarney Park (location of one of the two official FIFA training sites for visiting teams), the empty lots near and around the Dunsmuir and Georgia viaducts, Queen Elizabeth Theatre, Library Square, Thorton Park, Science World parking lot, International Village mall, Cambie Bridge works yard, Heather Civic Marina, PNE fairgrounds, and 19 SkyTrain stations within the city boundaries. FIFA sites are designated as BC Place Stadium, Parq Vancouver's JW Marriott hotel, Plaza of Nations, and Concord Pacific's Northeast False Creek lands. Vancouver's official 2026 FIFA World Cup countdown clock installed outside BC Place Stadium at Terry Fox Plaza. Currently, street performers can perform in many areas without a permit, but the new bylaw would temporarily ban most of the permit-free performance areas, including the sidewalks next to Library Square, Science World, Vancouver Art Gallery, Queen Elizabeth Theatre, Terry Fox Plaza, and several SkyTrain stations. Food trucks would be restricted in the downtown security footprint unless explicitly authorized.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team's 2026 schedule is reportedly taking shape. The opponent for a fourth match, which will take place in late May has not yet been determined, according to the report. Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium will host the pair of March friendlies against Portugal and Belgium, who both sealed their World Cup berths during the past international window. There will also be a multi-city, pre-World Cup camp in late May and early June, which will conclude with a sendoff match against Germany at Chicago's Soldier Field. May's friendly will take place on the East Coast, with Charlotte's Bank of America Stadium being studied as a possible host site. U.S. Soccer's new National Training Center in Fayetteville, Georgia will serve as the USMNT's home base from May 27-June 5. May and June's friendlies will feature Mauricio Pochettino's final roster for the World Cup. Pochettino and his player pool will learn their World Cup group stage opponents on December 5 when the FIFA Draw takes place at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. The USMNT recently concluded 2025 with a pair of home friendly wins over Paraguay and Uruguay. if we are truly in the “no one is safe” business, then you call more players than you need in may, and have a cut. related point, i think a tough immediate pre-tournament schedule (as opposed to earlier parts of the cycle) is justifiable as you need to test whether the team and its components are ready for next summer. however, if you are sincere, (a) people who flunk the test need to get cut or have their roles shrunk and (b) you need other options who can step into their shoes if they are exposed. or the scapegoat is a bench player whose fault that window wasn't, that the coach seemed after already. put differently, let the games tell you who belongs. this goes much better if you (duh) reward performers and demote suckage. i don't understand why you train and do friendlies in the east to play world cup games in LA and seattle. It's going to be entertaining watching USMNT players during this final stretch. PERFORM OR GET DROPPED……especially from those abroad that thought they were guaranteed to be selected until Poch's last press conference. According to Pochettino there is no A-team or B-team or C-team…..there is just the USMNT, so EVERYONE has a fair shot depending on the player's need, skill, abilities etc. The upcoming months are going to be interesting</p>
