                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UC Davis researchers are leading a $5.5 million study to better understand how children with Down syndrome develop expressive communication - the skills used to share what we want, think or feel. Most children with Down syndrome have delays in developing expressive communication. We know these delays are common and that children develop at different speeds, but we still don't know enough about how their communication skills change and grow." It is often associated with characteristics such as distinctive physical features, differences in learning, and, in some cases, health-related concerns such as heart problems. Thurman and her team hope to answer questions that families often ask but professionals cannot yet answer - such as when a child with Down syndrome might reach certain milestones or how early signs can predict whether extra help is needed. "Without this kind of information, parents and professionals don't have much to guide their decisions," Thurman said. "That often means waiting to see how things go or using a one-size-fits-all approach." Expressive communication can include gestures, sounds, pictures, sign language or spoken words. The team will use detailed, well-established methods to follow children's progress. These will include interviewing parents, tracking the words and skills children use over time and analyzing recordings of children communicating. The team will check in with families every three or four months, either in person or via telehealth, to closely monitor changes as they happen. "By combining these tools with rigorous research, we should be able to develop a more accurate and meaningful guide - like a roadmap specifically for children with Down syndrome." Understanding how these skills emerge and vary among children with Down syndrome could transform how families and providers plan interventions. Currently, language interventions for people with Down syndrome vary widely, and research on their effectiveness is limited. "As we learn more about the different ways people with Down syndrome learn and grow, professionals will be better able to create tools and supports that are more personalized and better timed." The ultimate goal is to improve quality of life for children with Down syndrome by giving families and professionals the knowledge they need to support communication development in the most effective way possible. "By working closely with families, we can make sure research focuses on the questions and concerns that matter most to them," Thurman said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>IntroductionModern challenges in drug developmentFrom petri dish to microphysiological systemsBiological basis: Mimicking human physiologyCase studiesTranslational outlookRegulatory interest: The FDA Modernization ActReferencesFurther Reading This innovation is reshaping preclinical testing by bridging the gap between laboratory models and real-world clinical outcomes. Over 90% of therapeutics that enter clinical trials ultimately fail, largely because traditional preclinical models do not accurately predict human efficacy or toxicity. Organoid-on-a-chip (OoC) systems combine self-organizing 3D biology with microengineered perfusion and mechanical cues, allowing for the real-time study of tissue-level function under physiologically relevant conditions.3 Recent reviews emphasize that these limitations have led to the integration of organoid and microfluidic chip technologies to improve preclinical predictivity by mimicking in vivo-like perfusion, oxygen gradients, and mechanical stimulation.3 OoC is a relatively new concept that describes the merging of two distinct but complementary technologies: organoids and microfluidic chips. Each technology was developed to address the limitations of 2D culture, yet they also have their own particular challenges.1,3 Organoids are three-dimensional, self-organizing structures derived from pluripotent or adult stem cells. When cultured under static conditions or in suspension or Matrigel, organoids often show limited maturation and only short-term functional activity.3 These limitations have been attributed to organoids lacking a perfusable vascular system, which leads to necrotic cores due to the inadequate diffusion of nutrients and oxygen.3 An OOC is a microfluidic device, often made from polymers like polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), that uses microchannels to construct models of human organs. Microfluidics enables the precise management of nutrient gradients, hydrodynamic parameters such as fluid shear stress, and mechanical signals, including stretching, observed in lung-on-a-chip models.3 Historically, OOCs have used 2D cell monolayers or simpler cell architectures, which lack the sophisticated 3D cellular intricacy of an organoid.3 To address these limitations, scientists have developed OoC, a hybrid platform that combines the strengths of both organoids and OOCs while addressing their respective limitations.2 Intrinsic microfluidic perfusion provides the continuous nutrient supply and waste removal that organoids need for long-term viability, while simultaneously providing the physical and chemical signals necessary for their functional maturation.3 Recent work has demonstrated quantitative in vitro–in vivo translation (IVIVT) of human pharmacokinetics using multi-organ chips that link gut, liver, kidney, and bone marrow modules under vascular perfusion, thereby achieving human-like predictions for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and toxicity.6 OoCs enable the use of tissue-specific matrix compositions, thereby supporting tissue-specific organization and function.1,3 Furthermore, OoC platforms use microfluidic channels to mimic systemic circulation to provide continuous perfusion for vascular and epithelial cell maturation. OoCs can also integrate multiple cell types to model tissue crosstalk, particularly in the TME. For example, OoC platforms can co-culture epithelial tumor cells with key components of the microenvironment, including stromal and immune cells.4 These capabilities make OoC platforms uniquely suited for testing immunotherapies, such as programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitors, which rely on the interaction between a patient's tumor and immune cells.2 Incorporating immune–tumor co-cultures within tumor-on-chip systems allows direct evaluation of immune checkpoint blockade responses under perfused, gradient-controlled microenvironments.4 PDOs are living 3D models that retain key histopathological, genetic, and phenotypic features of the parent tumor, accurately reflecting its unique cellular heterogeneity.2 When cultured on-chip, PDOs serve as high-fidelity platforms for in vitro testing of drug sensitivity. These OoC properties enable guided precision medicine, where a panel of therapeutics can be screened against the patient's specific tumor in vitro to identify the most effective, individualized treatment strategy.5 These platforms fluidically link multiple organ-on-a-chip models with a common medium to simulate human absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET).6 OoC systems generate extensive datasets from high-content (3D) microscopy and multi-omics, both of which are associated with inefficient manual analysis protocols that are prone to errors and unscalable. This act explicitly authorized the use of non-animal alternatives like OoCs to support drug applications, which encourages the pharmaceutical industry to adopt these platforms for their drug discovery projects.4,8 Hugo Francisco de Souza is a scientific writer based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While artificial intelligence technology is increasingly being used - formally and informally - to support medical diagnoses, its utility in emergency medical settings remains an open question. Researchers at Drexel University broached the question with clinicians at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., to better understand how and when the technology could help them save lives. Led by Angela Mastrianni, PhD, a Drexel graduate who is a postdoctoral fellow at NYU Langone Health and Aleksandra Sarcevic, PhD, a professor in Drexel's College of Computing & Informatics and director of the Interactive Systems for Healthcare Research Lab, the team looked at two types of scenarios in which AI technology is used to support emergency medical doctors in making treatment decisions. In an experiment that involved 35 emergency care providers from six health systems, the researchers found that participants were more likely to make correct decisions when both AI information and recommendations were provided, compared to receiving no AI support. However, they also found that participants were divided on their perception of receiving recommendations from an AI assistant during medical emergencies. Although most preferred to receive AI recommendations and synthesis, some physicians had concerns that the recommendations could infringe on their agency and bias decision making. The authors recently presented its findings at the American Computing Machinery's Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW). Although our study involved a small sample of health care providers, this is the sort of inquiry that will be important as the emergency medical community considers how AI technology can support its lifesaving work. There is no question that the technology can augment the work of humans in medical settings, but understanding when and where it is appropriate and accepted will be key to navigating its adoption." Aleksandra Sarcevic, PhD, Professor, Drexel's College of Computing & Informatics To arrive at their findings, the team first designed a prototype of an AI-enabled decision-support display - dubbed "DecAide" - for use in a pediatric trauma resuscitation setting. By surveying and interviewing a variety of emergency medicine care providers, the team gained an understanding of the types of information that providers use to support decision making during resuscitations and how best to present it. With this guidance, the display took shape as a concise listing of key patient information, highlighting abnormalities and color coding any changes in vital signs. One version presented only this information, while a second also offered a recommendation - such as a blood transfusion or neurosurgical procedure - along with its probability of success based on a risk calculation model drawing on resuscitation data from the primary research site, Children's National Hospital. In a timed virtual exercise, 35 providers were each presented these scenarios under three conditions: in one vignette, the decision-support display offered no information or guidance from AI; during another it offered AI-synthesized information and in the third, both AI-synthesized information and a recommendation were offered. Participants were asked to make real-time assessments in each scenario and decide whether or not the patient needed a life-saving intervention, such as a blood transfusion, brain surgery, a chest tube or needle decompression, intubation or chest surgery. Each participant also completed a survey about how they used the information display. Participants made the correct decisions in 64.4% of the scenarios when both AI information synthesis and a recommendation were provided. The rate fell to 56.3% when only information synthesis was provided without a recommendation and 55.8% when no support was provided. And in many instances, participants made their decision before AI-enabled recommendation was provided on the display. "We are seeing a gradual adoption of decision support systems in medical specialties such as radiology, but there is still quite a bit of hesitancy in using this new technology in dynamic and time-critical medical settings, like emergency medicine," Mastrianni said. "While there is evidence that AI models can diagnose illness at high levels of accuracy, we know that more research is needed to understand how best to integrate it in clinical settings so that providers begin to trust and use this new technology." The team suggests that continued research in this area should include larger participant pools with representatives from a wider range of medical specialties and types of hospitals. They note that before any such tools are adopted, additional information and support is needed for medical leaders deciding whether and how to implement them and how to create clear policies around their use.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Tulane University, with a team of colleagues from eight other universities, have discovered a new nerve cell signaling mechanism that could transform our understanding of pain and lead to safer, more effective treatments. The study, co-led by Matthew Dalva, director of the Tulane Brain Institute and professor of cell and molecular biology in the School of Science and Engineering and Ted Price at the University of Texas at Dallas, reveals that neurons can release an enzyme outside the cell that switches on pain signaling after injury. The work, published in Science, offers new insight into how brain cells strengthen their connections during learning and memory. "This finding changes our fundamental understanding of how neurons communicate," Dalva said. "We've discovered that an enzyme released by neurons can modify proteins on the outside of other cells to turn on pain signaling - without affecting normal movement or sensation." Researchers found that nerve cells communicate outside the cell with the enzyme vertebrate lonesome kinase (VLK), which can alter proteins in the space between neurons, affecting how those cells send signals. This is one of the first demonstrations that phosphorylation can control how cells interact in the extracellular space. It opens up an entirely new way of thinking about how to influence cell behavior and potentially a simpler way to design drugs that act from the outside rather than having to penetrate the cell." The team discovered that active neurons release VLK, which then boosts function of a receptor involved in pain, learning and memory. Adding extra VLK had the opposite effect, increasing pain responses. "It has very broad implications for neuroscience, especially in understanding how pain and learning share similar molecular mechanisms." Dalva said the findings point to a safer way to influence pain pathways by targeting enzymes like VLK rather than directly blocking NMDA receptors, which help regulate communication between nerve cells but can cause serious side effects when disrupted. Next steps are to see whether this is a mechanism specific to just a few proteins or part of a broader and underappreciated aspect of biology, and if so, it could reshape treatment approaches for neurological and other diseases, Dalva said. "Our findings were only possible through this kind of collaboration," Dalva said. "By combining Tulane's expertise in synaptic biology with the strengths of our partners, we were able to reveal a mechanism that has implications not just for pain, but for learning and memory across species."

DART 2030 outlines six areas of action for halting the spread of antibiotic resistance at national level and through international cooperation. The aim of interdisciplinary surveillance is, among other things, to identify trends and developments in antibiotic resistance so that targeted measures can be taken at an early stage and subsequently assessed. For example, the institute is home to the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Antibiotic Resistance. Its most important task is to collect comparable data on antibiotic resistance in zoonotic agents and other bacteria that pose a hazard to public health. Since 2023, this and other monitoring data has also been made available to experts and the interested public via the ZooNotify internet portal. Another key activity of the BfR is the collection and assessment of antibiotic consumption quantities in cattle, pigs, chickens and turkeys, as well as the frequency of treatment in certain animal production types.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than a century ago, Alois Alzheimer noted unusual changes in brain fats, which he described as "lipoid granules," along with the buildup of amyloid-beta (amyloid) plaques and tau protein tangles. These observations led to the identification of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Since then, most Alzheimer's research has focused on amyloid and tau, while brain lipid abnormalities have received far less attention. New research from UT Health San Antonio, the academic health center of The University of Texas at San Antonio, in collaboration with the University of California at Irvine, shows that changes in brain fats, or lipids, play a major role in Alzheimer's development and progression. Lipid imbalances can influence how amyloid proteins build up, and certain genes that regulate lipid metabolism are linked to Alzheimer's risk. In Alzheimer's disease, we see massive disruption of these lipids, yet most studies focus only on genes and proteins." Depending on how they are manipulated, microglia can either help maintain balance or worsen the disease. The research was co-led by Palavicini and Xianlin Han, PhD, professor in the Department of Medicine, who are both investigators with the Sam and Ann Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies. Using a mouse model of Alzheimer's, the scientists tested two approaches to remove microglia. In one, they treated mice with a drug that nearly eliminated all microglia and in the other, they used genetically modified mice that lacked microglia. "We wanted to understand which cells are driving these lipid changes," Palavicini said. The research team compared results from the mouse studies with post-mortem brain samples from people with and without Alzheimer's. They found that amyloid buildup dramatically altered brain lipid patterns. Two groups of lipids stood out: lysophospholipids (LPC and LPE), which are linked to inflammation and oxidative stress, and bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lipid that helps regulate the cell's "recycling centers," called lysosomes. The research team found that a form of BMP containing arachidonic acid (AA-BMP) accumulated near amyloid plaques, and that long-term removal of microglia prevented AA-BMP buildup, showing that microglia drive these changes. "BMP is still not well understood, especially in the brain," Palavicini said. "It forms substructures in lysosomes that attract proteins to break down damaged lipids. Without microglia, AA-BMP levels drop, which can interfere with the brain's cleanup processes." Progranulin levels rise in Alzheimer's conditions and closely align with AA-BMP accumulation. "In the Alzheimer's brain, rather than lowering BMP, it may be important to maintain or support its levels," Palavicini said. Therapies that boost progranulin could potentially restore balance and support brain health." LPC buildup was tied to astrocyte activation and enzyme activity, while LPE increases were linked to oxidative stress and weakened antioxidant defenses. "Even though we hypothesized microglia were driving the accumulation of these inflammatory lipids, it was actually other cell types, including astrocytes," Palavicini said. "This distinction helps us understand which cells to target for therapies and shows how complex lipid regulation is in Alzheimer's disease." The study revealed that microglia also help maintain myelin, a protective coating around neurons. Genetic removal of microglia under amyloid stress reduced myelin-related lipids. "This is why some lipid levels increase when microglia are gone. In most cases, removal of microglia was damaging, which was somewhat unexpected but reveals how critical they are for brain lipid metabolism." This research shows that Alzheimer's is not just about amyloid plaques and tau tangles. It also involves disrupted lipid balance, with microglia, astrocytes and neurons each playing different roles. "By targeting lipid balance along with amyloid and tau, we can develop better strategies to protect neurons and potentially slow or prevent Alzheimer's disease."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A toxin-secreting gut bacterium may fuel ulcerative colitis by killing protective immune cells that maintain intestinal homeostasis, according to a new study. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease affecting millions of people worldwide in which the body's immune system attacks the digestive tract, often causing severe and recurring symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal bleeding. Although the underlying causes of UC remain unclear, previous research indicates that failure of the intestinal epithelial barrier plays an important role in disease progression. Intestinal macrophages are crucial to maintaining the gut's protective epithelial barrier. Zhihui Jiang and colleagues examined colon biopsies from patients with UC and found that subepithelial, tissue-resident macrophages were almost completely absent, even in areas that were not yet showing inflammation. Further experiments in mouse models confirmed that removing these macrophages made the colon highly vulnerable to inflammation. Suspecting a microbial cause, Jiang et al. discovered that fecal samples from UC patients contained aerolysin, a pore-forming toxin produced by a variant of Aeromonas bacteria, which proved selectively lethal to macrophages but not to epithelial cells. In mouse models, infection with this macrophage-toxic bacterium (MTB) sharply worsened colitis, whereas mutant strains lacking aerolysin did not. What's more, MTB infection had no effect in mice already depleted of gut-resident macrophages, and neutralizing aerolysin with antibodies alleviated disease symptoms. In a clinical survey involving 574 participants, Jiang et al. discovered that Aeromonas species were present in 72% of UC patients but only ~12% of healthy individuals and nearly absent in those with Crohn's disease, further linking the bacterium to disease occurrence. "Directly targeting these microbes and their toxins could be a promising avenue for treating [inflammatory bowel disease] without inhibiting the patients' immune system with biologics, such as antibodies, and steroid drugs," write Sonia Modilevsky and Shai Bel in a related Perspective. An Aeromonas variant that produces aerolysin promotes susceptibility to ulcerative colitis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School have just opened a new window into understanding the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The work not only reveals principles of evolutionary biology but also suggests a new strategy to combat the antibiotic resistance crisis, which kills an estimated 1.3 million people per year worldwide. Plasmids are self-replicating genetic elements that float separately from a bacterium's own chromosomes. Plasmids evolve independently but also help drive bacterial evolution, including the development of resistance to antimicrobial compounds. In fact, they are the primary way that resistance can jump from one type of bacteria to another. Scientists have suspected that competition among plasmids within bacterial cells is key to propelling plasmid evolution, but until now they hadn't found a way to study it. First author Fernando Rossine, research fellow in biomedical informatics in the Baym Lab, and colleagues did so by solving two challenges. First, they created starting conditions in which each bacterial cell contained equal proportions of two plasmids that would compete with each other. Second, they used microfluidic devices to isolate single cells and better distinguish the effects of the intracellular plasmid competition. These constraints could inform new strategies that interfere with plasmid evolution and thus curb plasmids' ability to learn to withstand antibiotics - potentially leading to treatments for life-threatening bacterial infections. The study provides us with new tools to fight and prevent antibiotic resistance by weaponizing the intracellular competition between mobile genetic elements themselves." From a more philosophical perspective, he added, the study illuminates how evolution operates at multiple, sometimes conflicting, levels, "which is fundamental for our understanding of complex life."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recovery from deadly influenza infection may hinge on helping the lungs heal in addition to stopping the virus, according to a new study in mice, which shows that pairing modest antiviral therapies with immune modulation can restore damaged tissues and lung function, even after severe infection has taken hold. The findings offer a foundation for future clinical strategies to improve outcomes in severe acute respiratory disease once standard treatments are no longer sufficient. Severe and fatal cases of these maladies are often driven not only by the virus itself, but by a harmful inflammatory cascade that can lead to tissue damage and loss of lung function. Most current treatments for these diseases target inflammation or viral replication alone and tend to fail once extensive tissue damage has already occurred. As a result, therapies for late-stage disease are currently lacking. To better understand the timing of disease process and the balance between tissue injury and repair in severe pulmonary infection, Hiroshi Ichise and colleagues evaluated more than 50 immunomodulatory approaches in a lethal mouse influenza model and found that none improved survival when applied alone, except for neutrophil depletion. Given these observations, Ichise et al. propose a "tipping point" model – once early viral and inflammatory damage passes a certain threshold, controlling inflammation alone cannot restore tissue function. They argue that late in the course of viral pneumonia, and perhaps other acute respiratory diseases, recovery depends on rebalancing tissue injury and repair, rather than suppressing inflammation or viral replication. Through both molecular and imaging analyses, the authors show that both regimens successfully reduced lethality by preserving or restoring tissue integrity and lung function.
