                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artist Michael Benson reveals the hidden beauty of snowflakes, radiolarians and lunar rocks through stunning electron microscope images in his new book, Nanocosmos. This episode was made possible by the support of Yakult and produced independently by Scientific American's board of editors. Michael Benson: So the snowflakes were a different story altogether.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Benson: Three years of continuous snowflake production [Laughs] because it's—because really it, the winter, lasts for half the year. I worked out a methodology to get snowflakes into the vacuum chamber of the electron microscope using liquid nitrogen. I had this kind of cryopod, which was used to take DNA samples around Canada. So you can capture the flakes and keep them at -200 or something degrees, something incredibly cold … and then you have a shot at getting it into the vacuum chamber. Ice in general doesn't like a vacuum, and it doesn't like being hit by electron beams. But you have about three minutes to capture a snowflake. And so we worked out a methodology to get high-quality SEM [scanning electron microscope] images of, of snowflakes. [Flips to another page of the book.] You can see why no two snowflakes are, are alike when you look with a microscope like this because they're so complex, you know? [Points to an image in Nanocosmos.] This one has a bisected tine. I can't really use this one.” And then a minute later I said, “Wait a second, this is how it looks. And actually, I think it's beautiful. Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman. Radiolarians are single-celled organisms that live in water and are [typically] invisible to the naked eye. But under microscope these creatures take on an almost glassinelike quality. Their beauty, along with that of other tiny creatures, and some extreme close-up images of lunar rocks are the subject of Michael Benson's recently released book, Nanocosmos: Journeys in Electron Space. In it he uses a specific type of microscope, a scanning electron microscope, often used by scientists for research, to create beautiful art that he hopes will help instill a sense of wonder and awe in the world. And just a note to all of you listeners, Michael and I were together to look through his stunning new book, and we made a video version of this podcast so that you can look, too. Head over to our YouTube to see snowflakes, radiolarians and moon rocks in all of their visual glory. We have Michael Benson here with us today. Thank you so much for coming. Benson: Thank you very much for inviting me. Pierre-Louis: Your earlier books, you know, Planetfall and Cosmigraphics, really focused on sort of the beauty and the enormity of space, and this is a little bit the opposite. Why did you decide to switch it up? Benson: A lot of people don't even remember the name Buckminster Fuller. Benson: He was a prominent futurist, very famous in the mid-20th century. And he was being interviewed, apparently, by a young journalist, a little bit nervous talking to the great man towards the end of his life, and the journalist said, “You've spent a career prognosticating about colonies in space and our position in space. Does it ever bother you that you haven't actually been to space?” And Fuller looked at him and said. “My God, man, where do you think we are?” Benson: And my point is that, actually, this is not that different from the other work I've been doing; it's just that it's at a different scale. It's all about space and time, looking at how we try to understand our position and space and time using images, but I also write. And with the electron microscope work it was finally having a chance to look at phenomena here on this planet. I wanted to look at natural design at submillimeter scales, so smaller than a grain of salt. Benson: Well, no, it's huge if you're talking about, you know, atomic physics or something—we're talking about large structures. And we are talking about atomic physics because the electron microscope uses the electron and not the photon to look at subjects. Pierre-Louis: Yeah, I was gonna ask you about that. What makes a scanning electron microscope so different from [a] conventional lens-based microscope? It uses electrons instead of photons to look at the subjects, which allows for a far more detailed, nuanced, accurate look at extremely high magnifications of subjects. From a very young age I was aware of electron micro—microscopy images, invariably presented as belonging to scientific research. Benson: Although I am very science-adjacent. I use scientific technologies to explore phenomenal reality for my purposes. Benson: You know, which is, you know, more associated with the arts; it is not science. Pierre-Louis: In what way is it art? Because I think when people think about taking an image of something or preparing a slide—what are the choices you're making that make it different from, say, what people think of when they think of science? Benson: So scientific imaging is about research and empirical data acquisition. I am positioning my work as belonging to the history of, of the image. And in fact, I approach it like photography, even—although it's using a million-dollar piece of scientific research equipment that never leaves a single room—you know, a room ... Benson: You can't take it around [Laughs] and take photos with it. There is a real learning curve learning how to use that kind of instrument ... Benson: And I have been fortunate in having the confidence of the Canadian Museum of Nature in Gatineau, Québec. Benson: I had a training period, and then they let me loose on the instrument. It's a very complex set of procedures just to get a sample ready for the SEM. Benson: SEM: scanning electron microscope. Benson: And that's all exactly the same as what any scientist would do, exactly the same, you know? Art has a freer hand than science. Art does not have to justify itself and prove things. And art is also, to quote something Brian Eno said recently—I don't think he invented this, but it's an interesting point—that art is, in some ways, how adults play. Benson: And furthermore, play is not wasting time—play, in children, is about figuring out their place in the universe in a way, to simplify. Benson: And in my case this work is, in part, an extension of that impulse. You know, how to continue producing in myself this sense of wonder about our place in the universe, about the universe, you know, the phenomenal reality. And I'm also fascinated by frontiers. Pierre-Louis: One of the sets of images that open up the book are of these lunar moon rocks, and it's interesting looking at them because they do—they look like mountainscapes to me. Pierre-Louis: What are we looking at? [Gestures at a page in Nanocosmos.] Benson: So it's lunar impact glass, and it was a piece of ejecta, as they call it, you know, from a macrometeorite impact millions of years ago the Apollo 16 astronauts just kind of casually noticed lying on the lunar surface when they were doing something else and raked up—they had these rakes, sample rakes—and just threw in their sample bag and brought back to Earth. Every single lunar image in the book—there aren't that many ... [Flips to another page.] Benson: This is another lunar mountain range. They all came from the same piece of impact glass, which I just found marvelously ravaged and geological and, and, you know, landscapelike. This is all fracturing ... [Points to an image in the book.] And then, and then, you know, there was—there were millions of years of exposure to space that resulted in various forms of weathering, let's say. Benson: So they have—you can see, you know, characteristic lines radiating out, just like in macro lunar craters that we can see with a—through a telescope. They look like Utah or Arizona slick rock country, you know? Can I ask a very silly question? Pierre-Louis: I don't know. There's, like, a whole trend where—or a thing where people, like, feel compelled to, like, lick rocks, and you got [Laughs] ... Benson: Oh, my God, these are Apollo samples. No chance would I, you know—and, and, and in fact, I wasn't allowed to coat them. Because most samples you put in the electron microscope are coated with a molecule-thin layer of [a conductive material such as] platinum so that they don't charge. Benson: And that's complicated to explain. But you have an electron beam hitting the subject, you know, and if it's not grounded with, with that coating, it can charge, and, and so on. And so I had issues with—I, of course, I couldn't do that; these are priceless samples. Benson: And so I couldn't do that, so I had to figure out ways of imaging, imaging them without them—their charging, and nobody who listens to this podcast is gonna sit through an explanation of how I did that ... But no, I did not lick them. Benson: It's a good question, though. Pierre-Louis: Become almost a world unto themselves ... Pierre-Louis: Because they're taken so closely. They're obviously so beautiful, but is there also, like, a scientific benefit to taking pictures like these? Benson: Whether or not there's a scientific benefit is beyond me, but as I said earlier I am fascinated by frontiers, wherever they may be. And, and, and there's this sort of hazy zone in the sciences, where, where all of this research is taking place, and I am fascinated by that, but I'm not a scientist ... Benson: I go there as an artist, looking for my kind of “discovery.” You know, with those images of insects in plants, you know, I, I did have the benefit of being able to speak to and actually get loans from entomologists ... Benson: At the Museum of Nature. So I was asking things like, “Well, what does that thing do?” And then I would typically get an answer [such as], “Well, we believe it's for this,” and I realize I'm at the frontier, you know? Benson: “We believe it may be for this,” you know? [Gestures to a page in Nanocosmos.] So this is a flowering plant from the Adriatic, and when I collected it—the Croatian side of the Adriatic Sea ... Benson: And when I collected it—I mean, this is incredibly small. It's about—the, the entire plant, let's check [Flips to another page], the entire plant is eight millimeters wide, so that's, you know, under a centimeter wide. And when I collected this thing with tweezers and put it in ethanol, I noticed that there was this weevil in it. And so what you're seeing is this kind of—I mean, very, very close to how it would look in actual nature, you know? Pierre-Louis: If someone actually paid attention to look. Pierre-Louis: Because—I mean, because it's so small, it just feels like a thing that most of us would overlook. I mean, and also, who really looks at all those really tiny flowers? But I—one of the reasons why I really had a lot of fun with this project is it changed my way of looking at—my way of being in nature, you know? And there's another one that's similar to this that is even more ambitious in a way. In fact, I think it's the single most complex mosaic I did in the whole book—all of these are mosaic images, by the way; they're comprised of hundreds of individual scans. Benson: Yeah, so that is—that's from a—that's an Ontario plant and a foxglove aphid in it. [Points to a part of the image.] And that one took about three weeks of continuous work to assemble because the, the individual SEM frame was something like this. And then there's also a depth-of-field question. So, I mean, not to get all nuts and bolts on you here, but, you know, sometimes I had to do focus-stacking, get multiple scans of one part of the, of the subject in order to stack them in Photoshop and make sure everything was in focus, and then, you know, build a complex mosaic. And this is—this has some elements of—you know that famous painting with the tiger in the jungle [Laughs] ... Benson: There's a little bit of that going on. Pierre-Louis: Art isn't prescriptive, but, like, what do you hope that people get from seeing these images? Benson: I don't know. I mean, you know, for example, those—the weevil surrounded by flowering plants was consciously modeled after 16th- and 17th-century Dutch still-life painting, where you'd see all the—you could see all these flowers and insects, all in a perfect arrangement, and just kind of, you know, life in miniature. Benson: It's about triggering an aesthetic response. It's about showing worlds that you can't see with the naked eye, but we have these tools now to see them. Benson: See these worlds, you know? That, that also is all bound to this question of the frontier, of course. Radiolarians, there're these, like, you know, microscopic, basically, organisms ... Pierre-Louis: That live in the ocean. They're almost, like, glassine in structure ... Pierre-Louis: But we would never be able to know about them without, you know, advancements in imaging, functionally. He's best known to the layperson as the author of a book that, in English, the title is Art Forms in Nature, which is really the first arts-science crossover illustrated book bestseller ever. And it's still in print. He was using an optical microscope—the, the electron microscope had not been invented yet. Benson: He would've been envious, I think. Benson: I could look at radiolarians with a level of particularity that he could only dream of. But he did produce extraordinary work about radiolarians and many other organisms: diatoms, dinoflagellates … all kinds of things. [Flips to a page in Nanocosmos.] So this is a radiolarian from the equatorial Pacific. But look at the complexity there. And, you know, when it was fully intact and not partly damaged, it had a whole shell of this kind of latticework going on there [gestures to an image in the book]. And, you know, there—I write in the book about what all of these things are, we think, are doing, or at least to an extent: you know, what the—those radiating spines are all about. It's partly about flotation in the water column. Benson: Biological nature that I've seen. Pierre-Louis: And I think if we pop over here [Turns to another page] ... Benson: And diatoms are another class of single-celled organism, and, and they tend to be much more sleek, as you can see here. Benson: But they're tiny, little things, you know? It's just that there are billions of them. Benson: You see these long tendrils—you can see it from space, you know—of kind of greenish blooms in the water. The radiolarians are also—they distill silica from seawater and produce their, their shells from that. And under an optical microscope they look like glass. They have, they have symbiotic photosynthesis going on: algae living inside, producing energy. Like a pillbox, isn't it? This is a close view. I mean, this could be something in Istanbul, you know? [Flips back to the previous page.] Look at it—it's the same shape [laughs]. It's a little bit more beautiful ... Pierre-Louis: [Points to part of the image on the page]—yeah, it's almost, like, got lacing in there. And then we're gonna bounce forward again. Benson: Yep, so that's a dinoflagellate, and, and we were talking about them earlier. I mean, they are so strange. They are so beautiful to me. You have—usually, you have this sort of equatorial groove [Points to part of the image on the page] where one of the flagella coils around. And then you've got the—this, you know, polar opening here, where another flagella extends. They spin for stability, like a spacecraft might. And then they're propelled at the other end by this—another flagella, which shoots them forward. And they're just amazing things, you know. What are these guys up to? You know, there—I think that there's a tendency to think that, “Well, we're multicellular creatures, so a single cell must be a very simple thing.” Benson: You know, “'Cause we are complex, and we are made of many cells.” Well, it's not so simple. I mean, the single-celled organisms that have managed to survive and compete with each other and prosper in the sea are—have just as much evolutionary history as we do. I mean, you know, four point something billion years, right? Benson: Or three point something, yeah. I really should know that, but we don't, we don't know that—nobody knows that for sure. So they—they're very complex, and, you know, their survival strategies, their structural complexity is a result of the necessity to prosper, to go forth and prosper, you know? Benson: They had the same marching orders as Adam and Eve, I think, you know: “Go forth and prosper.” That's, that's life's principle. Benson: But, but the ones that are free-floating and competing with each other are particularly amazing. Pierre-Louis: It feels like, in this moment, it's really easy to be very cynical about everything, that there's a lot of weight and heft going on in the world ... Pierre-Louis: But hearing you talk about this book and this project, it seems like it reinforced your sense of wonder and ... Pierre-Louis: And I know that, you know, people have many emotions in looking at art, but it does feel like that if you—if people take away anything from your work, it should be kind of a sense of just how beautiful and weird and strange this world is. There's also a spiritual element here. You know, I'm not a believer in any kind of organized religion, but, but I'm awestruck by where we are, you know, and, and, and, and, and so there is a, you know, there's an element of, you know—I mean, okay, it sounds like a real cliche here—but communing or trying to understand, you know, “What is this? What is this project called life?” You know? Benson: And you're right, you know, it—we are living in times where, with a lot of help from algorithms and social media and certain toxic politicians and so forth, we are focusing on negative things, largely, and our—on ourselves. The human race, like any life-form, probably, is focused on its own self, you know, largely. But my work has been to, in, in a sense, turn my back on—at least the visual work—on, on the, on the human race ... I'm fascinated by the history of, of technology and science, and I have an opening essay in the book where I, where I trace the history of the microscope ... Pierre-Louis: Or at least that's what you want us to believe. Benson: Well, maybe we're all, maybe we're all aliens; that's another question. But in any, in any case it is about drawing the human gaze, ideally, away from our political squabbles, our social media, our—I don't know, you know, all of these things that are pretty banal, actually, when you look at it, or I would say so. Benson: And look at creatures and organisms and phenomena that, that have developed alongside us for the same length of time as we have, you know? That feels like a good place to end this conversation. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you for joining us today. Benson: Thank you very much for allowing me to expound on [Laughs], on my work.

Astrocytes play essential roles in the brain, and their dysfunction is associated with nearly every form of neurological disease. Despite their ubiquity, knowledge of how astrocytes contribute to disease pathogenesis is incomplete; accordingly, harnessing their biology toward therapeutics remains a major challenge. Here we show that the transcription factor Sox9 plays a context-specific role in maintaining astrocyte function and circuit activity in the aging hippocampus and Alzheimer's disease (AD) models. We found that Sox9 overexpression in astrocytes in AD models clears existing amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and preserves cognitive function. Mechanistically, Sox9 promotes the phagocytosis of Aβ plaques by astrocytes through the regulation of the phagocytic receptor MEGF10, which is sufficient to preserve cognitive function in AD models. Collectively, these studies highlight a role for astrocytic Sox9 during aging and AD while identifying Sox9−MEGF10 signaling as a prospective astrocyte-based therapeutic approach to ameliorate cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, recent research indicates that hot tubs may deliver more noticeable health benefits. Raising core body temperature through hot-water immersion can support several important physiological processes. Many of these effects continue even after the heating session ends. "We compared the most commonly utilized modalities of passive heating as they're used in everyday life and studied in scientific research," said study lead author Jessica Atencio, a doctoral student in the lab of Christopher Minson. These included body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output (the amount of blood the heart pumps per minute), immune cell levels and inflammation-related biomarkers. Measurements were taken before, during and after each type of heat exposure. This allowed the researchers to focus specifically on how each heat method affects a young, healthy population. "We saw that hot water immersion was the most impactful in increasing core body temperature, which is the main stimulus for these subsequent responses," Atencio said. "Increasing body temperature causes an increase in blood flow, and just the force of blood moving across your vessels is beneficial for your vascular health." When blood samples were analyzed, hot-water immersion was the only method that produced an inflammatory response as shown by increases in inflammatory cytokines and specific immune cell populations. "When you're submerged in water, the sweat mechanisms aren't efficient." Minson has spent more than twenty years studying the effects of heat exposure and how it relates to factors such as age, fitness level and illness. "There's no doubt in my mind that if people are willing to do some heat therapy, it's going to align with improved health, as long as it's done in moderation," Minson said. "If you repeat these stresses over time, our lab and many others have shown that they are consistent with improved health." He noted that exercise can offer similar or even greater advantages, but for people who cannot or prefer not to exercise, heat therapy may serve as an appealing alternative. "We want people to be smart and safe about it," he added. Then they'll be fine to do heat therapy." "We always say that exercise is the primary nonpharmacological treatment that people should be doing to promote health, but some people can't or just won't exercise," she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This device uses a specialized microneedle system that delivers a therapeutic molecule directly into damaged heart tissue, encouraging healing while limiting effects on the rest of the body. The biodegradable patch contains extremely small needles filled with microscopic particles carrying interleukin-4 (IL-4), a molecule recognized for its role in immune regulation. Huang and his colleagues reported their results in Cell Biomaterials, with funding from the National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association. "This patch acts like a bridge," said Huang, assistant professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Although this scarring helps maintain structural stability, it does not contract like healthy heart muscle. As a result, the remaining muscle must work harder over time, which can contribute to heart failure. Huang's team hopes their patch can interrupt this progression. This change can limit scar development and improve long-term outcomes. "They can either make inflammation worse or help the heart heal. "Systemic delivery affects the whole body," he said. According to Huang, these cells became more responsive to signals from surrounding tissues, particularly endothelial cells that line blood vessels. This improved communication may play an important role in longer-term recovery. "The cardiomyocytes weren't just surviving, they were interacting with other cells in ways that support recovery," he said. The team also found that the patch reduced inflammatory signals coming from endothelial cells, which can contribute to further heart damage. In addition, they detected increased activity in a pathway known as NPR1, which supports blood vessel health and overall heart function. At the moment, placing the patch requires open-chest surgery, but Huang hopes to create a less invasive method. He imagines a design that could be delivered through a small tube, making the treatment easier and more practical in clinical settings. Now we want to optimize the design and delivery." Huang is now partnering with Xiaoqing (Jade) Wang, assistant professor of statistics in the College of Arts and Sciences. Together they are developing an AI model that maps immune responses and helps guide future immunomodulatory therapeutic delivery. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.
