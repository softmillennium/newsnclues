            Police in Brazil swooped on the home and political headquarters of Jair Bolsonaro early Friday, searching the properties and ordering the former president to wear an electronic ankle tag.
    


            The right-winger and ally of US President Donald Trump was also barred from speaking to foreign officials or approaching embassies, and banned from social media, under orders of Brazil's Supreme Court.
    


            The restrictions were motivated by concerns that Bolsonaro would flee the country, amid his trial over an alleged plot to overturn the results of the 2022 presidential election, which he lost to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro has denied wrongdoing.
    


            Speaking outside the police station Friday, Bolsonaro called the ankle tag a “supreme humiliation” and said that he “never thought of leaving Brazil.”
    


            “The suspicions (of me leaving the country) are an exaggeration… damn it, I'm a former president of the republic – I'm 70 years old,” he said.
    


            Bolsonaro added that police seized “about 14,000 US dollars” and claimed the money was for personal use, adding he had the receipts to prove it.
    


            Hours after the ruling, the US State Department announced visa restrictions against Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes and an unspecified number of other court officials, accusing them of carrying out a “political witch hunt” against Bolsonaro.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement said he had “ordered visa revocations for Moraes and his allies on the court, as well as their immediate family members effective immediately.”
    


            Moraes made headlines last year when he banned social media platform X, during a feud with its billionaire owner – and former Trump ally – Elon Musk, over hate speech moderation and the company's failure to name a legal representative in the country, as required by law.  The platform has since been restored in the nation of 220 million people.
    


            Lula denounced Rubio's order in a Saturday morning statement on X, characterizing the visa revocation as an “unacceptable” interference in Brazil's justice system.
    


            Friday's raid came after Trump tried to force Lula to end the criminal trial against Bolsonaro, by threatening crippling tariffs on the country. Trump linked the tariff threat to what he described as a “witch hunt” trial against Bolsonaro.
    


            About a week later, the US launched an investigation into “unfair” trading practices by Brazil, according to a statement by the United States Trade Representative.
    


            Brazil's Supreme Court on Friday accused Bolsonaro and his son Eduardo of working with the US to impose the tariffs. CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment on this allegation.
    


            The court documents highlighted a confidential meeting Bolsonaro had with a US State Department official, and highlighted Trump's letter as an “offensive” and “clear threat” to Brazilian sovereignty.
    


            In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Bolsonaro denied that anyone lobbied the US to sanction Brazilian authorities working on his case.
    


            “There isn't any lobby to sanction an authority,” Bolsonaro said.
    


Speaking exclusively to CNN Thursday, Lula said that Trump's threats had broken from protocol, and argued that his predecessor's fate cannot be part of trade negotiations.
    


            “The judiciary branch of power in Brazil is independent. The president of the Republic has no influence whatsoever,” he said, adding that Bolsonaro “is not being judged personally. He is being judged by the acts he tried to organize a coup d'etat.”

            Lula added that Trump would be standing trial if the actions he took during the insurrection of January 6, 2021 had been committed in Brazil.
    


            On Friday, Trump posted a letter to Bolsonaro on Truth Social, in which he suggested the former Brazilian leader was the victim of an “unjust system,” and said that he would be “watching closely.”
    


            Bolsonaro posted Trump's letter on his official X account and, in a subsequent video, thanked Trump for his support with “eternal gratitude.”
    


            Bolsonaro had previously appeared to be preparing for the outcome of his trial and dismissed the idea that he might be considered a flight risk, saying: “I'll face the process.”
    


            “I'm not considering doing anything, I'm not considering anything, nothing at all,” he said, adding: “I'm not a criminal, the criminal is the one persecuting me.”
    


            Bolsonaro could face more than four decades behind bars if found guilty of masterminding the coup.
    


            He is among 34 people charged with five crimes, including attempting the coup. Part of the coup plot, prosecutors allege, involved a plan to potentially assassinate Lula, his vice president and a minister of the Supreme Court.
    


            Brian Winter, executive vice president of Americas Society and Council of the Americas, told CNN that Trump's mooted use of trade levers may not be so painful to Brazil – for which the US is not as significant a trading partner as, say, China.
    


            “Brazil only sends about 11% of its exports to the United States,” Winter said. “That's half what Brazil sends to China, and for some of Brazil's exports – not all, but for some of them – they can find other markets besides the United States.”
    


            “The question is, if this keeps escalating, could President Trump use measures that are even more painful, such as financial sanctions against large groups of people?” Winter asked, noting that Trump previously threatened, among other things, a travel ban on Colombian citizens during a disagreement with the Colombian government over migrant flights.
    


            “It's possible that President Trump could continue to escalate this in a way that could eventually produce considerably more pain for the Brazilian government and for the Brazilian people,” Winter said.

German authorities say at least 19 people were injured, four seriously, after a fireworks show went awry at a fair in the western city of Düsseldorf.
    


            Fire squad and emergency services deployed after the incident late Friday at the Rheinkirmes event along the Rhine river, where images from the scene showed fireworks going off nearly at ground level along its banks.
    


            A child was among the injured, the DPA news agency reported.
    


            Düsseldorf fire services said police were investigating the cause of the accident.
    


            “Our thoughts are with those affected and their families. We wish all those affected a speedy recovery from the consequences of the accident. We deeply regret the accident,” said Peter Dietlmaier, a spokesperson.
    


            Organizers ended the fair early for the day, and were deciding whether to continue the traditional fireworks at next year's event, he said.
    


            The 10-day fair features amusement park rides, drone and fireworks shows, and other entertainment by hundreds of staff along the left bank of the Rhine, opposite the city's historic district. The fair is organized by the St. Sebastianus Rifle Club, which traces its history to the year 1316.

US-made Patriot air defense systems, long hailed as a cornerstone of Western military aid to Ukraine, are now struggling to intercept advanced Russian ballistic missiles, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing sources.

One unnamed Ukrainian official told the outlet that Russian ballistic missiles have become more maneuverable, allowing them to evade Patriot radar detection. He did not clarify what type of missiles he was referring to.

Meanwhile, in light of the EU's efforts to wean itself from the American military-industrial complex amid uncertainty regarding continued US support for Ukraine, a next-generation European alternative is seeking to dethrone the Patriots, the report says.

The upgraded Samp/T missile system, developed by the Franco-Italian joint venture Eurosam, is being promoted as better suited to handle current threats and features a new radar that reportedly detects targets at a distance of more than 350km while being able to fire missiles in all directions, the paper notes.

The Samp/T also requires fewer operators, with the entire system able to run with as few as 15 people, compared to roughly 90 troops needed for a US Patriot battery, according to the WSJ.

Ukrainian forces have reportedly expressed concerns about Samp/T's performance. Nevertheless, an Italian defense official told the paper that the system had received “positive feedback” from Kiev.

On Monday, US President Donald Trump announced 17 Patriots were “ready to be shipped” to Ukraine, although his remark caused some confusion in Kiev as he did not clarify whether that number referred to full systems or their individual components.

Trump has also insisted on a scheme in which European NATO members would purchase US weapons for Ukraine. The EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, has welcomed his readiness to send Patriots but urged Washington “to share the burden” for the deliveries.

Russia has consistently condemned Western arms shipments to Ukraine, saying they only prolong the conflict without altering its outcome.

President Donald Trump has claimed that BRICS is “fading out fast,” while warning that any attempts by the group to challenge the US dollar will be met with a harsh economic backlash.

Speaking at the White House on Friday, Trump denounced what he called BRICS' attempts to weaken the dollar. “They wanted to try and take over the dollar, the dominance of the dollar... And I said, anybody that's in the BRICS consortium of nations, we're going to tariff you 10%.”

Trump stressed that Washington will spare no effort to preserve the dollar's hegemony. “The reserve currency is so important. You know, if we lost that, that would be like losing a World War.”

Washington “can never let anyone play games,” Trump said, adding that he has decided to “hit them [BRICS] very, very hard.” “If they ever really form in a meaningful way, it will end very quickly,” he said.

Trump also claimed his threat to impose 10% tariffs on imports from the BRICS had completely derailed the group's summit in Rio de Janeiro earlier this month. “They had a meeting the following day and almost nobody showed up,” he said.

However, the BRICS summit featured broad participation at the highest level. While China's President Xi Jinping was absent from the meeting, his country was represented by Chinese Premier Li Qiang. Russian President Vladimir Putin was also absent, but addressed the summit remotely.

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto, as well as leaders from Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE attended in person.

In October, Russia's Finance Minister Anton Siluanov stated that the share of national currencies in trade among BRICS countries has reached 65%, with the share of the dollar and euro plunging below 30%.

Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov explained that BRICS countries are exploring dollar alternatives “to shield themselves from US arbitrariness.” 

However, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has said that BRICS has never been meant as a rival to the US, although warning that “the language of threats and manipulation… is not the way to speak to members of this group.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Syria's interim leader Ahmad al-Sharaa have allegedly agreed to a US-supported ceasefire proposal, after the IDF carried out multiple airstrikes against the Defense Ministry in Damascus, ostensibly in defense of the Druze minority in southern Syria.

Special envoy Tom Barrack, who also serves as the US ambassador to Türkiye, credited American diplomacy under President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the “breakthrough” agreement in a statement posted on X on Friday.

“We call upon Druze, Bedouins, and Sunnis to put down their weapons and, together with other minorities, build a new and united Syrian identity in peace and prosperity with its neighbors,” Barrack wrote, adding that the ceasefire was “embraced” by Türkiye and Jordan.

BREAKTHROUGH —— Israeli Prime Minister @Netanyahu and Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa @SyPresidency supported by the U.S.A. @SecRubio have agreed to a ceasefire embraced by Türkiye, Jordan and its neighbors. We call upon Druze, Bedouins, and Sunnis to put down their weapons and…

The announcement follows a week of deadly clashes between Druze militias, Bedouin tribes, and central government forces in Sweida province – as well as a series of Israeli airstrikes targeting various locations, including the Defense Ministry in Damascus.

Since the fall of Bashar Assad's government, Israel has moved to expand its presence in Syria beyond the Golan Heights, citing a need to prevent hostile actors from entrenching near its borders. In a detailed statement on Thursday, Netanyahu said Israel had set two rules for Syria: the demilitarization of the region south of Damascus and the protection of the Druze community.

“Both those rules were broken by the regime in Damascus… I therefore directed the IDF to take powerful action,” Netanyahu stated. “As a result of that powerful action, a ceasefire came into force, and the Syrian forces retreated back to Damascus.”

Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is the former commander of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which seized control of Damascus last year. Since the upheaval, unaffiliated Islamists have reportedly carried out several massacres targeting Syria's minority communities, including the Alawites and Christians.

Amid reports of new atrocities against the Druze, al-Sharaa insisted that government forces had only been deployed to Sweida to stop the violence. In a televised address on Thursday, he announced a new deal with Druze factions – while accusing Israel of seeking to divide the Syrian people and turn Syria “into a battlefield of chaos.”

Despite past US designations of HTS and al-Sharaa as terrorist threats, Washington has increasingly backed the new leadership in Damascus and has moved to ease sanctions on Syria. Last month, Barrack even likened al-Sharaa's transition from militant leader to head of state to that of George Washington following the American Revolution.

DOHA, July 19. /TASS/. The Houthis delivered a missile strike on Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, using a hypersonic ballistic missile, the Yemeni rebel group's military spokesperson Yahya Saree said.

""Missile troops <…> conducted a unique military operation delivering a strike on Lod Airport (Ben Gurion Airport - TASS), using a Palestine-2 type hypersonic ballistic missile,"" Saree said in a statement broadcast by the Houthi-controlled television channel Al Masirah.

According to the rebels' spokesperson, the operation ""successfully achieved its objective."" As a result of the strike, he claimed, Israel's key airport suspended operations, and millions of Israelis ""were forced to run for shelter.""

On Friday evening, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a missile launched from Yemen had been intercepted. The sirens sounded in several areas in the Jewish state amid the missile threat.

After the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the Gaza Strip in 2023, the Houthis warned that they would launch strikes on Israeli territory while barring ships associated with the Jewish state from passing through the waters of the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait until Tel Aviv ceased its military operation against Palestinian group Hamas in the embattled enclave. The attacks stopped after a ceasefire was introduced in the Palestinian enclave in mid-January but the rebels warned they would resume strikes on Israeli vessels in the Red Sea after the ceasefire regime was breached in early March. Attempts to attack facilities on Israeli soil, including Ben Gurion Airport, have been made ever since.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Move by Marco Rubio is latest attempt by Trump administration to help former president avoid justice over alleged coup

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has reportedly stripped eight of Brazil's 11 supreme court judges of their US visas as the White House escalates its campaign to help the country's former president Jair Bolsonaro avoid justice over his alleged attempt to seize power with a military coup.

Bolsonaro, a far-right populist with ties to Donald Trump's Maga movement, is on trial for allegedly masterminding a murderous plot to cling to power after losing the 2022 election to his leftwing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro is expected to be convicted by the supreme court in the coming weeks and faces a jail sentence of up to 43 years.

As the day of judgment nears, Trump has been increasing pressure on the court and President Lula's administration. On 9 July, the US president announced he would impose 50% tariffs on all Brazilian imports as of 1 August, partly as a result of the supposed persecution of his ally. The move triggered an outpouring of nationalist anger in the South American country, with Lula describing it as “unacceptable blackmail”.

On Friday, after federal police raided Bolsonaro's house and fitted him with an electronic tag to stop him absconding, Rubio announced further moves in support of the defendant, who he claimed was the victim of a “political witch hunt”.

Writing on X, Rubio said he had ordered visa revocations for the judge leading the investigation into Bolsonaro, Alexandre de Moraes, as well as “his allies on the court” and their family members. Rubio did not name his other targets but the Brazilian newspaper O Globo identified them as Luís Roberto Barroso, José Antonio Dias Toffoli, Cristiano Zanin, Flávio Dino, Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha, Luiz Edson Fachin and Gilmar Ferreira Mendes.

Two other judges who were nominated to the court during Bolsonaro's 2019-23 presidency, André Mendonça and Kassio Nunes Marques, reportedly avoided the sanction, as did a third judge, Luiz Fux.

Lula denounced what he called “another arbitrary and completely groundless measure from the US government”.

“Interference in another country's justice system is unacceptable and offends the basic principles of national sovereignty and respect between nations,” the president said on Saturday, adding: “I'm certain that no kind of intimidation or threat – from whoever it may be – will compromise the most important mission of our nation's powers and institutions, which is to act permanently to defend and safeguard the democratic rule of law.”

The Trump strategist Alex Bruesewitz welcomed Rubio's announcement, calling Bolsonaro's treatment “sick and wrong”.

Bolsonaro's congressman son, Eduardo, thanked Rubio for his decision. “Thank you very much for this fight in favor of free speech, we do believe in the same values,” tweeted Eduardo, who has been living in the US since February and has reportedly been lobbying officials there over his father's plight.

Trump's interventions have appalled millions of Brazilians who hope to see their former leader held responsible for the alleged coup attempt, which culminated in the 8 January riots in Brasília.

Lula's institutional relations minister, Gleisi Hoffmann, called the visa cancellations “an aggressive and petty retaliation” and “an affront to the Brazilian judiciary and national sovereignty”.

Even influential rightwing voices have criticised the US's attempt to meddle in one of the world's most populous democracies by imposing 50% tariffs.

On Saturday, the conservative Estado de São Paulo newspaper described Trump's behaviour as “unacceptable external interference in Brazil's domestic matters”. “Trump has not only attacked our national sovereignty … [but also] stained the history of diplomatic relations between the two largest democracies in the Americas,” the newspaper's editorial board wrote.

While the Bolsonaros have hailed Trump's actions, they also appear to have grasped how the announcement of tariffs has backfired, allowing Lula to pose as a nationalist defender of Brazilian interests and paint the Bolsonaro clan as self-serving “traitors”.

Lula, who had been facing growing public disillusionment and an uphill battle to win re-election next year, has enjoyed a bounce in the polls since Trump launched his trade war, the brunt of which will be borne by coffee producers and cattle ranchers in Bolsonaro-voting regions, such as São Paulo.

Celso Rocha de Barros, a political columnist, said he suspected the Bolsonaros had been blindsided by the scale of Trump's attack.

“I think [Bolsonaro] wanted some kind of penalty - something he could use to say: ‘Look, Brazil's being punished because of Bolsonaro's persecution. But [the tariffs] went far too far … [they] screwed Bolsonaro's base,” said Rocha de Barros, pointing to their potential impact on agribusiness.

On Friday night, Bolsonaro's senator son, Flávio, post on X, calling on Trump to suspend the tariffs and replace them with individual sanctions. Soon after, however, he deleted the post.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Experts warn that the dangerous ideologically driven cuts at HHS will have long-term consequences for healthcare 

The Trump administration's “war on science” appears to have entered a new phase in the aftermath of a recent supreme court decision that empowered health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a prominent vaccine sceptic, and other agency leaders, to implement mass firings – effectively greenlighting the politicization of science.

The decision comes as Kennedy abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting of a key health care advisory panel, the US Preventive Services Task Force, earlier this month. That, combined with his recent removal of a panel of more than a dozen vaccine advisers, signals that his dismantling of the science-based policymaking at HHS is likely far from over.

“The current administration is waging a war on science,” warned Celine Gounder, a professor of medicine and an infectious disease expert at New York University in a keynote talk in May to graduates of Harvard's School of Public Health.

“Today we see rising threats to the public health institutions that have kept our world safe for generations,” she said, citing “cuts to research that benefits the lives of millions, looming public health emergencies that are not being addressed with the urgency they demand, and a continued coordinated attack on the very idea of the scientific process.”

Gounder added: “Over the past few months, we have seen the Trump administration engage not only in medical misinformation, but in active censorship of scientific discourse.”

Since he took the helm at HHS, Kennedy's unscientific views on vaccines and some other medical matters coupled with the agency's widespread research and staff cuts, have prompted protests from scientists inside and outside HHS plus lawsuits.

Medical experts say Kennedy's policies are helping “sow distrust in vaccines” as measles cases soar to a more than three decade high, hurt vital healthcare research with draconian cuts, and helped foment a Trump administration “war on science” mentality.

Kennedy sparked a firestorm in June by ousting 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends vaccines to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and votes to provide updates to its vaccine schedule. He then named a new eight person vaccine panel – half of whom share Kennedy's distrust of vaccines – who quickly retracted recommendations for flu vaccines containing an ingredient which many anti-vaxxers have falsely connected to autism.

That move sparked sharp criticism from veteran doctors with a national pediatric group, which opted to boycott its first meeting.

“Among the reasons we decided not to participate was because it clearly appeared to be an orchestrated effort to sow distrust in vaccines,” Sean O'Leary who chairs a committee on infectious diseases with the American Academy of Pediatrics, told the Guardian.

Dissent has also spread at the National Institutes of Health, where dozens of science researchers and other staff in June released a detailed document, dubbed the Bethesda Declaration, warning that key missions of the premiere research agency at HHS were being damaged by the Trump administration's budget cutting.

Even before these moves, prominent healthcare scholars were sounding loud alarms about some HHS policies and the administration's anti-science mentality – including its draconian budget cuts for research and staff cuts totaling over 10,000.

Gounder said there has been a “flood of Orwellian doublespeak from public health agencies”, contributing to declining vaccination rates and making Americans more susceptible to diseases like measles, which recently hit a level not seen since 2000 when measles was declared eliminated in the US.

Her critique has been amplified by public protests from healthcare experts troubled by its vaccine policies and large cuts to research and staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the NIH and other parts of HHS.

On a separate legal front, a Rhode Island federal court in July ruled against HHS and Kennedy and put a temporary stop to the drastic revamping of HHS and some of its staff cuts.

The ruling provided a court victory to a group of 19 Democratic state attorneys general, plus the District of Columbia, which in May sued Kennedy – plus other HHS leaders such as the FDA commissioner and the CDC's acting director – attacking the restructuring as an “unconstitutional and illegal dismantling” of the agency. Kennedy, they alleged, has “systematically deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job”.

The Rhode Island judge wrote that as members of the executive branch, Kennedy and the HHS do “not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress”.

For his part, Kennedy in March issued a statement defending the early HHS move to cut 10,000 full-time jobs: “We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”

Those jobs have since been cut, as of Monday 14 July, after an 8 July order from the supreme court that allowed the restructuring plans to proceed. Many employees who were supposed to be laid off during the agency's first round of 10,000 layoffs in April have been in limbo as the order made its way through the court system and later paused by federal judges. The reorganization, in addition to cutting staff, was supposed to consolidate the department's 28 divisions into 15 and cut regional offices from 10 to five.

Democrats in Congress too have voiced strong alarms about the thousands of HHS job cuts and their adverse impacts on healthcare and science.

Ten congressional Democrats led by congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, whose district is home to thousands of NIH and FDA workers, wrote to Kennedy in March demanding the rehiring of thousands of illegally fired workers, warning of the “harmful consequences” for patient healthcare and science research.

Raskin told the Guardian that Kennedy and the Trump administration's actions reveal a “complete disregard for the law making powers of Congress. Trump wants to be both the implementer of the laws and the legislative branch, but that is not his job. It's totally unconstitutional. They're trying to cut off funds that have been lawfully appropriated by Congress”.

O'Leary and many other medical experts warn that the dangerous ideologically driven cuts at HHS will have long-term consequences.

“What we're seeing across HHS is deeply concerning,” said O'Leary “NIH funding has never been politically or ideologically driven, but clearly that's what we're seeing now.

Move seeks to quell controversy that has engulfed the administration since it said it would not release more files from Epstein's sex trafficking case

Donald Trump said on Saturday that he had asked the justice department to release all grand jury testimony in Jeffrey Epstein's case. In a post on Truth Social, the president declared that even if the court gave its “full and unwavering support” that “nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics making the request”:

I have asked the Justice Department to release all Grand Jury testimony with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, subject only to Court Approval. With that being said, and even if the Court gave its full and unwavering approval, nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics making the request. It will always be more, more, more. MAGA!

While colleges and universities slow down during summer break, Ahniwake Rose is busy wondering what the fall semester will hold for the nation's 37 tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) – and if they will be able to stay open much longer.

As the president and CEO of the Indigenous non-profit American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), Rose (Cherokee and Muscogee Creek) braces as the schools she represents face a potential nearly 90% reduction in funding starting in October.

Donald Trump's fiscal year 2026 budget includes a proposal to slash operations funding from $183.3m to $22.1m for bureau of Indian education post-secondary programs – career and technical schools, community colleges, four-year colleges and universities. On 15 July, a House appropriations subcommittee approved legislation that allotted $1.5bn to the bureau of Indian education, though it did not specify how much would go toward post-secondary programs. Congress still needs to finish approving the budget for the bureau of Indian education, a subdivision of the Department of Interior.

Maryland's Democratic representative Jamie Raskin has joined in on public calls for the Donald Trump administration to release the entirety of the Jeffrey Epstein files, saying on X:

We don't need Trump or Bondi to sift through the stack and tell America what they think is ‘credible' in the Epstein files. Thanks, but no thanks—we'll decide ourselves. The president should stop playing us for fools and suckers. Release everything—now.

Raskin echoed similar sentiments on MSNBC, saying about the Trump administration:

Their policies are hurting our people and we've got to turn it around. And let's start by having some truth and clearing the air over this whole Epstein affair as quickly as possible.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Friday it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees. One union leader said the moves “will devastate public health in our country”.

The agency's office of research and development (ORD) has long provided the scientific underpinnings for the EPA's mission to protect the environment and human health. The EPA said in May it would shift its scientific expertise and research efforts to program offices that focus on major issues such as air and water.

The agency said on Friday it is creating a new office of applied science and environmental solutions that will allow it to focus on research and science “more than ever before”.

Once fully implemented, the changes will save the EPA nearly $750m, officials said.

Amid the buzz surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files, Donald Trump insisted on Saturday that the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have completely “obliterated” the sites.

Writing on TruthSocial, Trump said:

All three nuclear sites in Iran were completely destroyed and/or OBLITERATED. It would take years to bring them back into service and, if Iran wanted to do so, they would be much better off starting anew, in three different locations, prior to those sites being obliterated, should they decide to do so. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Trump's post comes after a new NBC report, which cited five current and former US officials familiar with a recent US assessment of the strikes, said that two of the three sites were not “as badly damaged”.

The news report, which was released on Thursday, added that two out of the three sites were “degraded only to a point where nuclear enrichment could resume in the next several months if Iran wants it to”.

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has reportedly stripped eight of Brazil's 11 supreme court judges of their US visas as the White House escalates its campaign to help the country's former president Jair Bolsonaro avoid justice over his alleged attempt to seize power with a military coup.

Bolsonaro, a far-right populist with ties to Donald Trump's Maga movement, is on trial for allegedly masterminding a murderous plot to cling to power after losing the 2022 election to his leftwing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro is expected to be convicted by the supreme court in the coming weeks and faces a jail sentence of up to 43 years.

As the day of judgment nears, Trump has been increasing pressure on the court and President Lula's administration. On 9 July, the US president announced he would impose 50% tariffs on all Brazilian imports as of 1 August, partly as a result of the supposed persecution of his ally. The move triggered an outpouring of nationalist anger in the South American country, with Lula describing it as “unacceptable blackmail”.

After years of heated attacks on the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, the Trump administration has begun suggesting recent costly renovations at the central bank's Washington DC buildings could justify firing Powell.

Donald Trump's antipathy for Powell stems mainly from the central bank boss's refusal to lower interest rates – something the president has repeatedly called for.

Recent comments from the supreme court suggested firing Powell could be unconstitutional, but that hasn't stopped the White House from getting creative.

Any move by the White House to formally dismiss the Fed chair would be unprecedented. The president has historically respected the independence of the central bank, and kept out of its way – even if there was disagreement over policy.

The Trump administration has decided to destroy $9.7m worth of contraceptives rather than send them abroad to women in need.

A state department spokesperson confirmed that the decision had been made – a move that will cost US taxpayers $167,000. The contraceptives are primarily long-acting, such as IUDs and birth control implants, and were almost certainly intended for women in Africa, according to two senior congressional aides, one of whom visited a warehouse in Belgium that housed the contraceptives. It is not clear to the aides whether the destruction has already been carried out, but said they had been told that it was set to occur by the end of July.

“It is unacceptable that the state department would move forward with the destruction of more than $9m in taxpayer-funded family planning commodities purchased to support women in crisis settings, including war zones and refugee camps,” Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic senator from New Hampshire, said in a statement. Shaheen and Brian Schatz, a Democratic senator from Hawaii, have introduced legislation to stop the destruction.

“This is a waste of US taxpayer dollars and an abdication of US global leadership in preventing unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and maternal deaths,” added Shaheen, who in June sent a letter to the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, about the matter.

The department decided to destroy the contraceptives because it could not sell them to any “eligible buyers”, in part because of US laws and rules that prohibit sending US aid to organizations that provide abortion services, counsel people about the procedure or advocate for the right to it overseas, according to the state department spokesperson.

The “Make America Great Again” (Maga) base is in revolt as never before. The trigger was Donald Trump's broken promise to publicly release details about Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier and convicted sex offender, who was facing federal charges of sex-trafficking minors when he died in jail in 2019.

Spurred by the president and his allies, Trump's movement has long latched on to the Epstein scandal, claiming the existence of a secret client list and that he was murdered in his cell as part of a cover-up. But last week the justice department and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced there was no evidence that the disgraced financier kept such a list or was blackmailing powerful figures.

Far from closing the case, the memo deepened supporters' obsession and sense of grievance. A movement defined by the view that elites rig the system against them felt cheated. Trump made efforts to douse the flames with ever-shifting explanations, excuses and distractions but merely poured fuel on the fire.

To some, his erratic and evasive behaviour implies a guilty secret. It also evokes a line from President John F Kennedy's 1961 inaugural address: “Those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.” Having spent years embracing QAnon-tinged propaganda that casts him as the only saviour who can demolish the “deep state”, Trump is now seen as co-opted by its corrupt bureaucracy.

Brazil's judiciary will not be intimidated by a US decision to target officials involved in the trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro with visa bans, a senior judicial official said late on Friday, criticising the move as arbitrary, according to Reuters.

In an escalation of tensions between US President Donald Trump and the government of Latin America's largest economy, Washington imposed visa restrictions on Friday on supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes, his family and other unnamed court officials. The visa bans were a response to the supreme court's decision to issue search warrants and restraining orders targeting Trump ally Bolsonaro, who is accused of plotting a coup to overturn the results of a 2022 election he lost.

Solicitor general Jorge Messias, the top judicial official for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's executive branch, said in a statement posted on X that prosecutor general Paulo Gonet was also targeted by the ban. “Rest assured that no improper manoeuvre or sordid conspiratorial act will intimidate our country's judiciary in the independent and dignified exercise of its task,” he added.

According to Reuters, Messias said the Brazilian officials were subject to “arbitrary acts of visa revocation by a foreign nation on account of their fulfilment of their legitimate institutional responsibilities in accordance with constitutional terms”.

In addition to Moraes, seven other justices from Brazil's 11-member supreme court were also hit by the US visa restrictions, government institutional relations minister Gleisi Hoffmann said on Friday. They include justices Luís Roberto Barroso, Dias Toffoli, Cristiano Zanin, Flávio Dino, Cármen Lúcia, Edson Fachin, and Gilmar Mendes.

The prosecutor general's office and the supreme court did not immediately respond to Reuter's requests for comment.

Trump has criticised the proceedings against Bolsonaro as a “witch-hunt”, a term he has used to describe his own treatment by political opponents, and has called for the charges to be dropped. In a letter last week, he announced a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods starting 1 August, opening the message with criticism of the trial.

Bolsonaro is on trial before Brazil's supreme court on charges of plotting a coup to stop Lula from taking office in January 2023. Bolsonaro has denied that he led an attempt to overthrow the government but has acknowledged taking part in meetings aimed at reversing the election's outcome.

Cpt Adam VanGerpen, public information officer for the Los Angeles fire department told ABC that people inside the club came out to help in the minutes before emergency crews arrived to help the victims, after a vehicle drove into a crowd along Santa Monica Boulevard in East Hollywood.
 According to the Associated Press (AP), he said:

They were all standing in line going into a nightclub. There was a taco cart out there, so they were … getting some food, waiting to go in. And there's also a valet line there. The valet podium was taken out, the taco truck was taken out, and then a large number of people were impacted by the vehicle.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

SINGAPORE — Ichika Kajimoto became the first-ever Japanese to capture a world title in open water swimming, taking the gold in the women's 3-kilometer knockout sprint on Saturday at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore.

Kajimoto finished first in the 500-meter final in the event that was added to the world championships program for the first time. Italy's Ginevra Taddeucci finished second, while Australia's Moesha Johnson and Hungary's Bettina Fabian tied for the bronze.

Kajimoto had finished second behind Taddeucci in their 1,500-meter preliminary heat, then second again behind Johnson in the 1,000-meter semifinals.

The victory came a day after Kajimoto won the bronze medal in the 5-kilometer open water race. On Wednesday, she placed eighth in the 10-kilometer event.

Kajimoto's journey in Singapore will not be limited to the outdoor competition. She also plans to compete in the pool in the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-meter freestyle events.

Editor's Note: This story has been updated with new details about the attack.

Cyber specialists from Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) carried out a large-scale cyberattack against the network infrastructure of Russian energy giant Gazprom, causing significant disruptions, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent on July 18.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Gazprom and Russian authorities have not publicly commented on the reported incident.

The alleged operation took place on July 17 and targeted systems used by Gazprom and its subsidiaries, which Ukraine's intelligence claims are directly involved in supporting Russia's war effort. 

Gazprom is Russia's state-owned energy company, one of the world's largest gas producers and exporters.

The cyberattack allegedly destroyed large volumes of data and installed custom software designed to further damage the company's information systems.

""The degradation of Russian information systems to the technological Middle Ages continues,"" the source within the HUR told the Kyiv Independent. 

""We congratulate Russian 'cyber specialists' on this new achievement and recommend they gradually replace their mice and keyboards with hammers and pincers.""

According to the source, access to Gazprom's internal systems was disabled for nearly 20,000 system administrators, and backup copies of key databases were wiped. The attack reportedly affected approximately 390 subsidiary companies and branches, including Gazprom Teplo Energo, Gazprom Obl Energo, and Gazprom Energozbyt.

In a later message on July 19, the source provided additional details on what was destroyed. 

""As a result of the cyber operation, the corporation's records of contracts, schedules, and tariffs were destroyed, including data on who and how much gas/oil should be supplied, data on payments, taxes, Gazprom's financial balances, information on the corporation's licenses and legal agreements."" 

Data for systems that manage pressure, costs, gas and oil balances, and data on Gazprom's wells and networks were also destroyed, the source added. 

The source provided a video and screenshots that appeared to show access deep within the Russian databases, though the Kyiv Independent could not verify the authenticity of the evidence. 

Hundreds of terabytes of data were downloaded by the Ukrainian hackers prior to their deletion from the Russian systems, the source said. 

The sources said the attackers managed to destroy clusters of ""extremely powerful"" servers running 1C, a software widely used for managing documents and contracts, analytics data for pipelines, valves, pumps, and SCADA systems — key elements in operating Gazprom's technical infrastructure. 

Multiple servers reportedly had operating systems removed or disabled, and the BIOS (basic firmware) of many devices was damaged, making them inoperable without physical repairs.

President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 19 announced the updated composition of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, following the country's latest government reshuffle. While most members remain the same, one notable change is the appointment of Rustem Umerov as the council's new secretary.

A new initiative will examine how the Ukrainian language describes foreign locations while at home, with the aim of standardizing and promoting a Ukrainian spelling, said Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.

Pavlohrad, a city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast that has become a key humanitarian aid hub for those evacuating the front lines, suffered one of its most severe attacks of the war, Governor Serhii Lysak said on July 19. 

In what could be one of the last visits by journalists to Pokrovsk, the Kyiv Independent spent 24 hours in the front-line city, embedded with a drone team of Ukraine's 68th Jaeger Brigade.

At least one person was killed and three were injured as a fire engulfed a residential building amid a Russian drone attack on Odesa overnight on July 19.

Russian strikes killed at least seven people and injured 31 others in multiple regions over the past 24 hours, Ukrainian regional authorities said on July 19.

The cyberattack allegedly destroyed large volumes of data and installed custom software designed to further damage the company's information systems.

Russia has lost 1,040,950 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on July 19.

Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on July 18 signed an order withdrawing Moscow from a military technical cooperation agreement with Germany amid strained relations between the two countries.

The ""Darts"" twin-engine strike drone is capable of traveling over 40 kilometers (25 miles) and carries a payload of 12-14 kilograms as opposed to the company's pre-existing single engine drone which can handle a maximum of 8 kilograms.

Russian air defense units intercepted 13 drones flying towards Moscow in under two hours, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reported at around 1:46 a.m. local time on July 19.

The U.S. will send its next Patriot system to Germany rather than Switzerland, in order to speed up Berlin's shipment of two Patriot batteries to Ukraine,  officials said. 

The tanks were promised to Kyiv in October 2024, but delivery was reportedly delayed due to resistance from the U.S. The remaining tanks will arrive ""in the coming months.""

""I will be looking for a person to lead this area,"" First Deputy Prime Minister and Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov wrote.

A fireworks accident at Düsseldorf's city fair has injured 19 people, four seriously, after rockets veered into the crowd. Meanwhile, the German Red Cross says the country lacks basic crisis training. Join DW for more.

A fireworks show at the Düsseldorf city fair, the Rheinkirmes, had to be cut short after 19 people were injured — four of them seriously — when rockets flew too close to the crowd.

Emergency crews have said at least one child was hurt, as videos and witnesses showed fireworks exploding unusually low.

In other news, Germany's Red Cross warns that the population is lacking in people with skills to deal with major emergencies, while German media responds to the latest deportation flight to Afghanistan.

Here's a roundup of the latest news, backgrounders and analysis from Germany on Saturday, July 19.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Saturday honored the Central Council of Jews in Germany for its role in society on the 75th anniversary of its founding.

""Jewish life is a part of us,"" wrote Merz on the messaging platform X, adding that the organization reminds everyone in the country of something ""that should be obvious: Germany must be a safe space for Jews."" 

Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier also honored the day, saying that he was ""deeply thankful"" that the organization's first leaders had determined to ""rebuild Jewish life in Germany in the aftermath of the Shoah [Hebrew for catastrophe, refers to the Holocaust, the ed.].""  

Steinmeier said that beyond not letting Germany forget the crimes of its Nazi past and fighting antisemitism, the Central Council of Jews in Germany served as ""an important driving force behind the democratic development of German society after 1945."" 

The institution, which functions as Germany's main political, societal and religious representative for Jews in the country, was founded on July 19, 1950, in Frankfurt — just five years after the end of World War II and the industrial-scale murder of more than six million European Jews at the hands of Germany's Nazi dictatorship.  

Today the council comprises some 105 communities and associations, and 100.000 individual members.

A majority of Germans have opposed banning the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), according to a new poll.

The survey by the Allensbach Institute, published Saturday by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, found that 52% of respondents reject a ban on the party, while 27% support it. In eastern Germany, two-thirds of those surveyed said they were against such a move.

According to the researchers, one key reason is that many Germans know AfD supporters personally. In the West, 67% said they had AfD sympathizers in their social circles; in the East, that figure rose to 88%. While 54% of respondents described the AfD as far-right, only 5% viewed their acquaintances who back the party in the same way.

Another factor behind the opposition to a ban is mistrust toward the parties advocating it. Many respondents suspect those parties are mainly trying to eliminate a political rival that has grown too strong.

The idea of a ban is divisive within Germany's governing coalition. The center-left Social Democratic Party voted unanimously at its June 29 party congress to prepare proceedings and called for a federal-state working group. The center-right Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union has pushed back, citing steep legal hurdles and urging a focus on political argument.

Two parties have been banned in (West) Germany, an openly neo-Nazi party in 1952 and the Communist Party (KPD) in 1956.

Around half of eligible voters in Germany have said they agree with the federal government's view that Russia poses a danger to the country, according to a new YouGov poll for Germany's DPA news agency.

The survey found that 13% see a very serious military threat from Moscow, while 36% consider it a significant one. By contrast, 30% say Russia poses only a minor threat, and 14% see no threat at all.

The divide is sharp along political party lines. Among supporters of the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, center-left Social Democrats, and the Greens, 58–62% view Russia as a major or very serious threat.

About one-third of these party groups see little or no danger.

The picture flips among far-right Alternative for Germany voters, where 65% say there is little or no military threat from Russia, while 29% see one.

Among supporters of the populist left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, only 33% see a threat, while 51% do not.

Supporters of the socialist Left party are evenly split — 48% see a threat, 47% do not.

German consumers are paying more for meat — and prices are still climbing this summer. 

And while retail costs rise, producers of Germany's favorite meat, pork, face falling returns.

According to the Agricultural Market Information Company (AMI) in Bonn, average discount supermarket prices for a 400-gram pack of minute steaks increased by 30 cents in early July, from €3.49 to €3.79 ($4.06 to $4.41). The price for coarse pork sausages rose from €2.59 to €2.89, and a 550-gram pack of chicken schnitzel went up 30 cents to €6.26.

Meat and meat product prices have steadily risen in recent years. The Federal Statistical Office reports that, by June, they were on average 31.7% higher than in 2020.

Poultry had risen by more than 45%, and minced beef by over 68%. The German Meat Industry Association cites several causes: general inflation, rising feed costs, wage increases, and energy policy impacts.

Beef has become scarcer in Germany. According to the industry association, more farms are ending cattle production, citing regulatory pressure and uncertainty about future farming standards. The result has been shrinking herds.

Meanwhile, poultry consumption is rising.

German media have begun scrutinizing the government's latest deportation flights to Afghanistan, questioning whether the men truly fit the label of dangerous criminals.

One of the 81 men deported on Friday was Haroon I., 27, who was escorted from a facility in Pforzheim under heavy police presence late on Thursday.

Footage of the scene, obtained by Die Zeit, shows the emotional moment.

The report said the man was a convicted cannabis dealer who had already served his sentence. People close to him say he had been rebuilding his life and was well on his way to integrating into German society.

Die Zeit said that Haroon had strong German, was living with his partner, a German woman, had a job and was a member of his community. He also had little connection to Afghanistan with most of his family having left the country.

The convoy was guarded by police in balaclavas who kept back friends and supporters.

Pforzheim was one of the departure points for the new round of deportations to Afghanistan ordered by Germany's centrist coalition. A plane carrying the men left Leipzig airport early on Friday.

The government has said it is delivering on a campaign pledge to deport people to Afghanistan and Syria, starting with criminals and people posing a perceived risk.

After the deportations, the United Nations said no one should be returned to Afghanistan, regardless of their legal status.

A fireworks display at the Düsseldorf Rheinkirmes — a type of town fair — has left 19 people injured, including four seriously.

Emergency services confirmed the injuries late Friday after fireworks reportedly exploded unusually close to the ground. According to police, at least one child was among the injured. 

Eyewitnesses told German public broadcaster WDR that some rockets flew sideways or detonated low, with a few even landing in the Rhine River. One video from across the river shows explosions lighting up both the sky and ground at the same time.

""I was at the fair watching the fireworks,"" said one witness. ""Some rockets flew surprisingly low and exploded close to people. I wondered if that wasn't too near the crowd.""

Fire officials believe some rockets may have veered off course, with one misfiring directly into the crowd.

Organizers initially kept the fair running to avoid panic but ended festivities early around 10:45 p.m. (2045 GMT). The event had been scheduled to continue into the early morning.

The Rheinkirmes fair, the biggest to take place on the river, is rooted in an annual celebration of the city's patron saint Apollinaris. It started on July 11 and is set to end on Sunday.

Germany has been falling short on preparing its population for major emergencies, according to the German Red Cross (DRK).

Millions of people need training in first aid and self-reliance, said Heike Spieker, head of the DRK's National Relief Society.

 ""To build these skills sustainably, four million people would need to be trained,"" she said. That level of preparedness would ensure people could help themselves and others during a crisis.

The courses, supported by federal funding and offered by aid groups, go beyond first aid. According to the Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance, they cover how to act when power goes out or flooding follows heavy rain.

To reach a ""reasonable level"" within five years, around 800,000 people would need training each year, Spieker said.

""In reality, current funding covers an average of fewer than 100,000 participants per year,"" she added.

She also criticized the government's current budget plans, saying they are ""absolutely insufficient and contradict the political promises to strengthen civil protection.""

The EU will impose a moving price cap on Russian oil, among other measures, in a bid to shrink Russia's economy. The bloc hopes the latest sanctions package will urge Russia toward a ceasefire with Ukraine.

The European Union has adopted a new set of sanctions against Russia in the hopes of restricting its ability to wage war in Ukraine. 

The EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was ""striking at the heart of Russia's war machine,"" and will keep up the pressure on Russia until a ceasefire is agreed.

The EU sanctioned Russia's energy, banking and military sectors in a slew of measures that France's top diplomat hailed as ""unprecedented.""

The EU has set a dynamic price cap on Russian oil — at 15% below the average market value — from $60 [€51.49] to $47.6 [€40.85].

The bloc has banned all future transactions via both Nord Stream pipelines and introduced an import ban on refined petroleum products made from Russian crude oil and processed in a third country.

It has banned 22 more Russian banks and more than a hundred non-EU shipping vessels that comprise a part of Russia's so-called shadow fleet, tankers that operate outside of standard international maritime regulations.

More than two dozen entities have been subjected to tighter export restrictions over supplying Russia with dual-use technologies that serve civilian but also military purposes. At least seven of these are Chinese, three are from Hong Kong and four based in Turkey.

The sanctions have effectively ""killed"" the Nord Stream pipelines, said Ben McWilliams, an affiliate fellow in the field of energy and climate policy with the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank.

Nord Stream pipelines run from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea.

McWilliams said that a series of underwater explosions had damaged the pipelines back in September 2022 and yet there were discussions around the possibility of reviving them in Germany. 

These sanctions make that much harder, he added.

""This is a very important clause. Anybody could have imported [oil] from Nord Stream, there was nothing to stop them,"" he told DW. ""But now there is a ban, which means in any future scenario, whatever the politics of the day looks like, a decision to lift the ban would have to be taken at the Union level,"" with all member states in agreement. 

""The ban on imports of petroleum products from third countries if refined from Russian oil was also quite significant,"" he added.

In alignment with this measure, the EU has sanctioned one of India's main refineries of Russian oil. 

""For the first time, we're designating a flag registry and the biggest Rosneft refinery in India,"" the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas posted.

Jakob Kirkegaard, Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute For International Economics [PIIE], said he suspected Russia was selling more than half of its oil exports via the shadow fleet.

As Russia faces a lower price cap for its oil, he said, it may now be encouraged to sell more via the shadow fleet which allows it to escape the price cap and is harder to chase on the high seas.

""Unless Baltic sea countries say we won't accept any such ship crossing through our waters, and just confiscate them,"" Kirkegaard said, enforcement of sanctions remains weak.

But seizing ships has its own issues and could be seen as a ""violation of freedom of navigation in international waters and could set a precedent,"" that could be misused by other countries.

""Then of course there is the fear that Russia might retaliate militarily.""

Moreover, experts argued that banning one Indian oil refinery exporting refined petroleum products was insufficient.

""The way India has been buying Russian fuel at cheaper prices I would assume many Indian refineries are refining Russian oil and exporting it to the EU,"" added Kirkegaard.

They said once these refined petroleum products, such as diesel, arrive from India to Europe, it was impossible to trace their origin.

In the wake of ongoing talks on an EU-India free Trade Agreement [FTA], Kirkegaard added, the EU would have taken New Delhi into confidence before imposing the sanction.

""I don't think it is going to be such a big deal, frankly. It will probably annoy the Indians. But will it lead to some big crisis between India and the EU? I would be skeptical.""

All eyes in the EU are now on Washington.

They are hoping President Trump delivers on his threat of imposing a 100% tariff on any country that is trading with Russia if there is no peace deal in 50 days, Trump's new timeline.

""The EU paved the way. Now it's time for perfect storm — the US Senate to vote on that Russia sanctions bill imposing crushing burdens on Russian economy and those fueling Russia's war of aggression,"" Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kęstutis Budrys posted on X.

No one believes thatEuropean sanctionsare enough to change Russian President Putin's war calculus and end Russian aggression in Ukraine.

But they can limit Russia's ability to inflict war on others over time. ""What these sanctions essentially amount to, is weakening Russia economically  over the longer run,"" he added. ""Russia is the main military threat to the EU, and that's what the EU needs, a weaker Russia.""","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

The US transport safety body said investigations into the Air India 171 crash in Ahmedabad will take time. It expressed support for India's investigating body AAIB.

The United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Friday that media reports on the reasons behind the Air India Boeing Dreamliner crash which killed 270 were speculative and premature. 

 India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which is investigating the accident, had released a preliminary report last week which raised questions about the engine fuel cutoff switches.

Since the report came out, there have been several media reports speculating over the cause of the crash in Indian and Western media, pointing to a possible pilot error. The report itself has been condemned for not providing enough information.

The NTSB is an investigative agency that investigates civil transportation accidents.

""Recent media reports on the Air India 171 crash are premature and speculative. India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau just released its preliminary report. Investigations of this magnitude take time,"" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in a statement shared on X.

According to the AAIB report, in the blackbox voice recording , ""one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff,"" and the other pilot ""responded that he did not do so.""

First officer Clive Kunder was believed to be flying the plane while Captain Sumeet Sabharwal was monitoring, hence it has been assumed that his hands were free to toggle with the fuel switch. 

The switches were restored 10 seconds later but the plane crashed, having already lost thrust. 

The report did not clarify what caused the engine fuel to cut off.

Some media reports and aviation experts have speculated that Sabharwal could have been suicidal and intentionally switched off the fuel.

The AAIB had condemned western media reports for being ""irresponsible"" and drawing conclusions ""through selective and unverified reporting,"" Times of India reported.

The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) sent legal notices to the Wall Street Journal and Reuters, saying the findings were ""neither substantiated by the official investigation nor endorsed by any competent authority,"" newspaper The New Indian Express said.

India's Civil Aviation Minister Kinjarapu Ram Mohan Naidu urged the press and people not to ""jump to conclusions"" and wait for the final report.

This comes less than two weeks after Trump signed into law the largest Medicaid cuts in US history.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

The Trump administration on Thursday said it will restrict waivers that have allowed states to keep kids enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program beyond the 12-month period of continuous coverage required under federal law.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), led by Mehmet Oz, announced the move on Thursday, saying that it has informed states of a “clear shift away from policies that extend beyond statutory limits,” specifically restricting Section 1115 waivers that have been sought and approved in dozens of states across the U.S.

“CMS will allow currently approved initiatives to run out their course but does not anticipate extending them nor approving new waivers,” the agency said in a statement, which came less than two weeks after President Donald Trump signed into law the largest Medicaid cuts in U.S. history.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, called the CMS announcement a “terrible development” and “yet one more awful example of the Trump administration's obsession with making it as hard as possible for Americans to access the healthcare they are eligible for.”

In 2022, Oregon became the first state in the nation to receive federal approval to provide children with continuous Medicaid coverage from birth up to age 6 through a Section 1115 waiver. The policy was described as a “ground-breaking initiative” that would “help infants and young children get off to a healthy start in life without parents having to worry about renewing their Medicaid coverage annually,” regardless of temporary changes to family income or other factors.

The CMS announcement points to the Oregon policy without explicitly naming the state. Oregon's federal waiver is set to expire in 2027.

Wyden said Thursday that “the Trump administration will stop at nothing to rip coverage away from American families, even kids they claim they want to protect.”

Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families, wrote that “in the name of ‘protecting vulnerable Americans,' the Trump administration will rip away Medicaid coverage from babies and toddlers.”

CMS insisted that the newly announced changes are aimed at protecting Medicaid's finances by ensuring that those who are no longer eligible for the program are removed.

But Amaya Diana, a policy analyst at the health research organization KFF, wrote Thursday that “not everyone who loses coverage at renewal is no longer eligible.”

“During the unwinding of the [pandemic-era] Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, seven in 10 Medicaid enrollees who lost coverage were disenrolled for procedural reasons,” Diana noted. “While some were no longer eligible, others lost coverage due to barriers such as communication issues.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

The masked, plainclothes ICE agents terrorizing immigrant communities are indistinguishable from racist vigilantes. 

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

For weeks, unidentifiable men and women wearing neck gaiters, mismatched camouflage attire, gloves and baseball caps have stood outside hearing rooms at the federal immigration courthouse in Lower Manhattan. They block stairwells and elevators, waiting for immigrants to leave mandatory court appointments, before handcuffing them and taking them to processing centers. Family members may wait days before finding out where their loved ones are being held — or if they're even still in the country. 

As U.S. immigration officials seek to arrest more than a million people this year, an army of plainclothes law enforcement agents has dispersed across the country. They arrive in unmarked vehicles while only their eyes peek out from a balaclava. Their bulletproof vests may identify them as “police” or a “federal agent” but often offer no hint as to their agency or division. They arrest workers at grocery stores and car washes and detain people near churches. They've been recorded smashing a car window to detain an asylum seeker, blamed for breaking doors and accused of intimidating reporters.

For undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers, the specter of an arrest lurks behind every trip outside. For people in these communities, the fear of being quickly deported is now accompanied by a new concern: that they may be kidnapped by individuals pretending to be law enforcement officers. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Legal experts, federal legislators and immigration activists told Truthout that by concealing their identities, immigration enforcement personnel have created fertile ground for impersonators to endanger the general public by posing as law police or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

“It's creating a lot of fear, of not knowing who these people are, of suddenly people approaching you to tell you and asking your name and your immigration status on the screen when they don't even have identification,” Rufina Reyes, the director of Washington-based grassroots organization La Resistencia, told Truthout while speaking through an interpreter. “Without any ID, without anything that can accredit them that they are legitimate, we could be exposed to a possible kidnapping, and that's basically what's happening.”

In February, a South Carolina man was charged with kidnapping, impersonating a law enforcement officer and other crimes after video footage emerged of him confronting a Latino driver and telling the man he was going to be sent back to Mexico. In April, a man was arrested in Florida after allegedly pulling in front of a vehicle and demanding the identification and immigration status of two men. The same month, a Florida woman was arrested after allegedly kidnapping her ex-boyfriend's wife while wearing a t-shirt that said “ICE,” referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and covering her face with a mask. In early June, a man posing as an ICE agent in Philadelphia reportedly robbed an automobile shop, zip-typing a woman in the process and saying that he “was going to take undocumented employees into custody.” Less than a week later, a man allegedly disguised as law enforcement fatally shot Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, her husband and their dog.

In recent weeks, immigration officers' deployment of face coverings has emerged as a focus for legislators across various levels of government, who have argued that their widespread use allows immigration personnel to act as an unaccountable secret police force. As agencies including the FBI and IRS assist with immigration enforcement operations, legal rights organizations have argued that the inability to identify agents poses problems for oversight.

“We would normally be trying to follow a paper trail and verify that paper trail against what we actually see happening on ground, and can't do that if you don't even know who is who is doing what,” Naureen Shah, director of government affairs for the equality division of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told Truthout.

In response, Democrats have begun introducing bills to ensure that federal immigration agents are clearly identifiable.

“We need to bring a national standard to ICE agents, and we need to bring transparency and accountability,” Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-New York), told Truthout. Velázquez introduced federal legislation in June to prohibit ICE agents from wearing facial coverings and mandate that agents have clothes displaying their name and affiliation with ICE while making arrests. “If we accept, as Americans, this kind of secrecy and abuse against immigrants, it's only a matter of time before it is used against American citizens too.”

That has already happened.

On July 2, the ACLU of Southern California and other legal organizations filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of immigration raids around Los Angeles. The legal claim noted that “numerous U.S. citizens who work, reside, or just happen to be in neighborhoods with large numbers of people of color” are “also getting swept up.” The same day, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund demanded the federal government pay $1 million in damages to a U.S. citizen who was detained by federal immigration officers at a Home Depot.

For years, legal organizations have argued that the deceptive tactics used by ICE agents to make arrests violate the Fourth Amendment. ICE agents have long represented themselves as local police officers or pretended to be delivery workers by carrying fake business emblems, according to training materials obtained by the Immigrant Defense Project in 2014. The organization has said that ICE's use of ruses has escalated since 2017.

But historians and law enforcement experts say the current omnipresent use of face coverings is a departure from longstanding practices by federal law enforcement conducting immigration operations.

Despite the legal efforts to rein in their tactics, ICE personnel have vast authority. They can conduct arrests without a warrant. They can carry out operations in areas of private businesses that are considered publicly accessible, like a restaurant dining area. They don't have to offer badge numbers or names, though they are supposed to identify themselves as an “immigration officer” after an arrest is made.

From California to New York, stories have emerged of agents refusing to state their agency affiliation while carrying out operations. In June, footage emerged of ICE agents on Long Island detaining a Hispanic U.S. citizen. Elzon Lemus, who was pulled over while driving to work, said that the agents refused to say what agency they represented even as he sat handcuffed on the street. On the other side of the country, ICE personnel arrested U.S. citizen Andrea Velez, accusing her of assaulting a federal officer. Velez said that she did not assault an officer and was racially profiled, and that the people who arrested her didn't identify themselves. 

These tactics prompted furious outcry from Democratic politicians, who have compared ICE's actions to those used by authoritarian regimes and extremist groups. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said that she “will never accept these unlawful and chaotic raids.” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu compared ICE agents to NSC-131, a New England-based neo-Nazi group. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Donald Trump was using federal immigration officers as a “modern-day Gestapo.”

“The KKK would mask themselves,” Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-New York) told Truthout during a phone call. 

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE have balked at these comparisons and framed calls to unmask agents as attempts to endanger the lives of the armed federal officers that rove in large groups. Agency officials have argued that facial coverings help protect officers.

“Every day the men and women of ICE put their lives on the line to protect and defend the lives of American citizens. Make no mistake, Democrat politicians like Hakeem Jeffries, Mayor Wu of Boston, Governor Tim Walz, and Mayor [Karen] Bass of Los Angeles are contributing to the surge in assaults of our ICE officers through their repeated vilification and demonization of ICE,” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in an email sent to Truthout via a spokesperson. “From comparisons to the modern-day Nazi gestapo to glorifying rioters, the violent rhetoric of these sanctuary politicians is despicable. This violence against ICE must end.”

In response to a query sent by Truthout, the agency claimed that assaults against ICE law enforcement have risen 700 percent, but did not provide details about how that figure was calculated or how many people have been charged for the alleged assaults. They also did not say if instances like the arrest of New York City Comptroller Brad Lander — who was arrested in June and accused of assaulting a law enforcement official after he tried to escort a migrant past agents seeking to detain him — counted toward that number. Others have noted that an increase in confrontations between officers and protesters is not surprising given the dramatic rise in encounters between ICE and the public under the Trump administration as officers seek to conduct 3,000 arrests per day to meet. 

Civil rights experts, immigrant advocacy groups and Democratic lawmakers told Truthout these arguments don't hold water and view such statements as justifications for an immigration enforcement apparatus set on drastically expanding the scope of its authority. 

Since taking office, the Trump administration has dramatically expanded the scope of immigration enforcement practices by deporting people to countries where they have no ties, refusing to communicate with local police agencies ahead of enforcement actions, ignoring court orders, ramping up arrests of people without criminal convictions, detaining green card holders and cancelling bond hearings for immigrants who arrive in the U.S. illegally, meaning they will be detained for the entirety of court proceedings.

Set against this backdrop, the unidentifiable immigration agents are just another symbol of a government agency that wants to act with unchecked power.

The masking “represents the normalization of a class of federal agents, a class of law enforcement that has even more impunity to operate as it wishes in communities,” Emanuel Gomez Gonzalez, a member of Durham, North Carolina- based immigrant-rights nonprofit Siembra NC, which helps people understand their legal rights, told Truthout. “If we are asking people to record interactions, but the officer never identifies themselves, there is never any way to hold them accountable for actions that they're captured committing that are apparent violations of constitutional rights.”

That lack of accountability has been fostered for decades, Alex Vitale, the coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College, told Truthout.

“This deportation machine was created by the Democrats. Beginning with Clinton, the Democrats created massive investments in harsher legal frameworks, massive expansions of the resources for border enforcement, [and] a rhetorical acceptance of the deportations,” Vitale said. “Obama oversaw the highest levels of deportations in the nation's history, and then Trump inherits that and further ramps it up. They're all throwing up their arms like, oh my god, fascism just fell from the sky.”

New legislative efforts to rein in ICE's authority will face both the political challenge of getting passed and the practical question of whether federal agents would adhere to new restrictions on their conduct.

Even so, those legislative efforts are occurring at the local, state, and federal level. In California, two state lawmakers introduced legislation to prohibit most law enforcement officials from covering their faces and mandate that they be identifiable by their uniform. 

Alex Marthews, the national chair of anti-surveillance group Restore the Fourth, told Truthout that his organization has been working with lawmakers in Massachusetts municipalities to pass ordinances that would require ICE officers to show proof of their agency affiliation and identity when asked by local police.

Such legislation could be “really powerful,” said Naureen Shah of the ACLU. 

“People who are in law enforcement do not want to be scrutinized by the public,” Shah said. “So if you are law enforcement who doesn't want to be questioned about what you're doing, you may be less likely to show up at a city if they are asking people for ID.”

In addition to the legislation introduced by Velázquez, Representatives Dan Goldman and Adriano Espaillat, introduced another piece of legislation that would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require that DHS officers show their faces, identify which component of DHS they work for, and wear official insignia. On July 8, two Democratic senators released legislation that would require ICE agents to display their agency affiliation and badge number or name. Such legislation is virtually certain to stall with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress, a fact Velázquez acknowledged during her call with Truthout. House Speaker Mike Johnson has scoffed at the suggestion that ICE agents should be identifiable. 

Even so, skeptics have viewed the proposals as weak efforts to rein in ICE's authority. The bill proposed by Velázquez would permit DHS to determine disciplinary action for officers who are deemed to have unnecessarily concealed their identity, while the legislation introduced by Goldman and Espaillat did not specify how agents could be punished. 

Vitale referred to these legislative efforts as “accountability theater” and argued they suffer from a more significant problem: merely requiring that law enforcement personnel are identifiable does little to curtail abuses of power. 

“The problem here is that people are stuck in a fantasy of liberal legal formalism that imagines that police are accountable to the public, but this is a fantasy people labor under that causes them to produce these completely naive and unrealistic ideas about police accountability,” Vitale said. “Even if you knew the identity of a federal agent who you believe is engaged in misconduct, there's still no effective remedy for that.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

U.S. President Donald on Friday made good on his pledge to sue The Wall Street Journal over its reporting that he wrote a “bawdy” letter for a leather-bound album that Ghislaine Maxwell prepared for the 50th birthday of Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and convicted sex offender who allegedly killed himself in jail while facing federal sex trafficking charges.

Maxwell, who is now serving a 20-year prison sentence “for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse minors,” collected dozens of letters for the book, according to the Journal.

The one allegedly crafted by Trump, the newspaper reported, “contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker. A pair of small arcs denotes the woman's breasts, and the future president's signature is a squiggly ‘Donald' below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.”

As the paper — part of billionaire Rupert Murdoch's media empire — detailed Thursday evening:

The letter concludes: “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.”

In an interview with the Journal on Tuesday evening, Trump denied writing the letter or drawing the picture. “This is not me. This is a fake thing. It's a fake Wall Street Journal story,” he said.

“I never wrote a picture in my life. I don't draw pictures of women,” he said. “It's not my language. It's not my words.”

He told the Journal he was preparing to file a lawsuit if it published an article. “I'm gonna sue The Wall Street Journal just like I sued everyone else,” he said.

On Friday, the president — a well-documented liar — sued the Journal in a federal court in Miami, Florida for assault, libel, and slander, according to CNN. In addition to the newspaper and its parent company News Corp, Politico reported, “the suit names WSJ reporters Khadeeja Safdar and Joe Palazzolo. It also names Rupert Murdoch.”

Trump sued Murdoch and the Wall Street Journal in Judge Aileen Cannon's district. www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/t…— Alejandra Caraballo (@esqueer.net) 2025-07-18T21:43:40.540Z 

Trump sued Murdoch and the Wall Street Journal in Judge Aileen Cannon's district. www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/t…

Trump had said on his Truth Social platform Friday morning: I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his ‘pile of garbage' newspaper, the WSJ. That will be an interesting experience!!!”

Later Friday, he addressed the filing in a post that noted his other recent lawsuits against media companies:

BREAKING NEWS: We have just filed a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS “article” in the useless “rag” that is, The Wall Street Journal. This historic legal action is being brought against the so-called authors of this defamation, the now fully disgraced WSJ, as well as its corporate owners and affiliates, with Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thomson (whatever his role is!) at the top of the list. We have proudly held to account ABC and George Slopadopoulos, CBS and 60 Minutes, The Fake Pulitzer Prizes, and many others who deal in, and push, disgusting LIES, and even FRAUD, to the American People. This lawsuit is filed not only on behalf of your favorite President, ME, but also in order to continue standing up for ALL Americans who will no longer tolerate the abusive wrongdoings of the Fake News Media. I hope Rupert and his “friends” are looking forward to the many hours of depositions and testimonies they will have to provide in this case. Thank you for your attention to this matter. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The president's history with Epstein has received heightened scrutiny in recent days, amid demand for the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to release its full files on the late sex offender. The two men were publicly associated with each other in the 1990s, up until a reported falling out over a business deal in 2004. Epstein was first arrested for sex crimes two years later.

Shortly after leaving the Trump administration earlier this year, Elon Musk, the richest man on Earth, claimed on his social media platform X that the president “is in the Epstein files” and “that is the real reason they have not been made public.”

After congressional Republicans repeatedly blocked a measure that would force the DOJ to release all Epstein files while protecting victims early this week, Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) introduced the Epstein Files Transparency Act and warned that if it is not considered by the House of Representatives within seven legislative days, a discharge petition will be circulated.

Late Thursday, after the Journal report was published, Trump said in a Truth post: “Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval. This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!”

In a post on X, Bondi said, “President Trump — we are ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.”

Trump's suit against the Journal comes as CBS parent company Paramount is under fire for its $16 million settlement with the Republican, who filed suit over the media organization's handling of a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, last year's Democratic presidential candidate, before the November election.

Among the critics framing that deal as a “big fat bribe” intended to secure federal approval of Paramount's pending merger with Skydance is late-night host Stephen Colbert, who announced Thursday that CBS has canceled his show following his recent commentary. The network's claim that it was a financial, not political, decision has been met with widespread skepticism.

“It's pretty obvious why Paramount chose to surrender to Trump,” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a Friday statement. “The Redstone family, the major owners of the company, is in line to receive $2.4 billion from the sale of Paramount to Skydance, but they can only receive this money if the Trump administration approves this deal.”

Tying the end of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” to congressional Republicans' attack on funding for NPR and PBS, the DOJ targeting Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Trump's threats to oust Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Sanders declared that “this is what the march toward authoritarianism looks like.”

In just the last day, Colbert was cancelled, PBS and NPR were defunded, and Trump threatened to sue even conservative outlets like the Wall Street Journal and NewsCorp over revelations related to Epstein.It sure looks like an open attempt at authoritarian control of the media.— Dylan Williams (@dylanotes) July 18, 2025 

In just the last day, Colbert was cancelled, PBS and NPR were defunded, and Trump threatened to sue even conservative outlets like the Wall Street Journal and NewsCorp over revelations related to Epstein.It sure looks like an open attempt at authoritarian control of the media.

The Paramount settlement followed one in Trump's case against ABC — which last December agreed to pay $15 million and release a note of regret after anchor and political commentator George Stephanopoulos said Trump had been found “liable for rape” of writer E. Jean Carroll. A federal jury found him civilly liable for sexual abuse and defamation, but not rape.

Sanders and several other critics have warned that the media “succumbing to pressure” from Trump sets “an incredibly dangerous precedent.”

            Most people don't expect Mimi Hymel to remember Hurricane Katrina. After all, she was only 3 when the Category 5 storm slammed into her Louisiana home in 2005.
    


            But nearly 20 years later, as Hymel watched news of the floodwaters inundating Texas Hill Country and saw the harrowing images of destruction from Camp Mystic, she said those memories came back with sharp clarity.
    


            She can still recall the moment her family decided they couldn't ride out Katrina and the sinking feeling she felt as her mom placed Hymel and her sister in their car and drove away, leaving their dad behind to work at a nearby hospital.
    


            But most of all, Hymel said, she remembers how she struggled to fall asleep for days after they escaped the storm because she didn't have her favorite stuffed animal.
    


            “I just had no idea if my dad was OK or even coming home at all,” she recalled. “I had a teddy bear named Cuddles that I didn't get to take in the car with me. In a scary time like that, I really wanted it for comfort.”
    


            Indeed, the importance of these plush companions was apparent as the floodwaters began seeping through the Chatterbox cabin at Camp Mystic, prompting a 9-year-old to offer her top bunk as a safe place for campers to store their stuffies during the storm.
    


            Hymel said the trauma of escaping a natural disaster has a way of changing you.
    


            But all these years later, she's found a way of channeling her experience during Katrina into helping today's youngest survivors.
    


            In the immediate aftermath of Katrina, Hymel said there was no shortage of local organizations and kind neighbors who tried to meet her family's immediate needs for food, clothes and shelter.
    


            But as a child, she said she struggled to process such dramatic and rapid change.
    


            “When we finally did get back to our house, everything was destroyed,” she recalled.
    


            And Cuddles had been lost to the floodwaters.
    


            Studies have long shown blankets or stuffed animals can help children adapt to unfamiliar or distressing situations and they become even more important when a child is processing grief.
    


            Although the family ultimately resettled in Texas, as she grew older, Hymel said she noticed how some first responders or families would share photos of stuffed animals they recovered after a disaster.
    


            “I was once that child so it's always just emotional seeing those photos,” she said. “I realized that kids experience disasters a little bit differently, so relief needs to work a little differently for them too.”
    


            That realization sparked Hymel to mobilize after catastrophes, coordinating with local businesses to host donation drives for stuffies and then partnering with first responders and other organizations to help distribute the plush toys in the aftermath of a tragedy.
    


            After the success of her early donation efforts, Hymel founded Comfort Bears in a Catastrophe. The nonprofit not only provides kids with a new stuffed animal after a crisis, but they also connect families to mental health resources.
    


            Each stuffed animal is tagged with a card offering free crisis counseling through the national Disaster Distress Helpline, which offers children and their families help navigating traumatic events.
    


            As interest in her work grew, so did the need. From the Miami Surfside condo collapse to the destructive fires in Maui and Los Angeles and countless floods and tornadoes, these days the steady drumbeat of disasters has been relentless, Hymel said.
    


            And so far, the nonprofit has donated more than 50,000 stuffed animals to children in need, Hymel said.
    


            She has also written a series of children's books called “Miss Prepared and Captain Ready.”
    


            “It teaches them important skills to know if a disaster were to hit, but it also encourages kids to get involved in their own way,” she said.
    


            But nothing, Hymel added, can compare to the joy of seeing a child receive a new stuffed animal and finding a sense of comfort in the midst of a crisis.
    


            “After Hurricane Ian, I was able to donate to the hospital I was actually born in,” Hymel said. “That was just kind of full circle.”
    


            From her home in Houston earlier this month, Annie Gully and her daughter watched as reports of flooding in the Texas Hill Country grew more dire by the hour.
    


            A close friend, she later learned, lost her niece, 8-year-old Blakely McCrory, in the floodwaters at Camp Mystic.

            “It's just unfathomable to even wrap your head around something like this happening,” she said. “You kind of have to go through the sadness and then you're like, ‘OK, what can we do to help.'”
    


            Gully, who owns Tree House Arts and Crafts, a local children's art studio, said over the years she's seen how a child's favorite stuffed animal can become like a family member.
    


            So, when her daughter suggested a donation drive for kids, she leaped at the idea. She reached out to Comfort Bears on social media and within hours they had a game plan.
    


            Gully's donation drive was covered on the local news and “that day alone, I think we collected 600” stuffed animals, she said.
    


            After three days they received more than 1,100 donations to be distributed throughout the state.
    


            “Children don't really have an outlet to help” after a crisis, Gully said. “You could tell their parents had explained to them that other kids have lost their lovies and how sad would it be if you lost your(s).”
    


            Gully is also selling “Mystic Strong” artwork, and the proceeds will be donated to charity in honor of McCrory and the other lives lost at Camp Mystic.
    


            “I feel like every time you turn on the news, there's just something worse that you hear about,” Gully said.
    


            But, she added, watching her community come together to donate comfort to the smallest victims of the floods in Kerr County has given her a reason to hope.
    


            “No one cares who you are, what you look like or who you voted for,” she said, “We're all just doing things together to help.”

            The 47th president is in many ways a different man than the 45th president, even though they are both Donald J. Trump.
    


            He's unafraid to swear in public or on social media and he's more emboldened, willing to directly challenge the Constitution and the courts and capable of demanding more loyalty from Republicans.
    


            But Trump 2.0 is also in direct competition with his former self in several important ways, starting with the fact that he can't seem to remember appointing people he now loathes.
    


            Trump's aides are looking at ways to oust Jay Powell, the Fed chairman Trump nominated to the role during his first term. Trump told House Republicans he had drafted a letter to take the unprecedented step of firing the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Markets beware.
    


            At the White House Wednesday, Trump seemed to forget that he had nominated Powell.
    


            “I was surprised he was appointed,” Trump said. “I was surprised, frankly, that Biden put him in and extended him, but they did.” Biden renominated Powell. Either Trump can't remember or he is willing himself to forget his role in the process.
    


            If Trump ultimately tests the Fed's independence and tries to fire Powell, he'll point to a building renovation that got underway during Trump's own first term.
    


            Before Trump took office for the second time, the FBI director appointed during his first term, Christopher Wray, quit early rather than wait to be fired.
    


            On the Supreme Court, CNN has reported on Trump's gripes behind closed doors about his nominee Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in particular.
    


            When Trump today threatens burdensome tariffs on Canada and Mexico, who he accuses of “taking advantage” of previous US presidents, he's also talking about his prior self.
    


            Trump's first-term administration negotiated the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement — a reboot of NAFTA. Back then, it was hailed as the major accomplishment of his trade policy.
    


            He has also evolved on issues including bitcoin and cryptocurrency, although that could have something to do with his family's business interests.
    


            And Trump used to support banning TikTok in the US, but now, after making inroads with young men in the last election, he very much wants a US-based company to step up and buy the platform.
    


            “He's undoing himself with a vengeance,” the CNN presidential historian Tim Naftali told me.
    


            The relatively moderate mainstream policy hands who marked the first Trump term are on the outs. Outsiders and MAGA figureheads are in.
    


            “Donald Trump clearly is angry about what his advisers forced him to do in the first term,” Naftali said, pointing specifically to trade policy.
    


            “His approach to Canada and Mexico is inexplicable given his first term, unless you realize that he wasn't happy with what he ended up doing in the first term,” he said.
    


            Naftali said Trump deserves credit for Operation Warp Speed, the effort to quickly develop a Covid-19 vaccine at a time when the country was largely shut down by the pandemic.
    


            But rather than build on that legacy, Trump selected Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his Health and Human Services director, elevating a vaccine skeptic to a top policy role.
    


            Kennedy fired all the members of a CDC vaccine advisory panel and brought in vaccine skeptics to review the vaccine schedule.
    


            I put the idea of Trump 2.0 correcting Trump 1.0 to a number of CNN reporters and anchors who pay close attention to foreign affairs, the economy and the environment.
    


            CNN's Jim Sciutto, who wrote a book, The Madman Theory, about Trump's first-term foreign policy, notes that Trump is more aggressive this time, and appears to be more inclined to listen to his own gut.
    


SCIUTTO: In his second term, President Trump is proving less likely to be deterred by advisers or advice against his more aggressive moves in international affairs. And, so for instance, while (former White House Chief of Staff) Gen. John Kelly and (former national security adviser) John Bolton were able to counsel him away from summarily withdrawing from NATO in 2018, many — including those who served in his first administration — fear his current advisers won't stand in the way. 






From foreign officials, the concern I hear most often is one of uncertainty. From tariffs to military support for Ukraine, they express doubts that what the president says today will hold tomorrow. Trade deals become fleeting agreements subject to where the financial markets are on any given day or how the White House reads domestic politics. And support for Ukraine — which European officials see as central to the security of the whole continent — rises and falls based on Trump's current interpretation of where Putin stands on peace talks. 






Trump has proven his willingness to make hard decisions his predecessors avoided — the US strikes on Iran stand out. What observers at home and abroad are waiting for is a consistent and predictable worldview.






            Allison Morrow, who writes the Nightcap newsletter for CNN Business, agrees there's a difference to this president, but he remains the same in one very important way.
    


MORROW: I agree with Tim Naftali, though I wonder how conscious Trump is of his attempts to undo USMCA, which itself was just a reshuffling of NAFTA. The Trump 2.0 tariff strategy, such as it is, doesn't make any sense in practice. If you really want to use tariffs to bring back US manufacturing, you can't be cutting deals, because then there's no incentive for companies to invest in domestic production. We've written about the contradictions at the heart of his tariff ideology dozens of times at this point, and there's just no response from the White House about how they think they can make tariffs do everything they claim, all at once. I think the thing that jumps out at me between Trump 1.0 and 2.0 is what hasn't changed. 






Fundamentally, I think Trump wants to avoid accountability. And that's why he has sort of slow-walked the tariffs into the market's collective consciousness, and backed off when the bond markets shuddered. He's testing to see what he can get away with without causing a financial or economic catastrophe. 






            Trump and his aides also clearly learned from his first term. Instead of trying repeatedly to repeal Obamacare, they cut future spending from Medicaid, which will have a similar effect by pushing millions of lower-income Americans off their health insurance in the years to come.
    


            CNN's Chief Media Analyst Brian Stelter noted that in this term, Trump is acting more forcefully against news outlets.
    


STELTER: Instead of merely tweeting insults at independent media outlets, he is taking concrete actions to penalize those outlets, while at the same time promoting and empowering MAGA commentators. Take the media story in the news right now: the imminent defunding of PBS and NPR. In Trump's first term, he harshly criticized public media, but those were just words, not actions. His administration also proposed annual budgets that would have zeroed out the funding, but didn't successfully pressure Congress to follow through.






In Trump's second term, he seemingly knows which buttons to press. He (or, probably more accurately, his aides) targeted the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in several different ways and sold Republican lawmakers on a DOGE-branded rescission that passed both the House and Senate. 






            CNN's Senior White House Correspondent Kristen Holmes isn't sure Trump is undoing his first term as much as he is better prepared this time.
    


HOLMES: Trump and his allies had four years to prepare for him to be president again. His allies used that time to create a framework for a second term agenda, as well as brainstorm potential roadblocks and work-arounds to those roadblocks, to ensure that they could start enacting his agenda on Day 1. 






The first time around, even members of Trump's own campaign were surprised he won. They had almost no real transition and Trump had to rely on Washington Republicans, many of whom did not have the same ideas as him, to help fill out the cabinet and guide him. And while he knew what he wanted to do, he had no real understanding of how to get it done. Now, he is working in unison with almost every inch of his administration to get what he wants done — and it's working.






            Holmes' point carries over to immigration, Trump's signature issue. He is more effectively carrying through with mass deportations than he did in his first term. With a more pliant Congress, he has money for his border wall, the go-ahead to turn ICE into the nation's largest and best-funded police force, and the help of Republican governors to create new detention centers to hold undocumented immigrants — not just violent criminals — he wants to deport. When he leaves office, the country will look a lot different after his second term than it did after his first.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","The FBI prepares to leave its ‘monstrosity' of a home","https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/19/us/fbi-headquarters-washington-dc-relocation","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            Few people hated the looks of the Washington headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation more than the man it was named after.
    


            J. Edgar Hoover “thought the architecture of that particular building was the greatest monstrosity ever constructed in the history of Washington,” then-Sen. Ernest Hollings said on the day the longtime director of the FBI died in 1972, five years after construction began and two years before it was finally fit to be occupied.
    


            The headquarters – like its namesake and the institution it houses – is bold and quite intimidating, its long rows of monochrome, square windows like dozens of eyes peering out over Pennsylvania Avenue.
    


            “It would make a perfect stage set for a dramatization of George Orwell's ‘1984,'” groused Washington Post architecture critic Wolf Von Eckardt when the building was dedicated in 1975.
    


            “The idea that the building was obsolete and the FBI needed to move out of it has been discussed for over a decade,” said Thomas Luebke, secretary of the US Commission of Fine Arts, a century-old agency that reviews and gives recommendations on proposed designs for DC government buildings.
    


            Now, after more than a decade of continual fits and starts, with plans dropped and money pulled back, the Trump administration says it is time for the FBI to make its move.
    


            “We are ushering FBI Headquarters into a new era and providing our agents of justice a safer place to work,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement earlier this month. 



            The bureau – the hub of federal law enforcement and domestic surveillance in the US that traces its roots back to 1908 – will move just three blocks west to the Ronald Reagan Building, a facility completed in 1998 and the youngest of Pennsylvania Avenue's major government office buildings, said Patel. It is a facility that can take on more staff as it was previously home to the US Agency for International Development, the American foreign aid organization  dismantled by the Trump administration, whose remnants are being absorbed into the State Department.
    


            It is likely to be only a first step, as the president has indicated he wants to tear down the Hoover Building and put a new FBI headquarters on the same site, an idea he pushed for in 2018 during his first term.
    


            The Trump administration has not yet given a timeframe for the move, nor the future of the building. It's unclear what's next for a structure that started out as part of an urban renewal project and is now considered by many to be a capital eyesore.
    


            FBI workers began moving into the building in 1974, before construction was even completed, but its history dates all the way back to the Kennedy administration. President John F. Kennedy was disturbed by the urban blight on Pennsylvania Avenue just a few blocks from the White House and made it a priority to bring a new life to the downtrodden section of the nation's capital.
    


            “JFK's inaugural parade passed by that stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in 1961, and I think Kennedy was really caught off-guard by how sort of dilapidated it was,” said Angela M. Person, associate dean of the Gibbs College of Architecture at the University of Oklahoma.
    


            “The north side (of Pennsylvania Avenue) presents a scene of desolation; block after block of decayed nineteenth century buildings,” a committee organized by Kennedy told the president in 1962.
    


            The council's lofty recommendations – including a two-block “national square” leading to the White House with a 150-foot-wide fountain – were never implemented, but the need to bring the neighborhood back to life was widely accepted.
    


            By the 1960s, the FBI had staff spread over nine separate locations in Washington. Bringing bureau operations under its own roof – an idea that was first proposed before World War II – became intertwined with the effort to modernize the space east of the White House.
    


            The reconceptualize Pennsylvania Avenue came at the same time designers were reimagining government buildings. Many settled on Brutalism, a style based on an imposing, block-like design rooted in its main tool of construction: concrete.
    


            “Brutalism's use of concrete – a solid, durable, and economical material – made it an appealing contemporary style to provide government agencies with efficient facilities that designers believed represented the stability of the American government,” says the National Capital Planning Commission.
    


            But the visual result was stark, producing an FBI Headquarters building composed largely of tan-and-black squares looming over the sidewalk, broken up by an 11-story rear section built on massive supports.
    


            “It is awkward imagery, to say the least,” said one of the more muted descriptions in The New York Times as the building was dedicated. Acclaimed DC architect Arthur Cotton Moore was less generous.
    


            “It creates a void along Pennsylvania Avenue,” he told the Washingtonian in 2005. “Given its elephantine size and harshness, it creates a black hole.”
    


            Although it was imagined as only one part of a larger effort to modernize the nation's main street, the Hoover Building was ultimately the only major project to come out of Kennedy's vision.
    


            “With exception of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Building, major physical changes along the avenue resulting from the Kennedy initiative were never realized,” a report from the National Park Service says.
    


            That meant the foreboding structure named after one of the most feared men in Washington became even more of an architectural standout on the grand avenue between the White House and the Capitol.
    


            “It dominates its part of downtown Washington, but is alien to the spirit of the capital and the architecture of Pennsylvania Avenue,” Von Eckhardt said in his brutal takedown of the Brutalist structure.
    


            To reach the main entrance, visitors must ascend concrete steps that rise over a manicured ditch that the government refers to as a “dry moat,” an effort to secure the building from vehicle crashes in an age before security bollards and reinforced planters became standard issue at federal buildings.
    


            Despite its detractors, the building's stark, intimidating building design is not universally reviled.
    


            “I think that we lose something historically if we just cover them over with a classical facade,” Person said. “I think there are ways to adapt them that help them become more beloved by the public than they are.”
    


            One blog that listed the headquarters among the “ugliest buildings in the world” also allowed that its blocky geometrical layout had “a certain Minecraft-y charm.”
    


            But the sense that the Hoover Building is distinctly out-of-place alongside the limestone and marble designs of most federal buildings has made it a popular choice for “what would you do”-style projects for budding designers looking to make a change.
    


            Luebke himself oversaw a studio dedicated to the building for the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 2020. “It's a pretty hard building on the community that looks like a fortress in the neighborhood,” he said.
    


            Proposals ranged from turning the block into a public pavilion to adding a fabric facade around the current building to give it a less imposing look.
    


            Ideas to reimagine the facility rather than tear it down frequently lock in on its open lower section facing Pennsylvania Avenue and large inner courtyard, features the public has never been able to use because of security concerns.
    


            “If the FBI's not going to be there, I think it really unlocks the building's potential for a lot of other uses that I'd love to see come to fruition,” said Person.
    


            One problem for both the FBI and any other organization that might want to take over the existing building is its sheer size and scope – 2.8 million square feet with firing ranges and massive storage space designed to hold endless rows of paper files and fingerprint cards, long before the idea of computer storage was a possibility.
    


            “It's a very different world than we had before,” said Luebke. “It would be very difficult to retrofit.”
    


            The Trump administration's decision to move the FBI to the Reagan Building – at least for now – bypasses a 2023 decision by the General Services Administration, which manages federal government buildings, that a new FBI headquarters should be built in Greenbelt, Maryland, about 15 miles from its current location.
    


            “Greenbelt has the lowest overall cost to taxpayers,” the Government Accountability Office said at the time.
    


            But President Trump made it clear that he has no interest in relocating the country's top law enforcement officials to the DC suburbs, especially Maryland, which he called “a liberal state.”
    


            “We're going to stop it. Not going to let that happen,” said Trump during a speech at the Department of Justice in March.
    


            The decision infuriated Maryland lawmakers who said the president didn't have the right to spend money on a different site.

            “The Congress appropriated funds specifically for the purpose of the new, consolidated campus to be built in Maryland,” said a statement released by eight Maryland members of Congress and Gov. Wes Moore. “Now the Administration is attempting to redirect those funds – both undermining Congressional intent and dealing a blow to the men and women of the FBI – since we know that a headquarters located within the District would not satisfy their security needs.”
    


            That kind of uncertainty and dramatic change of direction is familiar to people following the effort to replace the FBI's current headquarters.
    


            “The FBI cannot afford to continue the status quo from an operational effectiveness or a fiscal stewardship perspective,” then-Associate Deputy Director of the FBI T.J. Harrington said in 2011. But that is exactly what happened as multiple efforts to set aside the money for a new building were scuttled by Congress, which forced previous moving plans to be put on hold in 2017.
    


            The assumption in the 2010s that the FBI would be leaving the Hoover Building in a relatively short period of time led to the GSA deciding to put off needed maintenance, and the headquarters fell into greater disrepair. A decade ago, netting was added to the top of the building to catch pieces of concrete that periodically broke off from the structure.
    


            The government finally authorized some repair work in 2014 to deal with the crumbling concrete and regular water leaks, but the stopgaps haven't addressed long-term security concerns or the expansion of the bureau that now occupies space in nearly two dozen buildings around Washington.
    


            Exactly what will happen to DC's most polarizing building after the G-men move out is still not clear, although President Trump has suggested the FBI will eventually return.
    


            “We're going to build another big FBI building right where it is,” Trump said in March.
    


            That would be a project likely to stretch well beyond the president's term. A 2006 estimate produced for the GSA found that constructing a new FBI building at 935 Pennsylvania Avenue would take nearly a decade to complete. In 2018, the GSA's Inspector General said the cost of razing the Hoover Building and rebuilding on site would be $3.3 billion, amounting to approximately $400,000 for every FBI staffer working there.
    


            The Brutalist design is something that certainly will not return if the building is replaced. President Trump issued a memorandum on the first day of his second term, requiring that federal buildings “respect regional, traditional, and classical architectural heritage.”

            The Commission on Fine Arts has not received any formal proposals this year for a new use for the building or its property, Luebke said.

WESTBURY, N.Y. (AP) — A man who was pulled into an MRI machine in New York after he walked into the room wearing a large weight-training chain around his neck has died, according to police and his wife, who told a local television outlet that he waved goodbye before his body went limp.

The man, 61, had entered an MRI room while a scan was underway Wednesday afternoon at Nassau Open MRI. The machine's strong magnetic force drew him in by the metallic chain around his neck, according to a release from the Nassau County Police Department.

He died Thursday afternoon, but a police officer who answered the phone at the Nassau County police precinct where the MRI facility is located said the department had not yet been given permission to release the name Saturday.

Adrienne Jones-McAllister told News 12 Long Island in a recorded interview that she was undergoing an MRI on her knee when she asked the technician to get her husband, Keith McAllister, to help her get off the table. She said she called out to him.

She told News 12 that the technician summoned into the room her husband, who was wearing a 20-pound chain that he uses for weight training, an object they'd had a casual conversation about during a previous visit with comments like: “Ooooooh, that's a big chain!”

When he got close to her, she said, “at that instant, the machine switched him around, pulled him in and he hit the MRI.”




“I said: ‘Could you turn off the machine, call 911, do something, Turn this damn thing off!'” she recalled, as tears ran down her face. “He went limp in my arms.”

She said the technician helped her try to pull her husband off the machine but it was impossible.

“He waved goodbye to me and then his whole body went limp,” Jones-McAllister told the TV outlet.

Jones-McAllister told News 12 that McAllister suffered heart attacks after he was freed from the MRI machine.

A person who answered the phone at Nassau Open MRI on Long Island declined to comment Friday. The phone number went unanswered on Saturday.

It wasn't the first New York death to result from an MRI machine.

In 2001, 6-year-old Michael Colombini of Croton-on-Hudson was killed at the Westchester Medical Center when an oxygen tank flew into the chamber, drawn in by the MRI's 10-ton electromagnet.

In 2010, records filed in Westchester County revealed that the family settled a lawsuit for $2.9 million.

MRI machines “employ a strong magnetic field” that “exerts very powerful forces on objects of iron, some steels, and other magnetizable objects,” according to the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, which says the units are “strong enough to fling a wheelchair across the room.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — “Mr. President, this is the gavel used to enact the ‘big, beautiful bill,'” House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a White House signing ceremony on the Fourth of July.

“I want you to have it,” he said.

Handing over the gavel delighted President Donald Trump who, seated behind a desk outdoors, immediately tested it out with a few quick thumps.

The moment left a memorable mark on a historic day. The gesture reflected a traditional nod of honor, from one leader to another, a milestone of the Republican Party's priority legislation becoming law. But the imagery also underscored a symbolic transfer of political power, from Capitol Hill to the White House as a compliant Congress is ceding more and more of its prerogative to the presidency.

Since Trump's return to the White House in January, and particularly in the past few weeks, Republicans in control of the House and Senate have shown an unusual willingness to give the president of their party what he wants, regardless of the potential risk to themselves, their constituents and Congress itself.

Republicans raced to put the big package of tax breaks and spending cuts on Trump's desk by his Independence Day deadline. Senators had quickly confirmed almost all of Trump's outsider Cabinet nominees despite grave reservations over Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary, Pete Hegseth as the Pentagon chief and others. House Republicans pursued Trump's interest in investigating his perceived foes, including investigating Democratic President Joe Biden'suse of the autopen. 

But at the same time, Congress hit the brakes on one of its own priorities, legislation imposing steep sanctions on Russia over its war on Ukraine, after Trump announced he was allowing President Vladimir Putin an additional 50 days to negotiate a peace deal, dashing hopes for a swifter end to the conflict.




This past week, Congress was tested anew, delivering on Trump's request to rescind some $9 billion that lawmakers had approved but that the administration wanted to eliminate, including money for public broadcasting and overseas aid. It was a rare presidential request, a challenge to the legislative branch's power of the purse, that has not been used in decades.

“We're lawmakers. We should be legislating,” said a defiant Sen. Lisa Murkowksi, R-Alaska, as she refused to support the White House's demand to rescind money for National Public Radio and others.

“What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told, ‘This is the priority. We want you to execute on it. We'll be back with you with another round,'” she said. “I don't accept that.”

Congress, the branch of government the Founding Fathers placed first in the Constitution, is at a familiar crossroads. During the first Trump administration, Republicans frightened by Trump's angry tweets of disapproval would keep their criticisms private. Those who did speak up — Liz Cheney of Wyoming in the House and Mitt Romney of Utah in the Senate, among others — are gone from Capitol Hill.

One former GOP senator, Jeff Flake of Arizona, who announced in 2017 during Trump's first term that he would not seek reelection the next year, is imploring Republicans to find a better way.

“The fever still hasn't broken,” he wrote recently in The New York Times. “In today's Republican Party, voting your conscience is essentially disqualifying.”

But this time, the halls of Congress are filled with many Republicans who came of political age with Trump's “Make America Great Again” movement and owe their ascent to the president himself. Many are emulating his brand and style as they shape their own. 

A new generation of GOP leaders, Johnson in the House and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, have pulled closer to Trump. They are utilizing the power of the presidency in ways large and small — to broker deals, encourage wayward lawmakers to fall in line, even to set schedules.

Johnson, R-La., has openly pined for what he calls a “normal Congress.” But short of that, the speaker relies on Trump to help stay on track. When Republicans hit an impasse on cryptocurrency legislation, a Trump priority, it was the president who met with holdouts in the Oval Office late Tuesday night as Johnson called in by phone.

The result is a perceptible imbalance of power as the executive exerts greater authority while the legislative branch dims. The judicial branch has been left to do the heavy lift of checks and balances with the courts processing hundreds of lawsuits over the administration's actions.

“The genius of our Constitution is the separation of power,” said Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the former speaker, in an interview on SiriusXM's “Mornings with Zerlina.” 

“That the Republicans in Congress would be so ignoring of the institution that they represent, and that have just melted the power of the incredibly shrinking speakership” and Senate leadership positions, “to do all of these things, to cater to the executive branch,” she said.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., endured Trump's criticism over his opposition to the tax and spending cuts bill. The senator raised concerns about steep cuts to hospitals, but the president threatened to campaign against him. Tillis announced he would not seek reelection in 2026.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, voted against that bill and the rescissions package despite Trump's threat to campaign against any dissenters. 

One Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, appears to be pressing on, unphased. He recently proposed legislation to force the administration to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, something the president had been reluctant to do.

“Nowhere in the Constitution does it say that if the president wants something, you must do it,” said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, in a Senate speech. “We don't have to do this. We don't have to operate under the assumption that this man is uniquely so powerful.”

TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces an increasingly uphill battle in Sunday's upper house election, and a loss could worsen political instability at a time of daunting challenges, such as rising prices and high U.S. tariffs.

A poor performance would not immediately trigger a change of government but it would deepen uncertainty over his fate and Japan's future path. 

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a humiliating loss in a lower house election in October as its usual supporters registered their unhappiness over past corruption scandals and high prices. Ishiba is struggling to regain voter confidence. 

His minority government has since been forced into making concessions to the opposition to get legislation through the Diet, or parliament. That has hindered its ability to quickly deliver effective measures to curb rising prices and win wage increases. On top of shortages and soaring prices for rice, a traditional staple, Ishiba has been stymied by President Donald Trump's tariff demands.

(Tomohiro Ohsumi/Pool Photo via AP, File)



Frustrated voters are rapidly turning to emerging populist parties, including one that is promoting anti-foreign policies and backpedaling on gender equality and diversity.

Here's a look at Sunday's election:




Ishiba has set a low bar for the vote — a simple majority. Half of the 248 seats for six-year terms in the upper house are being decided, and the LDP and its junior coalition partner Komeito would need to win a combined 50. Added to the 75 coalition-held seats that are not being contested in this election, it would be a big retreat from the 141 seats the coalition held before the election.

If the ruling coalition fails to secure a majority, “there will be a move within the LDP to dump Ishiba,” said Yu Uchiyama, a University of Tokyo professor of political science. “It makes a leadership very unstable.” Under any successor, the ruling coalition would be a minority in both houses, he said. 

If Ishiba's coalition secures a majority and he stays on, his leadership will remain weak, with little hope of improved support ratings, Uchiyama said. “Either way, it is essential for the minority government to seek opposition parties' cooperation to achieve any policy.”

Measures to mitigate soaring prices, lagging incomes and burdensome social security payments are the top focus of frustrated, cash-strapped voters.

Rice prices have doubled since last year due to supply shortages, overly complex distribution systems and other reasons related to Japan's farming, causing panic buying as Ishiba has struggled to resolve the crisis.

Trump has added to that pressure, complaining about a lack of progress in trade negotiations, blaming a lack of sales of U.S. autos and American-grown rice to Japan despite a shortfall in domestic stocks of the grain. A 25% tariff due to take effect Aug. 1 has been another blow for Ishiba. 

Ishiba has resisted any compromise before the election, but the prospect for a breakthrough after the election is just as unclear because the minority government would have difficulty forming a consensus with the opposition.

The rice issue has cost Ishiba one farm minister. Rice prices remain high even after the farm minister's replacement, Shinjiro Koizumi, moved quickly and boldly to address the problem by ordering the emergency release of stored rice from reserves, helping to refill grocery store shelves in time for the election. 

Koizumi, son of popular former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, is a potential challenger to Ishiba.

Stricter measures targeting foreign residents and visitors have suddenly emerged as a key issue. 

The Sanseito party stands out with the toughest anti-foreigner stance with its “Japanese First” platform that proposes a new agency to centralize policies related to foreigners. It wants stricter screening for allowing Japanese citizenship and to exclude non-Japanese from welfare benefits. The party's populist platform is also anti-vaccine, anti-globalism and favors traditional gender roles.

Its stance has encouraged the spread of xenophobic rhetoric in the election campaign and on social media, critics say. A typical claim is that a rapid increase in foreign workers has hurt Japanese workers' wages and that foreigners use a large share of welfare benefits and have made Japanese society unsafe. 

“Foreigners are used as targets to vent their discontent and unease,” Uchiyama said, comparing the scapegoating to that in Europe and the United States under Trump. 

Experts say most of the rhetoric is disinformation aimed at frustrations among Japanese struggling to get by. Government statistics show foreign residents account for about 3% of both Japan's total population and of welfare benefit recipients. 

The Liberal Democrats, under a slogan “zero illegal immigrants,” have pledged to crack down on growing illegal employment of foreigners and against allowing them to default on social insurance payments or medical bills. The party also set up a task force to promote an orderly society, a move aimed at enforcing stricter measures on foreigners to address growing public unease. The rising conservative Democratic Party for the People, or the DPP, also is calling to restrict foreign ownership of Japanese real estate. 

The move triggered protests by human rights activists and alarmed foreign residents.

Given that its population is rapidly aging and shrinking, Japan needs foreign workers. It should discuss immigration policy more strategically, Takahide Kiuchi, an executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a recent analysis.

Conservative to centrist opposition groups, including the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, or CDPJ, the DPP, and Sanseito have gained significant ground at the Liberal Democrats' expense. Headed by charismatic Sohei Kamiya, a former local assembly member and a member of the defense reserve, Sanseito ranked as second favorite in the opposition after the CDPJ in some recent surveys.

They are believed to be raking in conservative supporters of the ruling party who are disappointed by Ishiba's leadership and flip-flops on policies. Ishiba is caught between his party's ultraconservatives and mainstream opposition leaders.

Still, the eight main opposition groups are too fractured to forge a common platform as a united front and gain voter support as a viable alternative.

When Ishiba lost big in October, there was speculation about a trilateral coalition government with the Komeito and the DPP or another conservative group, the Japan Innovation Party. But they've since cooperated only on certain legislation. If the ruling coalition loses its upper house majority, that could spark a regrouping among coalitions.

Yoshihiko Noda, a former prime minister and head of the opposition CDPJ, said the loss of ruling coalition majorities in both houses of parliament would enable opposition parties to push policies blocked by the LDP. Those include cuts in the consumption tax, recognition of same-sex marriages, and a law allowing married couples the option of each keeping their own names.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons joins Americas Newsroom to discuss the Democrats resistance to the Trump administrations crackdown on illegal immigration. 

Military bases in both New Jersey and Indiana will soon be used by Homeland Security to house illegal immigrants, drawing a furious response from Democratic lawmakers.

Parts of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey and Camp Atterbury in Indiana will be repurposed and used as ""temporary soft-sided holding facilities,"" the Defense Department told Fox News Digital, citing a decision by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

New Jersey Democrats blasted the decision, warning it would harm military readiness and urging Republicans to join them in helping reverse it. Both bases were previously used to house thousands of Afghan refugees following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.

""This is an inappropriate use of our national defense system and militarizes a radical immigration policy that has resulted in the inhumane treatment of undocumented immigrants and unlawful deportation of U.S. citizens, including children, across the country,"" the group of Democrats said in a joint statement.

""Using our country's military to detain and hold undocumented immigrants jeopardizes military preparedness and paves the way for ICE immigration raids in every New Jersey community. We have the greatest military in the world and using it as a domestic political tool is unacceptable and shameful.""

The statement was made by Reps. Herb Conaway, LaMonica McIver, Donald Norcross, Rob Menendez, Frank Pallone, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Josh Gottheimer and Nellie Pou as well as Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim.

It is unclear when either site will open and a decision will depend on operational requirements and coordination with Homeland Security, the Defense Department said. 

Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst is a joint military base operated by U.S. Air Force, Army and Navy — the only tri-service base in the country. Spanning 42,00 acres, it's home to 45,000 military and civilian personnel, making it one of the largest and most strategically important on the East Coast.

Camp Atterbury is an Army and Air National Guard base near Edinburgh that spans 34,000 acres and has been used for training brigades and hosting large-scale operations. 

Under the Trump administration, Homeland Security has been using detention facilities to house migrants while they await asylum hearings or deportation. 

The lawmakers said that Hegseth wrote to Conoway informing him of the decision. Hegseth wrote in the letter that the move would not negatively affect military training, operations, readiness, or any other military requirements, per NJ Spotlight News.

New Jersey is already home to Delaney Hall and the Elizabeth Detention Center which are being used as immigration detention facilities, although they are privately operated. Delaney Hall was the scene where Democrat Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested and charged with trespassing in a clash with federal immigration officials in May. Rep. LaMonica McIver, D‑N.J., was later federally charged for allegedly interfering with federal officers during the same incident.

The news comes two weeks after President Donald Trump signed the Big Beautiful Bill into law, which allocated between $150 billion and $170 billion towards immigration enforcement over the next several years, $45 billion of which was carved out to expand immigration detention facilities. The funds are part of the Trump administration's efforts to carry out the largest deportation operation in the nation's history. 

Earlier this month, the Trump administration opened an immigration detention camp in Florida's Everglades that is surrounded by alligators dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz.""

A Russian lawmaker who regulates the country's IT said Friday that WhatsApp should prepare to leave the Russian market, warning that the messaging app would likely be put on a list of restricted software.

Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the lower house of parliament's information technology committee, said in a statement that MAX, a state-backed messaging app integrated with government services, could gain market share if WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, left the country.

""It's time for WhatsApp to prepare to leave the Russian market,"" Gorelkin said, adding that Meta is designated as an extremist organization in Russia.

Facebook and Instagram, both also owned by Meta, have been banned in Russia since 2022, when Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in a war that continues.

Gorelkin made his comments after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law last month authorizing the development of MAX as Russia seeks to reduce its dependence on platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram.

Russian lawmakers approved sweeping legal amendments this week, proposing fines of up to 5,000 rubles, or $63, for anyone searching for material online the government considers to be extremist, including Instagram and Facebook, and opposition politicians and activists.

The proposal sparked criticism, including from some Kremlin backers like Margarita Simonyan, a state media executive who said journalists would be unable to investigate the activities of opposition groups such as the Anti-Corruption Fund founded by deceased opposition figure Alexei Navalny.

Anton Nemkin, a member of the parliament's IT committee, said it was determined that WhatsApp would leave Russia.

""The presence of such a service in Russia's digital space is, in fact, a legal breach of national security,"" Nemkin said, according to TASS, a state-owned news agency.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said all services must follow Russian law when asked if WhatsApp may leave the country.

Russia has long attempted to establish what it describes as digital sovereignty by promoting home-grown services.

But critics have expressed concerns that Russia's new state-backed messaging app may track its users' activities and have suggested Russia could slow WhatsApp's speeds to encourage downloads of the new app.

YouTube has had its audience in Russia decline significantly in the last year to fewer than 10 million daily users from more than 40 million in mid-2024 because slower download speeds have made it more difficult for people to access the video platform.

Shares in state-controlled technology company VK, which is developing homegrown digital services like VK Video, a rival to YouTube, grew 1.9% Friday.

The Kremlin released a list of instructions this week from Putin, including a directive to introduce additional restrictions on the use in Russia of software, including communication services produced in ""unfriendly countries"" that have imposed sanctions against Russia.

Putin gave a deadline of Sept. 1.

Referring to Putin's order, Gorelkin said WhatsApp would likely be among the communication services to face new restrictions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Democrats gear up for shutdown brawl with GOP: ‘They stabbed us in the back'","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3475962/democrats-gear-up-shutdown-brawl-gop/","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Democrats will be put to the test next week when Senate Republicans bring to a vote the first of several bipartisan government funding bills for next fiscal year.

But fresh off a Republican-controlled Congress clawing back $9 billion in DOGE-inspired cuts from money that both parties previously approved, Democrats are at a crossroads regarding whether to provide critical votes to fund the government without GOP assurances portions won't be rescinded.

“They stabbed us in the back, and if they commit to us that they won't do that again, then we might be able to write bills,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), a member of leadership and the Appropriations Committee. “The vibe today is, ‘we're going to trade baseball cards with you, and then we're going to sneak into your house later today and take our cards back.'”

Murphy, visibly irritated, added: “They're literally telling us that they are going to violate the bipartisan deals immediately. What do you do with that?”

The consternation over how to move forward has become a point of contention both internally among Democrats and in conversations with their GOP colleagues. Appropriators Murphy and Sen. Katie Britt (R-AL) engaged Thursday in what appeared to be a tense floor conversation shortly before the Democrat teed off on Republicans. 

“We debated it at length in the [Appropriations] Committee,” Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) told the Washington Examiner. “We're trying our best to make a bipartisan appropriations process. We'll see.”

Republicans are largely brushing off the government shutdown threats that have been led by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), messaging that the Democratic leader has softened slightly in recent days as the party debates next steps to counter a Republican-dominated Washington.

To complicate matters further, White House budget office director Russ Vought batted down demands for assurances from Democrats by saying the appropriations process “has to be less bipartisan.” The White House tried to clean up the remarks by claiming Vought meant the opposite.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) conceded that less bipartisanship would undercut efforts to overcome the 60-vote filibuster, a threshold that the White House rescission request was able to avoid.

“That runs contrary to what the math tells us around here,” Thune said of Vought's remarks. “We need 60 on [appropriations] bills, 60 to fund the government. And my expectation is, at least I hope, we plan to move [appropriations] bills that will have cooperation.”

But Democrats say the onus is on Republicans to extend offers that convince them back to the negotiating table, such as public assurances or potential stipulations inked into funding bills. 

“The idea that this is on Democrats is just absolutely preposterous,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), a leadership member, told the Washington Examiner. “Republicans are presiding over the evisceration of their own power, and they've been politically lobotomized. I'm done trying to sort them. They have to sort themselves.”

The $9 billion rescission package took back foreign aid money for global health programs and public broadcast funding that Republicans assailed as government waste, some of which they said was allocated by federal bureaucrats for inappropriate programs. The tranche amounted to only 0.10% of the $7 trillion budget, leaving many conservative fiscal hawks admittedly desiring steeper cuts with more rescissions after the 2026 government funding process that's due Oct. 1.

“If 10 Democrats don't want to work with us on cutting out all this NPR funding when they're actively, overtly partisan, then we have a responsibility to act on our own,” Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO), who was tapped by the White House to lead the rescission vote-wrangling effort, told the Washington Examiner. “That's what we did.”

But a recent schism between a group of Senate Republicans, including several close allies to President Donald Trump, tested the bounds in which GOP lawmakers were willing to let the administration alter how Congress intended appropriated funds to be used. The Department of Education, which Trump is seeking to dismantle, has since released money for state education programs after alarms were raised by senators that it was improperly being withheld, according to Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV).

TRUMP'S $9 BILLION DOGE CUTS PASS HOUSE AS JOHNSON TEMPERS GOP DIVISIONS OVER EPSTEIN VOTES

“When we have authorized and appropriated to these [states], the grants have gone out, and now all of a sudden, they mysteriously paused. Let us know what's going on,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) told the Washington Examiner. “It's not right to our school districts to be held in this state of limbo.”

In a small but positive step toward a funding solution between the two parties, the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday advanced with bipartisan support its latest two measures that comprise the 12-bill annual budget.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Four summers ago, the Left's apoplectic reaction to the passage of Georgia's Election Integrity Act of 2021 prompted the cynical authorities who run Major League Baseball to pull its All-Star Game out of Atlanta. Former President Joe Biden denounced the law as “Jim Crow in the 21st century.” Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) called it a “full-fledged assault on voting rights.” Former Rep. Stacey Abrams called it “a blatant attempt to make it harder for people to vote, especially in communities of color,” warning corporations that do business in Georgia must stand against it or face consequences. 

MLB commissioner Rob Manfred caved to the pressure and moved the game to Denver, citing this as “the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport.” Their values presumably being feckless adherence to the latest baseless leftist fad.

But former President Barack Obama heaped praise on Manfred's decision, congratulating MLB for  “taking a stand on behalf of voting rights for all citizens.”

So when MLB decided to play its 2025 All-Star Game in Atlanta, it would have been reasonable to expect boycotts, protests, even riots. After all, the Georgia voting law has not been changed since the dark days of the state's supposed return to the Jim Crow South. Don't Democrats disapprove anymore?

But the only sounds emanating from Tuesday night's All-Star Game in Atlanta were the crack of bat on ball, the roar of the crowd, and celebratory shouts echoing through Truist Park. What happened in four short years to silence the outrage?

What happened was that Republicans won the debate over election security, and Democrats exposed themselves as fearmongers and liars.

The 2021 Georgia law, misrepresented from the start by Democrats and the legacy media, enacted popular and common-sense reforms to secure the vote and ensure public confidence in elections. It replaced signature matching for absentee ballots with a requirement for voters to provide a driver's license number, state ID number, or a photocopy of an accepted form of identification. It codified the use of ballot drop boxes but set clear regulations for their placement and accessibility hours, ensuring they were monitored and secure. It outlawed “ballot harvesting,” in which people collect mail-in and absentee ballots to submit en masse. It also expanded in-person early voting, including mandatory weekend hours. 

These reforms produced a surge in confidence in elections among Georgians. A Cygnal poll in May found that nearly three-quarters of voters trust the system, a 27-point upward swing since the bill became law. Meanwhile, a 2022 MIT study found that 99% of Georgia voters reported no problems voting during the midterm elections that year.  

Increased turnout after the law passed reflects this surge in confidence. The vote total in the two most recent midterm elections increased by roughly 5%, and in the two most recent general elections by 6%. Early voting, in particular, broke records. On the first day of early voting in 2024, Georgia more than doubled the turnout of 2020 and 2022.

MLB HOLDS ALL-STAR GAME IN THE LAND OF JIM CROW

Notably, the number of black Georgians casting ballots increased by 80,000 between 2020 and 2024. This occurred even as voting methods shifted, with many black voters adapting without a hiccup to updated procedures, including expanded early voting hours. Democrats routinely suggested that black voters were incapable of securing the necessary documentation to vote — the soft bigotry of low expectations. But black voters defied this prejudice and turned out to vote in record numbers. 

The deafening silence about all this at the All-Star Game repudiated the Democrats' hysteria over Georgia's Election Integrity Act. Republican election reforms are popular and effective. The debate is now over.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Zohran Mamdani's goal of lowering prices conflicts with his own stated priorities and those of his allies.

Can the city of New York sell groceries more cheaply than the private sector? The mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani thinks so. He wants to start five city-owned stores that will be “focused on keeping prices low” rather than making a profit—what he calls a “public option” for groceries. His proposal calls for opening stores on city land so that they can forgo paying rent or property taxes.

Skeptics have focused on economic obstacles to the plan. Grocers have industry expertise that New York City lacks; they benefit from scale; and they run on thin profit margins, estimated at just 1 to 3 percent, leaving little room for additional savings. Less discussed, though no less formidable, is a political obstacle for Mamdani: The self-described democratic socialist's promise to lower grocery prices and, more generally, “lower the cost of living for working class New Yorkers” will be undermined by other policies that he or his coalition favors that would raise costs. No one should trust that “there's far more efficiency to be had in our public sector,” as he says of his grocery-store proposal, until he explains how he would resolve those conflicts.

Mamdani's desire to reduce grocery prices for New Yorkers is undercut most glaringly by the labor policies that he champions. Labor is the largest fixed cost for grocery stores. Right now grocery-store chains with lots of New York locations, such as Stop & Shop and Key Food, advertise entry-level positions at or near the city's minimum wage of $16.50 an hour. Mamdani has proposed to almost double the minimum wage in New York City to $30 an hour by 2030; after that, additional increases would be indexed to inflation or productivity growth, whichever is higher. Perhaps existing grocery workers are underpaid; perhaps workers at city-run stores should make $30 an hour too. Yet a wage increase would all but guarantee more expensive groceries. Voters deserve to know whether he'll prioritize cheaper groceries or better-paid workers. (I wrote to Mamdani's campaign about this trade-off, and others noted below, but got no reply.)

Read: New York is hungry for a big grocery experiment

In the New York State assembly, Mamdani has co-sponsored legislation to expand family-leave benefits so that they extend to workers who have an abortion, a miscarriage, or a stillbirth. The official platform of the Democratic Socialists of America, which endorsed Mamdani, calls for “a four-day, 32-hour work week with no reduction in wages or beneﬁts” for all workers. Unions, another source of Mamdani support, regularly lobby for more generous worker benefits. Extending such benefits to grocery-store employees would raise costs that, again, usually get passed on to consumers. Perhaps Mamdani intends to break with his own past stances and members of his coalition, in keeping with his goal of focusing on low prices. But if that's a path that he intends to take, he hasn't said so.

City-run grocery stores would purchase massive amounts of food and other consumer goods from wholesalers. New York City already prioritizes goals other than cost-cutting when it procures food for municipal purposes; it signed a pledge in 2021 to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions associated with food that it serves, and Mayor Eric Adams signed executive orders in 2022 that committed the city to considering “local economies, environmental sustainability, valued workforce, animal welfare, and nutrition” in its food procurement. Such initiatives inevitably raise costs.

Mamdani could favor exempting city-run groceries from these kinds of obligations. But would he? Batul Hassan, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America steering committee and a supporter of Mamdani, co-authored an article arguing that city-run stores should procure food from vendors that prioritize a whole host of goods: “worker dignity and safety, animal welfare, community economic benefit and local sourcing, impacts to the environment, and health and nutrition, including emphasizing culturally appropriate, well-balanced and plant-based diets,” in addition to “suppliers from marginalized backgrounds and non-corporate supply chains, including small, diversified family farms, immigrants and people of color, new and emerging consumer brands, and farmer and employee owned cooperatives.” If one milk brand is cheaper but has much bigger environmental externalities or is owned by a large corporation, will a city-run store carry it or a pricier but greener, smaller brand?

Mamdani has said in the past that he supports the BDS (boycott, divestment, sanctions) movement, which advocates for boycotting products from Israel. That probably wouldn't raise costs much by itself. And Mamdani told Politico in April that BDS wouldn't be his focus as mayor. But a general practice of avoiding goods because of their national origin, or a labor dispute between a supplier and its workers, or any number of other controversies, could raise costs. When asked about BDS in the Politico interview, Mamdani also said, “We have to use every tool that is at people's disposal to ensure that equality is not simply a hope, but a reality.” Would Mamdani prioritize low prices in all cases or sometimes prioritize the power of boycotts or related pressure tactics to effect social change? Again, he should clarify how he would resolve such trade-offs.

Finally, shoplifting has surged in New York in recent years. Many privately owned grocery stores hire security guards, use video surveillance, call police on shoplifters, and urge that shoplifters be prosecuted. Democratic socialists generally favor less policing and surveilling. If the security strategy that's best for the bottom line comes into conflict with progressive values, what will Mamdani prioritize?

Read: Shoplifters gone wild

This problem isn't unique to Mamdani. Officials in progressive jurisdictions across the country have added to the cost of public-sector initiatives by imposing what The New York Times's Ezra Klein has characterized as an “avalanche of well-meaning rules and standards.” For example, many progressives say they want to fund affordable housing, but rather than focus on minimizing costs per unit to house as many people as possible, they mandate other goals, such as giving locals a lengthy process for comment, prioritizing bids from small or minority-owned businesses, requiring union labor, and instituting project reviews to meet the needs of people with disabilities. Each extra step relates to a real good. But once you add them up, affordability is no longer possible, and fewer people end up housed.

Policies that raise costs are not necessarily morally or practically inferior to policies that lower costs; low prices are one good among many. But if the whole point of city-owned grocery stores is to offer lower prices, Mamdani will likely need to jettison other goods that he and his supporters value, and be willing to withstand political pressure from allies. Voters deserve to know how Mamdani will resolve the conflicts that will inevitably arise. So far, he isn't saying.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Tanning is back. And this time, it's not just about looking good.

The early aughts were the worst possible kind of golden age. Tans were inescapable—on Britney Spears's midriff, on the flexing biceps outside of Abercrombie & Fitch stores. The Jersey Shore ethos of “gym, tan, laundry” infamously encapsulated an era in which tanning salons were after-school hangouts, and tanning stencils in the shape of the Playboy bunny were considered stylish. Self-tanning lotions, spray tans, and bronzers proliferated, but people still sought the real thing.

By the end of the decade, tanning's appeal had faded. Americans became more aware of the health risks, and the recession shrank their indoor-tanning budgets. But now America glows once again. The president and many of his acolytes verge on orange, and parties thrown by the MAGA youth are blurs of bronze. Celebrity tans are approaching early-aughts amber, and if dermatologists' observations and social media are any indication, teens are flocking to the beach in pursuit of scorching burns.

Tanning is back. Only this time, it's not just about looking good—it's about embracing an entire ideology.

Another apparent fan of tanning is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., America's perpetually bronzed health secretary, who was spotted visiting a tanning salon last month. What tanning methods he might employ are unknown, but the secretary's glow is undeniable. (The Department of Health and Human Services didn't respond to a request for comment about the administration's views on tanning or Kennedy's own habits.)

On its face, the idea that any health secretary would embrace tanning is odd. The Obama administration levied an excise tax on tanning beds and squashed ads that marketed tanning as healthy. The Biden administration, by contrast, made sunscreen use and reducing sun exposure central to its Cancer Moonshot plan. The stated mission of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement is to end chronic diseases, such as cancer, by addressing their root causes. Yet the Trump administration's MAHA report, released in May, doesn't once mention skin cancer, which is the most common type as well as the most easily preventable. It mentions the sun only to note its connection with circadian rhythm: “Morning sun synchronizes the body's internal clock, boosting mood and metabolism.”

In fact, there's good reason to suspect that Kennedy and others in his orbit will encourage Americans to get even more sun. Last October, in a post on X, Kennedy warned that the FDA's “aggressive suppression” of sunlight, among other supposedly healthy interventions, was “about to end.” Casey Means, a doctor and wellness influencer whom President Donald Trump has nominated for surgeon general, is also a sun apologist. In her best-selling book, Good Energy (which she published with her brother, Calley Means, an adviser to Kennedy), she argues that America's many ailments are symptoms of a “larger spiritual crisis” caused by separation from basic biological needs, including sunlight. “Shockingly, we rarely ever hear about how getting direct sunlight into our eyes at the right times is profoundly important for metabolic and overall health,” she writes. An earlier version of Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill tried to repeal the excise tax on tanning beds. (The provision was cut in the final version.)

The alternative-health circles that tend to attract the MAHA crowd are likewise skeptical of sun avoidance. “They don't want you to know this. But your body was made for the sun,” says a “somatic energy healer” with 600,000 followers who promotes staring directly into the sun to boost mood and regulate the body's circadian rhythm. (Please, don't do this.) On social media, some influencers tout the sun's supposedly uncelebrated power to increase serotonin and vitamin D, the latter of which some erroneously view as a cure-all. Some promote tanning-bed use as a way to relieve stress; others, such as the alternative-health influencer Carnivore Aurelius, promote genital tanning to boost testosterone. Another popular conspiracy theory is that sunscreen causes cancer and is promoted by Big Pharma to keep people sick; a 2024 survey found that 14 percent of young adults think using sunscreen every day is worse for the skin than going without it.

These claims range from partly true to patently false. The sun can boost serotonin and vitamin D, plus regulate circadian rhythm—but these facts have long been a part of public-health messaging, and there's no evidence that these benefits require eschewing sunscreen or staring directly at our star. Tanning beds emit little of the UVB necessary to produce vitamin D. Some research suggests that the chemicals in sunscreen can enter the bloodstream, but only if it's applied to most of the body multiple times a day; plus, the effects of those chemicals in the body haven't been established to be harmful, whereas skin cancer has. And, if I really have to say it: No solid research supports testicle tanning. Nor does any of this negate the sun's less salutary effects: premature aging, eye damage, and greatly increased risk of skin cancer, including potentially fatal melanomas.

The specific questions raised in alternative-health spaces matter less than the conspiracist spirit in which they are asked: What haven't the American people been told about the sun? What lies have we been fed? Their inherent skepticism aligns with Kennedy's reflexive mistrust of the health establishment. In the MAHA world, milk is better when it's raw, beef fat is healthier than processed oils, and the immune system is strongest when unvaccinated. This philosophy, however flawed, appeals to the many Americans who feel that they've been failed by the institutions meant to protect them. It offers the possibility that regaining one's health can be as simple as rejecting science and returning to nature. And what is more natural than the sun?

Read: You're not allowed to have the best sunscreens in the world

Now is an apt moment for American politics to become more sun-friendly. Tanning is making a comeback across pop culture, even as “anti-aging” skin care and cosmetic procedures boom. Young people are lying outside when the sun is at its peak—new apps such as Sunglow and Rayz AI Tanning tell them when UV rays are strongest—to achieve social-media-ready tan lines. Last year, Kim Kardashian showed off a tanning bed in her office (in response to backlash, she claimed that it treated her psoriasis). Deep tans are glorified in ads for luxury goods, and makeup is used in fashion shows to mimic painful-looking burns. Off the runway, “sunburned makeup,” inspired by the perpetually red-cheeked pop star Sabrina Carpenter, is trending.

Veena Vanchinathan, a board-certified dermatologist in the Bay Area, told me that she's noticed more patients seeking out self-tanning products and tanning, whether in beds or outdoors. Angela Lamb, a board-certified dermatologist who practices on New York's well-to-do Upper West Side, told me her patients are curious about tanning too. “It's actually quite scary,” she said. A recent survey by the American Academy of Dermatology found that a quarter of Americans, and an even greater proportion of adults ages 18 to 26, are unaware of the risks of tanning, and many believe in tanning myths, such as the idea that a base tan protects against a burn, or that tanning with protection is safe. (“There is no such thing as a safe tan,” Deborah S. Sarnoff, the president of the Skin Cancer Foundation, told me.)

Recently, some experts have called for a more moderate approach to sun safety, one that takes into account the benefits of some sun exposure and the harms of too much shade. “I actually think we do ourselves a bit of a disservice and open ourselves up to criticism if the advice of someone for skin-cancer prevention is ‘Don't go outside,'” Jerod Stapleton, a professor at the University of Kentucky who studies tanning behaviors, told me. But the popular rejection of sun safety goes much further. Advances in skin-cancer treatment, for example, may have lulled some Americans into thinking that melanoma just isn't that serious, Carolyn Heckman, a medical professor at Rutgers University's Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, told me. Skin-cancer treatment and mortality rates have indeed improved, but melanomas that metastasize widely are still fatal most of the time.

From the June 2024 issue: Against sunscreen absolutism

In previous decades, tans were popular because they conveyed youth, vitality, and wealth. They still do. (At least among the fairer-skinned; their connotations among people of color can be less positive.) But the difference now is that tanning persists in spite of the known consequences. Lamb likened tanning to smoking: At this point, most people who take it up are actively looking past the well-established risks. (Indeed, smoking is also making a pop-culture comeback.) A tan has become a symbol of defiance—of health guidance, of the scientific establishment, of aging itself.

Panelists joined to discuss Trump's request to cancel $9 billion in already-approved federal funding.

This week, Congress passed Donald Trump's request to claw back $9 billion in approved federal spending, including funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined last night to discuss the president's rescissions request—and what its approval may signal about future appropriations.

“What I think will be remembered of this vote is it was a test case in whether” Republicans in Congress “could change the way the government appropriates money,” Michael Scherer, a staff writer at The Atlantic, said last night.

Historically, Scherer explained, even when one party controls both chambers of Congress, 60 votes are still required to pass a budget through the Senate. “That means you need a bipartisan process,” he continued. But this differs from a rescissions request, which can pass with only 51 votes. The Trump administration's goal, Scherer argued, is to break away from a bipartisan budgeting process “by making it a purely partisan” one. This, Scherer said, could “change dramatically the whole way the federal government's been budgeted for years.”

Joining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more: Leigh Ann Caldwell, the chief Washington correspondent at Puck; Stephen Hayes, the editor of The Dispatch, Meridith McGraw, a White House reporter at The Wall Street Journal; and Michael Scherer, a staff writer at The Atlantic.

Church intervention in electoral races is an efficient polarization machine.

In a court document filed earlier this month, the Internal Revenue Service quietly revealed a significant break with long-standing practice: Churches will no longer risk their nonprofit status if clergy endorse political candidates from the pulpit. The change stemmed from a lawsuit brought against the agency by evangelical groups that argued that the prior ban on church involvement in political campaigns infringed upon their First Amendment rights. Their victory, though, may turn out to be a Faustian bargain: Churches can now openly involve themselves in elections, but in doing so, they risk becoming de facto political organizations. What may appear to be a triumph over liberalism could in fact be a loss, the supersession of heavenly concerns by earthly ones.

Churches have long been divided over the proper role for religion in American politics. One approach has been to militate against the separation of church and state, insofar as that distinction limits what churches can do to exercise power in society. The IRS change, along with several others by the Trump administration, will soften that barrier, allowing churches to take on a much more pronounced role in electoral politics. Another approach has been to operate within the confines of that separation—which has produced some very noble results: a norm of discouraging churches from turning into mere organs of political parties, and an emphasis on forming the conscience of believers rather than providing direct instructions about political participation.

A conservative 30 years ago might have preferred that latter approach, or at least said so. Back then, members of the right complained that Black churches frequently gave political endorsements or raised funds for electoral campaigns, and that the IRS neglected to enforce its now-eliminated ban, known as the Johnson Amendment. Yet by 2016, that dynamic had reversed, leading Donald Trump, then still a presidential candidate, to court the coveted right-wing evangelical vote by vowing to destroy the amendment once in office. A number of religious leaders took the implications of that promise and ran with them—an investigation by The Texas Tribune and ProPublica published in 2022 found that plenty of evangelical churches were offering endorsement despite the rule. The hope in paring down the Johnson Amendment is apparently that church endorsements will influence the outcome of elections in the right's favor.

Elizabeth Bruenig: Progressive Christianity's bleak future

But there's little reason to believe that church endorsements will do much in the way of persuasion. American churches have already undergone so much liberal attrition that, in practice, many right-wing evangelical pastors will be instructing their congregations to vote for candidates most members already intend to vote for. To the degree that broadly conservative churches retain some liberal members, endorsing right-wing candidates seems like just the thing to alienate them, which is a loss for those congregations as well as for the faith as a whole. Church intervention in particular electoral races is an efficient polarization machine.  For that and other reasons, this policy shift doesn't really offer any benefits to Christians qua Christians. Providing political endorsements makes churches susceptible to powerful campaign tactics: PACs, for example, will have incentives to fund churches that reflect their agendas, meaning that pastors' livelihoods could come to depend on contorting their religious beliefs to suit political interests. Politically active congregants will also have good reason to lobby their pastors for certain endorsements, another source of pressure for church leaders to say that supporting a particular candidate is the will of God. And the practice of offering endorsements prioritizes accepting specific instructions from church leaders over cultivating Christian values and methods of reasoning that allow the faithful to determine which candidates to support for themselves. (Indeed, the Christian religion itself seeks to cultivate those very things for that very reason, rather than providing an itemized list of every behavior to perform and every behavior to avoid.) This is apparently why the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement that Catholic clergy will still decline to make political endorsements. “The Church seeks to help Catholics form their conscience in the Gospel,” the release read, “so they might discern which candidates and policies would advance the common good.”

That is a much more logical way for church leaders to proceed. Dictating which candidates to vote for is at once presumptuous, assuming much more about God's judgment than can rightly be accounted for, and also nihilistic, assuming that churchgoers are so ill-formed in their faith that they can't be trusted to figure out the right answers to these earthly, prudential questions. Granting the imprimatur of the faith to ordinary charlatans—the most common breed of politician—is ill-begotten, and borders on sacrilegious.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The debate is about a lot more than a look.

According to many Zoomers, concerning reports of a “Gen Z stare” may be overblown. If it exists, they say, it's simply a response to the idiocy of their elders.

Somehow, though, the concept — recently articulated on TikTok — gained instant recognition from millennials, Gen X, and boomers, who describe it as a blank, if not worried, look as a response to a direct question or interaction. Sometimes, it can be a lack of any greeting or reply from Zoomers in customer service specifically. Further reports point to a potentially related trend, where the group born between 1997 and 2012 don't say hi when they pick up the phone.

Any sweeping generational generalization — the millennial “failure to launch,” the Gen X “slacker” mentality, boomers ruining everything — has a way of galvanizing old, would-be foes and bringing them together for a universal tut-tut moment. Now, it's a new generation's turn in the barrel, and we're hearing about their lack of bar tabs, their surprising interest in religion, their tendency to fall for online scams, and their love of baggy pants. Few things unite people as easily as a common point of complaint and judgment.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

But the “stare” dogpile is also a reflection of the social skills we value and how we learned to value them; concerns that go beyond eye contact and active listening. In examining our hangups and the backlash, it becomes clear that the Gen Z stare is actually as much about Zoomers as it is the people who are frustrated by them.

The most difficult thing about the Gen Z stare is finding Zoomers who will actually admit — on record — to doing it.

In speaking to a few Gen Z people, the main response I got was that they didn't believe that they or any of their friends were guilty of committing the Gen Z stare. Sam Delgado, a freelance journalist and former Vox fellow, does not relate to giving what she understands to be “deadpan stare during conversations.” “I was a little confused at first because I hadn't heard of it before or didn't immediately understand,” Delgado says. “And while my other Gen Z friends aren't as chatty as I am, I've never seen any of them do this stare.”

Kat Swank, a young person born in 1997 — the Gen Z cutoff — who says she does not fix upon people with a lightless gaze, was also skeptical. “My TikTok For You Page is certainly telling me that it's real,” Swank tells Vox. “But I don't think I've ever really encountered it, though.”

Obviously, asking people whether they do an embarrassing thing is not going to elicit a rush of admissions. Psychology experts I spoke to said that while there's obviously no peer-reviewed research on the origins of the stare or its intent, they believe that at least some Gen Z starers are unaware that they're doing it. There's also reason to believe that the way young people look at older people now has plenty in common with past generations.

Michael Poulin, an associate psychology professor at the University at Buffalo researches how people respond to adversity, and says that he's seen “tons” of Gen Z stares. He's very familiar with the vacant gaze and felt its heavy void first hand. But he raises the point that part of being a college professor is looking around the room into a sea of young adults who would rather be somewhere else. Since Poulin has been teaching, and perhaps since time immemorial, students, regardless of generation, have given him that blinkless gaze.

Poulin, who says he's seen stares from millennial students in the past, raises the point that the Gen Z stare might not be specific to Gen Z but rather a manifestation of the tradition of older adults complaining about the newest, youngest adults. It's not unlike the way some of our parents told us to look people in the eye and respond to them in full sentences, or the way some of us were reminded not to slouch at the dinner table, or to greet people with firm handshakes.

Clearly, even in the distant past, some of us weren't making sufficient eye contact, were being too curt, slumped and ruining our posture, and doling out flimsy shakes to adults around us.

“To some degree, it's a comforting myth that all of us who are adults — who've gotten beyond the teens and 20s — that we tell ourselves that we were surely better than that,” Poulin says, asserting that older adult complaining about Gen Z probably have a few interactions in their younger years that were also complained about. “This isn't the first generation to fail” at behaving like a responsive adult.

Still, Poulin says, “I would be willing to speculate that it may be a little worse for Gen Z,” noting that complaining about Gen Z en masse on social media is a sort of new phenomenon. Bemoaning how annoying young people are used to be kept in smaller social circles like after church or at soccer practices or lunches, but now it's all online, documented and magnified with the possibility of going viral. That's probably an issue millennials, at least, can relate to.

One of the reasons why Gen Z might not be totally aware of their stare might be the same reason older generations are so sensitive to it: an unavoidable difference in number and types of human interactions.

Older adults have years or even decades of social experiences, most of which notably came before the pandemic lockdowns cut us off from one another and changed how we interact. Many also remember a pre-internet age of interaction, another sea change in the way that people relate to one another. For millennials and older, having learned the social skills to navigate a wider variety of in-person dealings, it can feel abrupt, even jarring, to encounter someone without them.

While it's true that possibly every generation possesses social behavior that, in some way or another, irked previous ones, there may be factors at play as to why Gen Z's has manifested itself in a vacant glance. It all comes back to those two big shifts: the internet and the pandemic.

“It's sort of almost as though they're looking at me as though they're watching a TV show,” says Tara Well, a professor at Barnard College. Well's research is primarily in social perception, cognition, and self-awareness. Like Poulin, she has seen the Gen Z stare coming from some of her students.

If your social interactions are largely dependent on scrolling through an endless amount of faces or staring into a lens, it might affect the way you interact with humans face-to-face.

Well explained to me that the stare has made her think about the idea of “self-objectification” a concept in psychology where people see themselves as an object or solely by their physical appearances, and begin to see other people as objects and images.

“We don't see them as dynamic people who are interacting with us, who are full of thoughts and emotions and living, breathing people,” Well tells Vox. “If you see people as just ideas or images, you look at them like you're paging through an old magazine or scrolling on your phone.”

It's not difficult to see a connection between social media and self-objectification.

If your social interactions are largely dependent on scrolling through an endless amount of faces or staring into a lens, it might affect the way you interact with humans face-to-face. On social media everyone just bleeds into an endless swipe if they haven't captured your attention. On top of that, Gen Z is the first generation to grow up with fully built out iterations of Instagram, TikTok, and other social media platforms. They also have largely experienced so many customer-facing interactions — ordering a pizza, speaking to customer service rep, buying movie tickets — as automated.

Of course, technological developments weren't the only thing happening during Gen Zers' time in high school and college. Many were also navigating those crucial years for social development during the pandemic, when life and school was shut down and held virtually.

Swank, the millennial-Gen Z cusper, said that during her high school years, she had full access to Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram (“the old Instagram where you're putting the worst photo you've ever seen of yourself with a sepia filter”). At the time, she didn't yet have TikTok and those social media platforms hadn't unspooled their now-sophisticated algorithms into the apps. But her younger peers did.

As a zillennial, she suspects she avoided the worst: access to TikTok combined with the pandemic. All that and “your social life is all fully all online? I can only kind of imagine, like, where your social skills kind of go from there,” Swank says. “Online, you can just stop engaging with someone, and you don't need to talk to them — I can totally see that bleeding into real life.”

While many of us had our social lives affected by lockdowns (and all have access to social media), Gen Z is the only generation who didn't get to experience what adult social life felt like before it.

Part of what Well studies is how humans react to each other. She looks into the small things, like how we modulate our voice when we talk to someone or how we react to small cues — the beginning of a smile, the small raise of an eyebrow, the end of a laugh, etc. These details help us decipher an interaction, to keep a good conversation going or end one that's run its course.

The Gen Z stare seems like the antithesis to these things. The person giving the stare may not know or want to reciprocate these cues; they may not have the practice or knowledge to help their conversational partner. At the same time, the person they're staring at has nothing to work with. That may explain why people may find the stare so irksome, regardless of whether or not the starer's intention.

“People interpret it as social rejection,” Poulin, the professor at Buffalo, told me. “There is nothing that, as social beings, humans hate more. There's nothing that stings more than rejection.”

If there's any solace for those feeling the frustration, or for Gen Z tired out of the discourse, it's that there that younger generation will likely give up its signature stare.

“Gen Z will grow out of it because people are going to keep having in person interactions,” Poulin says, noting that it might not be at the same rate as older generations who grew up with face-to-face interactions. “They will have more in person interactions, and they will experience consequences of engaging versus not engaging.”

When they do, older generations will probably find something else to complain about.

In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. That kind of journalism isn't easy.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

Medical devices in the brain are already making a difference for countless patients.

When you hear the word “neurotechnology,” you may picture Black Mirror headsets prying open the last private place we have — our own skulls — or the cyber-samurai of William Gibson's Neuromancer. That dread is natural, but it can blind us to the real potential being realized in neurotech to address the long intractable medical challenges found in our brains. In just the past 18 months, brain tech has cleared three hurdles at once: smarter algorithms, shrunken hardware, and — most important — proof that people can feel the difference in their bodies and their moods.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

Keith Krehbiel has battled Parkinson's disease for nearly a quarter-century. By 2020, as Nature recently reported, the tremors were winning — until neurosurgeons slipped Medtronic's Percept device into his head. Unlike older deep-brain stimulators that carpet-bomb movement control regions in the brain with steady current, the Percept listens first. It hunts the beta-wave “bursts” in the brain that mark a Parkinson's flare and then fires back millisecond by millisecond, an adaptive approach that mimics the way a cardiac pacemaker paces an arrhythmic heart.

In the ADAPT-PD study, patients like Krehbiel moved more smoothly, took fewer pills, and overwhelmingly preferred the adaptive mode to the regular one. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic agreed: The system now has US and EU clearance.

Because the electrodes spark only when symptoms do, total energy use is reduced, increasing battery life and delaying the next skull-opening surgery. Better yet, because every Percept shipped since 2020 already has the sensing chip, the adaptive mode can be activated with a simple firmware push, the way you'd update your iPhone.

Scientists applied the same listen-then-zap logic farther down the spinal cord this year. In a Nature Medicine pilot, researchers in Pittsburgh laid two slender electrode strips over the sensory roots of the lumbar spine in three adults with spinal muscular atrophy. Gentle pulses “reawakened” half-dormant motor neurons: Every participant walked farther, tired less, and — astonishingly — one person strode from home to the lab without resting.

Half a world away, surgeons at Nankai University threaded a 50-micron-thick “stent-electrode” through a patient's jugular vein, fanned it against the motor cortex, and paired it with a sleeve that twitched his arm muscles. No craniotomy, no ICU — just a quick catheter procedure that let a stroke survivor lift objects and move a cursor. High-tech rehab is inching toward outpatient care.

The brain isn't only wires and muscles; mood lives there, too. In March, the Food and Drug Administration tagged a visor-like headset from Pulvinar Neuro as a Breakthrough Device for major-depressive disorder. The unit drips alternating and direct currents while an onboard algorithm reads brain rhythms on the fly, and clinicians can tweak the recipe over the cloud. The technology offers a ray of hope for patients whose depression has resisted conventional treatments like drugs.

Cochlear implants for people with hearing loss once sounded like sci-fi; today more than 1 million people hear through them. That proof-of-scale has emboldened a new wave of brain-computer interfaces, including from Elon Musk's startup Neuralink. The company's first user, 30-year-old quadriplegic Noland Arbaugh, told Wired last year he now “multitasks constantly” with a thought-controlled cursor, clawing back some of the independence lost to a 2016 spinal-cord injury. Neuralink isn't as far along as Musk often claims — Arbaugh's device experienced some problems, with some threads detaching from the brain — but the promise is there.

On the speech front, new systems are decoding neural signals into text on a computer screen, or even synthesized voice. In 2023 researchers from Stanford and the University of California San Francisco installed brain implants in two women who had lost the ability to speak, and managing to hit decoding times of 62 and 78 words per minute, far faster than previous brain tech interfaces. That's still much slower than the 160 words per minute of natural English speech, but more recent advances are getting closer to that rate.

Yes, neurotech has a shadow. Brain signals could reveal a person's mood, maybe even a voting preference. Europe's new AI Act now treats “neuro-biometric categorization” — technologies that can classify individuals by biometric information, including brain data — as high-risk, demanding transparency and opt-outs, while the US BRAIN Initiative 2.0 is paying for open-source toolkits so anyone can pop the hood on the algorithms.

And remember the other risk: doing nothing. Refusing a proven therapy because it feels futuristic is a little like turning down antibiotics in 1925 because a drug that came from mold seemed weird.

Twentieth-century medicine tamed the chemistry of the body; 21st-century medicine is learning to tune the electrical symphony inside the skull. When it works, neurotech acts less like a hammer than a tuning fork — nudging each section back on pitch, then stepping aside so the music can play.

Real patients are walking farther, talking faster, and, in some cases, simply feeling like themselves again. The challenge now is to keep our fears proportional to the risks — and our imaginations wide enough to see the gains already in hand.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Big companies could soon launch their own stablecoins. Here's what it means for consumers.","https://www.businessinsider.com/genius-act-passed-two-retailers-are-considering-stablecoins-wmt-amzn-2025-7","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 09:15:00 GMT","

The landmark crypto bill that just passed in Congress paves the way for more businesses to issue their own stablecoins. 

This corner of the crypto market has received a lot of attention as the GENIUS Act moved toward becoming law, with crypto proponents cheering the huge show of legislative support. 

These digital assets are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to fiat money like the US dollar. Right now, they're mostly used by crypto traders to easily buy other tokens. 

However, stablecoins used for payments would be a monumental shift in the foundations of commerce. 

In June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Walmart and Amazon were considering launching their own stablecoins. Now that the GENIUS Act has cleared the final legislative hurdle, crypto experts expect big changes to the payments ecosystem. 

Here's what to know. 

It isn't hard to see the incentive for big companies like Walmart or Amazon. 

Businesses could save significant amounts in credit card processing fees, cutting out an expensive intermediary by having people use their proprietary crypto as payment. 

""Retailers currently lose an estimated 2% to 3% of every transaction to credit card processing fees,"" CoinRoutes co-founder Dave Weisberger, said.

""For companies with billions in sales, eliminating even a portion of that margin drag could unlock 10s of millions in savings. Stablecoins offer a potential alternative that reduces frictional costs, accelerates settlement times, and gives merchants more control over payment rails.""

Eliminating that type of cost would be a boon for Walmart and Amazon, but would be a blow to credit card issuers like Visa and Mastercard. 

""If a fraction of their customer base starts using a store-issued stablecoin instead of a Visa-backed card, that's billions in interchange fees gone overnight,"" Will Reeves, CEO of bitcoin rewards app Fold, told Business Insider.

Visa recently issued a statement on the passing of the GENIUS Act, noting that it anticipated the market shift brought on by stablecoin adoption. It stated that it is ""laying the groundwork by building and supporting blockchain-based solutions that help our partners and clients integrate stablecoins into the future of mainstream payments.""

For people shopping with a retailer like Amazon or Walmart, a stablecoin payment system might not feel all that different from what they're doing now.

According to Kevin Lehtiniitty, CEO of stablecoin network Borderless.xyz, a stablecoin issued by a big retailer would feel similar to using a gift card. 

Reeves shared a similar perspective. 

""On the surface, not much changes - you tap your phone, check out, maybe earn extra rewards or save on fees. But underneath, everything shifts. Walmart and Amazon aren't just retailers anymore—they're now your bank and your payment network.""

The benefit for shoppers could ultimately be lower prices if companies pass what they save in transaction fees to their customers.

""Competition at this scale drives down transaction costs, and that means consumers will likely see lower prices, better rewards, or both,"" Reeves added.

Dan Silverman, CEO of Balcony Technology Group, noted that the rise of corporate stablecoins could also prove beneficial to unbanked people, as it would allow them to access digital currency through their phones.

""The big thing I could also imagine is for loyalty points or rewards to be baked into the token itself,"" he stated. ""Think about when you get that long printed out receipt that has savings on it that you end up throwing out and never taking advantage of. The savings could be issued automatically on-chain.""

In order for either company's stablecoin initiative to succeed, its customers would have to trust them.

A potential downside for consumers is that stablecoins could add another layer to a process that's become pretty simple over the years. Shoppers would have to buy the stablecoins first and then use them to transact. For many people, it could be simpler to just keep using credit or debit cards already on file. 

Another risk for consumers is the management of stablecoin reserves. To hold their value, the tokens must be backed by an equivalent amount of liquid reserves, such as cash or short-term Treasurys. If these reserves are mismanaged or the issuing entity runs into financial trouble, the stablecoins could untether from their fiat peg and lose their value.

A top US Treasury official last year cited figures showing China's manufacturing-goods trade surplus approaching 2% of world GDP, roughly twice the share of Japan's in the early 1990s.

China's trade with the world is within reasonable bounds and the nation isn't out to dominate global markets, a senior official said, pointing to figures showing domestic consumption is driving economic growth.

“Most of China's production is intended to meet domestic demand,” Vice Finance Minister Liao Min said in an interview Friday near Durban, South Africa, where he was attending a gathering of Group of 20 policymakers. “When there's demand from abroad, China exports accordingly.

 After all, interest—as 18th century Italian economist Ferdiando Galiani liked to say—is just the price of anxiety. The very act of lending someone money causes worry. You demand compensation for that in the form of interest.

There's a long history of US presidents putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but the techniques have often been subtle or quiet in some way. Under President Trump, attacks on the Fed have risen to a whole new level. And it's not just Trump that's called on Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates. Other members of his administration (along with allies in Congress) have been hammering him both on policy and also topics unrelated to monetary policy, such as the cost of renovating the Federal Reserve building in Washington. Investors are taking seriously the prospect that Trump will find a way or a reason to remove Powell before the end of his term next year. And regardless of when Powell is replaced, there's a widespread anticipation that the next Fed chair will be someone more closely resembling a Trump loyalist. So do we still have an independent Fed at this point? On this episode, we speak with University of Texas-Austin economics professor Carola Binder about why central bank independence is so cherished by economists, why mere criticism of the Fed could be inflationary, and whether Fed independence has been permanently damaged.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Investors are growing skeptical that Chinese developer stocks will stage a rebound this year, as Beijing's reluctance to unleash sweeping stimulus deepens pessimism about the sector.

A gauge of developers' shares notched its biggest weekly drop in four months after a key meeting on Tuesday failed to yield any concrete measures to revive the industry. Property sales are likely to remain weak in the third quarter, with better-than-expected economic growth data undermining the case for stimulus in the near term, according to Morgan Stanley.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

President Donald Trump sued Dow Jones & Co., News Corp. and Rupert Murdoch for libel, according to court records.

The lawsuit comes a day after the Wall Street Journal published a story alleging that Trump once sent a suggestive birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein.

If President Donald Trump tries to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, it would almost certainly set off a courtroom battle that legal and policy experts say is bound to get messy, with uncertain impacts on the central bank, financial markets and the economy.

The tempestuous situation poses a myriad of thorny questions for which there are no easy answers considering no president ever has tried to unseat a Fed chair.

Among them:

""What is extraordinary here is the president going back and forth and discussing loudly whether he might fire or try to fire the Fed chair,"" said Bill English, the Fed's former director of monetary affairs and now a Yale professor. ""Of course, we've never gone through that, so we don't know legally how that would work and how the courts would see that and so on. So, I think it's all things that we haven't seen before, and raises real uncertainties.""

Even by Trump's standards, the events surrounding Powell of late have been stunning.

After an extended campaign of ad hominem attacks on Powell and demands for lower interest rates, Trump met with Republican congressional members Tuesday evening and asked them if he should fire the Fed chair, according to a senior administration official.

After the GOP members showed their backing for the move, the president indicated to them he would move on Powell ""soon,"" the official said.

However, no sooner did news break of the meeting then Trump told reporters that he's not considering a move, saying it's ""highly unlikely"" while simultaneously wondering out loud whether alleged mismanagement of the $2.5 billion expansion might qualify as cause.

Subsequent reports suggested that Trump's lawyers indicated that he would have a hard time legally dismissing Powell. The Supreme Court's ruling in Trump v. Wilcox this year called the Fed a ""uniquely structured, quasi-private entity"" whose governors enjoy insulation from removal for political or policy reasons.

That, of course, does not mean Trump won't try.

""It's a very high bar legally, but there also haven't been really any historical precedents for it,"" Jonathan Kanter, former assistant attorney general during the Biden administration, said on CNBC. ""So it would get litigated in court, probably be quite a bit of a circus, but, yeah, the standard is very high. It has to be for cause, and it has to be for neglect, malfeasance, abuse.""

Powell's options would entail suing and asking for a stay on any Trump removal action, Kanter said. The tactic itself could push resolution past the expiration of the Fed chair's term in May 2026.

As it winds through the legal system, the case would draw close attention and either could act as a bulwark for Fed independence, or reduce the normally sacrosanct central bank to just another political body subject to the whims of the Oval Office.

""The Supreme Court has signaled it would likely side with the Fed chair,"" Kanter said. ""It views the Fed as historically different than other independent agencies. Then it would kick the case right back down to a district court, which would determine whether the president had a basis to fire the Fed chair.""

Despite seemingly low chances of success, going after Powell still could serve a political purpose for Trump.

""I think Trump is setting it up so that there's a sword of Damocles hanging over Powell's head throughout the rest of his tenure,"" Kanter said. ""If there is a sustained period of inflation or stagflation, Trump has the ability to say, well, it's this guy's fault because he didn't lower interest rates.""

Indeed, the Trump-Powell dispute by all appearances runs deeper than qualms over the building renovations.

Trump wants sharply lower interest rates, and he wants them now, economic consequences be damned.

The president was on the attack again Friday, railing against Powell and his fellow central bankers. In a Truth Social post, Trump charged Powell and the FOMC officials are ""choking out the housing market with their high rate, making it difficult for people, especially the young, to buy a house. He is truly one of my worst appointments.""

Up until recently, Trump has reserved most of his criticism for Powell individually. But on Friday, he also said, ""the Fed Board has done nothing to stop this 'numbskull' from hurting so many people. In many ways the Board is equally to blame!"" Finally, using his nickname for Powell, he said, ""I can't tell you how dumb Too Late is - So bad for our Country!""

Besides Powell, Trump has two appointees on the board dating back to his first term: governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both of whom have said they are leaning toward a rate cut when the FOMC meets at the end of July.

Beyond those two, though, other members have not expressed any appetite for easing before the September meeting. There are 12 voters on the FOMC, and the chair is just one of them. Fed watchers including English, who served as the FOMC secretary, see policymakers pushed into a corner where cutting in July would seem like acquiescing to Trump's demands.

That's part of a larger concern on Wall Street over the reputational fallout the Fed faces as the Trump White House ramps up its efforts to use politics to influence monetary policy.

""The experience of other countries in which governments have suppressed central bank independence has generally been a combination of a slippery slope and the occasional sudden drop,"" Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economists at Capital Economics, said in a recent note. ""Unlike raising tariffs, which can be withdrawn before the real damage is done, the reputational costs from firing Powell would be harder to undo.""

Then there are the market and economic issues.

Firing Powell would be unlikely to change the committee's approach to monetary policy, and in fact could harden its position on rates.

Even if the FOMC did cut, it could do more harm than good to Trump's goal of lowering finance costs on the national debt. The last time the Fed cut, in the final four months of 2024, Treasury yields rose almost in perfect reverse correlation to the rate reductions, and the same thing could happen again if markets perceive the Fed is surrendering its inflation-fighting credentials to placate Trump.

""The historical record suggests that political interference contributed to poor monetary policy in the late '60s and early '70s, with unfavorable consequences for inflation developments,"" JPMorgan Chase chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli wrote. ""Any reduction in the independence of the Fed would likely add upside risks to an inflation outlook that is already subject to upward pressures from tariffs and somewhat elevated inflation expectations.""

While Trump wants the Fed to slash its key borrowing rate by 3 percentage points, such a move could raise inflation expectations, causing fixed income investors to demand higher yields, ""thereby increasing longer-term interest rates, weighing on the outlook for economic activity, and worsening the fiscal position,"" Feroli added.

For the time being, Powell and Co. is expected to continue to conduct business and make decisions based on data, with the constant drumbeat of Trump serving as a distraction that doesn't seem like it will go away, even if the president ultimately never tries to fire the Fed chief.

""Well, it isn't helpful to have the president be so aggressively antagonistic trying to pressure the Fed. It's not unprecedented that a president has views on monetary policy. We've seen that over time. But I think what's different about this time is that it's been pretty persistent and unrelenting,"" former Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Friday on CNBC. ""That will not change how the Fed goes about making its decisions on monetary policy.""

ORBE, Switzerland — For almost a century, a nondescript factory in an unsuspecting town beneath the Swiss mountains has played host to some of the most widely consumed coffee trends brewed up by caffeine giant Nescafe.

From the 1938 launch of its flagship soluble powdered coffee to freeze-dried granules and later coffee capsules, the Nestle-owned household brand is now targeting its latest iteration for the next generation of coffee drinkers.

""We have to develop solutions specifically to bring young people into the Nescafe brand,"" Don Howat, global category lead for Nescafe at Nestle, told CNBC.

For Nescafe, that means targeting the ballooning cold coffee market. Today, one-third (32%) of coffee consumed out-of-home is iced, according to company compiled estimates. For many younger consumers, namely Gen Z, it's often their first introduction to the ubiquitous drink.

""Nescafe's heartland is really in the morning, drunk hot,"" Howat continued. ""We're trying to move into a space which is throughout the day — more in the afternoon, consumed cold, retargeting that younger generation.""

""That provides a super exciting growth opportunity for Nescafe.""

Coffee is a big bet for Nestle, with Nescafe and sister brand Nespresso accounting for two of the company's six key priorities for 2025.

It represents a return to the core for the world's largest food and beverage company, whose main lines include coffee, pet care and food under popular brands such as Nespresso, Purina and KitKat.

Nestle's stock has lagged major rivals such as Unilever and Danone over recent years amid weaker sales growth and revised guidance, even as the sector at large has come under pressure from higher commodity prices and increased private label competition.

CEO Laurent Freixe, who took the helm in September, has vowed to refocus the business, saying a slew of acquisitions under his predecessor had ""weakened the fabric"" of the company.

""We want fewer, bigger, better innovations. We want breakthrough and impact,"" Freixe told a media event earlier this month, citing coffee as one of the categories with the highest rate of ""clear-cut"" wins.

The firm's latest gambit, Nescafe Espresso Concentrate, nevertheless marks a new approach to product development — one it plans to extend to other categories. The cold liquid concentrate, which can be used as a base for chilled caffeine drinks, was developed in a research and development (R&D) accelerator and trialed in U.S. Kroger stores before its ultimate sign off.

It is one in a stream of cold coffee products to flood the market lately, however the majority have been in the pre-mixed, ready to drink (RTD) space. Nestle says its goal is customization, with the concentrate designed to let consumers ""hack"" their coffee at home according to their preferences, for instance by adding milk, water, lemonade or other beverages.

""Most young people have grown up with coffee cold … their expectation is for cold coffee, lots of flavors, textures, additions,"" Howat said.

Launched in Australia in late 2024, the product has since expanded to the U.S., U.K., Canada, Japan, China and Singapore with plans for further markets underway. Meanwhile a collaboration with influencer Zach King is seen marketing the product at social media users.

""It's achieving what we set out to achieve,"" Howat said. ""It just takes the brand into a different space.""

The coffee giant is now hoping that by targeting new consumers and consumption habits, it could pave the way for further expansion into adjacent categories.

That includes penetrating traditional tea markets like India, China and Japan, building out customization and premiumization, and targeting new consumption occasions.

""What's interesting about younger consumers is they're drinking a lot less alcohol,"" Howat said.

Successive studies have pointed to lower alcohol consumption habits among Gen Z compared to previous generations, sparking a surge in non-alcoholic and health and wellness-oriented alternatives. July research from an ISWR survey sought to debunk that narrative, however, citing the cost-of-living crisis as a source of the perceived abstinence trend.

Nescafe nevertheless said it sees new scope to position coffee as an all-day product and sophisticated alcohol alternative.

""When they socialize in the evening with their friends, they'd like to drink something which is adult but perhaps doesn't have alcohol,"" he continued.

""That provides an opportunity for Nescafe to get into that space, perhaps with decaffeinated products, with cold products, indulgent products,"" he said.

Activist Commentary: Elliott is a very successful and astute activist investor. The firm's team includes analysts from leading tech private equity firms, engineers, operating partners – former technology CEOs and COOs. When evaluating an investment, the firm also hires specialty and general management consultants, expert cost analysts and industry specialists. Elliott often watches companies for many years before investing and has an extensive stable of impressive board candidates. The firm has historically focused on strategic activism in the technology sector and has been very successful with that strategy. However, over the past several years its activism group has grown, and Elliott has been doing a lot more governance-oriented activism and creating value from a board level at a much larger breadth of companies.

Elliott has taken a position in Global Payments.

Global Payments is a leading provider of payment processing and software solutions, focused on serving small and medium-sized merchants and select mid-market and enterprise customers. The company operates through two segments: Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions. Merchant Solutions, contributing about three-fourths of total sales, provides payment solutions to enable customers to accept card, check, and digital payments, offering authorization, settlement, funding and other services. Simply put, Global Payments, as a merchant acquirer, acts as a middleman between the merchant and card network to authorize and facilitate transactions. Through its Issuer Solutions segment, Global Payments provides comprehensive commerce solutions supporting the payment ecosystem for issuers through offerings like core processing, enterprise tokenization and more. This segment was formed in 2019 following the combination of Global Payments and Total System Services (""TSYS"") in an all-stock merger of equals to create a leading payments company with a presence in both merchant acquiring and issuer services.

Peaking in 2021 at roughly $220 per share and an enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EV/EBITDA) multiple of about 25-times, the company today trades around $80 per share and at a high single-digit multiple. The company managed to tread water during the pandemic despite the global slowdown in transactions and its focus on small and medium enterprises. However, sales growth has slowed significantly since 2020, now below the core acquiring market's high-single growth rate, implying market share loss to disruptors like Stripe, Fiserv's Clover, Shopify and others. That is all very interesting, but not what this activist campaign is about. This is about a company that made a poorly received ""bet the farm"" acquisition and is now at an inflection point that will determine its future.

On April 17, Global Payments announced that it had agreed to acquire Worldpay from Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) and private equity firm GTCR. The three-way cash-and-share acquisition also involved Global Payments divesting its Issuer Solutions (previously known as TSYS) business to FIS in a deal which valued Worldpay at $24.25 billion and Issuer Solutions at $13.5 billion. Global Payments' shares fell 17% following the announcement for many good reasons: (i) this acquisition was announced after management's commitments at their 2024 Investor Day to pursue increased shareholder returns, divestments, and, at most, small bolt-on acquisitions, (ii) management has a poor track record of integrating (or failing to integrate) acquisitions such as TSYS and AdvancedMD, and (iii) the company paid too much for Worldpay – acquiring it at 10.5-times EBITDA versus the 6.5-times multiple Global Payments trades at. Moreover, investors have grown skeptical of deals of this sort in the payments space after two of the three largest deals made in a 2019 wave of consolidation have been unwound (Global Payments – TSYS and FIS – Worldpay).

But the good news is that failure is priced in. Management thinks the Worldpay transaction makes strategic sense for Global Payments, simplifying its business model into a pure-play commerce solutions provider, and that it will provide $600 million in annual cost synergies and $200 million in revenue synergies. The market is not believing this or has little faith that management can achieve these synergies. From where the stock trades today, if management can come anywhere close to achieving these synergies and executing on this transaction, it will be a nice return for stockholders. What this company needs right now is help in execution and enhanced credibility, and Elliott can provide both.

There are companies that could use shareholder representation on the board and companies that need it. Global Payments is much closer to the latter. A reconstituted board that holds management accountable, commits to an M&A moratorium and adds members with experience integrating large acquisitions will almost immediately restore investor confidence in the company. Thereafter, the board can start to de-lever and possibly buy back shares at the appropriate time if Global Payments' stock is still significantly undervalued. We would also expect the board to do the most important thing boards do – oversee and evaluate senior management, but we do not think there would be any material management changes ahead of such a large acquisition like this.

Given the almost universal opposition to the Worldpay acquisition and the low investor confidence in management, we would expect that Elliott will be able to walk onto this board with any reasonable slate. In a contested situation for the 10-person unitary board using a universal proxy card, Global Payments would almost certainly face significant defeat. Elliott recently won two of four seats at Phillips 66 in a proxy fight with a much higher degree of difficulty. The fund made its reputation as an activist almost two decades ago as primarily a strategic activist in technology companies, making great returns getting companies sold or participating in the acquisition. However, Elliott has since evolved into a much broader and comprehensive activist in strategy, sector and geography. Today, the firm often does its best activism from the board level. We believe that a reconstituted board that includes an Elliott representative will restore investor confidence and increase the probability of a successful integration of Worldpay.

Along the ""last road in Ireland,"" on the country's rugged west coast, June O'Connell's business Skellig Six18 makes gin and whiskey — a time-intensive process guided by the wind, rain and cool temperatures that roll in year-round off the Atlantic.

America was a natural target market once their first spirits were ready to sell in 2019, according to O'Connell, given its strong familiarity with Ireland and big appetite for premium drinks. As an independent supplier, negotiations with distributors, marketers and retailers took more than a year, and her first products left County Kerry in November 2023 for a U.S. launch in early 2024.

Then the political tide started turning in the White House.

""Once it became clear which way things were heading, people were trying to get a lot of product stateside ahead of tariffs. We did do some of that, but now warehouses are full, importers are saying don't send any more, and it's only the big customers who are getting priority,"" O'Connell told CNBC.

Since the start of the year, President Donald Trump's unpredictable tariff announcements have been roiling businesses of all sizes.

The European Union in particular has drawn Trump's ire for its 198 billion euro ($231 billion) trade surplus in goods with the U.S.

He argues tariffs are needed to create a more balanced relationship; EU officials, however, argue that trade is more even across goods, services and investments, and have pledged to increase oil and gas purchases to narrow the gap.

Last weekend, Trump announced he is planning to hit the EU with a blanket tariff rate of 30% from Aug. 1, after last-minute negotiations failed to produce a framework deal. Huge uncertainty now hangs over whether an agreement can be struck in the next two weeks, and what details or compromises it might contain.

The Trump administration has already imposed a 10% baseline duty on EU imports, along with higher rates for automotives and metals.

The fact that the U.K.'s trade deal with the U.S. maintained a 10% baseline tariff with some sector exemptions has led many to believe that this could be Europe's best hope. The Financial Times reported Friday that Trump is now taking a harder line in EU negotiations and pushing for minimum tariffs of 15-20%, citing people briefed on the talks. CNBC has not independently confirmed the report.

The EU's food and drink trade with the U.S. is worth almost 30 billion euros, and trade group FoodDrinkEurope warned this week that any escalation in tariffs — which are generally paid by the importer — would hit European producers and farmers, while limiting choice and driving up costs for U.S. consumers.

Even the 10% U.S. import tariff imposed in April has been a blow to business, Skellig Six18's O'Connell said, with the final price impact on the consumer being much higher once additional costs have been passed up the supply chain.

""In terms of pricing, 30% [tariffs] would be untenable. The whole situation definitely stifles your ambition stateside,"" she added.

For Franck Choisne, president of French distillery Combier, a 10% tariff has been just about manageable. Founded in 1834, Combier is best known for making the liqueur triple sec – used in margarita cocktails – and the U.S. represents around 25% of its overall sales.

However, Choisne notes that the 10% tariff comes on top of a hit from the currency market. A weaker U.S. dollar this year has made it more expensive for the U.S. to import foreign goods, an additional dampener on demand.

A 30% tariff, plus exchange rate effects, would mean an overall rate of 45-50% is reflected in final consumer prices, he said, a level that could halve his company's U.S. sales.

""We understand President Trump wants a better balance between imports and exports, but at that 30% level then of course the EU will respond, trade will be hit and it will be a lose-lose situation,"" he said.

U.S. exporters of products such as bourbon would also suffer, a factor Choisne said kept him optimistic that the two sides will eventually negotiate a zero-tariff deal for the spirits industry.

In Italy's Lombardy countryside, more than half a million huge wheels of Grana Padano cheese roll off the supply lines of family-run business Zanetti each year. The company, which also makes parmesan and other hard cheeses, exports over 70% of its products, and the U.S. accounts for 15% of total turnover.

According to its president and CEO Attilio Zenetti, the volatility created by tariffs this year has been unlike any before, with contradictory announcements generating a huge amount of additional admin.

""It gives a lot of uncertainty and does not allow us to organise a real strategy,"" he said, bar trying to ship as many products as possible before higher rates potentially come into effect.

Zenetti said that the weaker dollar plus tariffs had already increased the company's U.S. retail prices by 25%. ""Further increases would of course directly reflect again on U.S. wholesale and retail prices and we fear that this will affect volumes,"" he said.

For some businesses, mitigating the tariff impact has meant looking at new supply chain options.

Alex Altmann, partner at accounting firm Lubbock Fine and VP of the British Chamber of Commerce in Germany, said that some EU manufacturers were considering moving their assembly lines to the U.K. to try to take advantage of its existing 10% agreement. In doing so, they must navigate the complexity of ""rules of origin"" that determine the source of a product for tax purposes.

Altmann gave the example of a German kitchen appliance manufacturer with strong demand in the U.S. The company sources most of its materials cheaply from Asia and imports them into the EU at a low tariff rate. It is not too difficult to then shift the final assembly process to a factory in the U.K., he said, to benefit from a 10% — instead of a potential 30% — tariff on products as they enters the U.S.

""We might not be facing these big tariff differences for a long time, but even if you cash in for a few months it's quite significant money,"" he added.

Elsewhere, big corporations are considering shifting at least some manufacturing to the U.S. German industrial giant Siemens, for example, told CNBC it had taken steps to localize manufacturing, and engineering group Bosch likewise said it was prioritizing a local-for-local model as it looks to expand its North America business.

However, for Skellig Six18's O'Connell, moving production is not possible. That's because the production of ""origin protected"" items — like an Irish whiskey, Italian parma ham or French champagne — can't be moved elsewhere.

Instead, O'Connell's is focusing on new potential markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America, but noted the difficulty of doing so in places without solid existing whiskey sales. Combier distillery's Franck Choisne, meanwhile, pointed out that becoming established somewhere new is resource-intensive, costly and could take years. In other words, it's no easy fix for a decline in U.S. sales.

""At times like this I just try to remember that I'm in an industry that's nearly 700 years old, requires patience and reminds you that things don't last forever,"" O'Connell said. ""You just have to keep controlling the controllables.""

What would it take for you to feel financially comfortable?

For most of the people who work with Joy Slabaugh, a certified financial planner, licensed therapist and founder of Wealth Alignment Institute, the answer is the same.

""It's always a little bit more than what they have,"" she says. ""Regardless of how much money they have, it's just a little bit more.""

On average, Americans say they'd need a net worth of $839,000 to feel financially comfortable, according to a recent survey from Charles Schwab. Members of Gen Z say they'd be comfortable with less — just $329,000, on average.

You may be wondering what net worth could afford you a comfortable life — and what your current net worth actually is.

If you're not sure the answer to either, don't worry. While financial experts say tracking net worth can be a useful tool in your money management arsenal, it presents an incomplete picture of your financial life.

""It's just one metric — and often a misleading one. I've seen clients fixated on their net worth while completely disconnected from their financial reality,"" Slabaugh says. ""Tracking net worth without tracking values or lifestyle intentions is like watching your pulse without knowing if your heart is healthy.""

Your net worth is the total value of everything you own, after accounting for money that you owe, and is a useful shorthand for overall wealth. To call yourself a millionaire, for example, you generally need a net worth of $1 million or more.

To find yours, add up your assets, such as bank accounts, stock holdings, physical valuables and home equity, before subtracting your liabilities, which include credit card debt, student loans and mortgage balances.

Theoretically, this number gives you a pretty decent overview of your actual wealth. Someone may appear to be wealthy if they have a $1 million house, for instance. Not so much if they also have $2 million in debt.

It's not always a very practical yardstick, however. For one thing, two people with the same net worth could have wildly different financial situations. One person may have a big chunk of assets in liquid cash, giving them plenty of spending power, while the other has the bulk of their wealth tied up in retirement accounts.

Rather than focusing on one number, you're better off examining how money flows in and out of your life, and whether or not you're making progress toward your goals, experts say.

""[Net worth is] a 'snapshot' of one's financial position at a single point in time,"" says Randy Bruns, a CFP and principle at Model Wealth in Naperville, Illinois. ""In contrast, their cash flow statement acts more like the 'video,' capturing the ongoing movement of money in and out that ultimately shapes their net worth.""

When it comes to feeling financially comfortable, it's smart to make sure you have a few critical bases covered, says Slabaugh. These include not only making ends meet, but having enough breathing room to pay down debt, build emergency savings and invest for the future.

Beyond that, no number in particular is going to bring you comfort unless you get to the heart of what you want from your money, she says. For many of Slabaugh's clients, building wealth means having security. For others, money is a means to flexibility and freedom.

""In nearly every case, the comfort isn't just financial — it's emotional,"" Slabaugh says.

Financial comfort, she says, comes when your money management aligns with your core values. Someone who values freedom, for instance, could aim to beef up their travel savings while looking for misaligned areas in their budget to slash.

""It could be, 'I'm spending hundreds of dollars a month on streaming services to escape the fact that I feel stuck. Let me divert that to a vacation fund, and now I can actually save to go to some of these places that I'm dreaming about while watching these shows,'"" Slabaugh says.

Instead of striving for a particular number in your bank account, ask yourself what about having that amount of money would do for you and what about your life would change if you already had it, Slabaugh says.

""These questions are often more revealing — and more actionable — than a net worth target ever could be.""

President Donald Trump said Saturday that even if the courts release the grand jury transcripts in the criminal cases of notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his convicted procurer of young girls, Ghislaine Maxwell, ""nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics.""

""It will always be more, more, more. MAGA!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Trump's post comes one day after the Department of Justice asked federal judges to unseal the grand jury testimonies in the criminal cases, following a request by Trump.

Trump on Thursday said that he had asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to ""produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval.""

The request to the DOJ comes amid growing pressure on Trump, including from some of his most loyal supporters, to release files in connection with Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.

Trump's Saturday Truth Social post suggests that the pressure campaign, which has lasted for weeks, is not abating.

The president also appeared to signal that he is not planning to take further steps in response to the critics' concerns.

""I have asked the Justice Department to release all Grand Jury testimony with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, subject only to Court Approval,"" Trump wrote on his social media.

""With that being said, and even if the Court gave its full and unwavering approval, nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics making the request,"" he continued.

Trump's Truth Social post also reflects a subtle change in his language about the request.

On Saturday, he stated that he had requested the Justice Department release ""all"" grand jury testimony in connection with the criminal cases, in contrast to Thursday, when he said he had requested the release of ""pertinent"" testimony.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the difference in the two posts.

Trump's post also comes one day after he sued media mogul Rupert Murdoch after The Wall Street Journal — which Murdoch owns — published an article describing a ""bawdy"" letter that Trump sent for Epstein's 50th birthday.

Trump has denied that the letter is his. He is seeking damages of at least $10 billion in the defamation lawsuit.

 Charles Schwab plans to offer spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum, aiming to attract clients who want to consolidate crypto holdings with their traditional assets. 

Charles Schwab is preparing to expand its crypto offerings by launching spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to CEO Rick Wurster.

In an interview with CNBC on Friday, Wurster said Schwab clients already hold significant exposure to crypto via exchange-traded products (ETPs), owning more than 20% of the industry's crypto ETP market. However, he noted that crypto still represents a relatively small portion of clients' total wealth, around $25 billion out of $10.8 trillion.

“We anticipate launching Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) sometime soon so that our clients have access to that,” he said. “We think that will be an acceleration of our growth.”

The CEO claimed that many clients currently keep 98% of their wealth with Schwab but hold just 1% to 2% of their crypto assets with digital-native firms. “They really want to bring it back to Schwab because they trust us. They want us to sit alongside their other assets,” he added.

Wurster said that Schwab is “absolutely” looking to compete against crypto exchanges like Coinbase by introducing spot crypto trading. “If they're buying their crypto at Coinbase, we would love to see them bring their crypto back to Schwab,” he said.

Earlier this year, Wurster said the company expects an April 2026 launch window to provide spot Bitcoin trading services to Schwab clients. At the time, he cited a 400% increase in traffic to Schwab's crypto website as evidence of investor interest in digital assets.

Schwab has increased its involvement in the crypto sector amid growing regulatory clarity. In 2025, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Reserve rescinded earlier restrictive guidelines issued after the FTX collapse. The change allows banks to participate in crypto activities such as custody and trading.

Following approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Schwab added Bitcoin and Ether ETFs to its platform. The company also provides other crypto-related products, including mixed ETFs, mutual funds, and Bitcoin options, according to its website.

A survey conducted in March by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon found that 83% of institutional investors intend to increase their crypto holdings in 2025, with many already investing in altcoins beyond Bitcoin and Ether.

The survey identified XRP (XRP) and Solana (SOL) as the most favored assets among respondents. It also showed that most expect to allocate 5% or more of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies this year.

Similarly, a May report by Fireblocks found that 90% of institutional players are using or exploring stablecoins, with almost half already deploying them for payments.

While the Bitcoin price has managed to hold close to its all-time high levels, there is still bearish pressure lurking in the background for the digital asset. With the surge to new peaks over the weekend, there have been multiple gaps created, and history suggests that Bitcoin will have to drop back down to fill these gaps before it can begin to rally again. These gaps now point to a return to its previous all-time high levels before the rally began last week.

Crypto analyst Youriverse explained the Bitcoin situation and why there could be a crash coming soon. First thing he pointed to was the fact that the cryptocurrency had made a V-shaped pattern after hitting its all-time high above $123,000, and this formation is usually bearish. This is because it shows a shift toward sellers being in control as profit-taking becomes more pronounced. This is only the start as more bearish developments are now in play.

Two Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) were created on the 4-Hour chart, and one has already been filled. The first happened with the retest at $119,000 and $120,000, which eventually led to a rejection. Therefore, this leaves one more gap to be filled, and it's the 4H FVG at its previous highs. This gives credence to the analysis and suggests that the other gaps created could be filled as well.

The analyst puts the second 4H FVG just above $111,000, which coincides with the previous high turned resistance. He believes that this is what makes the level a “magnet,” especially as investors begin to take profit. Strong selling pressure could provide the added momentum needed for the price to fall toward the $111,000 level.

Another major problem right now is that the Bitcoin price has formed a CME gap over the weekend, and with the retracement in price, the CME gap is looking filled at around the $114,000-$116,000 level. There has already been an attempt earlier in the week. But the $114,000 was not touched. If this CME gap is filled, then it makes it even more likely that the second FVG will be filled at $111,000.

Although the bearishness of the gaps still looms heavy over the Bitcoin price, there is still bullishness left for the cryptocurrency. One example of this is the rising volume alongside the increase in price, suggesting that the volume is being dominated by buyers at this level. Coinglass data shows the daily volume has averaged over $100 billion this week.

The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is currently still in Greed, and is yet to enter the Extreme Greed territory, which is usually when a top is marked. Open interest is also sitting close to all-time high levels, which could lead to a price push before a correction.

In a remarkable turn, ether exchange‑traded funds (ETFs) outpaced their bitcoin counterparts in daily inflows for the first time, pulling in over $600 million against bitcoin's $523 million. This shift underscores a growing institutional appetite for Ethereum, as heavyweight players like BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity pour fresh capital into ETH vehicles.

Simultaneously, billionaire backer Peter Thiel's Founders Fund has quietly amassed a 9.1% stake in BitMine Immersion Technologies, signaling confidence in Ethereum's potential beyond mere speculation. Together, these developments highlight a broader migration of treasuries toward programmable blockchains. For investors pondering portfolio pivots, this moment could define the best crypto to buy now.

In a major shift, ether exchange traded funds (ETFs) pulled ahead of bitcoin ETFs in daily investor cash for the first time ever. Ether ETFs attracted $602.02 million, just edging out Bitcoin ETFs' $522.6 million. Combined, crypto ETFs saw massive inflows totaling $1.1 billion that day, showing strong institutional demand.



This surge reflects a growing corporate pivot towards Ethereum. While Bitcoin remains the largest crypto by value, companies increasingly see Ethereum's broader utility beyond just holding. BitMine Immersion Technologies, for example, revealed it now holds over $500 million in ether.

On the flip side, Bitcoin's recent “halving” cut mining rewards by 50%, making it less profitable and pushing miners like BitMine to seek new strategies – including building Ethereum treasuries and exploring revenue streams like staking.

Peter Thiel's Founders Fund backs this move, quietly acquiring a 9.1% stake in BitMine. This signals Ethereum being viewed as a next-generation “digital gold” with real-world uses in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and stablecoins. Its smart contracts and staking yields offer more dynamic treasury options. Pending U.S. stablecoin regulations could further boost Ethereum's institutional appeal.

Ethereum's rise in corporate treasuries is just beginning, but it's already signaling a broader shift in how businesses approach digital assets. Instead of simply holding Bitcoin for exposure, companies are now actively using Ethereum, staking it, building on it, and preparing for regulatory clarity that could open the floodgates for traditional finance.

With companies like SharpLink and BitMine, plus backers like Peter Thiel betting big, the message is clear: the race isn't just about holding the most Bitcoin anymore. It's about who can use their crypto most effectively, and in that race, Ethereum is quickly pulling ahead.

While everyone is debating if $ETH can break $3.6k

SharpLink quietly accumulating 157K ETH since July 1 which is worth nearly $500M.

This looks like long-term positioning.

When institutions start buying in size like this, it's rarely random. They see something coming ETH ETF… pic.twitter.com/UuKpeGyvx1

— Henry (@LordOfAlts) July 19, 2025



In a nutshell, this Ethereum treasury boom reflects changing strategies in corporate finance. Over $1.6 billion worth of ether was snapped up in a month as prices broke $3,200. As more companies realize they can earn rewards and drive innovation through Ethereum, we're likely to see many more headlines about this second-place crypto taking center stage.

The surprising ETF inflows and high‑profile backing of Ethereum treasuries signal a strategic shift for institutional investors, who are no longer content with passive holdings. As staking rewards and smart contract utility take center stage, ETH's appeal has never been clearer. It stands out as one of the best crypto to buy now.

A Telegram-based trading bot powered by the $SNORT token, available on both Solana and Ethereum blockchains, Snorter benefits from Ethereum's growing institutional interest. Its staking reward system taps into the demand for yield, positioning Snorter as a strong contender in the current market.



Snorter Bot Token (SNORT) has raised over $2 million in its ongoing ICO, signaling a major step in the bot's mission to catch meme coin breakouts before they occur. The project is generating buzz within Telegram communities, attracting attention for its speed and potential returns.

By operating on Solana, a fast, low-fee blockchain, Snorter ensures quick, high-volume trading, putting it ahead of competitors on slower networks.

Snorter's custom private RPC connection further boosts its edge, providing faster access to token data and quicker trade execution, reducing slippage during volatile moments. This gives the bot an advantage over others, capturing trades before they even get noticed.

Beyond speed, Snorter incorporates MEV protection and honeypot detection to safeguard traders from risky situations like sandwich attacks and fake liquidity tokens. Its infrastructure ensures users can maximize profits while minimizing risks.

The bot's real-time copy trading feature allows newcomers to automatically mirror successful wallets, offering a hands-off way to benefit from expert traders. With its presale already outpacing projects like Banana Gun, Snorter is gaining momentum.

As Snorter ramps up development, it's positioning itself as a key player in the Telegram-based trading bot space.

Born after Bitcoin's halving cycle, Bitcoin Hyper combines Bitcoin's store-of-value nature with improved liquidity. As miners and treasuries explore new options, this token offers a fresh take on crypto's original narrative.



Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a fast Layer-2 solution built on the Solana Virtual Machine, has raised over $300,000 in just 48 hours. Total presale funding has now surpassed $3.31 million, reflecting rising investor confidence.

Rather than betting on Bitcoin's price alone, backers are investing in what the network could evolve into. Bitcoin Hyper brings speed, usability, and smart contract capability to BTC's foundation.

The network uses a zero-knowledge bridge to lock BTC and mint a wrapped version on its Layer-2, allowing fast transfers without third parties. Redeeming BTC is simple: burn the token, release the original.

By combining Solana's execution layer with Bitcoin's base value, HYPER keeps trust intact while unlocking flexibility. Users can move assets freely without giving up custody or relying on middlemen.

Developers can already build with live SDKs and Rust support, skipping the steep learning curve seen in earlier efforts like Stacks. This makes Bitcoin Hyper easier to adopt and faster to deploy.

With Ethereum leading on real-world utility, Bitcoin's next growth path may come from added programmability. Investors are looking past today's price and toward long-term infrastructure. As stated by one of the well-known crypto YouTubers, 99Bitcoins, Bitcoin Hyper is ready to explode.

More than 191 million HYPER tokens are now staked on the protocol, earning a dynamic 274% APY. That kind of commitment suggests early users aren't just speculating; they're building for the future.

Best Wallet Token is built for smooth cross-chain transactions and caters to the rise of institutional interest in programmable assets. With strong security and a user-friendly interface, it's becoming a favorite among investors.



Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers Best Wallet, a new non-custodial crypto wallet focused on strong security and beginner-friendly tools. The project is currently in Phase 2 of its roadmap.

So far, it has added fiat onramps, support for multiple wallets, and multi-chain access across Ethereum, BSC, Base, and Bitcoin. More updates are already in the pipeline.

Users control their private keys at all times, giving them full ownership of their assets. This key feature helps guard against rising threats of unauthorized access.

Security goes further with multi-factor authentication options, including biometrics. That adds an extra layer to ensure only the wallet owner can log in.

The wallet also filters out suspicious tokens, helping users avoid common DEX scams. This is especially useful for those trading newer or low-cap coins.

Developers say future updates will include even stronger anti-fraud protections and tools to block MEV-style exploits. The aim is to give users peace of mind with every trade.

With security and usability at its core, Best Wallet is shaping up to be a reliable option for both first-time users and seasoned crypto traders.

Ether's ETF triumph and Peter Thiel's quiet leap into Ethereum treasuries mark a defining moment for digital‑asset investing. While Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of crypto portfolios, Ethereum's programmable edge and staking potential are drawing unprecedented institutional capital.

As regulators finalize stablecoin rules and corporate reserves shift toward ETH, portfolio diversification is more strategic than ever. Those searching for the best crypto to buy now should keep these corporate shifts in mind before reaching a decision.

Oops, something went wrong

Wall Street's most prominent crypto bull just made his biggest bet yet—and it's not on Bitcoin. Tom Lee, the Fundstrat strategist known for his prescient bitcoin price forecasts, has been appointed chair of BitMine Immersion Technologies, a little-known company positioning itself as the “MicroStrategy of Ethereum.”

In a recent CNBC interview, Lee laid out his case for why Ethereum could be the next trillion-dollar opportunity, while also defending the market's concentration in AI leaders like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). His insights offer a roadmap for investors navigating today's tech-heavy, AI-driven market.

Lee's enthusiasm for Ethereum centers on what he calls the “rediscovery of Ethereum” as institutional adoption accelerates. The catalyst? Stablecoins. Lee described stablecoin development by companies like Circle (NYSE:CRCL) as the “ChatGPT moment for crypto,” driving unprecedented Wall Street interest in building on Ethereum's blockchain.

The numbers support his thesis. Currently, 30% of Ethereum's network usage comes from stablecoins, with JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) stablecoin and Robinhood's (NASDAQ:HOOD) tokenizing business choosing Ethereum as their foundation. More than 60% of all tokenized real-world assets now live on Ethereum, establishing it as Wall Street's “preferred choice” for blockchain infrastructure.

Lee referenced former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen‘s prediction that stablecoins could grow to over $2 trillion, which he sees as “exponential usage of Ethereum and the Ethereum token.” This institutional adoption story mirrors Bitcoin's corporate treasury adoption narrative that drove its meteoric rise.

Through BitMine Immersion Technologies, Lee is executing a bold capital markets strategy. The company recently completed a private investment in public equity transaction, selling 55 million shares at around $4.50 each for $250 million. Lee confirmed this money is being used primarily to buy Ethereum, leveraging “whatever relative premium exists to actually use capital markets to grow their Ethereum holdings.”

However, investors should understand the valuation dynamics. With the PIPE shares bringing total outstanding shares to at least 61 million—significantly higher than the 6 million often reported—the company's market capitalization runs into billions, even at lower stock prices. This means investors are paying “many multiples of the value of the ether you're buying,” betting on Ethereum's future appreciation rather than getting exposure at net asset value.

Lee's market perspective extends beyond crypto to the broader AI revolution. He argues in a CNBC interview that companies like Nvidia, which he calls “scarcer than da Vinci,” deserve their premium valuations. Trading at around 30 times earnings, Nvidia's multiple “is not that extended given how important they are to the AI ecosystem.

His defense of market concentration addresses a common investor concern: the top 10 companies represent 40% of market capitalization, with Nvidia alone comprising nearly 8%. Lee counters that these companies represent a “huge share of earnings growth,” particularly as the S&P 500 benefits from being “at the center of AI.”

See Also: A must-have for all crypto enthusiasts: Sign up for the Gemini Credit Card today and earn rewards on Bitcoin Ether, or 60+ other tokens, with every purchase.

He points to a counterintuitive valuation argument: despite the market enduring “six essentially black swans in the last five years” and thriving in terms of earnings, the mean S&P multiple (equal weight) sits around 16—lower than the 17.9 multiple on the eve of Covid. Companies producing “durable, sustained earnings growth” like Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), Nvidia, and Tesla deserve higher multiples, Lee told CNBC.

Lee's dual thesis—defending AI leaders while betting big on Ethereum—reflects a broader shift in how institutional investors view technology infrastructure. His argument that financial innovation, including Circle and other cryptocurrencies, contributes significant earnings growth to the S&P suggests crypto adoption has moved beyond speculative trading to become a legitimate earnings driver.

For investors, Lee's strategy offers a template: identify the infrastructure plays that will benefit from massive capital expenditure trends, whether that's Nvidia for AI computation or Ethereum for financial tokenization. However, his BitMine play also illustrates the premium investors pay for exposure to these themes through public markets.

The question for investors isn't whether these megatrends will continue—Lee's track record suggests they will. It's whether the current valuations, from Nvidia's 30x multiple to BitMine's significant premium to its Ethereum holdings, already reflect these opportunities or still offer room for growth.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum hits new highs, but is ETH's rally built on a bubble?","https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-hits-new-highs-but-is-eths-rally-built-on-a-bubble/","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 15:01:50 GMT","

Ethereum's rally is fueled by derivatives and arbitrage, lacking strong spot demand or long-term conviction.



Ethereum's recent gains are largely powered by leveraged derivatives trading and basis-driven ETF flows. Real investor participation remains weak, making the rally structurally fragile.

Ethereum [ETH] is climbing again, but the foundations of this rally look shaky.

While prices are up, most of the momentum is coming from leveraged bets in the derivatives market rather than steady spot buying.



Even inflows into ETH ETFs, once seen as a bullish signal, appear to be driven more by short-term trading strategies than long-term conviction.

As Ethereum's price tests new highs, the question now is whether the rally can hold without stronger backing from real investors.

Ethereum's 24-hour trading volume shows that derivatives are still doing the heavy lifting.

Between the 10th and 17th of July, daily futures and perpetuals trading ranged from $39.5 billion to a massive $65.3 billion, completely overshadowing spot volumes, which barely nudged above $3 billion.

Even on the 17th of July, with ETF-driven interest spiking, spot activity remained a small slice of the total market action.

Source: Cryptoquant Quicktake

This persistent imbalance shows how little actual buying is backing ETH's rally. The overwhelming share of volume is speculative, likely driven by short-term traders and arbitrage desks.

Until the spot component grows meaningfully, the rally's structure remains vulnerable to sudden unwinding by over-leveraged participants.

Ethereum ETFs just posted a record weekly net inflow of $1.78 billion, pushing total net assets to $17.3 billion.

This looks like a resounding vote of confidence. But dig deeper, and it's clear that much of this capital is likely tied to basis trades – delta-neutral strategies that profit from discrepancies between spot and futures prices.

Source: SoSoValue

These aren't long-only bets. They're hedged positions where traders often short futures against ETF longs, applying latent sell pressure to derivatives markets.

This arbitrage dynamic artificially boosts ETF flows without actually indicating directional conviction.

The ‘Basis trade' is booming again. The 30-day Weighted Annualized ETH Basis Return has surged to 14%, its highest since early March.

That spike reflects widening gaps between spot and futures pricing – fertile ground for arbitrage, but also a warning sign.

Source: Cryptoquant Quicktake

Aggressive basis expansion has usually coincided with highly leveraged market conditions. Traders borrow to exploit spreads, inflating derivatives activity without meaningful spot participation.

The problem? These flows can reverse fast, especially when funding flips negative or volatility returns.

To sustain the rally, ETH needs more than just basis-driven liquidity. It needs long-only inflows, genuine conviction, and real demand – none of which are clearly visible yet. Without that shift, price strength remains at the mercy of derivatives.

On-Chain Data Signals Market Uncertainty","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:6cf17a372094b:0-will-bitcoin-impede-or-support-altcoin-rally-on-chain-data-signals-market-uncertainty/","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 13:00:32 GMT","

According to an on-chain analyst on X, Bitcoin has decoupled from other cryptocurrencies or altcoins, which could lead to a severe price downturn within the market over the next day.

Why Traders Should Brace For Impact

In a July 18 post on the social media platform X, Joao Wedson, founder of crypto analytics firm Alphractal, reported that the Bitcoin price might witness a significant drop over the next day. The crypto analyst based his conclusion on multiple results obtained from on-chain analysis using three major metrics. 

First, Wedson referenced an earlier post made on X by Alphractal, saying that the market is currently dominated by long positions. According to the analyst, the effect of these long positions wouldn't necessarily last long in a market where the shorts have been liquidated — a phenomenon which also holds for the reverse case. 

The chart above is from the Correlation Heatmap – BTCUSDT versus ALTCOINS metric, which reads the trajectory of the two crypto categories and compares them. Using the chart as a foundation, Wedson mentioned that altcoins are decoupling from Bitcoin. 

When altcoins cease to follow the premier cryptocurrency's lead, the development could be subject to a couple of interpretations, which affect market sentiment. As a result, it is normal to expect increased market volatility.

Wedson also referenced the Altcoin Season Index Vs Bitcoin metric, which is used to measure if altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin within a specific period. According to the analyst, this Altcoin Season Index is currently on the rise, which is typically a positive sign for the altcoins. 

However, if historical trends are anything to go by, a rising Altcoin Season Index might be a negative signal for Bitcoin. Wedson explained that the Bitcoin market might experience a dump, dragging along with it the currently rising Altcoins, to re-establish market balance.

The crypto pundit also cited the Alpha Quant Signal as an influence in his conclusion. Wedson pointed out that the metric flashed a sell, which was expected, seeing as some significant whales recently added to the sell pressure on Bitcoin by selling a fraction of their holdings.

Outlook For The Altcoins

Even as the market flashes ominous signs, Joao Wedson expressed optimism in the viability of the beginning of an altcoin rally, saying he doesn't believe this is the final leg down for the crypto market. “But it's likely a sign that the market is about to form a new price base. So be cautious with the traps that might show up along the way,” the analyst added. 

As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $117,783, reflecting a mere 0.2% price increase in the past 24 hours. Representing the other camp, Ethereum, the “king of altcoins,” jumped by 2.23% in 24 hours and is currently valued at $3,562.

Cardano (ADA) just broke past the $0.80 mark, and the crypto community is buzzing with excitement. The odds of an ETF approval are climbing to 84%. Yeah, that's right. Traders are keeping a close watch to see how this might reshape the altcoin landscape. But what does it really mean for crypto payroll and the broader market?

Cardano's price has recently crossed above $0.80, which is quite a turnaround after weeks of hovering below key resistance levels. This jump comes after a solid 14% rally over the past week, bouncing back from a low of $0.54. The rise in price is closely linked to the growing likelihood of a spot ADA ETF being approved, which has now hit 84% on Polymarket. This shift in sentiment seems to reflect a growing confidence among traders, fueled by speculation around new crypto products and clearer regulations in the U.S.

People have also noted a rounding bottom on the chart, which is often a sign of a shift in market direction. The increase in ETF approval odds came alongside more buying activity, so whether ADA continues to rise depends on whether it can maintain its position above these crucial levels.

Regulatory clarity is a big deal for crypto payroll solutions. Especially in Asia, where countries are putting clearer legal frameworks in place for cryptocurrencies. Once businesses understand the compliance requirements better, it reduces the risk of legal penalties, thus encouraging more companies to adopt crypto payroll. This could lead to greater acceptance of crypto payments, particularly stablecoins, which are less volatile than traditional cryptocurrencies.

The implications of regulatory clarity go beyond compliance; they also encourage innovation and investment in crypto. As institutional interest increases, startups can utilize this momentum to create crypto-friendly payroll platforms that meet the needs of both businesses and employees. The rise of crypto payroll for startups and the trend of ""Pay Me in Bitcoin"" among tech workers show how salary payments are changing.

Aside from the ETF chatter, Cardano's network has also seen a spike in activity, with over $100 million locked in Cardano-based decentralized applications since late June. This increase suggests that more people are adopting the blockchain's offerings, like lending, trading, and liquidity pools. The uptick in on-chain activity supports Cardano's price rise, as users engage more with ADA-based applications.

For startups, this growth offers a chance to incorporate crypto solutions into their financial operations. As Cardano's ecosystem expands, businesses can take advantage of its technology to access decentralized financial services and innovative payment solutions more easily. Plus, the focus on stablecoins in Cardano's treasury strategy highlights their role in providing stable value and facilitating smoother crypto payments.

Looking ahead, analysts think that if ADA gets an ETF approval, it could draw more institutional interest and push prices up across the altcoin market. An approved Cardano ETF would likely unleash billions from institutional investors, increasing demand and liquidity for ADA and possibly other altcoins. This could enhance market credibility and encourage broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance.

But, let's not forget that short-term pullbacks often follow previous rallies linked to ETF approvals in crypto. Traders are on high alert, especially regarding the regulatory response to the current bid for a Cardano spot ETF. These developments will significantly impact market dynamics.

Cardano's recent price surge and rising ETF approval odds have sparked new interest in the project. With substantial trading volumes and increased activity on the blockchain, ADA may be positioned for more gains. The combination of regulatory clarity and network growth presents an opportunity for crypto payroll solutions to thrive, signaling a shift in how businesses are incorporating cryptocurrency into their financial operations.

As the landscape for crypto payroll evolves, companies need to be informed and flexible to make the most of this growing market. The future of crypto payroll looks promising, and Cardano's developments could be a catalyst for innovation and adoption across the industry.

Oops, something went wrong

Written by Aditya Raghunath at The Motley Fool Canada

With Bitcoin hovering near all-time highs, investors would be looking to gain access to the disruptive blockchain segment right now. In this article, I have identified two quality growth stocks that provide you with exposure to this rapidly expanding market, allowing you to generate outsized gains over the upcoming decade.

Valued at a market cap of US$104 billion, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally. The tech stock has returned more than 475% to shareholders in the last three years as Bitcoin prices have risen from US$16,000 in early 2023 to US$120,000 today.

Coinbase has increased sales from US$3.2 billion in 2022 to US$6.6 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, analysts forecast revenue to reach US$8.2 billion by 2028.

The crypto heavyweight continues to expand its portfolio of products and solutions. It recently partnered with Shopify, bringing crypto payments to mainstream e-commerce. With over two million merchants now able to accept USDC payments on Shopify's platform, this creates a new revenue stream and demonstrates the real-world utility of cryptocurrency beyond trading.

Coinbase's acquisition of Deribit, the leading crypto options platform with 80% market share, expands its derivatives capabilities and enhances institutional offerings. This transaction positions Coinbase as having the most comprehensive trading portfolio in the crypto space, spanning spot, perpetuals, and options.

The new Coinbase Business product targets the underserved small and medium business market, offering comprehensive financial services including payments, treasury management, and earning opportunities with up to a 4.5% annual percentage yield on USDC holdings. This diversifies revenue beyond traditional retail trading.

Recently, BlackRock confirmed that its Bitcoin ETF now manages more than US$72 billion in total assets, with potential for continued institutional adoption in the future. 

The upcoming Coinbase One card, offering 4% Bitcoin rewards, is expected to strengthen customer engagement while generating additional revenue through the American Express partnership. 

Valued at a market cap of over $2.5 billion, Hut 8 (TSX:HUT) is a Canada-based crypto mining company. Hut 8's Q1 results reflect the growing pains of strategic transformation, with revenue declining 58% to US$21.8 million from US$51.7 million year-over-year.

It reported a net loss of $134.3 million, primarily driven by a US$112.4 million non-cash loss on digital assets as Bitcoin's price declined from US$93,000 to US$82,500 during the quarter.

Despite near-term headwinds, Hut 8's strategic repositioning appears promising. The launch of American Bitcoin, a majority-owned subsidiary backed by Eric Trump, enables the company to separate its capital-intensive mining operations from its core energy infrastructure business. This structure creates predictable revenue streams through colocation, managed services, and shared services agreements.

Key operational improvements include a 79% increase in deployed hashrate to 9.3 exahash and a 37% improvement in fleet efficiency. Hut 8 maintains a robust balance sheet, holding 10,264 Bitcoin (valued at over US$1 billion) and having raised US$275.5 million through its equity program.

The 10.8-gigawatt development pipeline, including the 592-acre River Bend campus in Louisiana, positions Hut 8 for growth in high-performance computing and AI data centres.

With analysts maintaining bullish targets, the crypto mining stock is attractively positioned for investors betting on the energy infrastructure transformation, though volatility remains high at current levels.

Welcome to Gotham 2.0.

Mayor Eric Adams said he plans to rely much more on artificial intelligence to assist New Yorkers if he's re-elected to a second term.

“We're gonna run a smarter city,” he told The Post Thursday during an interview at Gracie Mansion.

“I'm talking about having an opportunity now to use everything from artificial intelligence to blockchain, new technology that's out there that could make our city smarter, so that our working class people can get the proper delivery of services.”

One example being explored is using blockchain technology to speed up the process for providing copies of birth and death certificates to the public, the Mayor's Office said.

Another is using AI to quickly translate English to other languages when needed, such as helping authorities better assist victims when they use voice-controlled drones during search-and-rescue missions and other emergencies.

Adams has embraced the tech industry and digital currency since becoming mayor in 2022, as he's pledged to help make NYC the crypto capital of the world.

He put his money where his mouth early on by agreeing to take his first three paychecks in bitcoin. Adams, who earns $258,750 a year as mayor, reported the value of the bitcoin ranging from $5,000 to nearly $55,000 in his financial disclosure statement for 2024 filed with the NYC Conflicts of Interest Board.

Wall Street's most prominent crypto bull just made his biggest bet yet—and it's not on Bitcoin. Tom Lee, the Fundstrat strategist known for his prescient bitcoin price forecasts, has been appointed chair of BitMine Immersion Technologies, a little-known company positioning itself as the “MicroStrategy of Ethereum.”

In a recent CNBC interview, Lee laid out his case for why Ethereum could be the next trillion-dollar opportunity, while also defending the market's concentration in AI leaders like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). His insights offer a roadmap for investors navigating today's tech-heavy, AI-driven market.

Lee's enthusiasm for Ethereum centers on what he calls the “rediscovery of Ethereum” as institutional adoption accelerates. The catalyst? Stablecoins. Lee described stablecoin development by companies like Circle (NYSE:CRCL) as the “ChatGPT moment for crypto,” driving unprecedented Wall Street interest in building on Ethereum's blockchain.

The numbers support his thesis. Currently, 30% of Ethereum's network usage comes from stablecoins, with JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) stablecoin and Robinhood's (NASDAQ:HOOD) tokenizing business choosing Ethereum as their foundation. More than 60% of all tokenized real-world assets now live on Ethereum, establishing it as Wall Street's “preferred choice” for blockchain infrastructure.

Lee referenced former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen‘s prediction that stablecoins could grow to over $2 trillion, which he sees as “exponential usage of Ethereum and the Ethereum token.” This institutional adoption story mirrors Bitcoin's corporate treasury adoption narrative that drove its meteoric rise.

Through BitMine Immersion Technologies, Lee is executing a bold capital markets strategy. The company recently completed a private investment in public equity transaction, selling 55 million shares at around $4.50 each for $250 million. Lee confirmed this money is being used primarily to buy Ethereum, leveraging “whatever relative premium exists to actually use capital markets to grow their Ethereum holdings.”

However, investors should understand the valuation dynamics. With the PIPE shares bringing total outstanding shares to at least 61 million—significantly higher than the 6 million often reported—the company's market capitalization runs into billions, even at lower stock prices. This means investors are paying “many multiples of the value of the ether you're buying,” betting on Ethereum's future appreciation rather than getting exposure at net asset value.

Lee's market perspective extends beyond crypto to the broader AI revolution. He argues in a CNBC interview that companies like Nvidia, which he calls “scarcer than da Vinci,” deserve their premium valuations. Trading at around 30 times earnings, Nvidia's multiple “is not that extended given how important they are to the AI ecosystem.

His defense of market concentration addresses a common investor concern: the top 10 companies represent 40% of market capitalization, with Nvidia alone comprising nearly 8%. Lee counters that these companies represent a “huge share of earnings growth,” particularly as the S&P 500 benefits from being “at the center of AI.”

See Also: A must-have for all crypto enthusiasts: Sign up for the Gemini Credit Card today and earn rewards on Bitcoin Ether, or 60+ other tokens, with every purchase.

He points to a counterintuitive valuation argument: despite the market enduring “six essentially black swans in the last five years” and thriving in terms of earnings, the mean S&P multiple (equal weight) sits around 16—lower than the 17.9 multiple on the eve of Covid. Companies producing “durable, sustained earnings growth” like Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), Nvidia, and Tesla deserve higher multiples, Lee told CNBC.

Lee's dual thesis—defending AI leaders while betting big on Ethereum—reflects a broader shift in how institutional investors view technology infrastructure. His argument that financial innovation, including Circle and other cryptocurrencies, contributes significant earnings growth to the S&P suggests crypto adoption has moved beyond speculative trading to become a legitimate earnings driver.

For investors, Lee's strategy offers a template: identify the infrastructure plays that will benefit from massive capital expenditure trends, whether that's Nvidia for AI computation or Ethereum for financial tokenization. However, his BitMine play also illustrates the premium investors pay for exposure to these themes through public markets.

The question for investors isn't whether these megatrends will continue—Lee's track record suggests they will. It's whether the current valuations, from Nvidia's 30x multiple to BitMine's significant premium to its Ethereum holdings, already reflect these opportunities or still offer room for growth.

After months of quiet activity, the non-fungible token (NFT) market seems to display signs of a comeback. 

It is because weekly trading volume rose to $128 million while active buyers jumped by more than 50%, according to NFT industry data aggregator CryptoSlam.io.

However, a new report by web3 tool for decentralized applications DappRadar showed that NFT trading volumes fell sharply in the second quarter of 2025, marking the fifth consecutive quarterly decline.

Trading activity dropped 80% year-on-year to $823 million, down from $4 billion in Q2 2024. The plunge marks the sector's lowest performance since the peak of the NFT boom in 2022, according to a DappRadar report. 

Despite the drop in trading volume, overall NFT sales rose by 78%, indicating that while interest remains, prices have significantly declined. Gaming NFTs dominated the quarter, with Guild of Guardians taking two spots in the top five collections, outperforming well-known collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club.

Meanwhile, profile picture (PFP) NFTs saw a 72% decrease in volume, while Real World Assets (RWAs) moved up in ranking with a 29% rise. Domain NFTs also gained traction, particularly on the TON blockchain, where Telegram users purchased anonymous number-based domains. 

The art category, on the other hand, recorded a 51% drop in volume but a 400% surge in total sales, suggesting broader accessibility at lower price points.

Lastly, the number of monthly NFT traders increased by 20% to 668,598, signaling renewed participation from users exploring different use cases beyond traditional collectibles.

In a report from insidebitcoins.com, it noted that the NFT market is showing signs of recovery in the first week of July, with total trading volume reaching $128.4 million, marking a 1.84% increase from the previous week. 

According to data from CryptoSlam.io, the number of NFT buyers also surged to over 1.06 million, up 50.56%, while the number of sellers and transactions also saw notable growth.

As of writing, in the past 24 hours, the global NFT market is still showing strong upward momentum, with sales volume reaching $18.07 million, an increase of 23.66%. The number of NFT buyers rose by 21.71% to 96,382, while sellers grew by 4.90% to 6,830. Transactions also saw a healthy rise, climbing 9.19% to a total of 216,887. 

In addition, from July 3 to July 9, 2025, Ethereum led NFT blockchain sales by volume with $23.7 million, up 5.39%, followed closely by Polygon at $23.6 million, which grew 12.33% and recorded the largest number of buyers at over 110,600—a 35.63% increase. Mythos Chain came in third with $14.3 million in sales, while Bitcoin posted a strong 41.41% surge to $12.7 million, continuing its rising momentum in the NFT space. BNB Chain recorded $9.3 million in sales. 

Meanwhile, Immutable, once a top performer as per the report from insidebitcoin, dropped by 35.08% to $5.9 million in the past week. 

In a response to BitPinas inquiry, Jopet Arias, a known Filipino NFT artist and the co-founder of TLYR Collective, weighed in on the recent spike in NFT sales, pointing to web3 gaming as the likely driver behind the renewed market activity.

“The recent spike in NFT sales appears to be coming mostly from the gaming sector — specifically from collectibles tied to web3 games… After looking into it, some of these games do seem decent. While they're not AAA-level in terms of polish, there's something intriguing about them.”

Jopet Arias, NFT Artist and Co-Founder, TLYR Collective

The Filipino NFT artist noted that many of the projects show early promise, with previews and websites suggesting teams are actively building playable and engaging experiences. Arias emphasized that if the current sales data reflects real interest in gaming NFTs, it could signal a healthy shift in the space, one that encourages exploration of new formats and economic models.

However, Arias expressed caution, noting that many web3 games remain in their early development stages. He pointed out that these projects often still lack refined gameplay, cohesive storytelling, and strong world-building, key elements that define lasting game IPs. While the interest is promising, he has yet to try these games himself, as most are still finding their footing.

Looking ahead, Arias said he is most interested in seeing these projects mature and evolve beyond speculative hype. 

“What I'm looking forward to is seeing these projects mature — to move beyond hype and inflated valuations, and just be called what they are: games. Games that people enjoy not because they're tied to tokens, but because they offer something meaningful, fun, or emotionally resonant. The web3 label shouldn't be the main selling point. The experience itself should be.”

Jopet Arias, NFT Artist and Co-Founder, TLYR Collective

In the past seven days, CryptoSlam.io shows that NFT trading activity has remained concentrated among a few standout collections, with Courtyard, DMarket, and DNS leading the rankings by sales volume. 

The top five NFT collection rankings by sales volume include Courtyard, which led with $17.56 million, even with a small drop in activity. DMarket came second with $9.13 million and the most transactions, showing steady user engagement. DNS was the biggest gainer, jumping 334% to $4.88 million in sales, though it had only a few buyers. However, PGNFT and Guild of Guardians Heroes both saw big drops in sales and users.

Courtyard is a blockchain-powered platform that transforms physical collectibles, such as trading cards and memorabilia, into NFTs, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade them digitally. 

Each item is securely stored in a vault and backed 1:1 by a token on the Polygon network, ensuring authenticity and ownership. Collectors can redeem the physical item at any time by burning the NFT or continue trading it online. 

DMarket is an NFT marketplace focused on esports and in-game collectibles such as skins, weapons, and armor from popular multiplayer games like CS:GO, Dota 2, Team Fortress 2, and Rust. 

It allows users to tokenize and trade virtual items as NFTs, offering features like instant sales, bidding, and even face-to-face trading without transferring assets off-platform. It supports over 40 payment methods and has processed more than 40 million transactions since its launch. DMarket appeals primarily to gamers and esports fans, blending blockchain technology with the gaming economy.

A DNS NFT, often referred to as an NFT domain, is a blockchain-based alternative to traditional domain names managed by the Domain Name System (DNS). Instead of being controlled by centralized registrars, NFT domains are stored on a blockchain and are represented as NFTs. 

This gives the owner full control and permanent ownership of the domain, which can be used as a human-readable wallet address or to host decentralized websites. Unlike DNS domains, NFT domains are not subject to renewal fees and cannot be seized or censored by third parties.

It refers to a large-scale NFT project called PGNFT CLUB, with its most notable collection being the Civilization Rabbit (PCCR) series. Hosted on the BNB Smart Chain, this collection features over 123,000 NFTs inspired by Chinese civilization, drawing from elements like historical landmarks and cultural customs. Each NFT is represented as a BEP-721 token and can be traded on platforms like OpenSea (BNB Chain). 

Guild of Guardians Heroes NFTs are digital assets representing playable characters in the mobile fantasy RPG Guild of Guardians. Built on the Immutable zkEVM blockchain, these NFTs allow players to truly own their in-game heroes, which can be used in gameplay, traded on marketplaces, or rented to other players. Each hero has unique traits, abilities, and rarity levels, contributing to team strategy and performance in dungeon battles.

On the other hand, one collection dominated the top NFT collectible sales last week, with all entries in the top 10 coming from the CryptoPunks collection.

The top two sales, Punk #1831 and Punk #9778, each fetched 150 $ETH. Beyond the top two, there is a noticeable drop in sale prices. Punk #4868, ranked third, sold for 76.5 $ETH, nearly a 50% decline in USD value from the top sale. 

The rest of the top 10 sales ranged between 48.5 and 70 $ETH.

The Pump.fun token, which had an impressive start by raising over $600 million in minutes and experiencing a 20% jump following a $30 million buyback, has since faced a significant downturn. The token is now trading 20% below its ICO price, with nearly 60% of early buyers already selling their holdings. This decline is notable despite the token being listed on major exchanges such as OKX, BitMEX, Kraken, and KuCoin.

The token's price has plummeted to approximately $0.00406, marking a 21% drop in just 24 hours. This steep decline occurred despite the token raising $448.5 million from over 10,000 participants during its public sale. The market sentiment remains bearish as bulls failed to defend key support zones, leading to a continued sell-off.

BitMEX data indicates that nearly 60% of early investors have sold their tokens, with only 3% increasing their positions. A failed $2.3 million buyback by Pump.fun further intensified the bearish momentum. Previous resistance levels are now forming around the $0.0052 mark, and selling pressure continues to dominate the token's price action. Open interest in PUMP perpetual contracts has dropped by over 16%, now standing at $629 million, suggesting a waning of speculative interest and fading market enthusiasm just days after its initial public offering.

Prominent trader Crypto Bully believes that more downside is likely unless a strong catalyst appears. Although oversold signals have emerged on Stochastic RSI, traders remain cautious. A chart shared by CryptoA4 hinted at a potential bottom, but conviction in that call is limited given the scale of recent outflows. Another crypto analyst, Gem Hunter, called PUMP's collapse predictable, citing key red flags such as the founder's past involvement in presales scams, the lack of an airdrop despite extracting $1.5 billion from the community, and the token's lack of real value to Pump.fun. He noted that the chart now mirrors a typical Pump.fun dump, with failed buybacks and relentless sell pressure, suggesting there's no bottom in sight.

With a rise in bear sentiment, analysts warn that the token could slide further in the short term, highlighting the risks of post-ICO hype cycles in the current market. The lack of utility, rewards, or an airdrop has led many to question the token's real value, further eroding confidence among traders.

Since President Donald Trump won the election in November, the price of bitcoin has surged from about $70,000 to roughly $120,000. This massive climb is due to high expectations for looser regulation, along with a crypto-friendly regime in both Congress and in the White House.

And Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, sees even bigger gains ahead. ""With policy, macro, and flows aligning, bitcoin may be setting up for a bullish end to the year – where a push toward $200,000 is no longer just a long shot, but a growing probability,"" he says.

While the realities of finding consensus among lawmakers on cryptocurrency have delayed some progress so far, the passage of the GENIUS Act in late July, which we detail below, shows that the industry is poised to score some major wins.

And with two other crypto-related bills on lawmakers' radar, it's worth sizing up the legislative landscape. Indeed, these bills have the potential to deliver tremendous impacts to those with exposure to the space, from retail investors to traditional banks to eager fintech and blockchain startups.

If you're wondering what bitcoin investors need to know about the crypto bills in Congress right now, here's a quick rundown.

The GENIUS Act, short for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, was passed by legislators in late July and signed into law by President Trump. It marks the first crypto bill to make it over the finish line in the 119th Congress.

This legislation will establish a framework to accelerate the development of stablecoins, which are a type of digital currency designed to minimize volatility by having their value pegged to a more stable secondary asset such as the U.S. dollar.

The goal is the same as legacy currency, in that the value remains constant so that businesses and consumers can transact with confidence. The regulation allows for the privacy that crypto enthusiasts want, as well as the benefits of quick and cheap transfers on digital payment rails.

One challenge stablecoins face is the built-in privacy of cryptocurrencies, which offers a serious stumbling block for regulators and law enforcement professionals.

Take tether, the leading stablecoin that is estimated to have a $160 billion market value. It continues to face regulatory scrutiny regarding loose ""Know Your Customer"" requirements, which are standard at traditional banks to ensure these institutions are not supporting war criminals or terrorist states.

But the GENIUS Act looks to find a middle ground, proposing ""permitted stablecoin issuers"" who are subject to state and federal licensing and oversight.

This is expected to bring a measure of accountability to the space without forcing the issuers to follow traditional banking rules or undercutting some of the privacy features that make stablecoins popular to begin with.

Why it matters for bitcoin investors: Adoption and support for stablecoins will make more mainstream consumers and businesses increasingly comfortable with crypto as they look beyond the legacy financial system.

In a recent earnings call, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon admitted his firm has to focus on internal stablecoin development if it wants to fend off competition on payments processing, deposits and even credit card rewards.

The billions of dollars currently held in tether stablecoins seem to indicate these digital assets can and will coexist with minimal impact on the value proposition of bitcoin.

In truth, many investors see bitcoin's volatility as a feature – so long as that volatility continues to generally provide upside, of course.

But continued confidence in digital currencies used for normal consumer and business transactions would be undeniably good for bitcoin, providing yet another proof point that this digital asset is far more than just a fad.

The CLARITY Act, also known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, aims to clarify registration requirements and regulatory structures for bitcoin market participants, including digital commodity exchanges, brokers and dealers.

The hard reality is that a multi-year turf war between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over jurisdictional issues has created headaches for companies that want to get involved with bitcoin or crypto, but don't know who is in charge of enforcement or oversight.

Consider major exchange Coinbase Global (COIN), which even brought a lawsuit to federal courts in an effort to force the SEC to respond to one of its requests after years of foot-dragging.

When a regulator is so disengaged or confused that they ignore market participants rather than answering ""yes"" or ""no"" on new products or approaches, it is not a good signal for companies that are looking to innovate or challenge the old way of doing business.

The situation is further complicated by proposals that have been floated to do away with the CFTC altogether and roll the organization into the SEC.

And considering the CFTC has just two commissioners at present, one of whom announced in May she would be leaving the agency, there is an urgent need to figure out who's the boss.

As for the CLARITY Act, the bill passed in the House of Representatives on July 17 and now heads to the Senate for consideration.

Why it matters for bitcoin investors: Some bitcoin-related entities operate offshore, and sometimes in unscrupulous ways. So, regulatory clarity is a critical step in building investor confidence as well as supporting market structure providers.

In many ways, it's pretty amazing that bitcoin has grown as much as it has in the face of this confusing situation between the SEC and CFTC.

Disruptive technologies often force public policy stakeholders to rethink the ruleset. But bitcoin has existed since 2009 and has had institutional interest on Wall Street for roughly a decade.

So the glass-half-full take on the lack of clarity at present could be that there are great tools, eager market participants and next-gen applications waiting in the wings for regulatory clarity.

And if not, at minimum, the CLARITY Act would provide the long-term path to a regulated and safe environment – but also one that becomes more competitive as startups gain confidence that their next big idea is worth pursuing as it falls within congressionally approved parameters.

Part of the reason movement on crypto regulation has been hard is that some of these bills get tied together. In fact, some lawmakers tried to include language from the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act into the CLARITY Act that would ban efforts to establish central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the U.S.

The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act was eventually passed in the House of Representatives on July 17 as a separate piece of legislation that now heads to the Senate.

CBDCs can be thought of as a digital dollar or digital euro, a form of currency that is issued and backed by a local central bank – just like hard currencies.

For some hardline conservatives, this idea of government-sponsored blockchains of citizen transactions veers too close to Big Brother financial surveillance. Hence, the name of the bill includes opposition to both CBDC as well as the ""surveillance state.""

According to Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-IN), the passage of the bill that he sponsored will ""codify President Trump's effort to prevent the development of a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, and ensure the United States' digital currency policy remains in the hands of the American people, and not the Administrative state.""

Why it matters for bitcoin investors: To many bitcoin believers, CBDCs are the antithesis of the cryptocurrency promise. After all, the very prefix ""crypto"" implies something hidden or secret – and the privacy offered by digital assets that operate outside the traditional financial system has in many ways fueled its appeal.

Many experts have speculated that increased movement or even discussions around CBDCs will drive more folks to bitcoin because of its proven record of privacy, and its global nature that is separate from national politics and central banking.

Time will tell if this provision advances in the Senate, or more importantly, whether the U.S. Federal Reserve or any other Western bank launches a CBDC that catches on.

Even the European Central Bank, which is far more advanced in its quest for a digital currency, hasn't moved beyond initial preparation and stakeholder discussions. That means there's little risk of bitcoin losing its appeal anytime soon to a CBDC.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

The US Congress has concluded its Crypto Week with significant developments in cryptocurrency legislation. The House of Representatives passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark stablecoin bill, with bipartisan support after several revisions. This bill is now headed to the president's desk for signature. The GENIUS Act will come into effect 18 months after the president's signature or 120 days after the final regulations are published by the US Treasury and Federal Reserve. Once in effect, stablecoin issuers will be subject to strict reserve requirements and the Bank Secrecy Act. 

The House also passed the CLARITY Act, a market structure bill championed by the blockchain industry, and a bill banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). These two bills will now proceed to the Senate, where they may face further deliberation and amendments due to the slimmer pro-crypto Republican majority. 

The GENIUS Act, once signed into law, will compel many American stablecoin issuers to become banks, as they will be limited solely to stablecoin issuance. Most US stablecoin issuers currently offer more services, and pursuing a bank charter would allow them to issue stablecoins along with a wider range of activities without needing state-to-state licenses. However, the final version of the bill does not include a provision for stablecoin issuers to offer interest on customer stablecoin reserves, a point of contention for some industry leaders. 

Three years after the bill is signed, no foreign stablecoin issuers that aren't approved in the US will be able to offer a stablecoin in the country, with some exceptions if the US Treasury deems the issuer's country of origin has a comparable regulatory regime. 

The CLARITY Act aims to offer ""digital commodities on mature blockchains"" an exemption from the Securities Act of 1933 and reassign regulatory oversight from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Despite criticism from some House Democrats, the act enjoyed significant bipartisan support. 

Senate Democrats who supported the GENIUS Act may also vote in favor of the CLARITY Act, despite vocal criticism from crypto-skeptic Democrats. The vote on the Anti-CBDC bill was closer, reflecting a more partisan divide on whether the Fed should be prevented from issuing a digital dollar. If a few Senate Democrats vote for the bill, it could have a chance at passing. 

The crypto industry is optimistic about these developments, viewing them as a significant step towards the full integration of crypto into the country's financial system. Industry leaders believe that pro-crypto laws in the US could influence laws abroad and help the US reclaim digital asset leadership. With more politicians swinging pro-crypto, the passage of these bills seems more a matter of ""when"" than ""if.""

Washington — President Trump signed a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing the ""exciting new frontier"" for the technology one day after the bill passed the House.

The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, is the first major law governing digital currency, and establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.

""We worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS Act. They named it after me,"" the president joked in the East Room of the White House. ""I want to thank you. This is a hell of an act."" 

Members of Congress and top executives from Robinhood, Tether, Gemini and other crypto and financial firms were in attendance for the signing ceremony.

The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill.

""The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' 'Sir, you have my vote.' Boom. 'Sir, you have my vote.' I really just, they just want a little love,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people."" 

David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president ""stepped in and saved this bill."" Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through. 

The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) establishes guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins. The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins. 

With the GENIUS Act signed into law, banks, nonbanks and credit unions can dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins. 

Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor, said stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments ""nearly instantaneously,"" rather than taking weeks. 

""Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins,"" Mr. Trump said. ""This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that.""

The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed ""one-for-one"" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, ""strengthening the dollar"" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a ""21st-century upgrade."" 

Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed ""Crypto Week"" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. The legislation is seen by the Trump administration and the crypto community as a way of bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.

""Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,"" the president said. ""You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation.""

The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year. 

The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.

The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week. 

Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.

""REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED….BUT NO MORE,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. ""THIS IS BIG!!!""

Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act took place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence. 

""Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,"" the president wrote on Truth Social. ""This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!""

Bondi said the Justice Department is ""ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts."" A judge will make the final call on whether the material can be made public, and the process could take weeks or months.

Time will tell if this provision advances in the Senate, or more importantly, whether the U.S. Federal Reserve or any other Western bank launches a CBDC that catches on.

Even the European Central Bank, which is far more advanced in its quest for a digital currency, hasn't moved beyond initial preparation and stakeholder discussions. That means there's little risk of bitcoin losing its appeal anytime soon to a CBDC.

Washington — President Trump signed a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing the ""exciting new frontier"" for the technology one day after the bill passed the House.

The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, is the first major law governing digital currency, and establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.

""We worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS Act. They named it after me,"" the president joked in the East Room of the White House. ""I want to thank you. This is a hell of an act."" 

Members of Congress and top executives from Robinhood, Tether, Gemini and other crypto and financial firms were in attendance for the signing ceremony.

The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill.

""The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' 'Sir, you have my vote.' Boom. 'Sir, you have my vote.' I really just, they just want a little love,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people."" 

David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president ""stepped in and saved this bill."" Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through. 

The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) establishes guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins. The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins. 

With the GENIUS Act signed into law, banks, nonbanks and credit unions can dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins. 

Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor, said stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments ""nearly instantaneously,"" rather than taking weeks. 

""Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins,"" Mr. Trump said. ""This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that.""

The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed ""one-for-one"" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, ""strengthening the dollar"" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a ""21st-century upgrade."" 

Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed ""Crypto Week"" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. The legislation is seen by the Trump administration and the crypto community as a way of bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.

""Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,"" the president said. ""You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation.""

The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year. 

The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.

The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week. 

Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.

""REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED….BUT NO MORE,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. ""THIS IS BIG!!!""

Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act took place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence. 

""Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,"" the president wrote on Truth Social. ""This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!""

Bondi said the Justice Department is ""ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts."" A judge will make the final call on whether the material can be made public, and the process could take weeks or months.

                    The crypto rally also powered gains in linked equities, with Coinbase and Robinhood climbing to all-time highs on Friday [File]

The crypto sector's market value hit $4 trillion on Friday, according to CoinGecko, marking a milestone that reflects its shift from a nascent asset class to a central part of the global investment landscape.

A wave of renewed optimism, regulatory clarity in key markets and rising institutional flows have catapulted the crypto sector to a new valuation peak.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to create a regulatory framework for U.S.-dollar-pegged cryptocurrency tokens, known as stablecoins, sending the bill to U.S. President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it into law.

""The arrival of the Trump legislation signaled an about-turn in attitudes towards the crypto industry, but legislators are still exercising some caution,"" said Derren Nathan, head of equity research, Hargreaves Lansdown.

House lawmakers also passed two other crypto bills, sending them next to the Senate for consideration. One lays out a regulatory framework for crypto, while the other seeks to ban the U.S. from issuing a central bank digital currency.

The $4 trillion milestone underscores how far the crypto industry has come from its speculative, fringe origins. With growing interest from asset managers, new exchange-traded products and broader adoption among retail and corporate users, digital assets are increasingly shaping conversations in global finance.

Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value, usually a 1:1 dollar peg, are commonly used by crypto traders to move funds between tokens. Their use has grown rapidly in recent years, and proponents say they could be used to send payments instantly.

""The Genius Act will go down in history as a law that served as a foundational step in mainstreaming of crypto as an asset class,"" said Chris Perkins, president, CoinFund.

Corporate treasury allocations to bitcoin are also gaining pace, with a growing number of public companies adding the token to their balance sheets as a long-term store of value.

The sector was last trading at a combined market value of $3.92 trillion, as bitcoin — the world's largest cryptocurrency — fell 1.8%.

Bitcoin crossed the $120,000 mark earlier this week, setting a record. Brokerage Bernstein forecast it could climb to $200,000 by end-2025.

Ether, the second-biggest crypto token, was last up 4.5%. It has more than doubled over the past three months.

The crypto rally also powered gains in linked equities, with Coinbase and Robinhood climbing to all-time highs on Friday.

Shares of the crypto exchange were last up 1%, while the retail trading platform, which also supports crypto trades, gained 3%.

Ether-focused stocks also saw broad gains.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Tether CEO Says He'll Comply With GENIUS to Come to U.S., Circle Says It's Set Now","https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/18/tether-ceo-says-he-ll-comply-with-genius-to-come-to-u-s-circle-says-it-s-set-now","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 00:25:10 GMT","

In the minutes after President Donald Trump signed a bill that joins the crypto world's stablecoins to the U.S. financial system, two of the chief stablecoin architects made the case in the Washington summer heat outside the White House that their companies are ready to embrace the new law.



Before he'd signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law after it swept through both chambers of Congress with major bipartisan votes, Trump basked in cheers and thanked several industry leaders in the East Room audience, including Tether CEO Paulo Ardoino, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Outside, the executives talked about next steps.



Ardoino amplified his plans for moving some of his global business into the U.S., where he said the focus will be on institutional users for a new token, but he added that he also intends to have Tether's stablecoin powerhouse USDT comply with the GENIUS Act as a foreign issuer. That'll mean a new auditing regime and changes to the vast reserves the company already maintains, which he says will require ""an adjustment"" but noted — with a smile — that his company ""made $13 billion in profits"" last year and will be able to manage it.



""Tether will comply with the GENIUS Act,"" he said, adding that the company will get to work now meeting the foreign-issuer standards. He said Tether has three years to work on getting into the U.S., and the company intends to manage two different versions of its stablecoins domestically — a jurisdiction it currently steers clear of.



The U.S.-centric coin — a second flavor of Tether that hasn't yet been hatched — is envisioned as serving a very different purpose.



""Institutions are used to super efficient markets, and they will count the single basis point; and so, for that reason, we need to build something that is proper for this new market,"" he told CoinDesk in the interview. The product built for those institutions will ""focus on payments and high, high, high efficiency.""





For Circle — a public company based in the U.S. — CEO Allaire said that the GENIUS Act ""really enshrines into law Circle's way of doing business.""

""We have always been trusted, transparent; we've been publicly audited for five years,"" he said.



But he noted that the U.S. landscape for stablecoins has already been rapidly changing in anticipation of the new law, with ""major technology companies, major commerce firms, financial institutions"" lining up to participate, which he said he welcomes.



""Once you have that federal law, it really is a green light to all these types of institutions to know that they can depend on this technology, build on this technology, integrated into how they store and move money into other innovations that can be done with smart contracts and programabilities,"" Allaire said.



To do business in the U.S., the GENIUS Act demands that extremely limited, highly liquid assets — mostly U.S. Treasuries — will back issuers' coins dollar-for-dollar, and it requires a stringent auditing process to constantly ensure that the assets are there.



Tether's Ardoino said his company's new chief financial officer, Simon McWilliams, ""started to work"" to land a ""Big Four"" audit firm — one of the global leaders in financial auditing — which has only been a possibility because of the recent support from the Trump administration. His company has a special relationship with the administration, too, in which the former CEO of Tether's chief U.S. reserves manager, Cantor Fitzgerald, is Trump's secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick.



Ardoino's appearance at the White House and direct thanks from the president is a sharp reversal of Tether's U.S. history, in which it settled investigations with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and New York Department of Financial Services. But past reports that the company remained under further U.S. investigation never developed into actions against the company or its officers.



Trump boasted repeatedly on Friday that he dug the crypto industry out of legal trouble with his predecessor's administration.





A company that's developed into a lobbying and political giant in Washington in a short period, Coinbase, was represented in Trump's front row at the White House event, and CEO Brian Armstrong called the new law the ""beginning of a big financial revolution in the U.S.""



Armstrong has spent a lot of time and effort, though, on the next major legislation pursued by the industry: a bill that sets regulations for crypto markets in the U.S.



""One down; one to go,"" he said. ""We've got to get the market structure bill through, as well. Seven percent of crypto market cap is stabecoins, so that's a very important first step. The other 93% is going to be addressed by that market structure bill.""



In the minutes before passing the GENIUS Act, the House of Representatives also voted 294-134 to send its market structure legislation known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act to the Senate with a resounding bipartisan result.



Armstrong's company has been one of the primary backers of political action committee Fairshake, a towering super PAC that's spent incredible amounts of money congressional races, supporting candidates who commit to pro-crypto legislation. After success in dozens of races last year, Coinbase's largesse continued with another recent $25 million addition that brought Fairshake's war chest to $141 million well before the genuine start of next year's races.



""We feel like it's important to stand up for our customers' rights, and the job's not done yet,"" he said. Even after the market structure bill, he said, ""I'm sure there'll be other things that come up in the future.""



Armstrong said that Trump's chief crypto adviser, David Sacks, has assured the industry that he's serious about a recently discussed deadline for the next congressional effort: September 30.



For his part, President Trump talked about the GENIUS Act as if he'd already accomplished the monumental task of lifting U.S. crypto into place to modernize the financial system.



""Under this bill, the entire ancient system will be eligible for a 21st Century upgrade, using the state-of-the-art crypto technology,"" the president said before sitting at a table to sign the bill, mobbed by Republican lawmakers and crypto executives.



""Tomorrow is a new day, a new era,"" Ardoino said after the event. ""We are very proud to be here and to be called out directly from the president, because it is the testament of all the good work that our team has done for the last years.""

The following is a summary of the transcript, which was analyzed using AI. The unedited full transcript (except for paragraph spacing) follows the summary. 



Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you, keep going. We worked hard. We worked hard.



Thank you very much. Yeah, we worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS act. They named it after me. And I want to thank want to thank you. This is a hell of an act. You know, I did something very unusual. I said, this has been something it's been a lot of people thought it was impossible, some of the things that have been done. Then, of course, the great big beautiful idea, the word great, the great big beautiful bill, that was something that nobody thought possible. They thought it would be in anywhere from seven to maybe three. I'll go the opposite direction, but three to seven different bills. And we said, Let's just put it in one, because this way there's something for everyone. And there really is, is a lot of things for everyone. And when we get the word out how great that is for every single person in this country, virtually, and the all they have is a sound bite death. You know their sound bite is death. Aren't they nice that they are the most incompetent people. They've lost their confidence. They've lost everything, if you think about it, but Jasmine Crockett is on her way. She's on her way. That's She's the new star of the Democrat Party, Jasmine Crockett, they're in big trouble. But I have to tell you, that was great, and this was great, and I am so tired of making phone calls at 234, o'clock in the morning, getting calls from our great speaker, sir, we have 12 hard nos. I say, Mike, Mike, it's two o'clock in the morning. We have 12 hard Nos. The good news is I call up. Hello Jim. How are you, sir? You have my vote, Sir, you have my vote. I really just, they just want a little love. Unfortunately, it's always the same. It's always the same 12 people. That's, it's, it's five senators, and it's 12.



And I actually said to John Thune, and I said to Mike, I said, Listen, I want to have a party, but not to those people that I have to speak to endlessly every time. And they're wonderful because they always seem to come through, other than a couple, Rand Paul Jr from Congress, and Rand Paul other than a few people. But I said, I want to have them over. We're going to have a party for everybody in Congress, everyone Congress, except 12. We're going to have and Mike is de I'll tell you what. Tom has definitely covered the whole group. Where are those 12 people? They're the only people I don't see. We could do it today. We don't have to vote. And I would say, of the 53 senators, 48 with a 48 in half, you won't even have to come to that one. But these are the greatest people, because they always vote yes, and we don't have to go crazy. You trust us. We trust you. That has been a very special group of people.



We really do. I mean, 96% phenomenal. And 4% extremely difficult. Do you agree with that? But they get there, most of them, not all of them. Those are the ones we really don't like. But I want to thank you all for being here. This is really a big day.



This afternoon, we take a giant step to cement American dominance of global finance and crypto technology as we signed the landmark genius Act into law. So congratulations to everybody. It is a big deal. It's come a long way since the Biden administration, when they had no idea what you were all talking about, and half of you are under arrest for no reason whatsoever, for no reason, and we want to have it not China. China wasn't actually have they were watching this thing. They like it. And we, we've got this, we've got AI, we've got a lot of, a lot of great ones happening. And this is a very big thing, and I want to thank the bill's author, Senator Bill Haggerty, a very good friend of mine. Thank you.



He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a very handsome guy. Looks great. He's got the whole package. But, you know, I got to know him. He was ambassador to Japan, and we had a little problem with Japan on trade, but he was my ambassador to Japan, and I went to Japan, and he is speaking fluently Japanese. I said, Did you learn it as a child? No, no, I just learned it over the last four or five months. I said, you learn Japanese? Maybe the single hardest language to learn, it's actually breathing, rather than it's breathing. I'm not going to imitate it, because we'll end up with a big story, and I don't want that. But he spoke totally fluent Japanese. I said, That's very impressive. And he was introducing me to Mr. Honda. I said, Oh, are you in the car business? He goes, yes. I said, You're a very rich man. And then he said, Mr. Toyota. Right, Toyota. Then I said, What business are you in? Let me guess. He said, cars. He was my interpreter, and I was so impressed. And I was getting ready to leave. He said, Sir, I'd like to run for the United States Senate. I said, Where are you from? He said, Tennessee. I said, Well, I love Tennessee, but do they know you there? No, but if you endorse me, I'll win, right? And I endorse him, and he took a 48 point lead, and they didn't know who the hell he was, and he's turned out to be a great senator, and now they all know who you are. So you are, you're fantastic, and we thank you, and you just the fact that you're doing this, and you understand this is a complicated world, and you understand it, Bill, so you've been great. Thank you very much. We're also pleased to be joined by our great Vice President, J de Vance. JD, thank you very much. Good job. And he's been up speaking late at night on the phone, I said. JD, how about you take it three or four of these people, please, because three or four I cannot speak to. I just can't and he take them, and he'd come through, right? JD, also speaker Mike Johnson, he is unbelievable. He's an unbelievable I mean, if you go by what we're doing, if you keep at this pace, you can't keep it up for another 200 days. But I will tell you this, if you keep up this pace for another week, you go down as the greatest speaker in the house in history. So one more word. Who needs Tip O'Neill? Who needs Tip O'Neill? He's better looking than Tip O'Neill too. But no, he's been going. He's been going at a fervent pace. Would you say that's right? Your wife probably says You are crazy. You've been aging beautifully in front. He's an amazing actually, he's an amazing speaker, a great leader, and everybody likes him and respects him, and that's why we're with a very small majority, like three. We had a time when we were one. Remember, we said we're one heart attack away from losing the house, and we won a couple of seats and a couple of other now we have seven, maybe, maybe, if we're lucky, seven, but we win with nobody's ever done I don't think anyone's ever done this before to win with those of all, we had a little help from John too, right? And a lot of other people I want to introduce, also Secretary Howard lucknick, who's been fantastic. You have done a great job, Howard, we've got great deals coming out of our ears. We have so many trade deals. And I really mean this too. It's like, how do you deal with so many but you know, I always say, well, we send out the papers that was a deal. They don't want to the fake news doesn't want to hear that. When I send out the paper that you're paying 35 or 40% tariff, that's a deal. Then they'll call and see if they can make a little bit different kind of a deal, like opening up their country to trade. In some cases, they've never been open. But we're doing well, and we have a couple of big ones to announce pretty soon, right? Could almost do it today. Maybe we'll say it. Maybe later on, we'll do it. Senator Bernie Moreno, what a great victory? Bernie had a great victory. Great Victory. That was one of the truly tough races. A lot of people weren't sure anybody could win that scene, and you won it in easy fashion, right? We want it together when you think of it, but you want it in easy fashion. Did a great job. Great guy, House Majority Whip. This is a great leader, Tom Emmer, a great politician and leader, really good. And I like his wife, even better, his wife is, she's the boss, but she's, she's, you are married to a fantastic woman. And he knows that, and he likes, he likes hearing it, because some people don't, you know. They say, Sir, could you please stop saying that my wife is better than me, sir, because the guys that don't usually end up with a good marriage, you know, he's got a great marriage. So thank you Tom. You really are a fantastic leader and representative and representatives Troy downing French Hill. Where's French Hill? Where is French you have been so great. Thank you, Coach. I spoke to him a little late when he was walking down the hall of st French he said, I'm there, sir. You a great, great, great guy. Everyone respects you French. You know that? Bill heisinger, Bill, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Good job. Dan muser, I thought he was going to become the next Governor of Pennsylvania, but he likes Congress better, I guess so. But I think you're terrific. And you know, I would have always been behind you that I can tell you. Tim Moore, Tim, thank you. Tim. John, Rose, John, hi. John, thanks. Good job. Brian style, Brian style, still young, still nice and young, it's good. GT, Thompson. GT, thank you. Andy Barr, good friend of all of ours. Thank you, Andy. Monica de la Cruz, Monica, she's here someplace. Thank you, Monica. Thank you. Monica. Mike herodopoulos, Mike, thank you, Mike, look good. Mike Lawler, Mr. Salt, well, it should guarantee your district. I mean, you worked hard for New York, right? And you're on television. I'm on television. So this should be good for a couple of points, but without you and your couple of friends from New York, that wouldn't have happened. That was not easy, right? Congratulations. Great job. Anna, Paulina, Luna, Anna, who is so great, I don't even if she's here or not here, I want to tell you that she has been so great and worked so hard to make sure we got it approved. Ralph Norman, Ralph, Ralph, what happened to Ralph? Nick? Begich, Nick, thank you, Nick, good job. Good job. Good, good votes. I just saw a great poll on you. Huh? Very good congratulations. Like Andy ogles. Andy, terrific friend. Beth Van Dyne. Beth, thank you. Beth, great job. Thank you. Thank you very much for the great support. Roger Williams, a great baseball player who also had to take a bullet, unfortunately, but he is a great guy. He was involved in that whole catastrophe, but he's fantastic, and has been from day one, along with a lot of other people that I won't call out because I have no idea where the hell you are. I think I saw Jason here somewhere. Where's Jason? Oh, it's lucky I called him. Ooh, it's lucky. They didn't put your name because I invited you at the last moment, right? He was over there doing some business in the White House, but you've been incredible in your position. Nobody knows more about taxes and finance than you do, so we appreciate it, right? Is that true? Howard, it's true. Thanks, Jason, great job, and you'll help out with that other matter. You make him so strong and powerful, right? Along with Deputy Secretary of Treasury, Michael Fauci de Where is Michael Good? Michael, how are you good? You'll help out over there. Okay, and Ambassador Ken. Howie. Ambassador, thank you, Ken, great job, Ken. I also want to recognize some of the countless industry leaders here today, including Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, you've done a good job, Brian, that's a big deal. Dave Ripley of Kraken, Jeremy Allaire of circle, it was a big day. Good job. Good job. Jeremy. Paolo ardino of tether, hello Paulo. Thank you. Paolo. Ryan McInerney of visa, that's a good company. Thank you. Chris Pavlov, Rumble, Chris, Chris, what happened to your location? Chris, you're always a front row guy. You're just being nice today. I think How's rumble doing good? Good. If Rumble is doing good, that means truth is doing good. Truth, that's great. You're doing a great job. Thank you. Chris, very much.



Vlad Tenev of Robinhood. Vlad, thank you, Brad, thank you. Vlad, good Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, these are two smart, handsome guys. They got the whole package. They're of Gemini, but they have the whole pack. They have a lot of things, actually, but Gemini is just the one for today, right? They've got the all, they've got the look. They've got the the genius. Got plenty of cash. And it's great that you're on our side. You guys are great. I could never tell them apart, but their mother, can I ask? Can your mother tell you apart? And the answer is yes, easily, or is it tough for her? Easy? I think. Thank you very much. It's great to be with you. Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out. You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago, but this signing is a massive validation. And even before the signing, over the last year, year and a half, I think your stuff has gone up more than any stock, or just about more a couple of stocks that were pretty good, I will say. But you, you have, certainly, as an industry, gone up more than anybody. Nobody has gained the respect in such a short period of time. But this signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up, because a lot of people would have given up two three years ago.



So I want to thank you for contributing to the incredible strength of America. This is going to make us stronger. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. You've made our dollar look really good and strong and powerful. It's good for the dollar and it's good for the country, and that's why I backed you at an early stage. And I also did it for the votes, because you did come out and vote. And they changed soon. You know, Biden's team, they changed tune right in the middle of the campaign. All of a sudden. They loved you guys. They dropped all charges. They did have, I got you guys out of so much trouble, because you remember, you remember they were very they treated you very unfairly, actually. So it's a great honor that we were involved and and it was, it was a tremendous amount of support that we got at the polls. We won. Think of it. We won every swing state. We won by millions of votes. We won the popular vote. We won the districts by 2700 districts too, by the way, every, every once in a while, that number can change, but it doesn't change by March, the map was almost totally red, and you guys were with us right from the beginning, exactly one year ago this month, many of you were with Nashville Tennessee. Do you remember that day? Right? It was a big day, Nashville Tennessee, and I became the first presidential candidate ever to address the Bitcoin Conference, and at this time and at that time, crypto members and founders were under relentless by the Biden administration, which is trying to crush your industry and crush you as people and go after vicious people don't realize the what Joe was doing guy but he was always known as a vicious guy. I guess if you're going to be in that you probably, if they're incompetent is better, right, because you don't want to have a vicious guy that's competent. If you did, I wouldn't be standing here today, but I pledge that we would bring back American liberty and leadership and make the United States the crypto capital of the world, and that's what we've done. And under the Trump administration, this is only going further, you're going to do really well. And I'm so proud of what you've done in the last couple of years. And very important. On day one, I remember I did this, and I said this, and I mentioned this name, and I got the greatest applause of the whole campaign. We fired Joe Biden's, sec chair, Gary Gensler, you a speech. It was just a line in speech. And I said, and I will fire Gary guessing, the place exploded. I finished that one, and I said, What the hell did that guy do? Hatred there turned out as I got for rigged with everything, it turned out you were absolutely right. In his place, I appointed a visionary chairman who wants America to build the future and not block the future. He's going to be unbelievable. He'll go down as one of the greats and fall at me.



The crypto guys, they said, everybody said, not only crypto every they all wanted Paul for the position, and he's a tough cookie too. He's just but they actually said, We don't care. We just think he's fair. All they learned was fairness. And they have somebody that you're really a champion of the street and you're a champion of the country, you do a fantastic job. I saw you interviewed the other night. I watched it two o'clock in the morning, this little thing called Sea Spanish. I don't know how many people were watching. Don't worry, you were in prime time too with that. But fantastic job. Absolutely so perfect for the job. Congratulations, Paul and Paul is here today among the commissioners, various commissioners, including pastor Pierce and Laura. Thank you very much, and thank you, Mark, wherever you may be here because of the thunderous applause, tremendous things about both of you. Thank you very much.



My first week in office, I also established the first ever presidential Working Group on digital assets, and we have an executive director wiz behind a football player, right? Bo is a great football player, one of the better players in college football. So who would think that I know that Daniel a lot of things from he was a genuine player. I stopped the weaponization of government against crypto or Bitcoin, and we ended the lawless operation. Choke point 2.0 that was a bad operation, and I kept my promises to the community and granted a full presidential pardon to Ross Ulbrich. No idea how. I had no idea how important that day became. Was like a symbol, and his mother was unbelievable. His mother was an unbelievable woman, but it was so, so important to a certain group of people. And in the truly momentous Act last March, I signed an executive order establishing the US Strategic Bitcoin reserve, as well as the United States Digital Asset stockpile, and that's all signed up, and With today's signing we're pushing even further into the exciting new frontier, just as I promised last year, the genius Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework To establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar backed stable coins. This could have been perhaps the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet. So a lot of people are saying that. I don't know. What do you guys think?

Yes, we'll tell you many Americans are unaware that behind the scenes, the technical backbone of the financial system is decades out of days, many, many years out of days. You know that Paul and others are straightening it out the payments and money transfers are costly and take days or even weeks to clear under this bill, the entire ancient system will be eligible for a 21st Century upgrade using the state of the art crypto technology. Who would have thought we would have been saying that two years after I met you for the first time, the genius Act provides banks, businesses and financial institutions, a framework for issuing crypto assets back one for one, with real us, dollars, treasury bills and other cash equivalents, is really strengthening the dollar and giving the dollar great prominence. And you know, you have this little group called bricks. It's fading out fast, but bricks is they wanted to try and take over the dollar, the dominance of the dollar, and the standard of the dollar. And I said, anybody that's in the BRICS consortium of nations, we're going to tariff you 10% and they had a meeting the following day, and almost nobody showed up. Physically, no, no, we didn't want to. They didn't want to be tariffed today. It's amazing. Now we're not going to let the dollar slide. If we have a smart president, you're never going to let the dollar slide. If you have a dummy that could happen, like the last one, he would have. You ever asked him about the dollar slide? He would have no idea. But we can't let that ever happen again. Consumers, vendors and people all over the world will then be able to use those stable coins for ultra low cost transactions that are cleared and settled in a matter of seconds, rather than weeks and months. And it's really an amazing thing with privacy, flexibility and decentralization of cash, this revolution has the potential to supercharge American economic growth and empower billions of people to study and transfer in US dollars. It's really all backed by the dollars. It's really a great thing. There'll be a lot of Democrat support. I have to tell you that I was shocked anytime we get one dem, but we had a tremendous amount of Democrat support, which we appreciated, which just shows you that you're doing the right thing. This will increase demand for US Treasuries, lower interest rates and secure the dollar's status as the world reserve currency for generations to come. The reserve currency is so important, you know, we lost that. That would be like losing a world war. We can never let anyone play games with us, and that's why, when I heard about this group from breaks six countries, basically, I hit them very, very hard, and they have a form. It will end very quickly. I will tell you to them. They won't. They won't be gone very long. I don't think they'll even they're virtually afraid to me, I also remain fully committed to my pledge never to allow the creation of a central bank digital currency in America will happen.

You some of the Congress, men and women, and they wanted that so badly. You know, I was impressed that they knew what the hell it was to be honest. Please, sir, please the central bank, digital currency, will you have to make sure. And they say, What do you know about that? It's amazing the knowledge that people have made all of a sudden, we don't have problems with some of them. I said, we've already got it from the Fed, right from Congress and from an executive order. You don't need it a fourth house Sure. We have to get it. And it's but they knew their subject. I didn't, and we helped them out. My first week in office, I signed an executive order to ban the creation of a cbdc and the United States, and very soon, I look forward to signing legislation that will notify and ban the make it a permanent. Law put it in permanence. I'm also committed to selling animal crypto market structure legislation this year to grow the industry. We're going to be growing it even more, more than people ever thought. It's a really hot industry, and for a little while, two nights ago, we were really concerned, as we live short of bucks. I would say maybe we were about nine short, nine short at three in the morning. We were about four short at 330 in the morning, and we were in good shape at four o'clock in the morning. But the people, a few people, are fought harder for the bill that we're signing than some of the people here today. You have been unbelievable.

It's our White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks and he has a show now become a show a couple of years ago. That's probably two years ago now in San Francisco, you kept it going a lot longer, and you got, is that still your eyes rated every show? Well, he knows what to say. Maybe 50 millions of people. They said, what's going on? But we had a great show. They said, You know, I had a really small decision. I get elected. I was running at that time, if I get elected, bring him into government and some of his work, unfortunately, we made a lot of money. They're very rich. He's a very rich media, but this is more important. Des, me too. It's like doesn't matter. This is much. I know how I talk about it all the time. How would you go back to those wonderful brokerage firm hire one or two people, and it's not the same. It's not the same as what you're doing, right? The biggest with one of the biggest deals in the world. Actually, the deal we're doing now in tariffs is the biggest where you ended up, the biggest deal ever made in history. It could be 1000 IBM, if you think of it. It's the biggest deal ever done. So it's hard to go back to a brokerage firm and $79,000 commission but I want to ask David, so David's been fantastic. He's done an incredible job. And I'd like to ask David come up say if you would.

David Sacks

Thank you, President Trump. It's a great Trump. It's a great, great honor to be here. And it's true that I never expected to work in government at all. And then everything changed after President Trump came on my podcast. And I, you know, I accepted this job as crypto as well because I thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for a President who really wants to get things done for the American people. And if anything, that's been an understatement. The first six months this administration have been more successful than any administration in American history.

President Trump has worked at that tech speed we're used to working fast at Silicon Valley, but even this has passed for us in Silicon Valley, the speed of the team with President Trump's really incredible. And now today, you have another historic legislative achievement to make the United States a crypto capital of the world. This genius act will unlock American dominance in the crypto industry by creating clear rules of the road. It will update arcade payment rails with a revolutionary new payment system, and it will extend US dollar anonymous, like you said, globally by creating a digital dollar that people all over the world can use. And for every digital dollar in a crypto wallet, there'll be a traditional dollar in a US bank account, which will create trillions of dollars demand for US Treasuries. So that is the power of this bill, as you asked all the comments, this is a huge promise made and promise kept by President Trump. And there's just a few other people I'd like to thank, first, my family for being here. Thank you, fellow wise

who President Trump mentioned, the director of our crypto Council. He released in a heavy lifting here, Tracy Johnson as well Harry and French Hill and all the congressman, senators, and we've already been met by President Trump, so I'll save the time, but it's really been hard for this is really a team effort, but most of all, to thank President Trump for accomplishing what nobody thought was possible. And it's true that just earlier this week, the media was reporting that this bill was dead. This bill was dead, and then the media didn't know one thing, that we have a secret weapon. We have a dealmakder in chief. And thanks to President Trump, he stepped in and save this bill, and it's because of your vision, your leadership, your determination, your skill that we're all here today.

Donald Trump

This is our superstar. She was the head of the Republican Party, and don't become beautiful two children, but she has been so good. She stepped into that position like there was nothing. That we want. And she said, Dad, I'd like to go home right now to my beautiful husband and my son and daughter, Rhett. They give you a fantastic job, and you work with a great gentleman too. He's doing a fantastic job. But I just want to thank you. I just need to stand here right now. I wanted to bring on. And thank you very much. Thank you. So under the Trump administration, as I just got back from Saudi Arabia, and we went to Qatar, we went to a number of countries, and I will tell you the the level of respect that this country has now is incredible. The UAE, I tell you what, we had a time there, but every leader said the same thing. They said, one year ago, your country was dead, and it said that way it was like supposed to be happy or insulted. But the truth is we were in deep trouble. But they said one year ago, your country was dead, and today you have the hottest country anywhere in the world. And it's true, we have the hottest country in the world. We had a country where a laughing stock with the borders, people pouring in. Can you imagine last month, in the month of June, actually zero. Now I don't even believe that zero, if you have hundreds of 1000s pouring in, or get over seven zero, but they have it down to zero. And very liberal people take that particular Oh, so liberal. So they're not giving us any fairness in zero people coming through a border. Can you imagine that for literally hundreds of people? All over the world. They came from prisons, jails. They came from mental institutions, gang members. They were gangs. They came from all over the place, from every country they came from the Congo and Africa. A lot from the Congo. They came from South America. A lot of came from Venezuela. They emptied their jails into our country. Can you imagine? They allowed that empty de jails into our country, and they let them walk right into our country like perfect, 11,888 committed murder. 50% committed more than one person. They murdered more than one person, 50% of 11,088 and we had murderers, and we're getting them out, and Tom Holman and Kristi are doing a great job at Town Hallman. Okay, you see central casting or what, and it takes abuse, but they just, they just keep fighting, and they're winning, and we're winning in the courts, and we're winning everywhere. 



But we've got the hottest country in the world, and you're a big part of it. So the golden age of America is upon us, and with today, signing the beauty of crypto and crypto industry and US dollar working together because they really are hand in hand, because they'll be stronger and bigger and better than ever before. And I just want to thank everybody, some tremendous people in this room, and maybe you want to sign I'll ask some of our great senators and congressmen to come on up, some of the top crypto guys, please come on up, because you guys work very hard on this, and we'll sign this, and we'll get on to the next panel, and we'll win. But we're we're winning all over the world right now. It's not even close, not even to us, and We're going to keep it going. Thank you, everybody. You world, which is a big scandal that we're a Republican, it would really be a big it is One of the great standards. 

Thank you Very much.

 The cybersecurity exploit occurred due to a ""sophisticated server breach,"" CoinDCX CEO and co-founder Sumit Gupta announced on Saturday. 

Indian cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX was hacked on Friday, leaving the exchange drained of $44 million. 

The hackers compromised one of CoinDCX's internal accounts used for “liquidity provisions” with another exchange through a server breach.

No user funds were affected due to the exploit, according to CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta. The CEO also said that all customer funds remain safe and wrote:

“The attacker's address was funded with 1 Ether (ETH) from Tornado Cash and later bridged a portion of the stolen funds from Solana to Ethereum,” onchain sleuth ZachXBT said.

Cointelegraph reached out to CoinDCX for comment but was unable to obtain a response by the time of publication.

Analyst Infinity Hedge noted that popular Indian exchange WazirX was hacked for $235 million on this exact date, one year ago — a reminder of the persistent cybersecurity threats facing the crypto industry and investors.

Iranian exchange Nobitex was hacked for $100 million on June 18 in a politically-motivated attack by a pro-Israel hacker group calling itself “Gonjeshke Darande.”

After stealing $100 million in the initial hack, the group leaked the source code for the exchange online, further exposing users of the crypto platform.

GMX V1, a version of the GMX Protocol perpetual exchange operating on the Arbitrum blockchain network, suffered a cybersecurity exploit on July 9, with the hacker making away with $40 million.

However, the hacker returned the stolen funds several days later, accepting a $5 million white hat bounty in return for the $40 million in crypto.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Arcadia Finance was the target of a smart contract exploit on Tuesday, leading to $3.5 million in crypto drained by the threat actor.

 Block's inclusion in the S&P 500 comes just two months after crypto exchange Coinbase made history as the first cryptocurrency firm to join the index. 

Jack Dorsey's financial services company, Block, Inc., surged almost 9% in after-hours trading on Friday following the news that it will be added to the S&P 500, the benchmark index of the 500 largest US companies by market capitalization.

Block will replace US energy company Hess Corp on the S&P 500 before trading commences on Wednesday, according to a statement on Friday. The announcement triggered a strong reaction from the Bitcoin (BTC) community, given the firm's advocacy for Bitcoin and its strategy for holding Bitcoin as part of its treasury. The most recent data from Bitbo shows that Block holds 8,584 Bitcoin.

Crypto commentary account WiseSummit said in a post on Friday, “This is not just a headline. It is trillions in passive flows inching closer to Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, crypto trader cryptothedoggy said, “Crypto roots + Fintech firepower = Wall Street's new blueprint.”

The stock price of Block (XYZ) surged 8.49% in after-hours trading on Friday, reaching $79 according to Google Finance data.

To be listed on the S&P 500, the firm must have a market cap greater than $18 billion, a public float of greater than 10%, and the most recent quarter's earnings should be positive. The sum of the previous four quarters' GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) earnings should also be positive.

Block's entry into the S&P 500 came only two months after crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) became the first crypto firm to make it into the S&P 500 index.

However, there is speculation that more crypto-related firms may be added in the future. 

On Wednesday, after Michael Saylor's Strategy broke its all-time high market capitalization, Strive Funds Bitcoin Strategy vice president Jeff Walton said it is the 11th day of Strategy qualifying for the S&P 500. 

Block's move onto the S&P 500 had been anticipated for some time. On Jan. 10, Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, suggested that Block could become the first company with an “explicit” Bitcoin strategy to be included in the S&P 500.

Meanwhile, on May 28, Block announced it would launch Bitcoin payments on Square, its payments processing arm, with a rollout to begin later this year before a full launch in 2026.

The company announced the plan at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, where Block demonstrated the feature at the BTC Inc. merchandise store.

Merchants will be able to accept Bitcoin payments through existing Square hardware using the Lightning Network, Bitcoin's faster, lower-cost layer-2 scaling network.

 Cayman Islands-based Bullish has filed for IPO registration with the SEC, aiming to list on NYSE as “BLSH.” 

Bullish, a cryptocurrency exchange owned by Bullish Global, has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. The Cayman Islands-based firm plans to list its ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “BLSH.”

The exact number of shares to be offered and the price range remain unspecified, according to a Friday F-1 registration statement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the exchange has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase additional shares.

For fiscal year 2024, Bullish reported a net income of approximately $80 million. However, despite this positive full-year result, the company experienced a significant downturn in the first quarter of 2025, reporting a net loss of $349 million compared to a $104.8 million net profit in the same quarter of 2024.

Furthermore, the exchange claims over $1.9 billion in liquid assets, including cash, Bitcoin (BTC), stablecoins and other digital assets.

Bullish operates through subsidiaries across multiple jurisdictions, including Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Gibraltar.

Its Hong Kong subsidiaries play a crucial role in the exchange's operations, providing engineering, cybersecurity, custody, and technology services, per the filing. Bullish HK Markets Limited holds regulatory licenses in Hong Kong to facilitate digital asset trading.

Last month, the Financial Times reported that Bullish has filed confidential paperwork with the SEC for a US IPO. The report said that American investment bank Jefferies was selected as the lead underwriter for the offering.

The exchange, which previously attempted to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal in 2021, saw its earlier efforts collapse as markets soured amid rising interest rates.

Bullish's move comes amid recent successes in the crypto IPO space. Circle, the issuer of the USDC (USDC) stablecoin, raised $1.1 billion in its public debut last month, exceeding expectations and marking a record-setting 167% gain on its first day of trading.

On June 6, Gemini, the exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, also filed confidentially for a US listing. Both brothers supported Trump's reelection bid and have backed crypto-focused political action committees.

President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act on Friday, marking the first major US legislation to regulate cryptocurrency, especially the $250 billion stablecoin market. The bill had passed the House with bipartisan support from 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.

The signing ceremony included members of Congress and leaders from major crypto firms like Robinhood, Tether, and Gemini. The bill's progress was briefly blocked by a dozen conservative Republicans but was cleared after negotiations.

Welcome to the family.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Although only one species of hominin (a tribe of the subfamily Homininae) exists on the planet today—good ole Homo sapiens—the human family, throughout more geologically-recent Earth history, was comprised of a complex tableaux of members. And over the years, scientists have tried to get a clearer picture of that prehistoric story by excavating ancient human sites around the world. 

Now, anthropologists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Hawai'i are illustrating a previously unknown—or, rather, uncategorized—chapter of that story with the introduction of a new human species, H. juluensis. The researchers published the details of this new species in the journals Nature Communications and PaleoAnthropology.

H. juluensis—the name for which means “big head”—thrived in eastern Asia from 300,000 years ago to around 50,000 years ago, when the species died out. According to the researchers, this group likely hunted wild horses, fashioned stoned tools, and even processed animal hides to survive frigid winters. University of Hawai'i's Christopher J. Bae said the breakthrough for discovering this possibly new species came when he and his team were devising a new system for organizing fossil evidence. 

“Although we started this project several years ago, we did not expect being able to propose a new hominin (human ancestor) species and then to be able to organize the hominin fossils from Asia into different groups,” Bae said in a press statement. “This study clarifies a hominin fossil record that has tended to include anything that cannot easily be assigned to Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis or Homo sapiens.”

One possible member of the new species H. juluensis isn't a newcomer to science by any stretch. Denisovans—first identified in 2010 via DNA extracted from a young girl's fingerbone found in Siberia—have never been given a species classification, but Bae believes that they could belong to this new species. 

H. juluensis also potentially solves another mystery of the Xujiayao hominin fossils, which have long perplexed researchers, as the remains display a mix of H. erectus and H. sapiens  features. According to a study by the scientists in the journal PaleoAnthropology, these remains have been confused for a variety of taxonomic representations, but note that differences in the cranium (spoiler: it's big), the teeth and jaws, and a few other features denote a new species represented in fossil remains including Penghu 1 (jawbone), Xiahe (mandible), Xuchang (partial crania), and a variety of Denisova fossils. 

Although this is a convincing argument that these particular specimens belong to a previously unknown human species, more research will be needed before anthropologists bust out the “Welcome to the Family” banners. But because these fossils still defy species classification, it's likely only a matter of time before the hominin tribe increases by one (or more).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Popular sugar substitute linked to brain cell damage and stroke risk","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250718035156.htm","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 14:50:55 GMT","

From low-carb ice cream to keto protein bars to ""sugar-free"" soda, the decades-old sweetener erythritol is everywhere.

But new University of Colorado Boulder research shows the popular sugar substitute and specialty food additive comes with serious downsides, impacting brain cells in numerous ways that can boost risk of stroke.

The study was published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.

""Our study adds to the evidence suggesting that non-nutritive sweeteners that have generally been purported to be safe, may not come without negative health consequences,"" said senior author Christopher DeSouza, professor of integrative physiology and director of the Integrative Vascular Biology Lab.

First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001, erythritol is a sugar alcohol, often produced by fermenting corn and found in hundreds of products. It has almost no calories, is about 80% as sweet as table sugar, and has negligible impact on insulin levels, making it a favorite for people trying to lose weight, keep their blood sugar in check or avoid carbohydrates.

But recent research has begun to shed light on its risks.

One recent study involving 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe found that men and women with higher circulating levels of erythritol were significantly more likely to have a heart attack or stroke within the next three years.

DeSouza and first author Auburn Berry, a graduate student in his lab, set out to understand what might be driving that increased risk.

Researchers in the lab treated human cells that line blood vessels in the brain for three hours with about the same amount of erythritol contained in a typical sugar-free beverage.

They observed that the treated cells were altered in numerous ways: They expressed significantly less nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and widens blood vessels, and more endothelin-1, a protein that constricts blood vessels. Meanwhile, when challenged with a clot-forming compound called thrombin, cellular production of the natural clot-busting compound t-PA was ""markedly blunted."" The erythritol-treated cells also produced more reactive oxygen species (ROS), a.k.a. ""free radicals,"" metabolic byproducts which can age and damage cells and inflame tissue.

""Big picture, if your vessels are more constricted and your ability to break down blood clots is lowered, your risk of stroke goes up,"" said Berry. ""Our research demonstrates not only that, but how erythritol has the potential to increase stroke risk.""

DeSouza notes that their study used only a serving-size worth of the sugar substitute. For those who consume multiple servings per day, the impact, presumably, could be worse.

The authors caution that their study was a laboratory study, conducted on cells, and larger studies in people are needed.

That said, De Souza encourages consumers to read labels, looking for erythritol or ""sugar alcohol"" on the label.

""Given the epidemiological study that inspired our work, and now our cellular findings, we believe it would be prudent for people to monitor their consumption of non-nutrient-sweeteners such as this one,"" he said.

A team of scientists has developed a powerful new way to detect subtle magnetic signals in common metals like copper, gold, and aluminum—using nothing more than light and a clever technique. Their research, recently published in the prestigious journal Nature Communications, could pave the way for advances in everything from smartphones to quantum computing.

The Longstanding Puzzle: Why Can't We See the Optical Hall Effect?

For over a century, scientists have known that electric currents bend in a magnetic field—a phenomenon known as the Hall effect. In magnetic materials like iron, this effect is strong and well understood. But in ordinary, non-magnetic metals like copper or gold, the effect is much weaker.

In theory, a related phenomenon—the optical Hall effect—should help scientists visualize how electrons behave when light and magnetic fields interact. But at visible wavelengths, this effect has remained far too subtle to detect. The scientific world has known it was there, but lacked the tools to measure it.

“It was like trying to hear a whisper in a noisy room for decades,” said Prof. Amir Capua. “Everyone knew the whisper was there, but we didn't have a microphone sensitive enough to hear it.”

Cracking the Code: A Closer Look at the Invisible

Led by Ph.D. candidate Nadav Am Shalom and Prof. Amir Capua from the Institute of Electrical Engineering and Applied Physics at Hebrew University, in collaboration with Prof. Binghai Yan from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Pennsylvania State University, and Prof. Igor Rozhansky from the University of Manchester, the study focuses on a tricky challenge in physics: how to detect tiny magnetic effects in materials that aren't magnetic.

“You might think of metals like copper and gold as magnetically ‘quiet'—they don't stick to your fridge like iron does,” explained Prof. Capua. “But in reality, under the right conditions, they do respond to magnetic fields—just in extremely subtle ways.”

The challenge has always been how to detect these tiny effects—especially using light in the visible spectrum where laser sources are readily available. Until now, the signal was simply too faint to observe.

Turning Up the Volume on Magnetic Whispers

To solve this, the researchers upgraded a method called the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), which uses a laser to measure how magnetism alters light's reflection. Think of it like using a high-powered flashlight to catch the faintest glint off a surface in the dark.

By combining a 440-nanometer blue laser with large-amplitude modulation of the external magnetic field, they dramatically boosted the technique's sensitivity. The result: they were able to pick up magnetic “echoes” in non-magnetic metals like copper, gold, aluminum, tantalum, and platinum—a feat previously considered near-impossible.

Why It Matters: When Noise Becomes a Signal

The Hall effect is a pivotal tool in the semiconductor industry and in studying materials at the atomic scale: it helps scientists figure out how many electrons are in a metal. But traditionally, measuring the Hall effect means physically attaching tiny wires to the device, a process that is time-consuming and tricky, especially when dealing with nanometer-sized components. The new approach, however, is much simpler: it merely requires to shine a laser on the electrical device, no wires needed.

Digging deeper, the team found that what appeared to be random “noise” in their signal wasn't random at all. Instead, it followed a clear pattern tied to a quantum property called spin-orbit coupling, which links how electrons move to how they spin—a key behavior in modern physics.

This connection also affects how magnetic energy dissipates in materials. These insights have direct implications for the design of magnetic memory, spintronic devices, and even quantum systems.

“It's like discovering that static on a radio isn't just interference—it's someone whispering valuable information,” said Ph.D. candidate Am Shalom. “We're now using light to ‘listen' to these hidden messages from electrons.”

Looking Ahead: A New Window into Spin and Magnetism

The technique offers a non-invasive, highly sensitive tool for exploring magnetism in metals—without the need for massive magnets or cryogenic conditions. Its simplicity and precision could help engineers build faster processors, more energy-efficient systems, and sensors with unprecedented accuracy.

“This research turns a nearly 150-year-old scientific problem into a new opportunity,” said Prof. Capua.

“Interestingly, even Edwin Hall, the greatest scientists of all, who discovered the Hall effect, attempted to measure his effect using a beam of light with no success. He summarizes in the closing sentence of his notable paper from 1881: “I think that, if the action of silver had been one tenth as strong as that of iron, the effect would have been detected. No such effect was observed.” (E. Hall, 1881).”

“By tuning in to the right frequency—and knowing where to look—we've found a way to measure what was once thought invisible.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Dirty water, warm trucks, and the real reason romaine keeps making us sick","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250718031225.htm","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 14:40:39 GMT","

E. coli outbreaks in romaine lettuce have long been a public health concern. and now a new Cornell University paper suggests that a combination of efforts in the field, and even postharvest techniques, can minimize risk to human health.

Co-authored by Renata Ivanek, a professor in the department of population medicine and diagnostic sciences, and Martin Wiedmann, professor in food safety, the paper outlines interventions likely to make a concrete difference in the safety of the nation's romaine.

""This study supports that interventions should focus on reducing produce contamination via contaminated irrigation water, on assuring that produce washes applied during processing consistently deliver reasonably high reductions of bacterial numbers, and on improving temperature control during distribution,"" Wiedmann said.

""We tried to describe the system as holistically as possible to account for different risk factors and how they could have interactions,"" Ivanek said. ""There's not just one intervention that will save us all. We spent a lot of time trying to understand the preharvest component, especially the irrigation water piece and how much risk can be explained by that.""

Study results suggested that much contamination originates from irrigation with untreated surface water applied through overhead spray irrigation systems. They found that risk from irrigation was reduced either through water treatments or by switching to furrow or drip irrigation.

""While not the most common system, spray irrigation is used in a number of fields for its benefits during germination, its cooling effect on plants and other reasons. But drip or furrow irrigation reduces the probability that water directly touches the leaves,"" Ivanek said, acknowledging that switching to these other irrigation systems introduces significant potential additional costs to grower.

Ivanek and her co-authors also explored the importance of maintaining proper cold storage temperatures along the entire supply chain to romaine's final destination.

""Time and temperature play a role in food safety, and also in food quality and shelf life,"" she said, describing a ""perfect storm"" if contamination happens at the farm or processing level and then improper transportation temperatures allow bacteria to grow.

The comprehensive practices and interventions explored in this study intend to aid decision-makers in establishing and enhancing food safety best management practices, Ivanek said.

""The big message is the American food supply chain is extremely safe compared to other countries,"" she said. ""We're exploring how can we make it even safer and where we should put additional effort.""

It's been speculated on. It's been rumored. It's been hoped for. And according to an interview with TechRadar, it's happening. Android ecosystem president Sameer Samat says Google plans to combine Chrome OS and Android “into a single platform.”

Google has kept its phone and tablet operating systems distinct from its laptop platform. There has been plenty of crossover over the years—the biggest being the introduction of Android apps to Chromebooks back in 2016—but they have always coexisted. With Samat's new statement, though, change is afoot.

In the interview, Samat also followed up on a comment made to WIRED's Julian Chokkattu at Google I/O this year, hinting at a future Google laptop, stating that “he's interested in how people are using their laptops these days.” The last Google laptop was the Pixelbook Go in 2019, which followed the ill-fated Pixel Slate 2-in-1 in 2017. If Google does plan to merge the new platforms, having flagship Google hardware on hand is a must. —Luke Larsen

In other Google news, the company has set a date for its Made by Google event, where it's expected to debut the Pixel 10 series smartphones, a new Pixel Watch, and new wireless earbuds. The keynote takes place on August 20 in Brooklyn, New York, and it kicks off at 1 pm ET (10 am Pacific). It'll be livestreamed as usual.

Google used to hold its big hardware event in October, but changed things up last year, putting the Pixel release date ahead of the iPhone, with more breathing room ahead of the holiday shopping season. The highlight of this year's release—other than marking 10 years of Pixel—is that Google is rumored to be moving to TSMC chips for its Tensor G5 chipset due to issues with Samsung's foundry.

Sony has dropped a new full-frame camera out of the blue, the RX1R III. The RX1R series was last updated nine years ago. Why now? If I had to guess, I'd say it has a lot to do with the success of compact fixed-lens cameras, like the Leica Q series, Fujifilm X100 series, and the Fujifilm GFX100RF. Sorry you had to wait almost 10 years, RX1 fans, but better late than never.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

What do you get out of a 10-year development cycle? Turns out … not that much. The RX1R III is pretty much a repackaged a7R V in terms of image capabilities. There's the same 61-megapixel full-frame sensor paired with the a7R V's Bionz XR image processor and the dedicated AI chip. That's a significant upgrade for this camera relative to the last model in the series, but there's no brand-new tech here.

More interesting are the design changes. The RX1R III ditches the pop-up electronic viewfinder of the RX1R II in favor of a rear-mounted viewfinder, making it look a bit like Sony's high-res travel camera, the a7R C. Also, Sony dropped the articulating rear screen; this one is fixed like the very first RX1R. Probably the best upgrade here is that the RX1R III uses Sony's larger batteries, the NP-FW50, which will dramatically improve battery life.

One thing that hasn't changed at all since this series was launched in 2012 is the built-in Zeiss Sonnar T* 35-mm f/2 lens. The big question here is, how will this more-than-a-decade-old lens work with the latest and greatest autofocus? We'll let you know when we get our hands on a review unit later this year. —Scott Gilbertson

Omega this week dropped a bright, summery version of its excellent Seamaster Diver 300M, following on February's bronze gold and burgundy watch. While, yes, it's not exactly a groundbreaking departure from last year's original, it hits all the right notes, mainly thanks to how strong November's first iteration was. However, this model has an edge over its siblings.

The aluminum bezel and stylish mesh bracelet remain, but look closely and you'll see subtle changes, most pleasing of which is that the wave-pattern on the dial has been replaced with a flat, matte-textured black. For the orange enthusiasts, note the lollipop seconds hand, and indices at 12, 3, 6, and 9 have all been given a pop of color. A final flourish is the matching orange “Seamaster” dial signature.

As with last year's 42-mm original, we'd still opt for the mesh bracelet ($6,800), but if you want to go totally tangerine, then spec the integrated orange rubber strap at $6,500. Regardless of strap selection, with the Caliber 8806 inside (certified as a Master Chronometer by METAS) and water resistance to 300 meters, this piece—either in orange or the original black—is currently WIRED's pick of Omega's lineup. —Jeremy White

Whether you're worried about power outages or unpredictable weather events, or looking to better manage rising energy costs, EcoFlow's new Ocean Pro system is targeting you. This whole-home energy backup system pairs modular 10-kWh batteries (expandable up to 80 kWh) with an inverter that can handle up to 40-kW solar panel arrays. Ocean Pro can output up to 24 kW continuously, enough to fully power most households, including HVAC systems, EV chargers, and other appliances.

The brain of the Ocean Pro system is its Smart Home Panel, allowing for real-time energy monitoring and AI forecasting on weather, pricing, and usage to automate your smart home systems. The system can act as a backup with a 10-millisecond switchover time should the grid fail. Ocean Pro can also export power to the grid, and there's support for the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) network to export excess energy based on need and electricity prices.

EcoFlow offers a 15-year warranty, with an IP67 rating for water resistance and flood resistance up to 2.6 feet. The kit can handle extreme temperatures (from –4 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) and has built-in fire prevention. The Ocean Pro also passed the UL 9540B safety certification for energy storage systems. Most folks install them on the side of their house, so the batteries come in a choice of aluminum, carbon fiber, or walnut finishes.

These systems are a big jump up from the EcoFlow portable power stations and power banks we've tested, but the company has been selling its PowerOcean home batteries in Europe for a while, and they have a decent reputation.

The Ocean Pro beats Tesla's Powerwall 3 on two key fronts: It can handle more solar (double) and it can store more energy (Tesla maxes out at 54 kWh). But Ocean Pro will not be cheap. Exact pricing depends on your home and the size of the system, but just a couple of batteries and the inverter will cost around $10,000. Ocean Pro is available directly from EcoFlow now. —Simon Hill

Purveyor of gaming-focused virtual display glasses, Viture just announced a whole new lineup. The Luma Series has four models: Luma, Luma Pro, Luma Ultra, and the Beast. Aside from a sharper display across the board, Viture's main addition in the top three models is a front-facing camera to allow for spatial capture and 6 degrees of freedom (dof) using its Spacewalker app, though this is not available yet.

The Luma Pro I have been testing gives you a 152-inch virtual display with a 52-degree field of view at up to 1200p resolution and 1,000 nits of brightness. Viture describes them as 4K-like, despite the resolution, but what it means is that this is its sharpest display yet. The clarity and brightness are excellent. There's also electrochromic film to darken the shades, and full customization with nose pieces, diopter dials, and adjustable temples with lighting effects.

Viture's Pro XR glasses topped our Best Smart Glasses guide until the Xreal One Pro displaced them. The key advantage Xreal's glasses have is a hardware chip that allows 3 dof, so you can pin screens in place. Up until now, Viture's virtual displays moved with you when you moved your head (unless you used its Pro Neckband wearable Android computer or Spacewalker app). But the Luma Pro and up will support 6 dof, allowing you to move in 3D space, though it will still be handled through software on your connected device. Viture also offers AI-powered 2D to 3D conversion across its glasses.

The entry-level Luma ($399) lacks the camera and is set to land in September. The Luma Pro ($499) is available now, but the 6-dof functionality will be enabled via Spacewalker later. The Luma Ultra ($599), coming in August, gets a little brighter with newer Sony Micro-OLED panels, and also sports dual-depth cameras and wider 6-dof platform support, including MacBook and Windows. The flagship model, the Beast ($549), landing in October, ups the field of view to 58 degrees and the display size to 176 inches, and it has built-in hardware to enable 3 dof, with 6 dof via software, and a built-in microphone. —Simon Hill

Sony is jumping into business with the National Football League. The two megabrands announced a partnership this week that includes a custom-developed Sony headset as the primary communications device for NFL head coaches. The headset may look familiar to fans of Sony's popular wireless headphones, as the design borrows heavily from the brand's flagship WH-1000X series, from engineering insights to the look and feel of the earcups.

Sony says the headset has undergone extensive testing in rain, snow, cold, and extreme heat to take on the notoriously bad-weather games NFL coaches endure, as well as drop testing for mishaps (and presumably flaring tempers).

Sony not only brought its years of noise-canceling experience to the system, but also optimized it for real-game environments using crowd noise at over 100 decibels, according to Sony Audio product manager Gator Nakahashi. Sideline communication will be handled by a custom mic transmitted over Verizon Business' Private Wireless Solution. The headsets will hit the field at the start of the 2025 season as the Cowboys take on the Eagles on September 4. —Ryan Waniata

This story originally appeared on Vox and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

In the wake of the record-breaking wildfires in Los Angeles in January—some of the most expensive and destructive blazes in history—one of the first things California governor Gavin Newsom did was to sign an executive order suspending environmental rules around rebuilding.

The idea was that by waiving permitting regulations and reviews under the California Coastal Act and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), homeowners and builders could start cleaning up, putting up walls, and getting people back into houses faster.

But that raised a key question for housing advocates: Could California do something similar for the whole state?

Earlier this month, Newsom took a step in that direction, signing two bills that would exempt most urban housing from environmental reviews and make it easier for cities to increase housing by changing zoning laws. Newsom also signed another executive order that suspends some local permitting laws and building codes for fire-afflicted communities with the aim of further speeding up reconstruction.

Housing reforms can't come soon enough for the City of Angels. Blown by hurricane-strength Santa Ana winds over an unusually dry, grassy landscape, the wildfires that tore through LA burned almost 48,000 acres and damaged or destroyed more than 16,000 structures, including more than 9,500 single-family homes, 1,200 duplexes, and 600 apartments in one of the most housing-starved regions of the country.

Los Angeles is a critical case study for housing for the whole state, a test of whether the Democratic-controlled government can coordinate its conflicting political bases—unions, environmental groups, housing advocates—with a desperate need for more homes. Revising the state's environmental laws was seen by some observers as a sign that the Golden State was finally seeing the light.

But despite the relaxed rules, progress in LA has been sluggish. More than 800 homeowners in areas affected by wildfires applied for rebuilding permits as of July 7, according to the Los Angeles Times. Fewer than 200 have received the green light, however. The City of Los Angeles takes about 55 days on average to approve a wildfire rebuild, and the broader Los Angeles County takes even longer. (Los Angeles County has a dashboard to track permitting approvals in unincorporated areas.)

“LA's process is super slow, so that's not surprising,” said Elisa Paster, a managing partner at Rand Paster Nelson, a firm based in Los Angeles that specializes in land use law. “Anecdotally, we've heard that a lot of people have decided they don't want to go through the process of rebuilding in LA because it is quite onerous.”

Now, half a year after the embers have died down, it's clear that changing the rules isn't enough. Advocates for CEQA say the 55-year-old law is really a scapegoat for bigger, more intractable housing problems. Other factors, like more expensive construction materials and labor shortages, are still driving up housing construction costs, regardless of permitting speeds. And some environmental groups worry that the rush to rebuild everything as it was could recreate the conditions that led to the blazes in the first place, a dangerous prospect in an area where wildfire risks are only growing.

CEQA is one of California's tentpole environmental laws, signed by then governor Ronald Reagan in 1970. It requires that state and local governments preemptively look for any potential environmental harms from a construction project, like water pollution, threats to endangered species, and later, greenhouse gas emissions. Developers need to disclose these issues and take steps to avoid them. The law also allows the public to weigh in on new developments.

In the years since, CEQA has been blamed as a barrier to new construction. Many critics see it as a cynical tool wielded to prevent new housing construction in wealthy communities, even being invoked to challenge highway closures and new parks on environmental grounds. It's one of the villains of the “abundance” movement that advocates for cutting red tape to build more homes and clean energy.

However, CEQA isn't necessarily the gatekeeper to rebuilding single-family homes after wildfires, according to Matthew Baker, policy director at the Planning and Conservation League, a nonprofit that helped shepherd CEQA in the first place.

For one thing, CEQA already has broad exemptions for replacing and rebuilding structures and new construction of “small” structures like single-family homes. “Our general take is that the executive orders around revoking environmental review and environmental regulations around the rebuilding [after the fires] did little to nothing beyond what was already in existing law,” Baker said. He added that the vast majority of projects that face CEQA review get the go-ahead, and less than 2 percent of proposals face litigation.

An aerial view shows homes burned in the Eaton Fire on February 05, 2025, in Altadena, California. U.S.

But the mere threat of a lawsuit and the precautions taken to avoid one can become a significant hurdle on its own. “CEQA can be an expensive and lengthy process, especially for large or complicated projects. This is true even if there is not litigation,” according to a 2024 report from California's Little Hoover Commission, the state's independent oversight agency. “Preparation of an Environmental Impact Report under CEQA can take a year or longer and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even, in some cases, more than $1 million.”

In addition, CEQA does come into play for people who want to make more extensive changes to their property as they rebuild, like if they want to expand their floorspace more than 10 percent beyond their original floor plan. The law is also triggered by broader wildfire risk-reduction initiatives, namely brush clearance and controlled burns, as well as infrastructure upgrades like putting power lines underground to prevent fire ignitions or installing more pipelines and cisterns for water to help with firefighting. Exempting these projects could help communities build fire resilience faster.

For multifamily homes like duplexes and apartment buildings, CEQA can be an obstacle, too, if the developer wants to rebuild with more units. “We have multifamily buildings in the Palisades that had rent-controlled units, and what we've been hearing from some of these property owners is like, ‘Yeah, sure. I had 20 rent-controlled units there before, but I can't afford to just rebuild 20.' Those people want to go back and build 50 units, 20 of which could be rent-controlled, or all of which are rent-controlled.” By bypassing CEQA, higher-density housing has an easier path to completion.

Rebuilding after fires is always going to be expensive. Your home may have been built and sold in the 1970s, but you'll have to pay 2025 prices for materials and labor when you rebuild. California already faces some of the highest housing costs in the country and a shortage of construction workers. The Trump administration is pushing the price tag higher with tariffs on components like lumber and its campaign to deport people. About 41 percent of workers in California's construction industry are immigrants, and 14 percent are undocumented.

But even before they can rebuild, one of the biggest challenges for people who have lost their homes is simply becoming whole after a loss. “From the clients that I've spoken to, they've had to argue with their insurance company to get full replacement value or reasonable compensation, and that's where they're getting stuck,” said David Hertz, an architect based in Santa Monica.

On top of the tedious claims process, insurance companies in California have been dropping some of their customers in high-fire-risk areas, leaving them no option besides the FAIR Plan, the state's high-priced, limited-coverage insurer of last resort. But after the multibillion-dollar losses from the Los Angeles fires, the FAIR Plan had to collect an additional $1 billion from its member companies, a move that will raise property insurance prices. People who can't get property insurance can't get a mortgage from most lenders.

There's also the concern of exactly where and how homes are rebuilt. In 2008, California updated its building codes to make structures more resistant to wildfires, but bringing burned-down old homes to new standards in high-fire-risk areas adds to the timeline and the price tag.

“There's this tension between all of us wanting to have people be able to rebuild their homes in their communities, and there's the question of ‘Are we just going to build back the same thing in the same unsafe place? Are we going to try to do things better?” Baker said.

All the while, wildfires are becoming more destructive. Wildfires are a natural part of Southern California's landscape, but more people are crowding into areas that are primed to burn, and the danger zones are widening. That increases the chances of a wildfire ignition and makes the ensuing blazes more damaging.

With average temperatures rising, California is seeing more aggressive swings between severe rainfall and drought. The 2025 Los Angeles fires were preceded in 2024 by one of the wettest winters in the region's history, followed by one of the hottest summers on record, and bookended by one of the driest starts to winter. It created the ideal conditions for ample dry grasses and chaparral that fueled the infernos.

“The question is, how does one really exist within a natural system that's designed to burn?” Hertz said. Reducing wildfire risk on a wider scale requires coordination between neighbors.

For example, Hertz said that in many of the communities that burned, there are likely many residents who won't come back. Neighbors could coordinate to buy up and swap vacant land parcels to create a defensible space with fire-resistant trees like oak to serve as fire breaks and water storage to help respond to future blazes. Hertz himself leads a community brigade, trained volunteers who work to reduce wildfire risk in their neighborhoods.

He also cautioned that while there's a lot of well-deserved pushback against regulations like CEQA, the reasoning behind it remains sound. Development without any environmental considerations could put more homes in the path of danger and destroy the ecosystems that make California such an attractive place to live.

“I think there's a balance,” Hertz said. “Nature doesn't have its own voice.”

At the same time, without speeding up the pace at which California restores the homes that were lost and builds new ones, the housing crisis will only get worse. The state will become unlivable for many residents. Long after the burn scars fade and new facades are erected, communities will be altered permanently.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Automakers Are Canceling Plans for New EVs. Here's a List of What's Been Killed So Far","https://www.wired.com/story/list-of-new-evs-canceled-by-automakers/","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

The year 2025 is only half over. But for some of global automakers' most ambitious electric vehicle projects, the In Memoriam segment is already shaping up to be a sad one. Major manufacturers including Honda, Stellantis, and Nissan publicly backed off plans to build and sell battery-electric vehicles, joining others who have made similar admissions in the past two years.

Vehicle program cancellations aren't the sign of a thriving industry. Traditional automakers work on five- to seven-year product cycles, which means they've already started spending money to design, plan, and produce vehicles that won't roll onto dealers' lots for years. Nixing those vehicles means losing money and leaving holes in their portfolios—something automakers won't do without good reason.

The good reason here seems to mostly come down to utter chaos in the EV market. Some five years ago, automakers seemed desperate to catch up with Tesla and its sky-high valuation, and so made grand pledges. Mercedes-Benz and Volvo said they would go all-electric by 2030; General Motors targeted 2035. Then the Covid-19 pandemic hit and scrambled supply chains. Then governments, including the US government, used a mix of subsidies and regulations to ratchet up pressure for automakers to produce zero-emission cars. Then EV sales growth slowed. Now, in the US, the federal government has used the GOP's One Big Beautiful Bill to bring a sudden halt to years of EV and battery manufacturing boosterism. Plus, its tariff policy has upended global supply chains. Now many of those automakers' big electric promises have quietly gone away.

Which is to say, the cancellations make some sense. “It's business as usual in the sense that disruption is the main driver of the last five years,” says Mark Wakefield, the global automotive lead at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. “There's a speed bump every year.” This year, the firm dropped its 2030 sales predictions for battery-electric and hybrid cars by a whopping 46 percent compared to last year's projections.

Cancellations might also be signs that automakers are learning from their mistakes and even beginning to adapt more quickly. “There's a lot happening and a lot also being questioned and then abandoned,” says Wakefield. Making faster lineup changes should be key to keeping up with Chinese automakers, who have been able to shepherd new EVs from conception to the roads in less than two years.

Which is to say, more changes are likely on the way. All the way down the automotive supply chain, “companies are going quiet about their EV projects,” says Hannah Hess, the associate director of the energy and climate practice at the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Manufacturers tend not to announce their cancellations but instead hope that people forget about their original proposals. So WIRED made a list of the canceled and postponed EVs of the past two years.

RIP to them—and expect a few more losses along the way.

Ford Three-Row EV SUVDied August 2024

Ford said last summer that it had rethought its electric vehicle strategy, cutting its annual EV program spend and devoting more resources to hybrids. ""What we've learned is that customers want choice, and so we're providing that choice, with a full lineup of EVs, hybrid, electric, gas, and diesel products,"" Ford CFO John Lawler said at the time. Among the casualties of the shift was a three-row electric SUV.

Honda Five- and Seven-Seat EV SUVDied July 2025

This month, Honda reportedly nixed a new EV series meant to hit the roads starting in 2026. The company reconsidered its plans in light of falling demand for EVs in the US and will reportedly refocus on increasing hybrid production. Honda is moving forward with its “0 Series” sedan and midsize SUV EVs, which are set to debut next year.

Mercedes-Benz MB.EA-Large PlatformDied May 2024

Mercedes-Benz was supposed to build a new electric vehicle platform to support the next versions of its EQS and EQE sedans and SUVs, plus other future luxury EV models, starting in 2028. But poor initial sales for the EQS and EQE reportedly led the company to focus on its current platform instead.

Nissan and Infiniti EV SedansDied April 2025

Nissan North America Chair Christian Meunier told Automotive News this spring that the automaker was “listening to market data” and its US customers, who were demanding fewer EVs and more SUVs. “The sedan market is shrinking,” he said. “We need to face reality.” Two EV sedans, by Nissan and its luxury division Infiniti, are out, and Nissan will build at least two electric SUVs instead.

Volvo All-EV LineupDied September 2024

Volvo said in 2021 that it planned to become a fully electric car company by 2030. Just three years later, it changed its tune. The company wrote in a press release that it “decided to adjust its electrification ambitions due to changing market conditions and customer demands.”

Maserati MC20 FolgoreDied March 2025

Stellantis' luxury Maserati brand killed off its planned MC20 sports car earlier this year. A spokesperson told Reuters that its customers “are not ready to switch to BEV (battery electric vehicles) in a foreseeable future.”

Apple CarDied February 2024

Apple's ambitious Project Titan, a plan to build an electric, autonomous car, operated in deep secrecy for a decade. Then the company reportedly pulled the plug in February 2024. The big problems plaguing the program included many, many changes in strategy and personnel, a cooling electric vehicle market, issues with the self-driving part of the project, the lack of support from a traditional automaker, and Apple's big push into other artificial intelligence projects. Some on the car team were reportedly moved into alternative AI efforts.

Fisker PearDied June 2024

The Fisker Pear, announced in 2022, was supposed to be a compact electric produced by the scrappy startup helmed by serial car company founder and designer Henrik Fisker. But the program was paused amid ""financial difficulty” in March 2024. By that summer, Fisker had filed for bankruptcy.

Buick EVDelayed July 2024

At one point, General Motors' Buick brand was positioned as the automaker's greenest. Now, a spokesperson for Buick says its first electrified car is postponed. Meanwhile, GM's 2018 promise to sell only electric vehicles by 2035 has been quietly scrapped. Just last month, GM said it would spend $4 billion in the next two years to increase production of electric and gasoline vehicles.

Ferrari EV 2Delayed June 2025

Ferrari's second EV model was meant to debut at the end of 2026; now it reportedly won't make an entrance until at least 2028. Reuters reported that the automaker doesn't see sustainable demand for an electric sports car and is concerned about the effects of heavy EV batteries on the experience of driving a zippy ride.

Lamborghini LanzadorDelayed 2024

Lamborghini's first all-electric vehicle was announced in 2023 for a 2028 production date; now, it won't make an appearance until 2029 at least. CEO Stephan Winkelmann cited slower-than-predicted electric vehicle adoption and changing regulations. “Life cycles are becoming shorter due to a lot of new regulations coming in each and every year. This is making our life more complex,” he said this month.

Lamborghini UrusDelayed July 2025

Also delayed, for an even longer while, is Lamborghini's “Super SUV” EV. The Urus will reportedly remain a plug-in hybrid until 2035.

Porsche 718 EVDelayed May 2025

Porsche last said that its next-gen, electric 718 was due out “mid-decade.” Perhaps wisely, Porsche never committed to a firm date. Now the vehicle is reportedly delayed not just due to lower-than-expected EV demand but because of supply chain troubles: Battery supplier Northvolt went suddenly bankrupt this year.

Tesla Model 2Delayed?

Last year, Tesla downgraded long-time plans to build a truly affordable electric car in favor of a revamped but still cheaper offering. At the time, the company said it would begin production of this new vehicle in June 2025. But as the electric-car company emphasizes its small, supervised self-driving taxi service launch in Austin, Texas, it has made no noise about this newer car. Expect an update from CEO Elon Musk this coming week, when the company holds its quarterly earnings call.

Most founders eventually have to pitch venture firms in hopes of raising capital. Tiffany Luck, a partner at NEA, took the stage at TechCrunch's All Stage event in Boston to answer how to craft the perfect one.

“I like to think of a VC pitch as your initial way for assessing founder-investor fit,” she told the crowd before diving into her presentation. One of the most important slides to have in a pitch is “The What,” she said, meaning, “‘The What' are you building.” That's followed by “The Why” you are the right person for the job and why you have a unique solution. But there's another Why, too: “‘Why' is now the perfect time to do it.”

Then there is “The Who,” she continued, “Who have you recruited to do this crazy thing with?” And finally, “The How.” 

“How are you going to get there? How are you getting there today? How will you get there over time?” she said. 

Then, of course, “some sense of numbers,” she added, saying that part depends on what state a company is trying to fundraise for — pre-seed, seed, Series A, and so forth.  “These are just meant to be the fundamental basics.” 

As Luck explained, “The What” sets the stage, telling the investor what the problem is, how it affects people, followed by what solutions exist today and where lies room for disruption. 

Showcasing a product demo during “The What” is a good idea, she said, and that a lot of investors love product demos. “If you think a picture is worth 100 words, I think a demo is worth 1,000 hours,” she said. “When you see the product, you actually get it quickly.” 

Luck said there are two different “Whys” every founder should address. First, there is the deeper Why, where a founder goes into their origin story and explains their unique perspective on a solution. 

Obsession is key here, she said, adding that investors want to see and understand that a founder is completely consumed by a problem and solution. This this passion is what will keep everyone motivated to keep building, she said.

Following this is the “Why now,” which means going into the market dynamics and readiness. 

“It's telling the story of why the market is ready for what you have or what you're building,” she said. 

The Why now leads into “The Who,” where the founder is expected to talk about the team they've assembled, how everyone's skills complement each other, and why everyone is obsessed with the mission of the product. 

“The shared conviction piece is really important,” Luck said. “It's ‘how are you all envisioning the future together?'” 

“The How,” is where a founder is supposed to talk about “milestones.” 

Here, she said, investors want to know what the minimum viable product (MVP) is? Who are the early users ? And what feedback the product is getting from them so far? 

“And again, explain where you are today. Where are you going? What have you learned?” she asked, listing off the questions. 

Talking about pivoting, if necessary, is also good here. 

Luck noted that she often talks to founders who pivoted early or at some point in their journey. It helps investors learn more about the early phases of a company, of “where not to go, what not to do, and it will help with the rest of the journey,” she said.

Finally, she weighed in on the importance of numbers. 

“Investors do love numbers,” she said. “I think a lot of the important numbers also involve storytelling.” Here, investors want to know about the market size and any traction a product might have. “Why do customers love this product? Why do you imagine that it's not only going to grow, but grow sustainably in a way that has great retention?” 

She likes to see a company talk about how much cash it's burning through, and what the runway looks like. The most important thing, though, is the ask: how much a founder is looking to raise this round and what they will do with the money. 

All together, the Who, What, How, and (two) Whys serve as a starting point, helping founders as they go forth on the entrepreneurship journey. 

“Founding a company is like extreme sports,” she said, likening it to climbing Everest in particular. “You're going up on milestones, different camps. You're encountering challenges, you're weathering storms, and you know, eventually you're trying to make it to the top, to the summit.”

AI is being forced on us in pretty much every facet of life, from phones and apps to search engines and even drive-throughs, for some reason. The fact that we're now getting web browsers with baked-in AI assistants and chatbots shows that the way some people are using the internet to seek out and consume information today is very different from even a few years ago.

But AI tools are more and more asking for gross levels of access to your personal data under the guise of needing it to work. This kind of access is not normal, nor should it be normalized. 

Not so long ago, you would be right to question why a seemingly innocuous-looking free “flashlight” or “calculator” app in the app store would try to request access to your contacts, photos, and even your real-time location data. These apps may not need that data to function, but they will request it if they think they can make a buck or two by monetizing your data. 

These days, AI isn't all that different. 

Take Perplexity's latest AI-powered web browser, Comet, as an example. Comet lets users find answers with its built-in AI search engine and automate routine tasks, like summarizing emails and calendar events. 

In a recent hands-on with the browser, TechCrunch found that when Perplexity requests access to a user's Google Calendar, the browser asks for a broad swath of permissions to the user's Google Account, including the ability to manage drafts and send emails, download your contacts, view and edit events on all of your calendars, and even the ability to take a copy of your company's entire employee directory.

Perplexity says much of this data is stored locally on your device, but you're still granting the company rights to access and use your personal information, including to improve its AI models for everyone else.

Perplexity isn't alone in asking for access to your data. There is a trend of AI apps that promise to save you time by transcribing your calls or work meetings, for example, but which require an AI assistant to access your real-time private conversations, your calendars, contacts, and more. Meta, too, has been testing the limits of what its AI apps can ask for access to, including tapping into the photos stored in a user's camera roll that haven't been uploaded yet.

Signal president Meredith Whittaker recently likened the use of AI agents and assistants to “putting your brain in a jar.” Whittaker explained how some AI products can promise to do all kinds of mundane tasks, like reserving a table at a restaurant or booking a ticket for a concert. But to do that, AI will say it needs your permission to open your browser to load the website (which can allow the AI access to your stored passwords, bookmarks, and your browsing history), a credit card to make the reservation, your calendar to mark the date, and it may also ask to open your contacts so you can share the booking with a friend.

There are serious security and privacy risks associated with using AI assistants that rely on your data. In allowing access, you're instantly and irreversibly handing over the rights to an entire snapshot of your most personal information as of that moment in time, from your inbox, messages, and calendar entries dating back years, and more. All of this for the sake of performing a task that ostensibly saves you time — or, to Whittaker's point, saves you from having to actively think about it.

You're also granting the AI agent permission to act autonomously on your behalf, requiring you to put an enormous amount of trust in a technology that is already prone to getting things wrong or flatly making things up. Using AI further requires you to trust the profit-seeking companies developing these AI products, which rely on your data to try to make their AI models perform better. When things go wrong (and they do, a lot), it's common practice for humans at AI companies to look over your private prompts to figure out why things didn't work.

From a security and privacy point of view, a simple cost-benefit analysis of connecting AI to your most personal data just isn't worth giving up access to your most private information. Any AI app asking for these levels of permissions should send your alarm bells ringing, just like the flashlight app wanting to know your location at any moment in time. 

Given the reams of data that you hand over to AI companies, ask yourself if what you get out of it is really worth it.

Bitcoin may be the most famous cryptocurrency on the planet, but in Washington, it's suddenly the ghost at the party.

This week, lawmakers passed the GENIUS Act, the first-ever U.S. law focused entirely on cryptocurrency. It sets clear federal rules for stablecoins, the digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar and used for instant payments. For the first time, crypto has a legal foundation in America.

But here's the twist: the bill doesn't mention Bitcoin. And that silence speaks volumes.

From Spotlight to Sideline

For more than a decade, Bitcoin dominated every conversation about crypto. It was the revolution, the protest, the gold 2.0. Politicians warned about it, billionaires backed it, and banks feared it.

Now? The U.S. government just passed the most important crypto law in history, and it didn't include Bitcoin at all.

Why? Because Bitcoin doesn't fit the Washington agenda anymore. Stablecoins are the hot new thing in the halls of Congress. They're pegged to the dollar, designed for payments, and (at least now) tightly regulated. They're the kind of crypto lawmakers can get behind: useful, tame, and trackable.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is messy. It's volatile, anonymous, and built to operate outside the financial system. It doesn't want approval. It doesn't ask for permission. And that makes it a problem for lawmakers trying to modernize finance without surrendering control.

Even as Wall Street piles into Bitcoin ETFs and companies like BlackRock embrace it as a long-term asset, D.C. remains silent. Bitcoin is being treated like a relic of crypto's rebellious past, not part of its regulated future.

A Shift in Crypto Power

The passage of the GENIUS Act is a political pivot. Stablecoins now have rules, protections, and the federal government's blessing. They're being embraced by banks, fintech firms, and maybe soon by everyday consumers sending money across borders or paying rent digitally.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, is on the outside looking in. Still popular. Still powerful. But politically orphaned. If this trend continues, crypto's future may belong to the regulated, dollar-linked digital tokens, and not the decentralized dream that Bitcoin represents. The big question: can Bitcoin stay relevant in a post-GENIUS world?

For now, Bitcoin remains king on Wall Street. But in Washington, it's rapidly becoming an afterthought. In a town where the rules are now being written, that's a dangerous place to be.

Prime Day may have passed nearly two weeks ago but summer is not a time for Amazon to take a break. If you're looking for a portable power station for van life or camping, there is no better time than now: Jackery Explorer models are very popular and they're currently on sale at Amazon.

Today, the Jackery portable power station Explorer 300 is an all-time low at Amazon, dropping to just $169 from its usual $259 price. The 35% discount puts it at the lower end for power stations available on the market for both planned holidays and unexpected power outages.

See at Amazon

The Jackery Explorer 300 boasts a 293Wh lithium-ion battery pack housed in a light and compact body and weighs only 7 pounds. Even though it's small, you have plenty of power which is strong enough to charge essentials such as smartphones, cameras, drones, laptops, and small appliances when you're out of the house.

Six devices are chargeable at the same time by users because of a wide variety of ports: two pure sine wave AC ports for continuous charging, a USB-C PD 60W port that is both input and output, a Quick Charge 3.0 port, a common USB-A, and a DC car port.

One of the major advantages is how fast the Explorer 300 can recharge: Using a standard wall plug and the USB-C PD charging input, you can charge up to 80% in just two hours from flat. Road life is taken care of by charging the power station from your car plug, or (if you own a Jackery SolarSaga 100 solar panel) by topping off on sunshine.

Because it is battery-powered and not gasoline, there are no fumes, no sound, and no upkeep to worry about, no complicated installation to navigate. Put it alongside the campsite, in a van, or in your living room in the event of a blackout.

With summer in full swing, Amazon's current deal won't last long.

With Donkey Kong Bananza now making its case as the real launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2, I needed a controller that could keep up with Kong's crashing fists. When it came to a game that epitomized joy and catharsis in equal measure, Nintendo's own Pro device proved a leading contender as best all-around, but not for the reasons you may think.

I spent my own money on an $85 Switch 2 Pro controller. Accounting for tax, it was closer to $95, which is nearly one-fifth of the total price I paid for my Switch 2. It's currently one of the most expensive gamepads you can buy for the Nintendo's new handheld, which is partially why the device has caused its own controversy. The repair gurus at iFixit called it “a piss poor excuse” for a gamepad. They excoriated it not just for how it's basically impossible to take apart, but for its lack of Hall effect joysticks. Those kinds of sticks use a magnetic field to reduce the risk of stick drift. The Pro 2 still uses potentiometer joysticks, which can wear out over time and create issues where the controller imagines inputs you didn't intend. When I brought my controller to the checkout counter, the retail worker asked if I wanted insurance. “The sticks can start to drift,” she said. Not a good first impression.

See Switch 2 Pro Controller at Amazon

Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller

It feels good in-hand, but there are better options if you can deal with connectivity issues.

Pros

Cons

These complaints are more than warranted, but the Pro controller does feel purpose-built for modern titles like Bananza. It's comfortable for most players, both big and small, thanks to its overly large face buttons and the smooth, rubbery feel of the sticks. I would prefer triggers with more depth to each pull, but Switch 2 games won't require any kind of pressure-sensitive trigger unless you play a GameCube title. In that case, Nintendo's recreated $65 GameCube controller is still your best bet for accurate gameplay. My main gripes with the controls are the soft L and R buttons and the spongy D-pad that won't pass muster for any fighting game aficionado. Is it the kind of device I would spend nearly $100 on? Normally, no. The problem is that third-party controllers on Switch 2 lack several features of the Pro 2 controller, which seems like a deliberate act on Nintendo's part.

The hedges of Nintendo's walled garden are as high and floral as they've ever been. Players who bought Nintendo's $450 handheld have a range of choices for a case or cameras if they're truly jonesing to see their choppy face represented in GameChat, but gamepads are another story. From a controller perspective, Nintendo's system is designed first and foremost for first-party. Sure, you could say that about any console, but Nintendo's device makes connecting third-party controllers a chore.

For review, both 8BitDo and Gulikit sent me their latest controllers to pair with Switch 2. Both makers have solid track records, and I would have expected an easy time linking them and the Switch 2. 8BitDo's $60 Ultimate 2 controller and Gulikit's latest $50 Elves 2 Pro—made to look like a classic Genesis gamepad—lack a “C” button for GameChat. That's not a heavy knock against either device since you can still access the voice chat function through the home menu. The issue for both was how hard it became to pair them with Nintendo's handheld. Both require new firmware updates through their respective websites. Even then, pairing them to the console could take two seconds or more than a minute.

See 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller at Amazon

See Elves 2 Pro Controller at Amazon

Gulikit told Gizmodo that the Switch 2 is using a different connection protocol than the original Switch. This means all third-party device makers had to adjust on the fly to what Nintendo changed. For one, Nintendo's Pro 2 controller is the only gamepad that lets you use Nintendo's software to program the GR and GL back buttons. The option doesn't come up on any controller, not even the officially licensed, wired PowerA Advantage controller at $40. Instead, you have to hold down the “PGRM” button on the back, select a button you want to map, and then hit one of the two AGR or AGL buttons on the rear.

See Power A Advantage Controller at Amazon

The inconsistencies mount when trying to get gyro controls working. There were rare instances when the Ultimate 2 wouldn't recognize them. Otherwise, both 8BitDo's controller and Elves 2 Pro had gyros just as accurate, if not more so, than Nintendo's device. Bonanza uses gyros only when aiming a chunk in Bananza or when adding a second player to control Pauline as DK's vocal turret. I prefer gyro aiming for Nintendo's games and in third-party games like Cyberpunk 2077, so the lack of it on the PowerA Advantage controller doesn't help it stand out despite its lower price.

While Donkey Kong Bananza wants you to feel like DK with every swing of your fist, Nintendo's Pro 2 controller lacks an evocative rumble. It barely shuddered my hands. 8BitDo's Ultimate 2 was like a jackhammer in comparison. Every cracked stone hit my wrists with a satisfying shudder. The Elves 2 Pro and Power A lack rumble, but I would also suggest you look at Gulikit's KK3 Max. It has solid rumble and gyro controls. It also has the same connection problems as the rest of these devices.

See Gulikit's KK3 Max at Amazon

Nintendo also ensured that only its first-party controllers could wake the console from sleep. It's just another annoying fact that gives Nintendo's Pro controller an edge. The Ultimate 2 or KK3 Max are both great first options if you can stomach those connectivity issues, but after several multiplayer sessions where controllers inexplicably disconnect, the problems aren't something you can ignore. Put together, it's enough to make me wish I were Donkey Kong—only thinking of his next banana fix—and with no care for walled gardens or expensive controllers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","China's BYD Takes the Lead Over Tesla in the Self-Driving Car Wars","https://gizmodo.com/chinas-byd-takes-the-lead-over-tesla-in-the-self-driving-car-wars-2000631712","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 15:00:30 GMT","

As the auto industry races toward autonomy, most companies are rolling out driver-assist features with one hand while handing out waivers, disclaimers, and legal fine print with the other. Not BYD.

The Chinese EV giant just made an unprecedented move: it's offering a public, financial guarantee for its autonomous parking system. If the system malfunctions, even due to an algorithmic failure, BYD will cover all resulting damages, including repair costs, third-party property damage, and compensation for personal injury.

“We are first in the world to propose a guarantee for autonomous parking,” the company said in a statement posted on social media Weibo. “Our move reflects absolute confidence in God's Eye ADAS.”

It's a bold promise that could set a new global benchmark for how automakers take—or avoid—responsibility for their autonomous technology.

While Tesla Warns, BYD Backs It Up

The announcement draws a sharp contrast with Tesla, whose Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is still marketed as a beta feature. Despite its name, FSD requires full driver supervision, and Tesla repeatedly reminds users that they, not the company, are legally responsible for anything that happens on the road.

BYD's stance flips that logic on its head. It's not just promising a smarter system; it's promising corporate accountability, a component that has been largely missing from the discussion around consumer-grade autonomy.

This guarantee is being delivered via a simple over-the-air (OTA) software update, not as part of a flashy concept car. With the upcoming God's Eye B update, BYD will enhance scene recognition, active safety, and precision parking in all conditions, including new functions like three-speed parking, U-turn assistance, and bypass maneuvers.

The First Real Liability Shift?

BYD wants to establish legal and financial trust. For years, regulators and safety advocates have warned that carmakers were deploying autonomous features too quickly without clearly defining who is to blame when something goes wrong. BYD's pledge may be the first real-world test of shifting liability from the user back to the manufacturer.

The move could have significant ripple effects. If one company is willing to put its money on the line for Level 4-style autonomous parking, will competitors be pressured to match that promise or risk being seen as reckless?

China First, But Not for Long?

For now, BYD's guarantee is limited to China. But the company's growing international presence, including its aggressive push into Europe and Latin America, raises a critical question: will BYD bring this liability pledge to Western markets?

If it does, it could force U.S. and European regulators to reexamine how they treat self-driving technology. It would also put immense pressure on companies like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, and GM to offer similar guarantees or risk appearing evasive to consumers.

After all, if a Chinese automaker can afford to own the risk of its AI, what's stopping Silicon Valley's richest car company?

The Bottom Line

BYD is attempting to rewrite the rules of who owns the consequences when AI is driving the car. In a world where most automakers treat autonomy as a “use at your own risk” feature, BYD's move is both rare and radical. They're not just betting on their technology; they're betting on earning your trust.

And unlike Tesla, they aren't asking you to sign a waiver. They're asking you to believe them, with their wallet.

Ken DiCross is building the infrastructure to connect blockchains, and he's doing it with AI. The founder of Wire Network, a blockchain interoperability company, DiCross says he uses AI for everything from pitching investors to stress-testing white papers. In this week's edition of How Do You Use AI?, he explains how it saves him hours every day, why he doesn't trust it blindly, and why decentralized AI could be the next big revolution. No TED Talk nonsense, just real life.

Episode 2: Ken DiCross—Crypto Believer.

Gizmodo: How do you use AI right now?

DiCross: I use AI for everything I possibly can; from helping with my schedule to categorizing and helping with email responses. I definitely use it for search. I can't tell you the last time I went to Google. I think that is just atrocious. I use it for business plans, for pitch decks. I use it to compare other interoperability or blockchain or AI companies.

Gizmodo: How does that work?

DiCross: I go to their website, grab their white paper, and download it into the LLM. Then I start asking a series of questions until I can find the issue. It's always centralization. Rather than solving it properly in a decentralized way, they just add a fix that creates some kind of risk—security, cost, or time. I create my list and send it off to my team or investors to show we still have a moat. That would take an enormous amount of time if I did it manually. AI helps me get it done in five minutes.

Gizmodo: What was the last thing AI helped you do?

DiCross: I created a contract. We're starting to bring on advisors, ambassadors, and consultants. I took all the requirements for what we want these people to do and asked the AI to categorize them—what belongs in each role—and generate a base contract. I still send it to legal, but it saves me an hour-long call or a lengthy email. I just feed it in real time and it gets me 80% there.

Gizmodo: Are there tasks you've completely handed over to AI?

DiCross: Yes, especially presentations. I don't create slides from scratch anymore. I just prompt it with the bullet points, and it fills out the rest. The LLM already knows Wire; we feed it everything. The output is fast and on point. It's the same for my devs. My top-tier engineers use it so efficiently that they're basically two or three people in one. We don't need junior-level devs anymore.

Gizmodo: Do you trust AI completely?

DiCross: No. It still hallucinates. I gave it a math problem the other day, and it botched it; something a six-year-old could do. I had to walk it through the right answer. So when people do “vibe coding” with AI, it can be dangerous. If you don't understand the code, you won't know if the AI's output is secure. You still need experts in the loop.

Gizmodo: Do you use it in your personal life?

DiCross: Definitely. I use it for search all the time. I don't use Yelp or Google anymore. If I'm traveling, I ask for the best restaurants nearby, their hours, anything. I pick up 5 or 10 minutes here and there and end up with a few extra hours in my day.

Gizmodo: Has AI ever surprised you?

DiCross: It's not the answers that surprise me. It's when it won't answer something. You hit a wall and don't always know why. It's frustrating. That's why we need decentralized AI: so people can get the information they need without worrying that it's being filtered or censored.

Gizmodo: What do you say to people who are scared AI knows too much?

DiCross: That's exactly why it has to be decentralized. I agree with them. Every time I use ChatGPT, I sigh. I know it's building a profile on me. You want your data encrypted and private. Right now, if you type in something like a medical concern, that data can be sold. Your insurance could go up in minutes. That's dystopian. We need decentralized, encrypted AI that works for us, not for Microsoft.

Gizmodo: Do you feel uneasy using it?

DiCross: Yes, because I know my data is getting hoovered up. But I also feel optimistic. Decentralized AI is coming. Just like Linux became the backbone of every server, we'll have open-source AI that anyone can use without fear. That's where the future is heading.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Uber Is Going All-in on Robotaxis","https://gizmodo.com/uber-is-going-all-in-on-robotaxis-2000630906","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 14:50:14 GMT","

By the end of this decade, your next Uber ride might not have a driver at all. At least, that's what Uber wants you (and its investors on Wall Street to believe.)

Uber announced a new partnership today with luxury electric vehicle maker Lucid and the robotics company Nuro. Under the agreement, Uber plans to deploy a fleet of at least 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with Nuro's self-driving technology over the next six years. The robotaxi service is expected to launch in a yet unnamed major U.S. city next year, with plans to expand to dozens of markets around the world.

As part of the deal, Uber will invest hundreds of millions of dollars into both Lucid and Nuro.

“Autonomous vehicles have enormous potential to transform our cities for the better,” said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a press release. “We're thrilled to partner with Nuro and Lucid on this new robotaxi program, purpose-built just for the Uber platform, to safely bring the magic of autonomous driving to more people across the world.”

This is not Uber's first foray into the robotaxi business. In September, it announced a partnership with Alphabet's Waymo and now operates Waymo's autonomous vehicles in Austin and Atlanta. Waymo also offers rides through its own app in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.

Uber is also not alone in promising to bring the sci-fi dream of cities filled with driverless taxis to life. 

Amazon-owned Zoox is testing its autonomous taxis in several cities, including Seattle, Austin, Miami, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. The company plans to begin offering public rides in San Francisco and Las Vegas by the end of this year.

And even Tesla is operating its own robotaxi service in parts of Austin. 

Still, despite Silicon Valley's obsession with driverless cars, it remains to be seen whether they can truly reshape urban transportation, at least anytime soon.

Even if Uber does deploy 20,000 robotaxis, that's still less than 1% of its current workforce of over 7 million drivers worldwide.

The road to driverless cars has also not been without its bumps. 

Earlier this year, Zoox issued a recall of 270 of its vehicles with a particular version of the company's autonomous driving software. The recall was a result of a car crash involving an unoccupied Zoox car in Las Vegas. This was the company's second recall this year. 

Meanwhile, General Motors announced late last year that it was pulling the plug on its robotaxi business ambitions. The automaker acquired Cruise Automation in 2016 with hopes of launching a fleet of driverless vehicles and pouring billions into the effort. But in December, GM said it would stop funding the unit, citing “the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.” 

Instead, GM is now using the company's tech to advance its driver-assistance software. 

That decision followed a serious incident involving a Cruise vehicle. In October 2023, one of its cars struck a pedestrian in San Francisco — after the person had already been hit by another vehicle — and dragged her nearly 20 feet. Cruise later paid $1.5 million for failing to fully disclose details of the crash to regulators.

What about AMD's Instinct MI308?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Earlier this week, the U.S. government lifted its ban on shipments of AMD's Instinct MI308 and Nvidia's H20 processors for AI to Chinese entities, which pleased the companies, their Chinese customers, and investors. However, John Moolenaar (R), the head of a House of Representatives panel on China, has sent a formal letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick criticizing the move and requesting a briefing to discuss the decision and future actions of the executive branch. There is an interesting part: he does not call for a ban on the said GPUs again, but to develop a new set of rules.

""I could not agree more, which is why I strongly supported the administration's ban on H20 sales [to Chinese entities] — we must not allow U.S. companies to sell these vital artificial intelligence (AI) assets to Chinese entities,"" the letter signed by John Moolenaar on behalf of the panel reads. ""The H20 chip significantly outperforms anything Chinese chipmakers like Huawei can currently produce, particularly in high-bandwidth memory — a critical factor for AI inference workloads.""

Nvidia's H20 HGX GPU for AI applications was developed in response to the U.S. government's ban on shipments of more powerful H100 and H800 GPUs to Chinese entities in late 2023. Although the H100 can be 3.3 – 6.69 times faster than cut-down H20 HGX with AI data formats, H20 HGX is a massively successful product in China not only because it outperforms the vast majority of AI processors that can be produced in volume domestically, but also because Chinese companies prefer to use Nvidia's CUDA platform as it by far outclasses everything that Chinese companies have to offer.

The congressman cited growing signs that Chinese companies are using Nvidia's H20 processors in ways that may breach current export rules. Among other things, he mentioned Tencent's reported use of Nvidia's H20s to train its Hunyuan-Large model, which likely required over 200 PFLOPS of computing power. A cluster of this capability would meet the U.S. government's definition of a supercomputer, placing it under restricted usage guidelines.

Moolenaar also outlined the disparity between U.S. and Chinese production capabilities. While Huawei's partner SMIC is expected to produce only 200,000 of the company's Ascend 910B processors in 2025 (which is based on an assumption that SMIC produced 200,000 compute chiplets for the Ascend 910B last year and its production capabilities remained the same in 2025), American companies plan to deploy over 14 million AI processors (made by their manufacturing partners) this year. Given the disparity in production capabilities, approval of mass Nvidia H20 sales to Chinese entities could enable China to create powerful AI models and distribute them globally, possibly at no cost, as part of a strategy to capture a significant share of the AI market.

The congressman criticizes the idea of comparing H20s to top-tier U.S. chips, arguing this misses the point. In his view, the correct reference point should be the most powerful chip China can produce at scale. Because the H20 substantially exceeds that level, Moolenaar warns that it would significantly advance China's AI sector if allowed to enter the market there.

Moolenaar recommends that export rules adopt a dynamic standard that stays just ahead of China's known domestic capabilities, rather than relying on fixed U.S. performance metrics.

While such a move would enable AMD, Nvidia, and other American companies to compete against China's AI processors that local companies can produce domestically, their shipments will not allow Chinese entities to develop something they could not using only domestic solutions. In addition, this could put a roadblock on the expansion of China's AI hardware outside of China, addressing concerns that companies like Huawei could set their own AI standards globally.

There is a catch, though. Export controls are intended to prevent China's People's Liberation Army from acquiring advanced AI technologies prematurely. However, PLA does not necessarily need to use mass-produced processors, but can rely on hardware that is not built in high volumes, yet delivers performance that is actually higher than that offered by American companies.

In his letter, Moolenaar requested a detailed briefing from the Commerce Department by August 8, 2025. He asks for clarity on licensing decisions, projected shipment volumes, risk assessments, enforcement mechanisms, and any potential policy updates related to AI technologies and export controls.

Still got it.

Przemysław “Psyho” Dębiak, a 42-year-old programmer from Gdynia, Poland, made history by defeating OpenAI's custom AI model at the AtCoder World Tour Finals (AWTF) 2025 ""Humans vs AI"" contest in Tokyo. Considered one of the most prestigious coding tournaments in the world, the AWTF invites just 12 of the top-ranked human programmers—and, for the first time, an AI competitor—to tackle its grueling challenges. After a 10-hour coding marathon, Dębiak edged out the AI by roughly 9.5%, clinching first place while the OpenAI-built model settled for second.

“Humanity has prevailed (for now)!” Dębiak wrote on X, confessing he'd slept only around 10 hours over three days while pushing himself to the limit. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman aptly responded with, “Good job, Psyho.” The AI model, branded OpenAIAHC, was widely expected to dominate the market. Still, Dębiak's innovative, heuristic-driven approach—using problem-solving shortcuts and educated guesses instead of brute-force calculation—secured the win. Contest administrator Yoichi Iwata praised his distinctive method, noting that while the AI excelled at raw optimization, it “fell short of human creativity.”

Humanity has prevailed (for now!)I'm completely exhausted. I figured, I had 10h of sleep in the last 3 days and I'm barely alive.I'll post more about the contest when I get some rest. (To be clear, those are provisional results, but my lead should be big enough) pic.twitter.com/fIMo0ifNCdJuly 16, 2025

The AtCoder World Tour Finals (AWTF) is regarded as the ultimate stage for heuristic programming contests that focus on “good-enough” solutions to complex, unsolvable problems rather than perfect ones. This year's challenge tasked competitors with plotting a robot's path across a 30×30 grid using the fewest possible moves, an NP-hard optimization problem with countless possible outcomes. With no access to external libraries or documentation, success relied on intuition, creativity, and adaptability—qualities where human ingenuity can still outthink the raw speed and precision of AI models.

Dębiak, a former OpenAI engineer who helped develop OpenAI Five (the Dota 2 AI), competed using only Visual Studio Code with basic autocomplete and admitted the AI pushed him to his limits: “I was close to the model's score, and that pushed me to give everything.” Near the end of the 10-hour marathon, he overtook OpenAIAHC to claim victory and a 500,000 yen prize. A veteran algorithmic competitor, Mensa member, and four-time TopCoder Open Marathon champion, Dębiak has never held a full-time job and once even joked about considering careers from DJing to professional poker. His win carries symbolic weight, a human triumphing over AI in a field where machines typically excel.

Update: I'm alive and wellThe results are official now and my lead over AI increased from 5.5% to 9.5%😎Honestly, the hype feels kind of bizarre. Never expected so many people would be interested in programming contests. Guess this means I should drop in here more often👀 pic.twitter.com/RsLD8lECNqJuly 17, 2025

All that being said, AI's steady progress is undeniable—Stanford's 2025 AI Index found coding benchmarks jumped from 4.4% AI success in 2023 to 71.7% in 2024. With tools like GitHub Copilot used daily by over 90% of developers, AI is reshaping workflows. However, this win highlights that creativity, endurance, and intuition —especially in long-form heuristic challenges —remain human strengths.

Dębiak isn't naive about the challenge ahead, saying, “It's easy to imagine a different problem where AI would win and humans would be far behind.”. Still, this feels like a human John Henry moment—a testament not just to sheer human will, but to the spark of creativity machines haven't replicated and (hopefully) will never be able to.

It wants to bury poop deep underground to counter all the pollution that its data centers generate.

Microsoft has just signed a deal with Vaulted Deep, paying it to remove 4.9 million metric tons of waste over 12 years sourced from manure, sewage, and agricultural byproducts for injection deep underground. According to Inc., the current cost of CO2 removal with the company is $350 per ton. If you multiply that by Microsoft's contract, that makes it worth more than $1.7 billion. However, neither entity has disclosed the actual terms of the deal, and its CEO, Julia Reichelstein, says that the company expects its costs to drop over time, and that the mentioned price isn't the actual sum that the tech giant paid.

This isn't the first time Redmond has paid another company to help offset its greenhouse gas emissions; Microsoft signed a deal with AtmosClear in April of this year to sequester 6.75 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. However, Vaulted's technique is unique — instead of extracting carbon dioxide from the air or electricity production, it collects organic waste. It combines it into a thick slurry, which is then injected about 5,000 feet underground. This prevents them from being dumped at a waste disposal site, where they would eventually decompose and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

“Generally, what happens to these wastes today is they go to a landfill, they get dumped in a waterway, or they're just spread on land for the purpose of disposal. In all of those cases, they're decomposing into CO2 and methane,” said Reichelstein to Inc. “That's contributing to climate change. And then oftentimes, especially when it's spread on land, all those pathogens are going directly into people's groundwater.”

Projects such as these enable Microsoft and other tech giants to offset the massive amounts of carbon emissions produced by data centers, particularly as they consume a significant amount of electrical power, often generated from fossil fuels. For example, Musk is facing legal action in Memphis, Tennessee, after his company, xAI, is accused of polluting the air by using under-reported power generators at the Colossus Supercomputer. Aside from that, many companies, including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, and others, are investing in small modular reactor research to establish their clean energy sources for their expanding data center businesses.

This isn't how we usually build PCs.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Alienware Area-51 is a pre-built gaming PC, but we put together one on our own. Only this one isn't made of metal and components, but rather Lego bricks. The 318-piece model that we constructed is a set being doled out by Alienware to members of its Alienware Arena fan community, but we got to go hands on a kit to try. .Usually, this kit — which uses real Lego bricks but is not at all affiliated with Lego, multiple pieces of legalese remind me — goes for 9,999 Alienware Rewards Points. Those points are earned by fans by spending time on community forums and participating in the Discord, achieving login streaks, playing partner games on Steam, competing in giveaways, and more. (Buying Alienware products doesn't earn ARP). For the purposes of this so-called PC build, Alienware just shipped us one. Some people are already trying to sell them sealed on eBay for $400 to $500, though it's unclear if anyone has bitten at that price.

What I wanted to see was just how close to the original system this kit could get, and whether or not a Lego kit could capture the fun (and stress!) of building a PC.

The package sure looks like a Lego set, minus any branding. Inside, the instruction manual is also a pretty solid Lego knockoff, and there are 11 bags of pieces. There was also a card advertising BuildaMOC, which sells custom Lego kits and builds bespoke models for businesses.



I found out quickly that I would not be building each component, then installing it. Instead, the build started with building the bottom of the case, followed by the power supply shroud and its two fans. There's a QR code on the PSU shroud, just like on the actual Area-51, which has many QR codes with instructions on upgrading parts. Here, that QR code works, and takes you to the Alienware homepage. The back of the case also features the A51 inscription. I noticed that side of the case wasn't all uniformly gray. Some of the pieces were a bit off-color.

With the bottom of the case and the back wall built, you move on to the motherboard, which was easily my least favorite part of the build. I don't usually mind lots of detail work with tiny pieces, but this is where I found that the distribution of the parts in the bags sometimes didn't make a ton of sense, and I constantly switched between bags looking for the next tiny part. I would've been better off dumping it all on the floor.There are some fun novelties on the motherboard, my personal favorite is the choice of Wolverine claws to serve as the power cables to the board. Unfortunately, there's only one RAM stick. On the one hand, this is a Lego model. On the other hand, can't that Lego model let me fantasize about the most powerful rig possible? Single-channel RAM is a no-no on any serious gaming PC.

The GPU and cooler are also built onto the motherboard. No word if the graphics card is supposed to be an RTX 5090, but it's certainly cheaper. The cooler was my least favorite part, as it got knocked off several times when I was installing the next part, the case's see-through window, but eventually I got it all attached.

I feel like the case's window is a weak point. It consists of 12 small panels and two large panels. You can see into the case, but there are a lot of lines and connectors obstructing the view of the internals. This is where I think a real partnership with Lego might've helped: custom pieces probably would have been a better fit.

Next came the top of the case, which also includes the 360 mm radiator (good news:it has three fans). This also included customized pieces to show off the honeycomb venting and the ports on the top. This was followed by the front, including two fans and the RGB light ring, as well as the back, with a clear series of PCIe slots and the PSU.

Often, I've been left over with a few extra parts when building Lego sets. I was hoping to have an extra fan piece to put at the rear of the system. The Alienware Area-51 doesn't have a fan in the back, but I thought that, on a Lego set, I could add the rear exhaust, faithfulness to the original PC be damned. Oh well.

Finishing the build is the end of it. I couldn't boot the system up for benchmarking. I guess you could say that it was bricked out of the box.

The Area-51 is a behemoth of a desktop at 24.04 x 22.42 x 9.12 inches. The Lego set fits far more comfortably on my desk; it's 5.3 inches long, 2.2 inches wide, and 5 inches high.

The width and depth are both about 1:4.63 in scale, while the height gets a bit more lopped off at 1:4.38.

If you're looking for a good idea of the size, Apple's latest Mac Mini is 5 x 5 x 2 inches — almost the exact size as this model, but with a real computer in it.

I've often heard people describe PC building as ""Legos for adults."" I disagree. Lego is Lego for adults. But PC building and Lego building do share the same satisfying feeling of putting something together methodically and being able to admire your handiwork. (OK, fine, the PC is also a bit more useful in other ways).I'm not sure I see Alienware getting into the toy business. But I'd love to see Lego get into the PC business, making models of famous rigs. It wouldn't be far-fetched: the company already made the Atari 2600 and the Nintendo Entertainment System. It would be great to see an IBM PC Model 5150, a Bondi Blue 1998-era iMac, or even the Alienware Area-51 Predator 1 in its striking green chassis. Heck, even building a bunch of generic components and making a life-size PC would be a ton of fun for the right people. If Lego doesn't do it, maybe another one of these companies repurposing official bricks will.Whether you're enough of a die-hard Alienware fan to save up points to get this kit is up to you — I've never been a member of a fan club. I just wish there were more chances to build PCs in this fashion.

It's fun to see a PC recreated in this way, but the Area-51 is also still new. It's not iconic yet. It makes the brick kit more novelty than trophy, but if you're spending tons of time on Alienware's website and community forums, it's probably the type of thing you'll admire.

An electronics, metalworking, and 3D printing enthusiast has created some Reference Circuit Books where the ‘pages' are PCBs. Published by Bolt Industries, there are presently two volumes available, with their content produced by the aforementioned expert enthusiast and Burqueño, Ian Dunn. The first book focuses on DC Circuit Fundamentals, while the other explores LEDs, transistors, and oscillators. The ‘books' are available now and sell for $37 each.



Bolt Industries boasts that these books “bring circuits to life!” That seems to be more accurate than the average similar claim, with the books being built from PCBs that a PSB-C PD charger can power. Each book contains four live, hands-on circuits designed to demonstrate key electrical principles. They are interactive, too, featuring buttons and switches, with some models sporting lights and sounds, and so on. Thus, they are pitched as “invaluable tools for both learning and reference.”

The two PCB books currently available are described by Bolt Industries as follows:

Each book weighs in at 3.95 ounces (112g) and has just four ring-bound pages. However, remember that these are relatively thick, fiberglass-reinforced, interactive, USB-C-powered pages. If you don't have a spare USB-C wall wart or power bank and are out and about with the books (not likely?), Bolt Industries highlights that you can even use your PD-compatible phone as the power source.

For some hands-on PCB books action, check out Sydneysider Dave Jones sharing news of the new reference works on his extremely popular EEVblog YouTube channel, earlier this week. After watching the video segment, it's pretty safe to assume Dave likes these books, giving them a “huge thumbs up.”

The mailbag section of the video discussing the new PCB books begins at 3 minutes and 39 seconds.

A new study from Emory University reveals that maintaining optimal cardiovascular health can significantly improve overall physical and psychological well-being.

Published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association, the study synthesizes findings from nearly 500 peer-reviewed studies. It confirms that the benefits of heart-healthy behaviors extend far beyond the heart, positively impacting brain function, vision, hearing, muscle strength, and even reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and dementia.

""While we recently learned that heart-health and brain health are closely tied, in this review we found that almost every organ system and bodily function from head to toe benefit from a heart-healthy lifestyle,"" says Liliana Aguayo, PhD, MPH, research assistant professor at the Emory University Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing and core faculty member at Emory's Global Diabetes Research Center, who led the study. 

The review is the first of its kind to systematically examine how the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7™ metrics - which include not smoking, healthy eating, regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar - influence health outcomes across multiple organ systems. The updated Life's Essential 8™ also includes sleep as a key factor.

Among the key findings were that those with heart-healthy habits:

The study was supported in part by the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health. It calls for further research in underrepresented populations, including children and pregnant women, and emphasizes the need to understand how even minor lifestyle improvements yield significant health benefits.

Inhaling agricultural dust may pose significant risks to gut health for workers in animal agriculture, a University of California, Riverside, study has found. 

Led by Declan McCole, a professor of biomedical sciences in the UCR School of Medicine, the study expands on prior findings that hog farm dust causes airway inflammation. The researchers now report in the Journal of Applied Toxicology that inhaling this dust also alters the gut microbiome and impairs intestinal function, including increased ""leaky gut"" or intestinal permeability. Leaky gut is associated with a range of chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and type 1 diabetes.

""Exposure to swine farm dust, which contains high levels of bacteria and endotoxins, caused both airway inflammation and increased passage of gut bacterial products into the bloodstream in our mouse models,"" said Meli'sa Crawford, a former postdoctoral researcher in McCole's lab and the paper's first author. ""But what's especially striking is the impact we observed on the gut microbiome and metabolism.""

The researchers exposed mice intranasally to hog dust extract for three weeks. The mice showed a significant drop in beneficial bacterial species, including Akkermansia muciniphila, Clostridium sp. ASF356, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium. 

The research team also found decreased levels of critical compounds in the gut of the mice, such as riboflavin, nicotinic acid, inosine, and leucine - key players in energy metabolism, immune regulation, and gut barrier maintenance.

While most research has focused on the respiratory effects of farm dust, our findings clearly show that inhaled pollutants can have systemic consequences. This research underscores the importance of considering the gut–lung axis when assessing the health risks of bioaerosol exposure in agriculture.""

Declan McCole, professor of biomedical sciences, UCR School of Medicine

The study builds on growing evidence that pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations can impact multiple organ systems. 

""Agricultural dust is rich in fine particulate matter and resistant bacteria, presenting a complex threat to farmworkers' health,"" McCole said. ""Our earlier work showed that inhaled hog dust extract leads to neutrophilic lung inflammation. We now show the link to intestinal barrier dysfunction and microbial imbalance, highlighting the need for improved workplace protections for agricultural workers to mitigate long-term health consequences.""

The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health; University of California, Davis-Western Center for Agricultural Health and Safety; and University of California Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship Program. Crawford is now an assistant professor in the Department of Animal Sciences at Rutgers University in New Jersey.

The title of the research paper is ""Respiratory Exposure to Agriculture Dust Extract Alters Gut Commensal Species and Key Metabolites in Mice.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy linked to lower breastfeeding rates","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250718/Hypertensive-disorders-in-pregnancy-linked-to-lower-breastfeeding-rates.aspx","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 03:54:00 GMT","

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) - like chronic or gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia - are among the leading causes of maternal and infant death in the United States. 

Between 2017 to 2019, 16% of all U.S. pregnancies were complicated by an HDP diagnosis, with much higher rates seen among non-Hispanic Black/African American and American Indian/Alaskan Native women. But HDPs don't just affect women in the short term; these disorders can increase their long-term risk for heart disease, kidney disease, and stroke. 

But there could be an opportunity to mitigate these longer-term health risks through breastfeeding, Yale researchers have found. In a new study, they discovered that an HDP diagnosis before or during pregnancy related to higher odds of never breastfeeding, or for those who initiated breastfeeding, higher probability of stopping. The findings suggest women with HDPs may benefit from targeted interventions that promote their exposure to the cardioprotective benefits of breastfeeding.

The findings are published in the journal JAMA Network Open.

We looked at breastfeeding initiation, or whether you ever started breastfeeding. We also looked at breastfeeding duration. So, if you did start, how long did you breastfeed for? Having a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy was associated with worse outcomes for both of these measures.""

Deanna Nardella, instructor of pediatrics and physician-scientist with Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and first author of the study

There can be many barriers to starting, and sustaining, breastfeeding after childbirth, from facing lactation challenges and inadequate parental leave policies to lack of breastfeeding education among patients and healthcare providers alike. In the U.S., 83% of women start breastfeeding, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but only 25% continue to exclusively breastfeed through the first six months - the recommended duration by leading health organizations. 

""These statistics beg the question, why is that the case?,"" Nardella said. ""As a practicing pediatrician in the New Haven community, it is not often I see parents who truly do not want to breastfeed. Rather, I frequently see parents try to breastfeed, shortly thereafter encountering common - and often addressable - challenges, such as pain, latch difficulties, and milk supply concerns. 

""Unfortunately, many families do not get the timely care they need to address such challenges, resulting in breastfeeding cessation. I believe that the attrition we see in U.S. breastfeeding rates, particularly within the early weeks to months postpartum, in large part reflect systems level issues.""

Other maternal comorbidities, including chronic and gestational diabetes, have been shown to negatively influence breastfeeding outcomes, but little is known about the breastfeeding outcomes for those with HDP despite its high prevalence among pregnant people in the United States. For Nardella, understanding this relationship is critical to promoting health equity. 

""We know that Black and Native women in the U.S. have higher rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,"" she said. ""These communities also have the lowest breastfeeding rates. Though we cannot say that HDPs directly cause these observed inequities, understanding the mechanisms of the relationship between HDP and breastfeeding initiation and duration could promote more equitable long term cardiometabolic outcomes for pregnant individuals and infants from these communities.""

For the new study, researchers sought to better understand this relationship by analyzing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). PRAMS surveys women across the U.S., usually around four months postpartum, on their attitudes, beliefs, and experiences during their pregnancy, prenatal, and postpartum periods. 

Their sample included women who had delivered a live infant between January 2016 and November 2021 and who had provided complete data for HDP and non-initiation or cessation of breastfeeding. The researchers defined HDP as self-reported high blood pressure or hypertension, preeclampsia, or eclampsia before or during pregnancy. Women were determined to have never breastfed if they reported ""no"" to ever breastfeeding on the survey. Among those who reported breastfeeding, researchers defined time to cessation as 0.5 weeks if they reported breastfeeding less than one week, their exact breastfeeding duration (in weeks) if provided, or infant age at the time of survey completion (in weeks) if they reported they were still breastfeeding. 

Their analytic sample included 205,247 participants - a weighted sample representing nearly 11 million U.S. women - from 43 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, and across all socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. They found that women with an HDP had 11% higher odds of never breastfeeding and, among those who did start breastfeeding, a 17% higher probability of stopping at some point during the postpartum period. The median time for breastfeeding cessation was 17 weeks shorter for women with HDP than those without HDP. These findings suggest a negative association between HDP and breastfeeding outcomes. 

""Over 80% of U.S. families choose to breastfeed their infant,"" said Sarah Taylor, professor of pediatrics (neonatal-perinatal medicine) at YSM and co-author of the study. ""However, most do not reach the goal, set by the American Academy of Pediatrics, to exclusively do breastfeeding for six months. Research, such as this study showing an association between HDPs and shorter breastfeeding duration, guides the development of strategies to help all families reach their breastfeeding goal.""

Future studies to identify the mechanisms that underlie this relationship between HDP and breastfeeding are required to develop targeted, innovative strategies to improve breastfeeding outcomes for people with HDP, researchers said.

""Such strategies could include having a standard, dedicated prenatal lactation consultation for those individuals who wish to try breastfeeding and have risk factors for experiencing worse breastfeeding outcomes, such as HDP,"" Nardella said. ""Pregnancy is a critical, and often underutilized, period for lactation education and support.""

She added: ""This paper provides foundational knowledge on which to build future studies to understand how our health systems can best support those individuals with hypertension in reaching their personal infant feeding goals. As a system, we must do better about supporting women with HDP in reaching whatever their infant feeding goal may be, particularly if it involves any amount of breastfeeding. Such support could promise long term improvements in health outcomes for many pregnant individuals and their infants, especially among communities with high risk of cardiometabolic disease and breastfeeding cessation.""

The study was supported by grants from the Yale Pediatric Scholars Program, the Yale National Clinician Scholars Program, and the Clinical and Translational Science Awards from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

As youth engagement in high-energy sports surges, so does the prevalence of sport-related injuries. Among them, tibial tubercle avulsion fractures (TTAFs) represent a small but serious subset, accounting for less than 3% of pediatric fractures. These injuries commonly affect adolescent boys and are associated with risk factors such as delayed skeletal maturity, Osgood-Schlatter disease, and abnormal body mass index. Diagnosis can be complex, as symptoms mimic other knee conditions, and imaging beyond basic X-rays is often required. Despite several classification systems, no consensus exists on standardized treatment protocols. Due to these challenges, there is a growing need for in-depth studies to better understand and manage TTAFs.

In a recent review (DOI: 10.1002/pdi3.2521) published in Pediatric Discovery (2025), researchers from the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and Sichuan University examined the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of TTAFs in children and adolescents. These injuries, though rare, are becoming more frequent due to rising sports participation among youth. The article reviews decades of literature and new clinical findings to offer guidance for orthopedic surgeons facing this unique challenge in pediatric care.

The study delves into how TTAFs occur—often during sudden movements like jumping or landing, when the quadriceps muscle forcefully contracts and pulls on the tibial tubercle. The authors explain how specific anatomical features and the stages of bone development make adolescents particularly vulnerable. While boys face higher risk due to later growth plate closure and greater quadriceps strength, the presence of Osgood-Schlatter disease or extreme BMI—whether high or low—also heightens susceptibility. Diagnostic tools such as CT and MRI are recommended to detect hidden soft tissue damage and guide surgical planning. Multiple classification systems are discussed, with the Ogden system remaining the most widely used despite its limitations. Treatment options range from conservative casting for stable fractures to surgical methods like open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for displaced or complex cases. The review underscores the variability in clinical decisions due to the lack of evidence-based guidelines and highlights the importance of monitoring for complications like compartment syndrome, which can be life-altering if untreated.

Many of these young patients are active in sports and unaware of their risk until an injury sidelines them. What this review emphasizes is the need for vigilance—not just in diagnosis, but in understanding the subtle risk factors like growth plate maturity and muscle force imbalances. With proper identification and early treatment, most children recover fully and return to their activities.""

Dr. Xing Liu, senior orthopedic surgeon at Chongqing Medical University

This study provides clinicians with a critical update on recognizing and treating TTAFs in pediatric patients. Its insights help bridge the gap between injury mechanism, clinical presentation, and long-term recovery strategies. As sports-related injuries in children grow more common, this knowledge equips orthopedic specialists with the tools to make timely interventions and reduce complications. Looking forward, developing unified clinical guidelines and further exploring risk factors like BMI and OSD may improve both treatment precision and outcomes. With appropriate care, young patients can return to full function—sometimes even stronger than before.

A new editorial was published in Volume 16 of Oncotarget on July 16, 2025, titled ""microRNAs in soft tissue sarcoma: State of the art and barriers to translation.""

In this article, Elizaveta K. Titerina, Alessandro La Ferlita, and Joal D. Beane from Ohio State University discuss the role of microRNAs in soft tissue sarcomas (STS), a rare and diverse group of cancers that begin in connective tissues, like bone or fat. The authors explain how these small molecules regulate cancer-related processes and highlight their potential as non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring. They also outline the main challenges that need to be addressed before microRNA-based strategies can be used in clinical settings.

Soft tissue sarcomas include over 50 subtypes, making precise diagnosis and effective treatment difficult. The editorial describes how microRNAs influence cancer growth, spread, and response to therapies. Because microRNAs are stable in body fluids like blood and saliva, they could be used for early detection and to help guide treatment decisions. Such as, certain groups of microRNAs are linked to how patients respond to specific drugs, showing their potential as tools for precision medicine.

""For example, miR-17-92 and miR-106b-25 clusters have been associated with sensitivity or resistance to eribulin in STS.""

The authors also explain that microRNAs could help distinguish between tumor types that are often difficult to differentiate, such as benign lipomas and malignant liposarcomas. Recognizing these differences is crucial for guiding treatment decisions. Specific patterns of microRNA expression in blood samples may enable clinicians to make quicker and more reliable diagnoses without the need for invasive procedures. Beyond their diagnostic role, microRNAs are also being explored as therapeutic tools, but applying microRNA-based therapies to patients remains challenging. These molecules can act as either cancer promoters or suppressors, depending on the environment, which complicates the development of safe and targeted treatments. However, new delivery methods such as lipid nanoparticles show promise in improving precision and safety.

Overall, microRNAs are emerging as an important focus in STS research, offering new possibilities for advancing diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. As researchers continue to address the current challenges, these small molecules could become valuable tools in improving cancer care.

Nearly one-third of the nation's K-12 U.S. public schools mandate mental health screening for students, with most offering in-person treatment or referral to a community mental health professional if a student is identified as having depression or anxiety, according to a new study.

About 40% of principals surveyed said it was very hard or somewhat hard to ensure that students receive appropriate care, while 38% said it was easy or very easy to find adequate care for students. The findings are published in the journal JAMA Network Open.

Our results suggest that there are multiple barriers to mental health screening in schools, including a lack of resources and knowledge of screening mechanics, as well as concerns about increased workload of identifying students.""

Jonathan Cantor, study's lead author and a policy researcher at RAND

In 2021, the U.S. Surgeon General declared a youth mental health emergency. Researchers say that public schools are strategic resources for screening, treatment and referral for mental health services for young people who face barriers in other settings.

Researchers wanted to understand screening for mental health at U.S. public schools, given increased concerns about youth mental health following the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In October 2024, the RAND study surveyed 1,019 principals who participate in the RAND American School Leader panel, a nationally representative sample of K-12 public school principals.

They were asked whether their school mandated screening for mental health issues, what steps are taken if a student is identified as having depression or anxiety, and how easy or difficult it is to ensure that such students received adequate services.

Researchers found that 30.5% of responding principals said their school required screening of students with mental health problems, with nearly 80% reporting that parents typically are notified if students screen positive for depression or anxiety.

More than 70% of principals reported that their school offers in-person treatment for students who screen positive, while 53% of principals said they may refer a student to a community mental health care professional.

The study found higher rates of mental health screenings in schools with 450 or more students and in districts with mostly racial and ethnic minority groups as the student populations.

""Policies that promote federal and state funding for school mental health, reimbursement for school-based mental health screening, and adequate school mental health staff ratios may increase screening rates and increase the likelihood of successfully connecting the student to treatment,"" Cantor said.

Support for the study was provided by the National Institute of Mental Health.

Other authors of the study are Ryan K. McBain, Aaron Kofner, Joshua Breslau and Bradley D. Stein, all of RAND; Jacquelin Rankine of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine; Fang Zhang, Hao Yu and Alyssa Burnett, all of the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute; and Ateev Mehrotra of the Brown University School of Public Health.

ATLANTA (May 30, 2025) – The U.S. Under-20 Men's National Team will continue its preparation for the FIFA U-20 World Cup with an international camp from June 2-10 in Cairo, Egypt. Head coach Marko Mitrović's 22-player squad will play Colombia on Friday, June 6 and face Egypt on Tuesday, June 10.

Players born on or after Jan. 1, 2005 are age-eligible for this year's FIFA U-20 World Cup, set for Sept. 27-Oct. 19 in Chile. For this training camp, Mitrović called up 14 players born in 2005, six born in 2006 and two born in 2007.

Originally called up for the U-19 MNT's camp in Marbella, Spain next week, defender Luca Bombino and forward Zavier Gozo will now join the U-20 MNT for the matches against Colombia and Egypt.

A total of 14 Major League Soccer clubs are represented on the roster, led by two players from Atlanta United. Six players are based abroad, with two plying the trade in Spain and one each coming Denmark, England, Germany and Portugal.

Goalkeepers (2): Gavin Beavers (Brondby/DEN; Henderson, Nev.), Diego Kochen (FC Barcelona/ESP; Miramar, Fla.)

Defenders (8): Matai Akinmboni (Bournemouth/ENG; Upper Marlboro, Md.), Reed Baker-Whiting (Seattle Sounders; Seattle, Wash.), Luca Bombino (San Diego FC; Saugus, Calif.), Noah Cobb (Atlanta United; Chattanooga, Tenn.), Tate Johnson (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; Tampa, Fla.), Ethan Kohler (Werder Bremen/GER; Campbell, Calif.), Nolan Norris (FC Dallas; Fort Worth, Texas), Francis Westfield (Philadelphia Union; Philadelphia, Pa.)

Midfielders (6): Matthew Corcoran (Nashville SC; Dallas, Texas), Benjamin Cremaschi (Inter Miami; Key Biscayne, Fla.), Taha Habroune (Columbus Crew; Columbus, Ohio), Sergio Oregel Jr. (Chicago Fire; Chicago, Ill.), Brooklyn Raines (Houston Dynamo; Chicago, Ill.), Pedro Soma (FC Barcelona/ESP; Coconut Creek, Fla.)

Forwards (6): Luke Brennan (Atlanta United; Atlanta, Ga.), Kristian Fletcher (D.C. United; Bowie, Md.), Zavier Gozo (Real Salt Lake; Eagle Mountain, Utah), Peyton Miller (New England Revolution; Unionville, Conn.), Serge Ngoma Jr. (New York Red Bulls; North Plainfield, N.J.), Marcos Zambrano (Vitoria Guimaraes/POR; Gladwyne, Pa.)

Fourteen players return from the U-20 MNT's March training camp in L'Albir, Spain where they defeated Mexico 3-0 and drew with 1-1 with Japan. The U.S. took control of the match against Mexico early thanks to a Luke Brennan goal three minutes into the match. Kristian Fletcher notched a brace to complete the scoring for the USA. Against Japan, the U.S. went down 1-0 in the first half but battled back to earn a 1-1 draw.

Ten players on the June camp roster helped the USA secure its U-20 World Cup berth with a runner-up showing at the 2024 Concacaf U-20 Championship in Mexico: Luca Bombino, Noah Cobb, Zavier Gozo, Taha Habroune, Ethan Kohler, Nolan Norris, Sergio Oregel Jr., Brooklyn Raines, Pedro Soma and Marco Zombrano.

A number of players already have represented the United States on some of the game's biggest stages. Three players were a part of the U.S. roster at the 2023 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Indonesia, leading the squad to the knockout stage before a narrow defeat to eventual champion Germany: Matthew Corcoran, Habroune, and Soma.

In addition, three players helped the U.S. finish fourth at the 2023 PanAmerican Games, the USA's best showing at the tournament since 1999: Norris, Oregel Jr. and Raines.

Gotta earn it

Chelsea have been world champions for almost an entire week now, and since this new Club World Cup tournament is only held every four years (like the actual World Cup), we will get to call ourselves world champions for the next four years.  Pretty cool.  (The annual format lives on as the brand new “FIFA Intercontinental Cup”, first held last December.)

However, our participation in the next Club World Cup, to potentially defend our title, is not guaranteed.  This runs contrary to most club competitions at UEFA level, where the winners automatically qualify for next year's tournament (or qualify for the higher level competition, such as the Europa League winner going into next year's Champions League).  It is however in line with the way FIFA do things.  The winners of the World Cup used to get an automatic spot, but that was changed in 2000, and now every national team except the host nation's (or nations') has to qualify.

The Athletic do point out that FIFA have not actually adopted a “definitive” position on this issue, and have plenty of leeway built into their regulations to easily decide to change their policies either officially or unofficially (like when they granted Inter Miami a place in this year's tournament as the “host country representative team”, a provision they invented on the spot).

But as things stand, we will have to earn our way back in — by either winning the Champions League in the next three years, or by performing at a high level consistently enough to get an at-large bid. Ironically, runners-up PSG are already qualified as the 2025 Champions League-winners.

FIFA have officially announced Chelsea as the 'first ever' Club World Cup champions after their triumph in New Jersey on Sunday night. 

The Blues beat Champions League winners, and favourites for the Club World Cup, Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday night after a Cole Palmer masterclass - the forward scoring two and assisting another. 

It was a shock result, but an emphatic win on the night, with Chelsea now taking home the all-new trophy, as well as a hefty cash prize. 

However, their success has seemingly had an impact beyond that match, with previous Club World Cup winners now known as 'FIFA Intercontinental Champions'. 

As such, though the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona are no longer world champions. 

The competition was first played in 2000 as the Club World Championship, before returning in 2005, and was played annually until 2023, before adopting its current form. 

This summer's competition saw it expanded to 32 teams for the first time, having previously been fought between just six (2020) and eight (2000).

Four English teams had won the Club World Cup prior to Chelsea's second crown on Sunday, though they will now seemingly be recorded as FIFA Intercontinental Champions titles.

FIFA appeared to confirm the news themselves on Sunday night, as they shared a social media photo of Chelsea lifting the trophy with the caption: 'The first ever FIFA CWC Champions.'

While City won the original competition in 2023, Liverpool lifted it in 2019 and United in 2008. Chelsea had also won it previously in 2021.

Real Madrid won it the most times with five - most recently in 2022 - while Barcelona won it four times, and Chelsea, Corinthians, and Bayern Munich twice.

It was a Club World Cup final like no other before it, with President Donald Trump joining Chelsea for the trophy lift. 

Having been given VIP treatment during the match alongside First Lady Melania and FIFA president Gianni Infantino, Trump took centre stage during the trophy presentation.

Trump, who was booed by a section of the crowd, presented Robert Sanchez with the tournament's golden glove award.

Viewers of DAZN's coverage were then able to watch an unlikely exchange, as Infantino introduced Trump to Palmer, as the Chelsea and England star walked up to collect his player of the tournament prize.

Lip reading expert Jeremy Freeman revealed Trump had words of admiration for Palmer, after watching his stunning performance in the final.

'Chelsea's biggest fan. I'm a big fan of you. So well done you,' Trump said, according to Freeman.

Palmer, who has be known to offer few words in post-match interviews, reportedly replied 'Thank you' before rejoining his team-mates.

The 23-year-old's reaction to Trump's decision to remain on stage during Chelsea's trophy presentation, however, has garnered the biggest reaction from fans.

The US President had been given the honour of presenting the trophy to Blues captain Reece James, with the expectation that he would then step aside, as is customary.

Infantino was seen attempting to usher Trump away from Chelsea players, but the US president remained in place, standing either side of James and Sanchez. 

Trump's refusal to leave the stage left Chelsea players bewildered with Palmer appearing to say, 'What's he doing?'.

Speaking post-match, Palmer admitted 'I knew he was going to be here but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy so I was a bit confused, yeah.'

Further light has been shed on Trump's presence in the trophy presentation, with his interactions with Chelsea captain James and goalkeeper Sanchez having been revealed.

While Palmer appeared confused in the background, Freeman revealed James had asked for Trump's permission to lift the trophy.

As Palmer said 'No, no, just wait, wait…wait…wait', James was seen turning to the US President to seek his approval. 

James reportedly said 'I can lift?', with Trump responding 'Oh we can, good!'

According to Freeman, Sanchez had been open to Trump remaining on the stage and being part of the celebrations.

'Please, sir,' the goalkeeper said to Trump, according to Freeman, before asking him 'Want us to lift the trophy next to you?'

With Trump having signalled his approval, Sanchez was seen motioning for James to lift the trophy and kick-start the celebrations.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City have all been stripped of a major title by FIFA.

All three teams watched on as Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 to win the Club World Cup final last weekend.

Cole Palmer scored a brace in New Jersey, with Joao Pedro's strike making it 3-0 before half-time and proving to be the final goal of the game.

Advert

Enzo Maresca's side lifted the Club World Cup trophy for the first time, having lost in the final to Corinthians back in 2012.

This year's Club World Cup was played under an entirely new format, with a group and knockout phase consisting of 32 teams from six confederations.

FIFA have now made a decision over how they recognise the new tournament - and it is bad news for United, Liverpool and City.

Advert

They have decided to recognise Chelsea as the 'first-ever' Club World Cup winners, meaning they are now the only club side who can be considered as 'world champions'.

According to the Daily Mail, the above three English clubs - and all other previous winners - will now be known as 'FIFA Intercontinental Champions'.

There is a similarly-named tournament known as the FIFA Intercontinental Cup, which sees each of the six teams that won their confederation's continental cup compete in a mini-tournament in December.

That is, it must be added, different to the other FIFA Intercontinental Cup, which ran between 1970 and 2004 and was contested between the UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores winners.

Advert

The new Club World Cup brought with it a new trophy - though the trophy for the previous format also had the 'Club World Cup' title branded on it.

After all that, we're left with something of a roll of honour that recognises just one world champion - and many more now-former world champions.

The Club World Cup is set to return in 2029, with PSG, Pyramids, Al Hilal and Cruz Azul already qualified after winning their continental championships last season.

Cole Palmer and his influencer girlfriend Connie Grace have unfollowed each other on social media just days after the Chelsea star won the Club World cup.

The Chelsea star and his partner have also removed all pictures of one another from their respective accounts. 

It comes after the 23-year-old starred in the Club World Cup final, scoring two goals and claiming an assist for Joao Pedro, as Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain to become world champions.

Grace had travelled to the US during the tournament but was not among the wives or girlfriends who celebrated the win on the pitch at the MetLife Stadium.

Now the pair have both unfollowed one another on Instagram.

Palmer this week said he was looking forward to being reunited with his girlfriend, but that he first wanted to visit St Kitts and Nevis.

Mail Sport exclusively accompanied Palmer as he returned to his ancestral Caribbean homeland for the first time, where his paternal grandfather was born. 

He was given a hero's welcome as he arrived on the island, 4,000 miles from the Manchester suburb of Wythenshawe where the Chelsea and England star grew up.

The 23-year-old even held a reception with the country's prime minister.

Meanwhile, Grace is continuing to enjoy a holiday in Miami, posting a picture of herself in the city on her Instagram on Friday.

Palmer and Grace went public together in November last year at the GQ Men of the Year Awards and are around eleven months into their relationship. 

Grace, a nail technician and Instagram influencer with 38,000 followers, is also from Manchester. 

The duo met when they were 17 through mutual friends.

In March she said: 'Cole now is still the same Cole that I met when I was 17. Obviously, he's changed, he's grown up, and his life now is completely different, but he's still the same boy, he's still laid-back Cole.

'Cole will adapt to whatever situation he's in. He's not bothered that he's that far from home because all he wants to do is play football and if it means leaving home and being in a place which is completely different to where he's from, he'll do it.

'He's not bothered about the whole fame side of it and he's not bothered what people think of him. He is only just bothered about scoring goals and doing well for his team, doing well for his country, and you've got to love him for that.'

Palmer is currently enjoying his summer break after another impressive season, where he guided Chelsea to the Europa Conference League title.

He scored 18 goals and provided 14 assists in all competitions, scoring 15 and assisting nine in the Premier League, as Chelsea qualified for the Champions League for the first time in three years.

The Blues take on Erik Ten Hag's Bayer Leverkusen in less than three weeks in their opening pre-season game, before hosting AC Milan two days later.

They then begin their Premier League campaign by welcoming Crystal Palace to Stamford Bridge on August 17. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","“The only reason”","https://chelsea.news/2025/07/chelsea-club-world-cup-success/","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 08:45:00 GMT","

Former Liverpool star and ESPN pundit Steve Nicol has given a bizarre reason as to why he thinks Chelsea won the Club World Cup.

The Blues were crowned World Champions after they brushed aside Paris Saint Germain 3-0 in New York on Sunday afternoon.

Chelsea were at it from minute one and dominated proceedings with Cole Palmer scoring twice and Joao Pedro adding a third.

Not many expected to Chelsea to make the final, and even fewer gave them any chance of overcoming PSG, who have been the outstanding team in Europe.

The Blues grew in confidence throughout the tournament, and saved their best performance for the final, which was arguably their best since Enzo Maresca took over.

Players have spoken on how the criticism and people writing Chelsea off gave them extra motivation, and Mareca's men have been widely praised for their success.

However, Nicol wasn't in the mood for offering his congratulations and gave a bizarre reason as to why the Blues won.

“The only reason Chelsea won [Club World Cup], by the way, is because of the field,” he told ESPN.

“They keep banging those balls, knowing that the ball would stay in bounds and wouldn't go outside. I mean, I just couldn't take it seriously enough.”

The pitches in America did come under criticism from players during the tournament, but this very much sounds like sour grapes from Nicol.

Chelsea had a successful first season under Maresca as they returned to the Champions League and won two trophies.

The pressure will now be on to improve next season and make more progress, although it's been reported the Italian isn't under immediate pressure to win the league.

Reportedly the expectation for next season is Champions League qualification through the league, and to go as far as possible in every cup competition.

Cole Palmer and his girlfriend Connie Grace have unfollowed each other on Instagram, sparking fresh rumours of a split. 

This development comes hot on the heels of Chelsea's emphatic victory over PSG in the Club World Cup final.

According to reports, the pair, both 23, have severed their social‑media connection, igniting speculation about their relationship's status

Fans were quick to pick up on the lack of mutual follows, but equally telling was Connie's conspicuous absence from Chelsea's title celebrations at the MetLife Stadium.

It is also claimed that Palmer's likes are no longer visible on Connie's Instagram posts.

She is claimed to have initially accompanied Palmer to the U.S. and was present for the final — yet she didn't join the on-field festivities after their triumph. 

Her absence has led many to wonder if tensions began during the tournament itself.

Meanwhile, Palmer touched down in St Kitts and Nevis for a warm summer holiday, where he received a hero's welcome in his paternal grandfather's Caribbean homeland. 

A post shared by Cole Jermaine Palmer (@colepalmer10)

Connie, however, did not accompany him.

However, as at the time of this report, neither Palmer nor Grace have officially confirmed the end of their relationship.

The pair were first spotted together in July 2024 during a holiday in Ibiza following the UEFA European Championships.

Since then, many fans have been drawn by Connie's stylish presence and high–profile appearances next to Palmer.

Palmer, a Wythenshawe native, went public with his romance with Grace at the 2024 GQ Men of the Year Awards.

The pair frequently engaged with each other online — liking posts, and making mutual appearances at football matches. 

 Connie previously opened up about their long-term relationship, revealing that they met when they were both 17.  

Speaking in the Amazon Prime documentary titled ‘England's Lions: A New Generation', the Manchester-based manicurist and influencer spoke candidly about their relationship, describing Palmer as “warm and cuddly” and admitting, “you've got to love him.” 

She said: “We met when we were 17. I think he knew me through mutual friends, so I think he probably had his eye on me. Oh, he's warm and cuddly. Well, with me, hopefully with no one else.”  

But now their relationship, believed to be approximately three years old, seems to have ended.

Premier League trio Manchester United, Liverpool, and Manchester City have been ‘stripped' of one of their most prestigious titles following a controversial FIFA decision this week. It appears the world football governing body is attempting to rewrite Club World Cup history as part of its ongoing efforts to raise the tournament's profile.

Among the changes already made to what was once seen as a glorified mid-season friendly by the top European clubs are the expansion of the competition to 32 teams, a stricter qualification process, and the introduction of a lucrative £125 million prize for the winners.

But perhaps the most controversial change of all is FIFA's decision to disregard all past winners of the tournament and start from scratch. They have now officially declared Chelsea as the ‘first ever' Club World Cup champions following their emphatic 3-0 win over Champions League holders PSG last Sunday at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, according to the Daily Mail.

After winning club football's most lucrative competition, Chelsea aren't guaranteed to be present to defend their title in 2029.

Previous winners of the Club World Cup are now labelled by FIFA as ""FIFA Intercontinental Champions."" As such, though, the likes of Liverpool, Man City, Man United, Real Madrid and Barcelona are no longer considered world champions.

The competition was first played in 2000 as the Club World Championship, before returning in 2005, and was played annually until 2023, before adopting its current form. FIFA appeared to confirm the news themselves on Sunday night, as they shared a social media photo of Chelsea lifting the trophy with the caption:

""The first ever FIFA CWC Champions.""

While City won the original competition in 2023, Liverpool lifted it in 2019 and United in 2008. Chelsea had also won it previously in 2021. Real Madrid won it the most times with five - most recently in 2022 - while Barcelona won it four times, and Chelsea, Corinthians, and Bayern Munich twice.

A change in trophy appears to have brought with it an official change in who can claim to have won the Club World Cup. However, the previous editions haven't been completely erased - suggesting a revamp similar to the 1992 transformation of the old European Cup into what we now know as the Champions League.

The length of the half-time show has caused controversy.

Only Current Champions and Current European and Continental champions should have been allowed to enter this competition.  Chelsea finished 4th last season.  How was this possible?

AirBnB has been named the official accommodation for the thousands of soccer fans attending the 2026 FIFA World Cup matches. For those who own homes or businesses in South Florida, it's a great opportunity.

Local FIFA fans aren't just getting ready to cheer on their favorite teams but potentially reap the benefits of the thousands of visitors who will come to the United States to watch any of the 78 matches that will be played across 11 cities. One of those cities is Miami.

Watch NBC6 free wherever you are

“We as hosts we really specialize and really pride ourselves on providing an experience, more than just a stay,” shares Andres Aguirre, a host with AirBnB.

Aguirre is an AirBnB owner in Aventura. He says his summer 2026 bookings are ready to welcome soccer fans to one of his properties located just 10 minutes from Hard Rock Stadium, the host of 7 World Cup Games.

“We have four bedrooms and two bathrooms, with a pool, a heated pool,” Aguirre shares as he showcases the property. “We also have a hot tub, fire pit and an outdoor area where you can just relax and enjoy your time here.”

A house like Andres' in September could rent for $550 a night, but during the World Cup, which runs from June 11th to July 19th of next year the price practically doubles. The week of June 11th, the same house costs $1,111 a night.

“At the end of the day we expect an average host to make more than $3,000 dollars during the event in 2026, so it's important to think of this as a great economic opportunity, while still remaining a casual host, and don't make this a full time activity for you,” said Jordi Torres Mallol, the America Regional Director of AirBnB.



Mallol added that the influx of tourists will yield in a major economic boost. 

“We expect hundreds of thousands of travelers coming into the US, Canada and Mexico. In particular, in Miami, we expect more than $30,000. This adds up to economic opportunity and economic impact of $3.6 billion dollars, and in the case of Miami, $380 million dollars,” explained Mallol. 

And if that wasn't enough, the accommodation platform will offer exclusive experiences for fans.

Mallol said some of the fan experiences include training with soccer legend Tim Howard in the context of the FIFA tournament, or catching the game from the stands with the former LA Galaxy player.

And closer to home, tour guides like Diana Contreras are just one of the many business owners that are hoping to give fans a unique experience to learn about the city in which the games are being played.

“I love this neighborhood so much, I have been here 13 years, so this is very natural for me, to give tours of my favorite neighborhood and the artists that I know as my friends and my own art as well,” Contreras said.

According to a Deloitte and Touche study, AirBnB hosts in the 11 World Cup host cities could generate up to $210 million dollars in profits -- a financial goal!

AirBnB said that it's contributing $5 million dollars to host cities to go towards different projects. The specific projects will be selected in the next few weeks.","{'href': 'https://www.nbcmiami.com', 'title': 'NBC 6 South Florida'}","soccer"

Extreme heat is becoming soccer's most pressing challenge, as dramatically demonstrated during this summer's FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. As global temperatures continue to rise, traditional summer tournaments are evolving into health hazards for both players and spectators. Climate scientists are sounding alarm bells, warning that June and July competitions could soon become breeding grounds for life-threatening heat-related illnesses.

Despite FIFA's introduction of cooling measures — including additional water breaks and shaded bench areas — players have voiced serious concerns about tournament conditions. Many experts now advocate for a fundamental shift toward cooler months, though such changes would upend soccer's deeply entrenched seasonal calendar. With the 2026 World Cup set for North America and 2030 set for North Africa, both notoriously hot regions, FIFA faces mounting pressure to confront this climate reality before it's too late.

Impact on players and the game

Intense heat during matches raises the risk of heat-related illnesses, with players reporting dizziness, exhaustion and difficulty maintaining performance during high-stress games [1]. At the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the U.S., players struggled with a “brutal heat wave,” leading to complaints even from high-level professionals like Chelsea's Enzo Fernández, who urged organizers to avoid afternoon kickoffs [2].

Medical experts warn that playing high-intensity sports in such heat can be dangerous, particularly when Wet Bulb Globe Temperature — which considers temperature, humidity, wind and sunlight — exceeds 89.6 degrees[3]. Prolonged exposure to heat can also impair cognitive performance, affecting referees' decision-making and potentially the integrity of the game [4].

 

Measures implemented and their challenges

 

Resistance to change

Critics oppose moving the World Cup to winter months for several major reasons:

 

Impact on fans

Fans are also at increased risk of heatstroke, dehydration and other heat-related illnesses[7]. At recent tournaments, local authorities and clubs have issued heat mitigation guidelines for fans, and some matches saw visibly depleted crowds or earlier departures due to oppressive conditions[2].

While most major games still draw large crowds, extreme heat has deterred some fans from attending matches, particularly those played in open stadiums during afternoon hours[2]. Uncomfortably hot conditions hurt the overall fan experience, diminishing enjoyment and potentially leading to financial losses for hosts dependent on ticket and concession sales.

The Blues stand to make a big profit on the wantaway winger despite the indifferent nature of his spell at Stamford Bridge

We have been waiting some time to witness Chelsea's bewildering new transfer strategy yield some semblance of success, but, all of a sudden, it has started to bear fruit. Fresh from their incredibly young squad claiming a second trophy in as many months, the Blues are set to make a cool profit on one of their expendable wantaways.

Noni Madueke is set to complete a costly £52 million ($70m) transfer across the English capital to fierce rivals Arsenal, and the imminent deal means Chelsea stand to gain more than £20m ($27m) - despite the winger largely flattering to deceive since arriving from PSV for £30.5m ($41m) in January 2023.

This is the new master plan in action, and with tangible success finally being delivered on the pitch, the club's hierarchy will believe that their often baffling approach to the transfer market is now paying off...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Major League Soccer, not Serie A, would offer the Dortmund midfielder the perfect opportunity rediscover his game

As Borussia Dortmund took on Mamelodi Sundowns in their second Club World Cup group stage fixture, Gio Reyna could only watch from the locker room at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati. In fairness, he wasn't alone. Half of the Dortmund bench had joined him there, the German side watching their teammates toil in the scorching summer sun.

But that image - one that went viral on both sides of the Atlantic - summed up Reyna's position in Dortmund right now. It was, in effect, the perfect metaphor. Reyna the outcast, watching from afar, not even relevant enough to be on the bench.

And that's pretty much where the Reyna saga is these days. And yes, it is a saga. The Dortmund attacking midfielder is an immense talent. He is perhaps the most naturally gifted player in the USMNT setup. But at Dortmund, he has become, to put things generously, an afterthought. Niko Kovac clearly doesn't trust him even for garbage time minutes, let alone the high intensity grind of the Bundesliga that Reyna, on talent alone, is good enough to star in.

For a few years now, the story has been one of ""How Reyna is going to turn things around at Dortmund."" But now, transfer talk has kicked up for good. His Dortmund future was in doubt before. Now it just seems non-existent. A move is inevitable. Landing spots are tough to evaluate. Another Bundesliga club might make sense. A more permanent home for a lower level Premier League team could also work

Recently, two links have popped up: MLS and Serie A. LAFC and NYCFC have been mentioned in the domestic U.S. league. Parma seem a potential Serie A destination - with reports suggesting a deal for a $7 million switch could be in the works.

But for this iteration of Reyna, 22, full of quality but in dire need of a fresh start, MLS simply has to be his immediate future. It is the only way he can play his way into the USMNT picture. And, more broadly, it would seem to be a career-saving move for an immense talent steadily fading into irrelevance.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

GOAL's brand new Beast Mode On Podcast, hosted by Adebayo Akinfenwa, welcomes guest Michail Antonio as he discusses the harrowing car crash that almost killed him, as well as listing some of his toughest opponents and the Portuguese referee that he almost fought on the pitch after being left outraged by the decisions of the official.

Antonio, who is West Ham's record Premier League goalscorer having struck 68 times in England's top flight for the Hammers, recalls one particular defeat, against Bayer Leverkusen in a Europa League quarter-final tie back in April 2024, that made him so angry that he was ready to punch referee Artur Soares Dias in the face.

Twenty-nine different men have reached world No 1 on the ATP Rankings since the system was first launched in 1973.

Among them are tennis icons and all-time greats of the sport, but who are the tallest ATP Tour stars to reach the pinnacle of their sport?

Here, using official information from the ATP Tour website, we list the eight tallest men to reach world No 1 in the singles rankings.

Our list starts with reigning world No 1 Sinner, who has now remained at the top of the ATP Rankings since first rising to the top in June 2024.

The Italian is already joint-12th all-time for most weeks as the ATP world No 1, and is the winner of four Grand Slam titles to date.

At 191cm/6'3, Sinner is the joint-third-tallest world No 1 in ATP Rankings history.

The same height as Sinner, Spanish star Moya spent two weeks as the world No 1 in March 1999.

Moya first broke through with a surprise run to the Australian Open final in 1997, before winning his sole Grand Slam singles title at the 1998 French Open.

The Spaniard rose to world No 1 after reaching the 1999 Indian Wells final, and he remains the joint-third-tallest, though he will always be the first ATP world No 1 from his nation.

The first Russian player, male or female, to reach world No 1 in the singles rankings in the Open Era, Kafelnikov was one of the leading stars of the late 1990s.

The Russian triumphed at the 1996 French Open and 1999 Australian Open, and would strike gold at the Olympic Games in 2000.

Kafelnikov, the winner of 26 ATP Tour titles, is another world No 1 who measures 6'3/191cm in height.

One of the leading players of his era, Becker won six Grand Slam singles titles and spent a total of 12 weeks as the world No 1.

Becker won three Wimbledon titles, two Australian Open titles, and a US Open title across his career, and spent two small spells as the world No 1 in 1991.

The German is one of five world No 1's listed as 6'3/191cm, though he was the tallest-ever world No 1 when he first rose to the top in January 1991.

After years of being held off the top spot by his ‘Big 3' rivals, Murray finally surged to world No 1 in November 2016, and held the top ranking for 41 straight weeks.

The Brit was famously a two-time Wimbledon champion, triumphing in 2013 and 2016, though he also prevailed at the US Open in 2012.

So far the only Briton, male or female, to be ranked world No 1 in the Open Era, Murray is another player who is 6'3/191cm tall.

The only Brazilian player to reach world No 1 in the Open Era, Kuerten spent 43 weeks atop the ATP Rankings across three separate spells over 2000 and 2011.

Kuerten is, of course, best remembered for his Roland Garros success, lifting the title in 1997, 2000, and 2001.

The Brazilian is part of a group of six world No 1's listed as 6'3/191cm tall on the ATP Tour website.

The 5 greatest men's Grand Slam duopolies: Alcaraz & Sinner with 7 straight majors

The winner of two Grand Slam singles titles, Safin was the second Russian man to reach world No 1 and spent nine weeks atop the ATP Rankings.

Safin is best remembered for winning the 2000 US Open and 2005 Australian Open, with his nine weeks as No 1 spread across two separate spells in 2001.

At 6'4/194cm tall, the Russian is officially the second-tallest world No 1 in ATP Tour history.

Just two centimetres shy of two metres tall, will the ATP Tour ever see another world No 1 as tall as Medvedev?

The Russian has spent 16 weeks of his career as the No 1, across two spells in 2022, and lifted the US Open title in 2021 – alongside a further five runner-up finishes at majors.

Medvedev is listed as 6'6'/198cm tall on the ATP website, making him the tallest man to ever reach the top of the ATP Rankings.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are the two men to beat on the ATP Tour, and at the moment, they appear to be head and shoulders above everyone else. 

With the last seven Grand Slam titles split between them, Alcaraz and Sinner look set to dominate men's tennis for the foreseeable future. 

In the most recent edition of the rivalry between the two, the Italian emerged victorious to become the first from his country to clinch a Wimbledon singles crown. 

His triumph meant Sinner snapped a five-match losing streak against Alcaraz, which dated back to the China Open in 2023. 

The head-to-head record is now 8-5 in favour of the Spaniard, who also leads his rival 3-2 in Grand Slam events.

Both players are evenly matched at their highest level, but world number 29 Tallon Griekspoor says there are some things the world number two can do that his Wimbledon conqueror simply can't.

On the ‘Changeover Podcast', Griekspoor said: “For me personally, I've always had more chances against Sinner than I had against Alcaraz. I feel like with Sinner, you know what's coming.

“He does it unbelievably well. He's the best player in the world. But at the same time, he doesn't have the net skills and the net game that Alcaraz has.

“He doesn't have the drop shot. He doesn't have the backhand slice. The things he does are unbelievable.

“[Sinner has an] unbelievable level, but I think Alcaraz has a bit more options. And I think why Alcaraz is also a little bit more up and down is because he maybe is not using the right options at the right time.

“But, on the other hand, in trouble, I think Alcaraz can do much more. I think Alcaraz, his peak can be higher than Sinner's peak.

“I just think that Alcaraz has more options. He's more complete than Sinner is. But whatever Sinner does, he's the best in the world at doing that.”

After beating him in the semi-final of the China Open in 2023, Sinner couldn't buy a win against Alcaraz on the tour.

In 2024, he lost to him three times, the first of which came at the Indian Wells Open, where he was overcome in three sets. 

At Roland Garros that year, Alcaraz won their second career bout on clay, beating Sinner in a five-set thriller to advance to the final in Paris. 

The five-time major champion won their last match in 2024 in the final of the China Open to deny his opponent a title defence. 

Alcaraz defeated Sinner in the championship matches of both the Italian Open and the French Open this year before finally losing to him at the All England Club.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Ahead of the semifinals, most were expecting a final showdown between Andrey Rublev and Denis Shapovalov, but Aleksandar Kovacevic has thrown a spanner in the works by beating Rublev in an ATP 250 semfinal for the second time this year (Montpellier) to reach a second career final and have another opportunity for a maiden title. Shapovalov, meanwhile, will be determined to win another title after an up-and-season so far for the Canadian. But who will come out on top?

Head-to-head: first meeting

 While this final won't have the same star quality as Rublev vs Shapovalov, Kovacevic has been playing some great tennis this week and produced a great final in Montpellier (where he came very close to beating Shapovalov's countryman Felix Auger-Aliassime) and will back himself to put in another good performance against Shapovalov.

On paper, this is perhaps the first final in Shapovalov's career where he starts as a very clear favourite, given his much higher ranking and also how well he has been playing so far this week, dropping no sets and only 12 games en route to the final. If he maintains the kind of level he has shown so far this week, there might be little that Kovacevic can do to stop him. That said, the Canadian is known for his inconsistency and Kovacevic has been playing some very good tennis, not least in getting a second career top 10 win in the semifinals here, both against Rublev this year in the semifinals of ATP 250 events.

Just like in Montpelier, he will have to follow up his win over Rublev against a Canadian opponent; he was very close to beating Felix in France and will be hoping to go one better against Shapovalov. With this week's performance, the American has already secured a new career high ranking and a title would really cap off a dream week, but under normal circumstances Shapovalov should be a bit too much for him at this point.

Prediction: Shapovalov in 2

Holger Rune is working on strengthening his team after a 2025 season that hasn't lived up to his ambitions

After the trial collaboration between Alexander Zverev and Toni Nadal at the Rafa Nadal Academy, a new duo is stepping into the spotlight this Saturday! As the North American swing is set to begin next week, Holger Rune was spotted training in Washington with Andre Agassi.

According to our information, the American is not yet officially part of the Danish player's team. The two will work together for three days in the United States before deciding what comes next. Andre Agassi is there to bring a fresh perspective to the Rune project, whose main coach remains Lars Christensen, also present in Washington.

A video published by the YouTube channel Open Court shows Holger Rune and Andre Agassi training together.



Holger Rune is currently working on strengthening his team after a first half of the season marked by ups and downs. 

He claimed the fifth title of his career on the clay courts of Barcelona and reached the final of the Indian Wells Masters 1000. However, he has not gone beyond the round of 16 in any Grand Slam and was knocked out in the first round at Wimbledon.

This is the second time in his career that the Danish player, currently ranked No. 8 in the world, will compete at the Washington tournament. He won't have many ATP points to defend during the North American hard-court swing this season. In 2024, he lost in the third round in Montreal, reached the semifinals in Cincinnati, and suffered a first-round exit at the US Open.

Aside from a brief hiccup at Wimbledon, Alexander Bublik has remained on a roll and is two wins away from another ATP title at the Swiss Open Gstaad.Bublik, who recently triumphed on the grass courts of Stuttgart, has advanced this week with straight-set victories over Alexander Shevchenko and Francisco Comesana. The 34th-ranked Kazakh has won 11 matches dating back to the start of the French Open, where he made a surprising run to the quarterfinals.Standing in Bublik's way of the Gstaad final is Arthur Cazaux, who lost their only previous encounter 6-4, 7-6(1), 6-4 last summer at the All-England Club.Cazaux is just 7-7 on the main tour in 2025, but he is also coming in pretty hot. The 116th-ranked Frenchman built some confidence by successfully qualifying for Wimbledon and reaching round two (beat Adam Walton in five sets before losing to Alex de Minaur in four). So far in Gstaad he has defeated Nikoloz Basilashvili, Tomas Martin Etcheverry, and Jerome Kym all in very tight three-setters.With Bublik red hot on clay (no, that is not a misprint!) and Cazaux coming off a trio of three-setters, this will likely be one-way traffic for the tournament's last remaining seed.Pick: Bublik in 2    87WWW: Bublik vs. Cazaux?

the Bublik bandwagon is filling

He looks like a different person

Cazaux has a very big win this week over Etcheverry, since clay is not his surface and did play Bublik somewhat close on grass before, so will have a touch of confidence, but all signs point to Bublik here getting this done handily and is a big fav., Bublik in 2.

As the summer tennis season reaches its peak, attention is rapidly turning from the grass courts of London to the hard courts of New York. 

Wimbledon have just concluded, crowning their latest champions, Jannik Sinner in the Men's Singles and Iga Swiatek in the Women's Singles, after two weeks of exciting action. 

Now, with the US Open around the corner, starting on August 24th, fans and players alike are setting their sights on the final Grand Slam of the year.

Beyond the prestige and the trophies, a significant motivator for elite athletes is the substantial prize money on offer. Each Grand Slam competes to provide the most lucrative rewards, reflecting their status at the pinnacle of the sport. 

While all four majors offer life-changing sums, the financial stakes often vary; therefore, Tennis Gazette has taken a closer look at which tournament truly offers the biggest paycheque.

To wrap up, while all Grand Slams offer immense financial rewards, the US Open generally stands out as the most lucrative for its singles champions, with a projected $4.3 million payout for 2025. 

Closely following is Wimbledon, offering approximately $3.83 – $4.09 million USD to its winners. The French Open and Australian Open round out the top four, with champion payouts of roughly $2.72 – $2.91 million USD and $2.37 – $2.13 million USD respectively. 

While the prestige of a Grand Slam title is paramount, the significant prize money on offer adds a compelling financial incentive for the world's best tennis players.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Roger Federer's former coach Ivan Ljubicic has slammed John McEnroe for his ""nonsense"" claims about Rafael Nadal during the French Open last month. The American tennis icon sparked controversy when he said after Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz's legendary clash that either player could have defeated 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal at his peak on the Paris clay.

As the two new standard bearers for men's tennis, Sinner and Alcaraz did not disappoint, producing an instant classic in the Roland-Garros final. The Spaniard, 22, came from two sets behind and saved three Championship points to claim his second French Open title and fifth major overall in astonishing fashion.

The pair faced off again at Wimbledon earlier this month, where Sinner, 23, avenged his gruelling defeat to Alcaraz to claim his fourth Grand Slam title.

After witnessing what many considered to be one of the all-time great Grand Slam finals, McEnroe said on TNT Sports: “You took a look at them bringing their A-game right now – I'm saying Sinner and Alcaraz against Nadal on clay – you would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favoured to beat Nadal, at his best.

""Do I think they're going to reach 20, 24 titles either one of them? No. Because I think that plateau is so hard it's almost impossible; there's more depth in the game, bigger hitters, and more things happen.

“But these two guys right now, it's like when you watch the NBA and you say nobody could be better than Michael Jordan. The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen.”

Those comments were interpreted by some as disrespectful towards Nadal, who retired last year after clinching an incredible 14 French Open titles. One person who most notably took issue was former tennis player Ljubicic, who coached Nadal's long-time rival Federer between 2016 and 2022.

""It was a very, very, very good final,” the Croatian said. “And the drama was perfect with the match points saved. But people always exaggerate.

“John McEnroe said Nadal wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys. That's nonsense. We haven't seen the best of Alcaraz and Sinner yet. They still have a lot of room for improvement.

""But I don't think they're ahead just yet. I sometimes watch matches from 2005, 2008, 2012, 2015 [between] Roger and Rafa. That was already incredible tennis.""

McEnroe has already taken the step to clarify his earlier comments, saying during Alcaraz's Wimbledon quarter-final victory over Cameron Norrie: “I made a comment during the French [Open] where I said these guys [Alcaraz and Sinner] would have a shot… I didn't say they would beat Nadal every time.

“I said the fact that you would think these two players would actually go onto the court really believing they could do it – with Nadal in his prime – it shows you how much the level of the game has changed even in a couple of years.”

The Latest Zverev v Rothenberg Update From Berlin

Here we go! 

Sally Jenkins wasn't at Wimbledon this year, but her column for The Washington Post—“Tennis fans deserve better than John McEnroe”—still created a lot of chatter in the Wimbledon media center. 

Jenkins roped Patrick McEnroe into her complaints, saying that the pair “have given the viewer about as much information as a couple of air compressors, complete with the irritating hissing.” Here's more of the gist:

Responsibility for this lies with cowed producers and frictionless network chiefs who have enabled the McEnroe monopoly despite their shallow blandness — and who have allowed John in particular way too much diva license. He calls virtually all of the top matches, from ESPN to NBC to TNT, and cuts out to do cameos for BBC and Tennis Channel, without doing a lick of ostensible homework.

Here are my two cents on the McEnroe monopoly on US tennis broadcasting:

Boris Becker has re-emerged to deliver some hard truths to Novak Djokovic about his future.

After all, Wimbledon marked another near-miss for the 38-year-old in his never-ending conquest for a 25th Grand Slam title.

The Serbian's sole remaining mission within the sport is clear, and his continued presence within the sport is centred around it.

However, he faces two stumbling blocks that he seemingly cannot surpass, particularly with Jannik Sinner.

The Italian has won his last five matches against the legendary veteran, and along with Carlos Alcaraz, this duo have won all of the last seven majors.

It's clear why Djokovic is sticking around, but Becker is starting to question it.

Speaking on his podcast with Andrea Petkovic, he began by stating: “That's the big question now, because to win a Grand Slam, he probably has to beat both [Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner].

“That's how it was with Wimbledon, and he said Wimbledon was the tournament where he had his best chance of winning a Grand Slam.

“As a reminder, he has already won the tournament seven times. He's now reached the semifinals of Wimbledon 14 times, just imagine. That's so absurd, it's an insane number.”

However, the German then turned from adulation into advice, continuing: “He also has to realise, yes, he did injure himself a bit on match point against [Flavio] Cobolli, but at 38, you get injured more easily.

“Against [Jannik] Sinner, in the first two sets, I think he was relatively fit. Sinner, of course, was the better player, because for me, Sinner is Djokovic 2.0; he's another version of Djokovic, 15 years younger. Novak knows that, too.

“I'm glad he reached the semifinals; he played a great tournament, but is that enough for him?

“He's still playing tennis because he wants to win 25 Grand Slams, to become the sole record holder.

“But it must be said that on their good days, Sinner and Alcaraz are better than Djokovic is on his good days. That frustrates him, but he's a realist.

“The question is, how realistic are the chances he'll win another Grand Slam now, because time is running out for him?”

It seems strange that people are questioning the decision for Djokovic to keep playing tennis, when this year he has reached the semi-finals of all three Grand Slams.

For most on tour, that would represent their best-ever season. For the 24-time Grand Slam winner, it is not enough.

But, if he remains ever-present and continues to reach these latter stages, he at least puts himself in contention.

Eventually, one of Alcaraz or Sinner will have to fall early, giving him the opportunity to claim that elusive 25th title whilst only having to play one of them.

At Wimbledon, had Djokovic beaten the eventual champion, the Spaniard would have awaited him in the final. He had lost the last two finals to him, and so to overcome both of them in one event would've been near-impossible.

He needs a little luck, but if he keeps himself present, he gives himself a chance. He'll likely continue doing this either until he gets that slice of luck or his body no longer lets him. Regardless, a figure as legendary as he has earned that right.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Iga Swiatek, Wimbledon champion, received a special LEGO model of a giant strawberry, as a gift from her corporate partner, LEGO. Swiatek loves to build LEGO models as an off-court hobby.

We're gonna need a bigger bowl! Iga Swiatek arrived home after winning Wimbledon to a special keepsake to commemorate a historic victory as SW19: a LEGO model of a giant strawberry.

The model of Wimbledon's most famous snack (and Swiatek's favorite pasta topping) was a gift to the 24-year-old by the toy company, for whom she has been an ambassador in Poland for the last year. In her time at the top of the game, Swiatek has confessed to enjoying building LEGO models away from the court, and credits the creative outlet helping to keep her mind sharp on the tennis court.

“I like the process so much as it helps me to clam, focus on here and now, just be in the moment when I need it, for instance when I'm waiting for hours for my matches,” she told Forbes last year.

 “I like what the process does, it helps me be grounded, concentrated and calm.”

Her newest model, made of 3,000 LEGO bricks, also features a miniature figurine of Swiatek holding a bowl of strawberries and cream, and two tiny tennis racquets.

A post shared by Iga Świątek (@iga.swiatek)

""[This] will remind me how important the small pleasures and joys in life are,"" she wrote when revealing her present on Instagram.

The big berry adds to a menagerie of custom LEGO sets that Swiatek has been gifted by the brand for career milestones.

Last year, after winning her fourth Roland Garros crown and to celebrate her 23rd birthday, she received a model of Court Philippe-Chatrier complete with an attached ""Iga's Bakery"" -- inspired by a Parisian bakery  -- that weighed 26 pounds. Present were mini figurines of herself, her team, her cat Grappa, and other Easter eggs like the cast of ""Friends"" -- her favorite show -- and soccer star Robert Lewandowski sitting in the stands.

She was also once gifted a model of her Tecnifibre racquet made entirely of LEGO. 

""I appreciate Lego's team creativity a lot,"" Swiatek says. ""It's a whole new level of what people's imagination can do.”

2025 hasn't really gone according to Novak Djokovic's plan, but tennis legend Jimmy Connors feels that the veteran has a ace up his sleeve for the upcoming US Open. Connors had a warning for the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, claiming that Djokovic wasn't yet done.

Djokovic has reached three Grand Slam semi-finals this year. He had to retire vs Alexander Zverev in Melbourne, and then lost in the French Open and Wimbledon semi-finals.

Speaking on a podcast, Connors said, “I am not counting him out yet. When you have got guts, you have got guts. And sometimes those guts are going to come out.”

“I got a feeling that as much as he would have liked to have won Wimbledon, that result in the semi, he didn't like that. Losing three straight sets like that. He is not used to that, that's not him, that's not his game. So believe me, the guy can come up with something up his sleeve for the US Open, which might just surprise a lot of people and you know what, I would love to see it,” he added.

2025 is also expected to be Djokovic's swansong year, but after the Wimbledon semi-final, he hinted that he would be back next year.

Meanwhile, Aussie ace Nick Kyrgios, who has a good relationship with Djokovic, feels that he will be retiring soon. “I think he's got to be finished soon,” he said.

“Like, come on, what more? I asked him this at Indian Wells this year. We were in the locker room and I said ‘why are you here? Why are you playing?' He just goes ‘I don't know.'”

Kyrgios also feels that Djokovic will be more inclined to spend time with his family. “I go ‘what about your kids, I know you want to spend time with your family'. He said ‘yeah, I don't know'. That was the first time I think he missed his family a lot,” he said.

“I can't see him playing for more than another year. Not again. Not the whole year again. He is so professional. I am just speaking from my experience if I had a family like his and kid,” he added.

After a phenomenal rise, Filipina ready to make her third Grand Slam debut this year

Dubai: Three years after lifting the US Open girls' singles trophy, Alex Eala is set to return to New York — this time as a history-making Filipina making her main draw debut in the women's singles at the final Grand Slam of the year.

Eala, now ranked No 56 in the WTA Rankings, has been included in the official entry list for the US Open, scheduled from August 24 to September 7. It marks the 20-year-old's third Grand Slam appearance of the season following her campaigns at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

But this trip to Flushing Meadows holds extra meaning. In 2022, a then 17-year-old Eala captured the junior title in emphatic fashion, becoming the first Filipino to win a Grand Slam singles trophy. And this year, she returns not as a promising junior, but as a fully fledged professional — and the first Filipina to ever contest a main draw match at the US Open.

The milestone comes at the end of a breakthrough season that has seen Eala firmly establish herself on the WTA Tour. Her run to the fourth round of the Miami Open back in March helped her break into the world's top 100 for the first time. She followed it up with her maiden WTA final appearance at Eastbourne and main draw entries at two Grand Slams.

Alongside her rise in the rankings has come significant financial reward. So far in 2025, Eala has earned approximately $591,592 (around P33.8 million) in prize money, putting her 53rd among all players on the WTA earnings list this year. That total includes her $88,468 (approx. P5.1 million) payout from Wimbledon, where she fell to defending champion Barbora Krejcikova in the first round after a spirited start.

Her Wimbledon showing also pushed her career earnings past the $1 million mark — a landmark feat for any young tennis professional, and a sign of her growing stature on tour.

Eala's US Open debut won't come in isolation. The product of the Rafael Nadal Tennis Academy is gearing up for a busy hard-court swing in North America, with entries in two high-profile WTA 1000 events — the National Bank Open in Montreal (July 26 — August 7) and the Cincinnati Open (August 5—18). Both tournaments will be first-time appearances for Eala, who now qualifies directly for main draws thanks to her ranking.

In both events, she will rub shoulders with the biggest stars of the sport — including world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, French Open champion Coco Gauff, Wimbledon winner Iga Swiatek, and Australian Open champion Madison Keys.

From a junior dream in New York to a million-dollar career on the professional circuit, Eala's story is still unfolding. But with history already made and more firsts in sight, the Filipina ace heads into the US Open with growing belief — and a nation behind her.

Aleksandar Kovacevic summoned a striking sense of deja-vu against Andrey Rublev on Friday evening at the Mifel Tennis Open by Telcel Oppo in Los Cabos, where he surged into the championship match.

The 26-year-old American rallied to a gritty 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory over the top-seeded Rublev after two hours, 29 minutes at the Mexican hard-court ATP 250. Having also defeated Rublev to reach his maiden ATP Tour final in Montpellier in February, Kovacevic now boasts a 2-0 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

“I can't lie but say that once you get a win over a player one time, you believe you can do it again,” said Kovacevic. “I was not feeling so great to start, but then I really found my energy in the second and third sets. I had a bit of luck going my way, but I'm proud of the way I competed.

“Every match is a new challenge. I thought about how I was going to play against him, but you can't think too much of the past, whether it's good or bad.”

Kovacevic will take on Denis Shapovalov in Sunday's final. It will be the first tour-level championship match between two players with a one-handed backhand since Stefanos Tsitsipas defeated Dominic Thiem at the 2019 Nitto ATP Finals. 

By becoming the fourth American finalist in Los Cabos, Kovacevic is up 10 spots to No. 66 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, guaranteeing a new career high on Monday. He could rise another 10 places to No. 56 if he captures his first ATP Tour trophy.

Rublev, the World No. 10, was aiming to record his 250th tour-level win on hard courts. He saved four break points for a gutsy service hold to move to 4-3 in the final set, but Kovacevic found a late spark and reeled off the final three games to prevail.

Watch Extended Highlights of Los Cabos semi-finals: 

Kovacevic faces a maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with third seed Shapovalov, who continued his impressive debut in Los Cabos by reaching the final without dropping a set. The 26-year-old Canadian was relentless throughout his 6-2, 6-2 win over Adam Walton, saving all four break points he faced and converting all four he carved out on the Australian's serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

“It's what I was born with and it's the way I grew up playing,” Shapovalov said when asked about his aggressive game style. “It's important to stay aggressive and keep going for it. It's been a great week for me, I didn't know what to expect coming in. It's always special to play a final at this level. It's going to be fun.”



With his 66-minute victory, Shapovalov joined countryman Felix Auger-Aliassime (3), Alejandro Davidovich Fokina (2) and Jack Draper (2) as the only men to reach multiple hard-court finals this year. Shapovalov, who won the biggest title of his career at the ATP 500 in Dallas in February, is chasing his fourth ATP Tour trophy.

Shapovalov's 2023 season was cut short in July due to a knee injury, but he returned to form at the back end of 2024 by winning his first title in five years in Belgrade as a qualifier. The former No. 10 player in the PIF ATP Rankings then surged through three Top 10 opponents during his Dallas triumph. By reaching his ninth tour-level final this week, Shapovalov is up four spots to No. 29 in the Live Rankings.

Iga Swiatek, Wimbledon champion, received a special LEGO model of a giant strawberry, as a gift from her corporate partner, LEGO. Swiatek loves to build LEGO models as an off-court hobby.

We're gonna need a bigger bowl! Iga Swiatek arrived home after winning Wimbledon to a special keepsake to commemorate a historic victory as SW19: a LEGO model of a giant strawberry.

The model of Wimbledon's most famous snack (and Swiatek's favorite pasta topping) was a gift to the 24-year-old by the toy company, for whom she has been an ambassador in Poland for the last year. In her time at the top of the game, Swiatek has confessed to enjoying building LEGO models away from the court, and credits the creative outlet helping to keep her mind sharp on the tennis court.

“I like the process so much as it helps me to clam, focus on here and now, just be in the moment when I need it, for instance when I'm waiting for hours for my matches,” she told Forbes last year.

 “I like what the process does, it helps me be grounded, concentrated and calm.”

Her newest model, made of 3,000 LEGO bricks, also features a miniature figurine of Swiatek holding a bowl of strawberries and cream, and two tiny tennis racquets.

A post shared by Iga Świątek (@iga.swiatek)

""[This] will remind me how important the small pleasures and joys in life are,"" she wrote when revealing her present on Instagram.

The big berry adds to a menagerie of custom LEGO sets that Swiatek has been gifted by the brand for career milestones.

Last year, after winning her fourth Roland Garros crown and to celebrate her 23rd birthday, she received a model of Court Philippe-Chatrier complete with an attached ""Iga's Bakery"" -- inspired by a Parisian bakery  -- that weighed 26 pounds. Present were mini figurines of herself, her team, her cat Grappa, and other Easter eggs like the cast of ""Friends"" -- her favorite show -- and soccer star Robert Lewandowski sitting in the stands.

She was also once gifted a model of her Tecnifibre racquet made entirely of LEGO. 

""I appreciate Lego's team creativity a lot,"" Swiatek says. ""It's a whole new level of what people's imagination can do.”

Remembering Jules Bianchi with Charles Leclerc

Liam Lawson takes a moment to reflect on everything that has happened this year in an exclusive interview with F1.com.

Liam Lawson has experienced a lot in his short F1 career, with super-sub appearances, promotions, demotions and redemption all playing a part so far. Halfway into the 2025 season, which he started at Red Bull Racing and continued at Racing Bulls, the New Zealander talks to F1.com about the past, present and the future…

Lawson has just made his way back to a buzzing Goodwood Festival of Speed paddock after wrestling a rally car around the estate's own forest stage – bright red, giddy with adrenaline and keen to highlight how much fun it was behind the wheel.

It adds to an already whirlwind 2025 for the 23-year-old, who dusts himself down, sits back in an armchair and presses an ice-cold can of Red Bull onto his forehead for some instant relief, then gets set to talk through all the twists and turns with F1.com.

Lawson's year, of course, started at Red Bull, having been given the nod following his impressive showings at AlphaTauri/Racing Bulls as a substitute for the injured Daniel Ricciardo in 2023 and as a full replacement across the final few rounds of 2024.

It represented a massive opportunity to take the next step in his F1 adventure alongside reigning four-time World Champion Max Verstappen, with the prospect of turning points finishes into podiums, race victories and perhaps even more.

But that self-described “lifelong dream” would be over after two challenging Grands Prix, with team chiefs sending him straight back to Racing Bulls via Q1 exits and no-scores at the season-opening back-to-back events in Australia and China.

A bitter blow at the time, Lawson has since worked hard to move on from that moment, settle into a rhythm at Red Bull's sister outfit and cement his place on the F1 grid – something he appears to be doing based on recent points-yielding efforts.

“I mean, it's a bit weird to have a second to reflect,” says Lawson, as the memories flash through his eyes. “It's been a very busy couple of months with six weeks and five race weekends. To have a bit of time… it's important to think about how everything's been.

“I think recently, performance-wise, it's been our strongest [phase]. The car's been fast, and I've also been probably at a level that I wasn't quite at before that.

“I would say there hasn't been enough points scored, for sure. Austria was great, but it's not enough. We need to be doing stuff like that as much as we can. I think the consistency is what's been tough.

“Obviously the start of the year, [we had] the big shake-up with the team switch, and then not really having the time to get to grips with things, racing every weekend, and trying to be at the level that I need to be at. It's been a lot.”

It begs the question, has Lawson had time to process everything that's happened?

“Honestly, not really – not yet,” he says. “I think now it's not quite… I think the summer break is the time everybody mentally switches off, at least for a week or so.

“We all know we have a couple more races coming up before then. You're still in that mindset, you're still thinking about what just happened, how we're going to improve in the next couple of races, and how I'm going to improve myself. You're just in it.

“It's nice to have a bit of time to breathe, but mentally I'm thinking about Belgium and Hungary that are coming up, and trying to go into that break with a good couple of races.”

Doing so would mean bookending the first half of the season in completely different ways.

As touched on above, Lawson qualified 18th on his Red Bull debut at Melbourne's Albert Park before crashing out of the rain-hit race, then lined up at the very back of the grid at the Shanghai International Circuit and finished the Grand Prix just over a minute behind Verstappen.

But while Lawson admits those results “weren't good enough”, several factors were against him – namely a compromised testing period, going to tracks he had never raced at before (including a Sprint weekend), and having to deal with his generational talent of a team mate.

Former Red Bull junior Jaime Alguersuari was a sympathetic voice as the paddock reacted to Lawson's demotion (and Yuki Tsunoda's promotion), commenting that “you can't be a hero and then the worst driver in one or two races”.

Lawson, too, makes clear that despite the natural disappointment of not being afforded more time at Red Bull, he never lost the belief in his abilities across that two-race spell.

“I think I would say one thing to be clear about is that between the first couple of races, to the team switch, then going to Japan, mentally for me nothing changed,” he states, sitting back up in his chair while doing so.

“It's been very heavily speculated that my confidence took a hit and stuff like this, which is completely false. From the start of the year, I felt the same as I always have.

“I think in two races, on tracks I'd never been to, it's not really enough for my confidence… maybe six months into a season, if I'm still at that level, if the results are still like that, then I'd be feeling something – maybe my confidence would be taking a hit.

“I was well aware that those results weren't good enough, but I was just focused on improving, fixing and learning, basically. I was in the same mindset as I have been since I came into F1.

“I think that was the biggest thing going into a team like that, in a car like that… it was going to take a bit of time to adjust and learn. With no proper testing, the issues in testing, the issues in Melbourne through practice… it wasn't smooth and clean. I needed time, and I wasn't given it.”

He adds: “I haven't really talked much about it, because I think for a big part of this year, I've just ignored everything that happened, and I've just focused on trying to drive the car – but I know there was a lot of stuff that went out that was speculation about how I was feeling.

“My confidence hasn't changed since the start of the year to now.”

After Lawson's first day back with Racing Bulls at Suzuka, I asked him how the RB21 and VCARB 02 compared, given all the talk about taming Red Bull's cars in recent seasons, and the difficulties Verstappen's various team mates have faced.

“It does feel different, definitely,” he admitted on that Friday. “I think it's maybe not what everyone expects, but it is definitely a different feeling to drive. I think the window that the [Racing Bulls] guys have at the moment is very, very good.”

Lawson's performances over the next few races were solid rather than spectacular on paper, predominantly posting Q2 appearances and midfield finishes – while rookie team mate Isack Hadjar pushed for Q3 and points – over the five race weekends from Japan to Emilia-Romagna.

But there would soon be flashes of the Lawson who caught the eye in 2023 and 2024, who proved himself alongside more experienced team mate Tsunoda, and who earned that call-up to Red Bull's main outfit.

Monaco brought the first rewards with a Q3 appearance and top-10 finish, as well as Lawson playing the team game in a particularly strategic race – featuring two mandated pit stops – to help Hadjar bag even more points for Racing Bulls.

Then, after encouraging practice pace in Spain and Canada faded, the Austrian Grand Prix weekend marked one of Lawson's strongest in F1 to date – a stellar P6 on the grid being turned into P6 on race day (behind only the McLarens, Ferraris and George Russell's Mercedes).

While some on the outside had expressed their doubts, Lawson knew it was only a matter of time before he delivered such a showing.

“No breakthroughs, just gradual build-up,” he says of the effort behind that top-six result. “Even from the first triple-header, the speed was good. It wasn't great, but it was quite good there. Since then, it's been in a pretty good place.

“We've gone to a lot of tracks… Monaco we were very strong in practice; Barcelona strong in practice; Canada strong in practice. Then you go to Qualifying and little things make a difference. It's not good enough, because the results haven't been coming consistently enough, but the speed itself has been quite good.

“Why Austria was a great weekend was obviously just to have that breakthrough of points, and I guess probably show a little bit of what's been building for a while, but also what needs to be coming more frequently.”

Achieving that consistency is arguably as difficult as it has ever been in F1.

With an incredibly small field spread in the closing stages of the sport's current ruleset, it means just a few hundredths of a second can be the difference between a painful Q1 exit and the elation of reaching Q3.

The situation is also reflected in the Teams' Championship standings, as 40 points separate Williams in fifth position and Alpine at the foot of the order – Racing Bulls holding seventh with 36 points to their name.

“F1 in general is very, very close right now, so it puts pressure on us, and the team, to first of all bring the best package we have to a race,” Lawson continues.

“If you arrive at a track and your car's way out of the window, and you're trying to chase it, everybody else is improving. It's so close that we're just trying to find half a tenth here and half a tenth there.

“All the way up until the final two corners of the lap you're in a position where you're going to go through to Q2, and one little thing, a tiny error, can just knock you out. You lose one or two-tenths and then you're on the receiving end.

“The car's consistently been quite strong recently. I think we're in a good place, and we're just trying to keep the trajectory going upwards.”

Amid all of this, it's worth noting that Lawson only has 23 starts to his name – below a current calendar's worth of races and not much more than the 2025 group of rookies.

“That's crazy,” Lawson responds with a smile when the number is pointed out, before pondering what would represent a respectable return from the 12 rounds still to come this season.

“I think for us, it's just having more frequent, good races – not one-off races,” he comments. “It's very, very hard, especially in the midfield, where you're trying to have that edge over everybody else around you.

“You're quite often fighting for [a few] points at the back end of the top 10, and occasionally when things are really good you get an Austria weekend, but it's very hard to achieve that all the time.

“I would say a consistent run of points is what we're looking for, to have [fewer] of these weekends where it's little issues, being knocked out in Q1 and things like that.”

Given the rollercoaster ride so far, and the tight scrap Racing Bulls find themselves in, does it mean Lawson's mindset is now very much focused on each race as it comes, rather than thinking about where his F1 career might be in another year's time?

“It is at the moment, yeah,” he nods. “I think the thing about F1 in general is you come in and there are so many races and so many weekends. You're used to probably having a bit more time.

“Here, you're forced to basically come out of a race weekend, especially on a triple-header, have a day to think about what just happened, and then you're straight away thinking about the next race. You almost get lost in this world.

“I don't know if it's healthy or not healthy, but you just think about F1, the performance and the result. I sit here now and we're nearly mid-July. The year has just gone. The fact we've done 12 races is insane, and they've just gone by like that.

“It does make a difference when you go into those little breaks, summer break and end of season, where you switch off. I find those moments quite weird. After too much time I get quite concerned that I'm not thinking about it… and you end up thinking about it!”

When the chequered flag drops at next month's Hungarian Grand Prix and drivers head into the summer break, there will be more than usual for Lawson to look back on and evaluate, but the signs are now pointing toward him finishing 2025 in a much better place than he started it.

Remembering Jules Bianchi with Charles Leclerc

Aston Martin Team Principal Andy Cowell discusses Adrian Newey, working with Honda and looking ahead to 2026 with F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto.

Four-and-a-half months ago, Adrian Newey walked into Aston Martin's state-of-the-art Formula 1 facility in Silverstone, sharpened his pencil and started scribbling ideas on the giant drawing board pitched in his shiny new office.

Since then, the 66-year-old has barely left that room, aside from a first trackside visit with his new team in Monaco, a follow-up visit at Silverstone over the road from the factory and a handful of days off. When he's in there, he frequently enters what he describes as a ""design trance"" where he is fully emersed in his own world and unaware of what is going on around him.

It's a tried and tested approach over decades that has – along with his legend as the greatest designer of all time – further energised the British team trying to build themselves into a team capable of fighting at the sharp end of the field – and generated an incredible buzz.

""Adrian is an amazing individual,"" says Aston Martin CEO and Team Principal Andy Cowell, as we chat in the summer sunshine. ""He's got great experience but the thing he loves is being at the drawing board thinking about the design of a racing car.

""And it's not just one part on the racing car, it's the whole system and so since March, he's spent hour after hour after hour at his drawing board just thinking about suspension concepts, the monocoque, where to put the engine, how to position the driver – all those detail architectural aspects of the racecar.

""He's adventurous, he's creative and adventurous and he pushes the boundaries and so everybody's got less volume to fit more components in and that inspires the engineers. They look at it initially and go how am I going to do that? But they are finding ways and Adrian helps with that.

""He doesn't just give a problem. He helps giving detailed solutions as well and the whole supply chain, in there in the factory, is enjoying working on that.

""From an idea on Adrian's drawing board to then having it running in the wind tunnel requires the model designers to create the parts and manufacturing and suppliers and bringing it all together and making sure it's a high-quality model in the wind tunnel. So we're doing that quicker than we've ever done before which is exciting.""

As you'd expect from Newey, he's pushing the envelope with his design. Cowell describes his approach as ""adventurous"" and that is pushing the technical team to reach new levels to make it work.

""Having Adrian join us since March, firing up the drawing board, and the machine that is required downstream of that, has just added some extra impetus to what we're doing for '26,"" adds Cowell.

""[Ahead of the British Grand Prix] we had both Fernando [Alonso] and Lance [Stroll] in the wind tunnel section with the model and Adrian. Adrian was talking about the features on the model. He pushes the boundaries.

""He packages ten things into the space where only one would normally fit, and all the engineers see that as a challenge. It's not just the engineers, it's the whole group of people within the aerodynamics development area.

""The pace with which we're creating changes on the '26 wind tunnel model is quicker than we've ever done before. It really is very impressive. It is like watching 100 people all run 100 metres sub-ten seconds, with perfect baton passes.

""It's very exciting to see and all of that is enabled by having the facilities, and the people and the methods. So yeah, it's an exciting journey into '26.""

Bar a few lunchtime chats with his colleagues about the 2025 car, Newey's full focus has been on 2026, when his first Aston Martin will be built to sweeping new aerodynamic rules and fitted with a works Honda power unit that will run 100% sustainable fuel.

And from Silverstone onwards, the team's complete development focus will be on next year. Their update at the British Grand Prix will be their last for this year, despite them sitting down in eighth in the Teams' Championship on 36 points.

The team know how much of an opportunity 2026 gives them to make a leap up the order. But they also know how much of a challenge it is given how much change they are going through.

Next year, they will go from customer to works team for the first time, with Honda coming on-board as their power unit supplier, while the squad will also do their own gearbox and suspension rather than buy-in from Mercedes.

""It is a transformation going from a customer team to a works team at the same time as all the regulation changes and the new factory and all the new equipment,"" says Cowell. ""It's a huge transformation for everybody in our team.

""But I'm really impressed with the enthusiasm that everybody's got. Everybody wants to get to the front. Everybody wants to do well. Everybody's open-minded to making changes in the way we work in responsibilities and so on. Everybody's busy, everybody's making lots of change, but it's enjoyable change.""

It took some time, but Honda eventually made it to the top of the pile in terms of power unit competitiveness on their last return to F1 when they triumphed with Red Bull. Having reversed the decision to leave the sport and instead partner up with Aston Martin, the Japanese manufacturer have been ramping their operation back up.

It's going to be a challenge to hit the ground running, as they lost crucial development time when they pulled out and then returned to the sport – while it always takes time to build a new relationship with a new partner. But they can take a lot of confidence from the way they persevered and delivered with Red Bull.

""The works been going on for many, many months so the design of the Honda power unit is very much fitting hand in glove with the back of our monocoque and the front of our transmission,"" says Cowell.

""The hardware has been tested in Sakura (Honda's power unit base in Japan) and our transmission has been tested here at Silverstone as well as on the back of the power unit in Sakura.

""There are daily meetings and then there are regular more senior level meetings to check in to make sure that we're all working in the right direction.""

One thing that will be stable for Aston Martin is driver line-up. Double world champion Alonso is signed up for what will be his fourth season with the team while Stroll, son of owner Lawrence, is set for his eighth campaign with the Silverstone squad.

Alonso may be turning 44 mid-way through next season, but he is showing no signs of slowing up. The Spaniard is on a run of four successive points scores and continuing to prove he has what it takes to get the maximum – and more – out of a race car.

""Fernando is one of those amazing drivers,"" says Cowell. ""He's got great experience. His race craft is tremendous but also his vision for where we should be going is incredible.

""He is looking at every little bit of detail of the car. He isn't just thinking about how the car felt to him in a session or in a race so he's a he's an exciting individual to have in the team.""

Stroll started the campaign strongly with two points scores, followed that up with a fifth in the Miami Sprint but then didn't score until last time out at Silverstone – where he ran in the podium positions at one stage – and withdrew from the Spanish Grand Prix because of pain in his wrist.

""Lance is really enthusiastic about the future of the team and next year so we're really pleased that he is also signed with us for next year,"" says Cowell.

""And when you look at the points, fortune was going with him at the start of the year and has perhaps dropped away a little bit but he's pushing hard.

""In the last couple of events, he's shown the performance but then, bad luck in Qualifying with red flags and so on has stopped him from from pushing forwards.""

Aston currently sit eighth in the Teams' Championship, five points behind Sauber in sixth. They've far from given up on this year – and will hope that by understanding better how to get the most out of their package in recent races, they can move up the standings.

But, of course, much of their hope rests on Newey steering them in the right next direction next season – and the whole team gelling together to deliver on the opportunity.

The actress' first book was acquired by Little, Brown and Company and will be released in March.

Christina Applegate has lived nearly her entire life in the spotlight. She first gained fame playing the onscreen daughter of Ed O'Neill and Katey Sagal on the beloved 1980s sitcom Married…With Children; she was 16 when the show premiered. Though she's been in countless television shows and films since (Friends, Anchorman, the Broadway revival of Sweet Charity), the actress has kept many of her life's moments to herself — until now. Applegate will publish her first memoir in March 2026, The Hollywood Reporter can exclusively announce.

	











You With the Sad Eyes will cover Applegate's life and legacy, starting with her tumultuous childhood in Laurel Canyon in the '70s, her earliest years on set and the struggles (abuse, body dysmorphia and more) that plagued her meteoric rise.

	“I decided to write this book when I was forced to slow down,” says Applegate. “I've had a career in TV and film since I was 3 years old, and I loved it. But with MS, all the things I thought were important shifted. For a long time, it felt impossible to find the meaning in everything I've been through, but for the first time in my life I've been able to stop and reflect. I've packed a lot into these 50-something years. It's scary — not gonna lie — to finally decide to tell it all. But no matter how dark it gets, I wrote this because I truly believe that books can make people feel less alone. I promise, You With the Sad Eyes won't be some big violin scratching for my life. But it will be real. It will be filled with the ups and downs, the humor and grief of life. So here I am. Real me. Lots to say.”

	











	The memoir was acquired from CAA by Little, Brown and Company in a preempt for World Rights and will be edited by Executive Editor Bryn Clark. “As an editor, I'm always chasing the elusive feeling of ‘I have to have this.' You only know it when you see it, and I knew Christina's book was it the second I read her opening words,” says Clark. “Christina speaks to the power of embracing the messiness and temporality of life instead of hiding behind the plastic veneer of our modern world. We have no time to waste on falsehoods and perfection.”


	Applegate follows the story of her earlier years with her health journey, and coming to terms with the repercussions of her 2021 multiple sclerosis diagnosis; searching for her identity and her joy in the face of the loss of her ability to act. Little, Brown and Company, a division of Hachette Book Group, will publish the memoir. Applegate is repped by CAA and Entertainment 360.

The seven-member global group made their Coachella debut this April, showcasing their dynamic performance skills to a new audience: “We poured our hearts into it.” 


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	Girl group XG has been leading the charge in the global pop space since their debut three years ago.


	The seven-piece hip-hop and R&B-inspired group — made up of members Jurin, Chisa, Hinata, Harvey, Juria, Maya and Cocona — debuted in 2022 with the single “Tippy Toes.” In the time since the undeniably catchy song, XG has ventured into an array of different genres with songs like the rap-heavy “Woke Up” to the Y2K-feeling “Left Right” and “Shooting Star.”




	Formed by Japanese entertainment company XGLAX, a global fanbase has always been XG's target. The seven-piece outfit took yet another step forward on the global stage this past April, making their Coachella debut to much fanfare.

	The women of XG stopped by The Hollywood Reporter's L.A. office to discuss Coachella, their recent single “Million Places,” their world tour and what they hope for the future.


Can you tell me about your experience at Coachella?


MAYA We're still not over how amazing Coachella was. The energy was just so crazy, and it was our first time ever going to Coachella. It was one of our dream stages and it's one of the biggest music festivals in the world, so we were so grateful and honored to be able to perform [at the festival]. There were so many Alphaz who came to watch our performance, so we're grateful for them.

	











What were preparations for Coachella like? How long were you were preparing — there were obviously things you couldn't prepare for, like a windy stage.


MAYA Super windy.


CHISA Coachella is a stage we've been dreaming about for so long. We worked on the setlist together, focusing on the transitions between the songs too. Since it was a band adaptation, we basically built the stage from scratch. We also worked on a new choreography; a dance routine called “Shinobi.” We practiced all this after arriving in L.A. We rearranged the MC for Coachella too. We are doing a world now [that has] a different setlist. This Coachella-exclusive setlist shows everything great about us. We practiced over and over again — we even changed the setlist at the very last moment. We poured our hearts into it. It was fun, but very windy, much more than we expected. We had a blast. The vibe was awesome and very festive. But we need to solve the wind problem, so you may see some changes during week two. (This interview was conducted between week one and week two.)


You all looked like you were having so much fun. Were there any surprise moments on stage for any of you?


COCONA During “Is This Love,” although it was just for a moment, there's this scene where we wave flowers. The audience also waved with their lightsticks. They danced to “Left Right” like this [motions hands from left to right]. In the last part, some were dancing along with us. I saw many Alphaz in the front row — they were shouting “XG,” which made us really happy. We were more focused at Coachella compared to [our recent] world tour, so we weren't able to interact with our fans as we usually do. But even with the in-ears [in], I could hear them cheering and singing. I was excited to see new people dancing along with us. During “IYKYK,” they were like “Wooo!” It was a happy surprise.

	











Is there anything you learned from the experience? Even if just from week one to week two?


JURIA We've got tons. It went beyond our expectations. Since Coachella is held outdoors, the wind felt strong, as we mentioned earlier. I wore my hair down because I like it that way. But my face got covered with the wind. There were many other incidents partly because it was outdoors. I'll take this as a lesson and wear my hair up next time. It was a valuable learning experience. Performing in a different environment from the world tour taught us so many things. Performing at an outdoor festival like Coachella was such a huge honor.


Can you tell me about “Million Places?”


JURIN We've [been] touring around the world for about a year. This song is filled with the precious moments we shared with Alphaz. The song and lyrics, for example, reflect our visit to the U.S. and what we experienced in Paris. This song is filled with memories of what we've actually been through. This song will take Alphaz back to the world tour. It's going to be a special song. I'm very sure about this.


CHISA It's a moving track. 


What was your experience touring the world like? Can you share how you were able to go through this experience together and about some of your favorite moments?


HINATA During the world tour, we worked together to build the stage. That experience gave us a deeper sense of responsibility and it made our bond even stronger.


CHISA We held space meetings, right?

	











HINATA We simply talked, nothing formal. We had plenty of communication [with one another].


JURIN On top of that, the World Tour and, of course, Coachella have been our dreams since our debut. It's like we've hit a major milestone. It reminds us of our trainee days when we got through difficult moments together. Everything we've been through is precious. Each time, we celebrate together by sharing meals, for instance. Those small moments make us happy. We've begun to realize how valuable these experiences have been. It's a great motivation for us.


You've already hit a lot of milestones as a group. What are your aspirations going forward? Do you have a big dream you're working towards?


HARVEY There are so many goals we want to achieve, both as a team and as individuals. The most important thing, I believe, is that we enjoy what we do every day. We can already do that, so I'd love to keep that going from now on. Since 2025, I've been feeling that. Since we've always valued the idea of enjoying the moment. I think that makes the “just do it” mindset [we have] feel even more important. We feel nervous and anxious when trying something new, but the seven of us can pull it off if we just do it. Each of us has unique senses and talents. It gives us the confidence to keep chasing our goals and dreams. My biggest goal for the seven of us is to perform at the Super Bowl.


As XG, you've been able to explore different genres and try new things. How would you describe the group's true musical identity? 












CHISA Space is a core part of our identity. It's reflected in many of our songs. Of course, the wolf-motif, too. We always say, “Let's head to outer space.” Space is infinite [and] nothing is impossible. Our music embodies infinite possibilities. I would say [what defines our music] is outer space, infinity and the idea that nothing is impossible.


What was it like to be able to see so many of your fans, Alphaz, at Coachella and around the world on the tour? Many of them have been supporting you from afar, but you were finally able to meet them up close.


MAYA It was such an amazing feeling. I think seeing so many of our Alphaz show up to our concert just to have fun, have the time of their lives [and] enjoy our music together means so much to us. I feel like our Alphaz are so cute and they have the best energy. I feel like every time we see each other, it's something new. Throughout this world tour, I feel like we built this relationship where we can't be separated, we're always together. “Million Places” is a song about that, about all the precious and special moments we had with our Alphaz. I'm hoping our Alphaz get teary [or] get emotional by hearing this song. It's a beautiful song and I'm really excited to sing song together.

""The witches are back,” the ‘Babygirl' star wrote in a heartfelt Instagram post. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	The witches are officially back! 


	To celebrate their first day on the set of the Practical Magic sequel, Nicole Kidman shared a heartfelt video on Instagram of herself and Sandra Bullock shooting for the film. 




	“The witches are back. Owens sisters' first day on set! #PracticalMagic,” the Babygirl star wrote in the caption of the post, while The Lost City actress can be heard saying, “Turns out, we have a lot of work to do.” 




			Related Video		







	Kidman and Bullock first starred as Sally and Gillian Owens, two sister witches who are plagued with a family curse that kills the men they fall in love with, in the 1998 film helmed by Griffin Dunne. Practical Magic 2 will be directed by Susanne Bier, whom Bullock has worked with on Bird Box and Kidman on The Perfect Couple.

A post shared by Nicole Kidman (@nicolekidman)


	Of working with Bier on Practical Magic 2, Kidman said it was like “the perfect triangle” for the trio to work together on the film, due to the director's past work with both actresses. She explained, “Sandy's worked with her, too, so the two of us were like, well, this is the perfect triangle because we all know each other so well and so to be able to work together on something that is fun and witchy.”


Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing are set to reprise their roles as the Owens aunts (who raise the sisters after their parents pass) in the follow-up. New additions to the cast include Joey King, Lee Pace, Maisie Williams, Xolo Maridueña and Solly McLeod.

	











	Evan Rachel Wood, who played Bullock's character's daughter in the first film, revealed that she was not asked to come back for Practical Magic 2. “l offered my services, even if it was one scene or one line. I was told they are recasting. I am sorry to disappoint the fans. It was not in my control or my choice. I would have happily rejoined my sisters,” she wrote on her Instagram Stories in July.


	Akiva Goldman, a co-writer of the 1998 movie, co-wrote the sequel script alongside Georgia Pritchett. Bullock and Kidman, too, serve as producers with Denise Di Novi (who also worked on the original Practical Magic). 


Practical Magic 2 will hit theaters on Sept. 18, 2026.

	Chris Gardner



	Are you ready to be together forever?


Neon and the married stars of its new body horror film Together, Dave Franco and Alison Brie, have concocted a contest for movie lovers ready to tie the knot that could land them a free trip to the chapel in Las Vegas. Dare we say, it's a pretty genius promotional tie-in.  




	The Oscar-winning studio will pick up the tab for an all-expenses-paid Sin City wedding for one lucky couple. All the couples have to do to enter is propose at a movie theater (inside or out) any time between now and by midnight on Aug. 3, all on video of course. “Film it, post it by Aug. 3 with the hashtag #TogetherContest,” Brie explained in a new Instagram video while seated alongside her husband. “How crazy romantic is this?”

	Written and directed by Michael Shanks, Together casts Franco and Brie as Tim and Millie, a couple that finds themselves at a crossroads as they move to the countryside, abandoning all that is familiar in their lives except one another. With tensions already flaring in their relationship, a nightmarish encounter with a mysterious, unnatural force threatens to corrupt their lives, their love and their flesh by bringing them closer than they've ever been. 

	











Together hits theaters everywhere July 30.


	Thursday proved to be a big day for the Together marketing and social team. Not only did they introduce this proposal challenge, Neon's Instagram page also made use of the biggest pop culture story of the day by posting a photo of the couple caught on a kiss cam at the Coldplay concert (Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and his chief people officer, Kristin Cabot) with the caption, “The perfect date night movie.” Actress Eiza Gonzalez caught it and posted, “Lol great marketing,” while Ilana Glazer added, “Good job u guys.”

Led by Netease Cloud Music and Tencent Music Entertainment, the 20-company Billboard Global Music Index rose 3.0% for the week ended July 18.

	Glenn Peoples



Chinese music streaming stocks continued their upward trajectory this week as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing showed signs of easing. Netease Cloud Music rose 12.1% to 302.40 HKD ($38.55), bringing the Chinese music streamer's July gain to an impressive 25.5% and its year-to-date improvement to 164.8%. Tencent Music Entertainment (TME), China's leading music streaming company, rose 8.3% to $21.43, valuing the company at $36.8 billion and bringing its year-to-date increase to 71.9%. 


	Cloud Music and TME shares have both benefited from solid first-quarter results and growing consumer interest in music subscriptions. Chinese stocks in general received a boost this week after the U.S. government eased export bans and allowed the sale of Nvidia's AI chips to China. In addition, Chinese data showed that China's gross domestic product grew 5.2% in the second quarter despite continued trade tensions. 


	The 20-company Billboard Global Music Index (BGMI) rose 3.0% to 2,982.90, breaking a two-week losing streak and improving its year-to-date gain to 40.4%. The BGMI nearly doubled the Nasdaq composite index's 1.7% increase and was well ahead of the S&P 500's 0.6% gain. In the U.K., the FTSE 100 rose 0.6%. South Korea's KOSPI composite index advanced 0.4%. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Warner Music Group (WMG) continued its winning streak, jumping 4.9% to $31.22 and getting a boost from Rothschild & Co Redburn's upgrade of WMG to “neutral” from “sell” on Tuesday (July 15). After reaching the mid-year mark down 12.1%, WMG shares have gained 14.6% since the company's July 1 announcement that it will save $300 million annually from layoffs and other cost-cutting measures. The company will announce earnings on Aug. 7. 


	Most live music stocks were in positive territory. Sphere Entertainment Co. spiked 7.6% to $46.15, the stock's highest closing price since Feb. 21 and more than $22 higher than its low point after President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners on April 3. Live Nation climbed 4.6% to $150.52, bringing the stock to within approximately 5% of its all-time high of $157.75. MSG Entertainment was up 2.0% to $40.25. CTS Eventim fell 1.3% to 103.90 euros ($120.82), but the German concert promoter's 27.3% year-to-date gain was the best of the peer group. 


	Shares of Abu Dhabi-based music streamer Anghami rose 2.1% to $0.49 after the company announced on Wednesday that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders to vote on a reverse stock split that will allow the stock to remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market exchange. The company has until Aug. 18 to achieve a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share for at least 10 consecutive business days. 


	SiriusXM shares fell 2.7% to $23.56 after Wednesday's announcement of an affordable, ad-supported satellite radio tier, SiriusXM Play, that will cost under $7 per month. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on SiriusXM on Wednesday (July 16) to $22 from $21 and kept its “underweight” rating.


	With HYBE in the news over a federal probe into Chairman Bang Si-hyuk, the K-pop giant's stock fell 1.1% to 268,000 KRW ($192.98), marking it third consecutive weekly decline. At least one analyst was optimistic this week: On Thursday (July 17), Nomura increased its price target for HYBE shares to 370,000 KRW ($266.42) from 270,000 KRW ($194.42) and maintained its “buy” rating. HYBE will announce its second quarter results on Aug. 6. 


	Spotify shares dipped 2.0% to $695.18, the fourth consecutive weekly decline after closing at $772.60 on June 27. After reaching the mid-year mark with a 71.4% gain, Spotify has dropped 9.4% in July. The company will report earnings on July 29.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: Taylor Russell has exited The Thomas Crown Affair, the Michael B. Jordan-directed reimagining of the classic Steve McQueen film. Sources said the exit was due to creative differences. The studio is recasting the role as production continues in London. 


	Russell was set opposite Jordan in the role of an insurance investigator who suspects that an adventurous banking executive is pulling off ambitious heists, and they develop sparks between them. That role was played by Faye Dunaway opposite McQueen in the 1968 original, and by Rene Russo opposite Pierce Brosnan in the 1999 version. 

	











	Russell will next be seen starring in the Korean thriller Hope by Na Hong-jin opposite Michael Fassbender, Alicia Vikander and Hoyeon. She can also be seen opposite David Johnson in the upcoming Frank Ocean film, and she's in talks to star in a remake of Single White Female opposite Jenna Ortega for Sony and Elizabeth Gabler's 3000 Pictures. She made her stage debut recently in the Jamie Lloyd-directed revival of the Lucy Prebble play The Effect. She had a breakout turn opposite Timothée Chalamet in the Luca Guadagnino-directed Bones and All, winning the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Emerging Actress at Venice.




			Watch on Deadline		







	She's also a director who made her debut co-directing The Heart Still Hums, which won Best Documentary Short at the Palm Springs ShortFest. She's repped by UTA and attorney James Feldman.


	Jordan stars in The Thomas Crown Affair alongside Kenneth Branagh, Lily Gladstone, Danai Gurira, Pilou Asbaek and Aiysha Hart. Jordan and Elizabeth Raposo are producing for Outlier Society alongside Charles Roven at Atlas Entertainment. Drew Pearce wrote the script, with previous drafts by Wes Tooke and Justin Britt-Gibson. Patrick McCormick and Toberoff Productions' Marc Toberoff are also producing and Alan Trustman, who wrote the McQueen original, is an executive producer.


	The film will hold its March 5, 2027 theatrical release date.

Is Hailee Steinfeld available…?

I'm really disappointed to hear that Taylor Russell is leaving ‘The Thomas Crown Affair.' She brought such a unique energy to the role. It'll be interesting to see who they cast next!

Michael needs someone across from him that is today's Diahnn Carroll, classy with some sass…a fresh face. I watched him do a Creed interview with a lady named Amber Pickens. That is the type of look and chemistry that film needs.

Creative differences lol. Sure. Would love the truth

Interesting. They should recast the female lead with Hallie Steinfield. Capitalize off the success of Sinners where they had amazing chemistry. Other potential replacements are Melissa Barrera, Brie Larson, Naomi Scott.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SATURDAY AM: DC Studios and Warner Bros' Superman is coursing to a second weekend of $57M, with a chance for upside. That's an ease of -54%, a second weekend percentile decline on par with Deadpool & Wolverine, and better than the second weekend superhero holds we've seen YTD, Thunderbolts (-56%) and Captain America: Brave New World (-68%).


	Word of mouth remains excellent with continued Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak polling showing a high definite recommend at 74%, with parents at 70% and kids under 12 at 65%. Warners is having a great weekend overall, the fourth weekend of Apple Original Films' F1 is only down -23%.

	











	Overall weekend for all titles before Marvel Studios' The Fantastic Four: First Steps gives the summer box office another $100M+ bump is $135.2M, which is -9% off from a year ago when Twisters opened to $81.2M.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The new stuff isn't really impressive. Paramount Animation's Smurfs is coming in at $12M, which is better than expected (there was a fear the blue guys and gal would get crushed in the high single digits). Again, it's an international and consumer products play. No one was going into this thinking they were going to re-invent the wheel and soar these grosses into some rebooted stratosphere. It's a very old property (gosh, 1980s?) sans the coolness of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The first movie in pre-streaming 2011 opened to $35.6M (and finaled at north of $142M+) — because at that time there had never been a Smurfs movie before. The movie cost a net $58M before P&A. The Rihanna-starring Smurfs gets a B+, which is the lowest CinemaScore in the series of four films to date. The previous one, The Lost Village, received the franchise's only A grade.

	











	There's a big reach on social with Smurfs at 309M across Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube with “Rihanna fully activated and cross-promoting her beauty brand, feeding 420M fans and pumping materials along with Nick Offerman at 3.4M fans with other cast not activated.” Rihanna has also been a trooper showing up to do extensive press at the pic's Belgian premiere and LA fan event.


	Definite recommend at 50% isn't a rush. Per Comscore/Screen Engine's PostTrak, 59% of the audience are parents with a child and mostly moms at 73%. Younger-skewing property for kids, as we told you and PostTrak shows that with 68% under 9 years old (47% between 7-9). Mostly girls here at 61%. Female leaning at 61%. Under 35 is 69%. Kids under 12 gave the movie an 80% positive, with a low 44% must-see right away. Grosses are evenly spread throughout the country but best in East, South and South Central. AMC MJ Harlem is the leading cinema stateside with close to $19K.


	Diversity demos are 47% Caucasian, 29% Latino and Hispanic, 13% Black, and 4% Asian American. 


	Despite any heralding of profit by Sony on I Know What You Did Last Summer with a net production cost of $18M, $13M-$14M opening isn't a win. It doesn't indicate any kind of revived interest in this '90s fave property. Some rivals are betting the movie comes in lower, like $12M, but the reboot 27 years later after its previous sequel is bound for the lowest opening in the theatrical pic franchise. That's not the grand B.O. plan when it comes to reviving these classic horror IPs. Sony was richer in their reboot of 28 Years Later debuting to $30M, and with a current running total of $68.7M. Snarked one film finance source about Summer, “It didn't feel like there was any stickiness in the marketing materials.”  Overall social media universe reach was 196.8M, which was even below Sinners‘ 222M and under the original M3GAN‘s 330M reach. In regards to CinemaScore, I Know What You Did Last Summer gets a C+, the lowest in the series next to the 1997 original's B-, and the 1998 sequel's B. Sure, a sequel can be pulled off at a low cost, but with a depreciating scale of grosses. 


	Says social media monitor RelishMix, “negative chatter on the new I Know What You Did Last Summer is filled with critiques and doubts. Since this feature-length revival comes not even four years after the television adaptation of the franchise, some are quick to judge its quality: ‘Looks like the TV series, which was awful,' and ‘This looks like a straight to streaming movie. It does not look like it was meant for the theater. It reminds me of the Scream TV show that aired on MTV.' Even the return of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. falls short of satisfying fans, ‘Bringing back aged old casts feels cliché. I just knew they would do this. Another movie that no one asked for. Original version always is better.'” 


	Low definite recommend on Summer at 43%. 50/50 male to female showed up. Demo breakdown is men over 25 (36%), female over 25 (30%), female under 25 (20%), and men under 25 (14%). Sixty-one percent 18-34 turnout. Even cash flow across the country, but South is the best. AMC Grove in LA is the highest cinema for the pic with just over $22K. Few PLFs on Summer since they're staying with the Man of Steel. 


	Ari Aster's Eddington gets a C+, which is the same grade as the director's Midsommar. Definite recommend on PostTrak is 39%. Aster loves being divisive. The opening now is at an estimated $4.8M after a first day/previews of $1.88M. Midsommar, a genre movie, posted a 3-day of $6.5M in what was a $10.9M 5-day start. Hereditary with a D+ CinemaScore remains Aster's best opening at $13.5M. The wow here given Eddington‘s mash-up of two genres –70s Altman comedy and Rambo— is that it's guns-a-blazing ahead of Aster and Joaquin Phoenix's previous partnership, Beau Is Afraid which died with a $2.66M semi-wide break at 965 theaters, and $8.1M domestic gross. Seriously, coming away from the pic's premiere at Cannes, the sentiment felt Eddington was destined for the B.O. nightmares of Beau Is Afraid (that VFX filled movie carried at net production cost of $35M; we've heard gross is as high as $50M). The movie is playing on the coasts, which is no surprise, with AMC Burbank the highest grossing venue for the movie with just over $21K. Demo breakdown is men over 25 (46%), women over 25 (27%), men under 25 (15%) and women under 25 (11%). 18-34 turnout is 60%. Who loves this movie? Per PostTrak 13-17 year olds (2% turnout, 80% grade) and 35-44 year olds (44% showed up, 79% positive grade). Diversity demos are 61% Caucasian, 18% Latino and Hispanic, 8% Black, and 8% Asian American.

FRIDAY PM: Not a gangbusters weekend, but solid enough to make exhibition content. Warner Bros/DC Studios' Superman is looking at $16M, -71%, in its second Friday, for what's looking to be a $55M second weekend at 4,275 theaters, for a decline on the high-end that's in the -56% realm. Worldwide all in by Sunday is looking like $400M. 


	Matt Reeves' The Batman fell -50% in weekend 2 for a $66.5M take, while James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 eased -56% for a $65.2M second weekend. On the high side, Superman will stand at $232.7M by Sunday end of day. 


	Standing strong above the new stuff in second is Universal's third weekend of Jurassic World Rebirth with $21.5M at 3,854. The Gareth Edwards directed movie dips -47% with a running cume by Sunday of $274.2M. 


	Columbia Pictures and Screen Gems I Know What You Did Last Summer is seeing just under $6M today for what's hoped to be a $13M-$15M opening at 3,206 sites. Rivals believe it's in a fight for third with Paramount Animation's Smurfs which is seeing $4M today at 3,504 locations, and a $12M 3-day. The last one under Sony, 2017's Smurfs: The Lost Village opened to $13.2M. Smurfs is a much younger skewing movie among kids under 12. The IP always does better abroad, and the upside for those studios getting involved with the property is the share of the merchandise revs.  Paramount Global is handling the consumer products licensing for the Smurfs in most international territories including North America. 


I Know What You Did Last Summer 1 back in 1997 opened to $15.8M, while party 2 in 1998 debuted to $16.5M. That's unadjusted for inflation. 


	Apple Original Films' F1 is seeing a fourth Friday of $2.6M at 3,094 theaters, and 3-day of $9.4M, -28%, for a running cume of $153.4M. 


	A24's Eddington at 2,111 sites is looking at $1.9M today and $4.5M for the weekend. That's under what another Cannes premiere, Wes Anderson's Phoenician Scheme, did in its wide break at 1,678, $6.2M at 1,678. Eddington cost $25M net shot with New Mexico tax credits, which is under the reported $30M that Focus Features shelled out for Phoenician Scheme. 


FRIDAY AM: Columbia Pictures and Screen Gems' reboot of I Know What You Did Last Summer banked $2.2 million in previews from showtimes that began at 2 p.m. Thursday, while A24's Ari Aster socio-political Western Eddington did $625,000.


	Neither film, nor Paramount Animation's Smurfs, is expected to over swell with Warner Bros/DC Studios' Superman still a fortress atop the box office chart with an expected second weekend of $55M-$60M, after the James Gunn movie ended its first week with $177.7M. Superman is pacing ahead of the first week of Matt Reeves' The Batman by 3% ($172.5M, final domestic $369.3M), 16% ahead of Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($152.7M first week, $359M final domestic) and 3% behind the first week of GOTG Vol. 2 ($183.1M, final domestic $389.3M).

	











I Know What You Did Last Summer is eyeing around $13M+, while Smurfs is anywhere in the high single digits to low teens. Eddington is expected to land in the under-$5M range.


	The Jennifer Kaytin Robinson-directed I Know What You Did Last Summer counts previews that are higher than Blumhouse/Universal's Wolf Man ($1.4M previews, $10.8M opening) from earlier this year, and 62% less than Sony's reboot of 28 Years Later ($5.8M previews, $30M opening). Critics have settled at 38% Rotten on I Know What You Did Last Summer while the Rotten Tomatoes audience meter is at 69%. That latter score is the best in franchise, ahead of the original 1997 installment at 41% and the 1998 sequel at 29%.


	The 1997 movie, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and the late Anne Heche, opened to $15.8M and legged out to $72.5M domestic, $125.5M worldwide. The 1998 sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer debuted to $16.5M and ended its run at $40M. The movies made $165M combined. The third movie, I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer starring Brooke Nevin, went direct to home video in 2006. The new installment features the return of Hewitt and Prinze Jr alongside newcomers Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers, Sarah Pidgeon and Gabbriette Bechtel.


Eddington‘s critical score stands at 66%, which is under the 90% certified fresh of Aster's horror opus Hereditary, and his Swedish solstice genre pic run amok Midsommar (83% certified fresh), and 2 points under his trippy Joaquin Phoenix pic Beau Is Afraid (68% fresh).


Smurfs didn't hold previews last night.


	The rest of the week:


	1.) Superman (WB) 4,135 theaters Thu $10.9M (-7% from Wed) Week $177.7M/Wk 1

Captain America 4, Thunderbolts and Fantastic Four combined might not even beat the total that Deadpool & Wolverine got by itself just last summer.

At the most, those 3 movies combined will make about $1.3 billion in theaters this year, compared to the $1.338 billion that Deadpool & Wolverine made.

And while Superman will end up higher than all 3 of the Marvel movies this year with about $600 million total, it is still a flop in theaters because of its budget and marketing.

4 superhero flops in one year is an absolute disaster!

Why Spider-Man and Batman movies have great appeal both in US and overseas while Superman just in the US?

Fantastic Four the First Family lol

Oy. As noted, this week now decently behind last year. Next week will continue. Even if FF is strong, it'll be nowhere close to Deadpool. Puts a lot of pressure on Bad Guys, Naked Gun, Freakier Friday and Weapons. Possible some of those perform well. Also possible…not. And that's just to keep pace with It Ends With Us and Alien: Romulus. Late August looks even more atrocious than last year unless those early ones overperforms and hold. A strong May boost met with a meh June…I'll be curious where the summer to summer comps end up after what was supposed to be the “best slate of summer releases” in years. I'm hopeful for some of those named above but worried: “What if this is as good as it gets?” anymore.

Pretty good hold for Superman and overall a decent result at the domestic BO.

The question is why international is massively underperforming compared to previous DC movies and Man of Steel specifically? In Germany it opened behind Jurassic World and F1 (!) and it's expected to fall to #4 this weekend behind Smurfs. I doubt anyone expected that.

	After he was accused of rape in April, Shannon Sharpe has reportedly settled the Jane Doe's civil lawsuit on undisclosed terms.


	The accuser's attorney Tony Buzbee announced Friday that the lawsuit will be dismissed now that they have “reached a mutually agreed upon resolution” with the 3x Super Bowl champion and sportscaster.


	“On April 20, 2025, The Buzbee Law Firm filed a complaint in Nevada making several allegations against Shannon Sharpe on behalf of our client,” wrote Buzbee on X. “Both sides acknowledge a long-term consensual and tumultuous relationship. After protracted and respectful negotiations, I'm pleased to announce that we have reached a mutually agreed upon resolution. All matters have now been addressed satisfactorily, and the matter is closed. The lawsuit will thus be dismissed with prejudice.”

	











	Following the April lawsuit, Sharpe denied the allegations and asserted that incidents of rape, choking and more in the 13-page civil suit are being taken out of context and were consensual. His attorney called the complaint a “blatant and cynical attempt to shake down Mr. Sharpe for millions of dollars.

	Attorneys for both sides confirmed that Sharpe had previously offered $10 million in attempt to convince the accuser not to file the lawsuit.

Narrator: It wasn't a lie.

10 millions settlement offer is outrageous for something that's supposed to be a lie.

Did you feel this way when Trump paid Stormy Daniels $130,000 but still denied having sex with her?

There's no way Disney takes him back. Paying his accuser to drop the suit is a terrible look.

Oh please, there's a convicted felon, who was also found liable for sexual abuse and defamation, in the White House. Sharpe isn't going anywhere

So all standards of decency are abandoned now? Does everyone get a pass for sexual assault?

Fact check: true.

SPOILERS: This post contains details about I Know What You Did Last Summer (2025)


	As I Know What You Did Last Summer slashes its way into a new generation, Jennifer Kaytin Robinson‘s requel has plenty of surprises in store for fans of the OG.


	The latest horror franchise to come back from the dead, amid the likes of Halloween and Scream, the followup to the 1997 slasher flick and its '98 sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer takes some big swings with its killer reveal, as well as some top-secret cameos that longtime fans will appreciate.


	With Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprising their roles from the previous two films as survivors and high school sweethearts Julie James and Ray Bronson, nostalgia was inevitably going to be a major factor in this new installment, which also boasts a young cast of new potential victims (and suspects), including Chase Sui Wonders, Madelyn Cline, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers and Sarah Pidgeon.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	In addition to several Easter eggs—including a freight elevator, a parade float, a steamy gym locker room and a Scooby Doo reference—the sequel keeps longtime fans hooked with a few massive twists.


	Read on for some major SPOILERS about I Know What You Did Last Summer (2025).


	“I am dead,” Sarah Michelle Gellar previously offered as a response to whether she'd reprise her role from the OG as Helen Shivers, following her family's set visit in Australia with husband and former co-star Prinze.

	











	A close friend of the director, it turns out Gellar was just playing coy about the fact that she makes a digitally de-aged cameo as Helen's snarky ghost in a dream sequence of the guilt-laden Danica Richards (Cline), a fellow former Croaker Queen. Her cameo follows some heavy references to the doomed beauty queen, including a visit to what was once Shivers Department Store.


	The moment earned a passionate response from the audience at the movie's world premiere this week in Los Angeles, and it's sure to have the same impact in theaters on opening weekend, ahead of Gellar's highly-anticipated return to Buffy the Vampire Slayer.


	Stick around for the credits, as a stinger brings back another survivor of the franchise, Brandy Norwood‘s Karla Wilson from the '98 Bahamian-set sequel, a cameo Robinson also teased.


	Reacting to the news of another vengeful massacre in Southport, North Carolina, Karla receives a menacing knock at the door. Could it be… Nick Fury? No, it's Julie warning her with another letter she received, along with a throwback photo of them, featuring a red X over Karla's face.


	With a couple of new ‘final girls' joining the franchise, Julie and Karla seem poised to team up against the remaining killer for another potential installment. 


	Following a pretty similar plot and format as writer Kevin Williamson and director Jim Gillespie's feature adaptation of Lois Duncan's 1973 novel, Robinson and co-writer Sam Lansky took a big swing with the reveal of their requel's killer, one that no other horror franchise has taken, at least in recent memory.


	Avenging the death of her spiritual peer and sober buddy, Pidgeon's Stevie Ward reveals in her big menacing monologue that she decided to take revenge on the group of former friends who covered up his death, after previously deserting her during her darkest days.


	What first seems heartbreaking for Ray, who is established as Stevie's employer and father figure, soon turns out to be an even more shocking reveal. Coming face to face with Julie, he confesses to guiding Stevie's murderous impulses to take revenge on the gentrified town that erased the trauma he endured (and for which he has apparently never sought help) nearly 30 years before.


	With Julie and Wonders' Ava Brooks defeating Ray, his homicidal protege is still out there and ready to take revenge in another installment.

	As summer at the box office heats up, MCU fans are sharing their first reactions to The Fantastic Four: First Steps.


	Following first screenings for the debut entry in Marvel Studios‘ Phase 6, which hits theaters July 24, audiences have praised the visual artistry, impeccable writing and performances from Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Julia Garner.


	On X, one fan called it “Quite possibly the best Marvel Studios film ever released. Absolutely loaded with talent and standout performances from Vanessa Kirby and Joseph Quinn. If you thought the MCU died with Endgame, think again. Thoughtfully crafted and easily a genre-defining classic.”

	Several fans praised the VFX of the movie, including the design of Julia Garner‘s Galactus. “#FantasticFour First Steps is visually one of the best things Marvel has ever made. Parts feel like Interstellar & demand IMAX,” wrote another fan. “Galactus is awesome. Silver Surfer looks really, really good. VFX were often immaculate. Cosmically and on Earth, Matt Shakman dropped a visual feast.”


	Others also noted their appreciation for the film's social and political commentary. “#FantasticFour is a triumph. A pitch-perfect script backed by great performances — particularly from Pedro Pascal — turns what could be a simple superhero movie into a sharp commentary on our society that makes its nuance palatable for those that may not take it at face value,” one person posted.

	Following James Gunn's DCU launch with Superman‘s $220 million opening weekend, Matt Shakman‘s The Fantastic Four: First Steps is tracking for a $100-110M opening. It's a needed win for Marvel Studios after several box office upsets in recent years.

	As David Corenswet takes on the red cape for James Gunn‘s Superman, DCU fans could still see Henry Cavill return in another role.


	The DC Studios boss recently said he “would love” to cast Cavill in his DCU as he recounted how he and co-chair Peter Safran broke the news to the “absolute gentleman” of an actor that he would no longer be playing Clark Kent in the franchise.


	“It's terrible. Believe it or not, the day we were dealing with trying to figure out if we could take the job at DC Studios,” recalled Gunn on the Happy Sad Confused podcast. “The day the deal closed, all of a sudden, they were announcing that Henry was back. And I was like, ‘What is going on? We know what the plan is. The plan was to come in and do Superman.' It was really unfair to him and a total bummer.”

	When he and Safran were tapped to co-head DC Studios in 2022, Gunn said, “There was a vacuum at the time and a lot of people were… They had a take on what they wanted to do at DC and they were trying to force their way and it was just never part of the equation for [WBD CEO] David Zaslav. We came in, and that was really unfortunate. I'm like, ‘This poor guy.'”


	Gunn and Safran then “sat down” with Cavill to break the news. “He was an absolute gentleman and a great guy about it,” recalled Gunn. “He said, ‘The only thing I ask is that I'm able to reveal it myself as opposed to coming from you guys.' And I'm like, ‘That's a class act.'”


	And although Corenswet has taken over as the Man of Steel, Cavill could still pop up in the new DCU. “I talked to him about it on that day. I would love to put Henry in something,” said Gunn.


	Since taking over DC Studios with Safran, Superman marks the first entry in his new DCU franchise, which begins with the ‘Gods and Monsters' phase.

Cavil is by far tne best superman since Reeve…..Gunn knows how to ruin good things

It's going to be a crap film anyways, so it's fine, Henrys reputation will stay intact.

They should have had him play Ultraman.  What a missed opportunity.

Summer 2026… Henry Cavill is super Batman!

Gunn will know what it feels like soon enough. Superman has cratered overseas and will likely only do around 35% or less of its worldwide tally from foreign box office. It is DOA.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","What the Smurf are we doing here?","https://www.avclub.com/smurfs-review","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

The Smurfs movies from over a decade ago finally learned to stay in their own animated world after three films, discarding their Alvin And The Chipmunks-style forays into live-action in favor of something suitably smaller-scale. But the Smurfs series came to a close just as Trolls was establishing a new sugar-rushed, pop-scored paradigm for outdated IP adaptations. So now, nearly a decade after that film came out, the Smurfs are back. Their new movie is both a knock-off of the lucrative musical from DreamWorks (which is where Smurfs director Chris Miller worked for most of his career) and of the lapsed trend of multiversal superhero fare. Caught between its cynical approaches to bygone zeitgeists, Smurfs can't decide how it wants to sell out.

While directed by Miller and written by Pam Brady (whose credits alternate between South Park projects and kiddie fare), it's Rihanna that emerges as the true auteur of Smurfs. Replacing Katy Perry and Demi Lovato in the pop-star-as-Smurfette role, Rihanna is the lead actor, producer (alongside her manager Jay Brown, and Roc Nation co-founder Ty Ty Smith), and contributor of original music. If any musical artist deserved an easy check for making dance-pop that copy-pasted cartoon character models could perform rote choreography to, it'd be Rihanna—at least, as opposed to Justin Timberlake.

But despite Rihanna's prominence in the film, and its former production title of The Smurfs Musical, Smurfs can't enjoy the simplicity that comes from being derivative of just one thing. Amid a cloying “I Want” song from James Corden, generic music-video sequences, and Rihanna needledrops, the film must needlessly complicate the quest of No Name Smurf (Corden) to figure out his “thing” through song. (“Carpool Karaoke Smurf” was taken, apparently.) To that end, Brady latches onto another concept that was floating around Hollywood about a decade ago: A team of heroes protecting the multiverse from villains who want to assemble a collection of magical color-coded MacGuffins.

The evil wizard Gargamel's evil wizard brother Razamel (both voiced by JP Karliak) seeks to find and antagonize the Smurfs not just for hatred's sake, but for a larger prize: a lost magical tome in a set of four, which grants control over the multiverse when wielded together. One of these infinity books has long been hidden in Smurf Village by Papa Smurf (John Goodman) and his brother Ken (Nick Offerman, who doesn't play Uncle Smurf, but whose Smurf has a regular human name for undisclosed reasons). There's another normally-named Smurf out there, Ron (Kurt Russell), who has a Thor-like mane of blond hair and a Captain America-style shield. Again, his name is not Ron Smurf, but just Ron. These three escort Smurfs to its superhero showdown finale, where the “Guardianeers Of Good” face down the dark magicians. 

As an afterthought, No Name Smurf gets a name and a “thing.” His name/thing is far less personality-driven than standbys like Vanity Smurf, Brainy Smurf, or Worry Smurf, but a bit more specific than Smurfette, whose thing has always been Girl. And yet, those single-word descriptions are about all the Smurfs have ever been able to handle.

When Smurfs focuses on its comic and cheapy Hanna-Barbera origins, the film is at least quietly hokey. Sure, the ugly character designs are facile and poorly integrated into the more detailed backgrounds. Sure, the jokes are still riddled with middle-aged screenwriter gags about Zoom calls, podcasting, emails going to spam, and LinkedIn. And sure, every other line of dialogue replaces profanity with the word “Smurf,” a long-running bit so beaten and bloodied that—when the film actually begins bleeping out words to make the connection more explicit—it almost circles back around to surreally entertaining. But that's Smurfs. That's all these vaguely familiar 70-year-old pop cultural artifacts have to offer.

When Smurfs strives for more, when it uses magic portals to travel to Paris and Munich and the Outback (where it introduces Natasha Lyonne cashing a check as something called a Snooterpoot), its sweaty chintziness gives way to exhaustion. At least, over the course of the film's interdimensional travel, Paramount Animation introduces a few different art styles to relieve audiences of the core aesthetic and incessant plotting. Thirty blissful seconds flitting between claymation, 8-bit, and anime are an oasis. But then the film gets back on track, and the water turns to sand in your mouth, revealed as a mirage. 

Where the Smurf are we? How the Smurf did we get here? What the Smurf are we doing? These questions use “Smurf” as a catch-all stand-in, shaped around something unsavory yet immediately recognizable to make it more palatable to a large audience. Smurfs does the same thing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","James Gunn says there were massive arguments over whether to call Superman a pussy","https://www.avclub.com/superman-james-gunn-guy-gardner-wuss","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 02:28:00 GMT","

Is Superman a pussy? Enlightened minds may disagree!

This, per an interview that Superman writer/director/producer/all-purpose PR man James Gunn gave to Josh Horowitz's Happy Sad Confused podcast this week, marking something like the end of his press tour odyssey promoting the film. Gunn, never the most taciturn guy, spoke openly about the battles waged while making the film—including what was apparently a pretty epic back-and-forth over whether Nathan Fillion's Guy Gardner would end up telling David Corenswet's Man Of Steel “Don't be such a pussy” at a key moment in the script. (In the finished film, Fillion says “wuss,” instead.)

Gunn describes the arguments that broke out over the word—which would have had Corenswet's Big Blue Boyscout chastise Gardner for the harsh language, apparently provoking a massive laugh from test audiences—as the biggest of the fights that came up during the movie's extensive edits. (The second-biggest: The decision of how to resolve one of the movie's weirder plotlines, Jimmy Olsen's reluctant rekindling of a relationship with selfie-shooting whistleblower Eve; Skyler Gisondo was reportedly asked to deploy a whole range of facial expressions when reacting to Sara Simpaio hugging him at the end of the movie, from happy acceptance to “staring into the void.”) Gunn mostly seems amused by the debates, but also makes it clear that they were real, genuine arguments. (See also a fight about whether to showcase Superman saving a squirrel in the midst of a massive kaiju fight; some people in test audiences really did not like the squirrel rescue.)

﻿

But while he mostly restrained himself to comments about the movie itself—including jokingly referring to Corenswet as his personal Krypto and “prodigal son,” after he and the actor went back and forth frequently over how to handle certain pivotal scenes—Gunn did venture into a bit of wider DC drama. Most interestingly, that includes addressing the moment when he and fellow DC Studios head Peter Safran had to bring Henry Cavill in to tell him he wasn't Superman anymore. Which was a conversation made a lot more awkward by the fact that Cavill had, literally on the day that Gunn and Safran had closed their deals to take over the studio (with a plan for a fresh, younger Superman in their pockets) stated on social media that he'd been given the green light by Warner Bros. to say he was coming back to the character after a multi-year absence. (Gunn, a diplomat, never mentions Black Adam star Dwayne Johnson by name here, but does note, with a wry expression, that there was a “vacuum” at Warner Bros. that meant certain people were trying to “force their way.”) Gunn calls the whole thing a “bummer” for Cavill, and reiterates what was said back in 2022, i.e., that he'd love to cast the actor somewhere else in the wider DCU.

As we've noted before, one of the genuinely enjoyable things about Gunn being in such a position of power at the moment is that he's even freer to speak his mind than usual, and the HSC interview is a great example of how candid the man can get. (He claims to have genuinely not noticed any parallels between Superman's travails at the hands of internet trolls and his own well-documented ones, for instance, and details a scene so darkly funny, between Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor and Zlatko Burić's Vasil Ghurkos, that he knew it had to be cut basically as soon as he saw it in the edits—but still can't help but break down laughing as he describes it.)

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Judge shuts down Prime Video ads lawsuit for good","https://www.avclub.com/judge-shuts-down-amazon-prime-video-ads-class-action-suit","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 00:52:00 GMT","

A judge has just dismissed, with prejudice, a class action lawsuit brought against Amazon's Prime Video streamer, alleging that the sudden addition of ads to the service's video content last year constituted an illegal stealth price increase. U.S. District Judge Barbara J. Rothstein has now rejected this claim, saying—and we're going to go ahead and paraphrase here—that there's an important legal distinction between actually raising the price of a thing, and just making the original thing shittier, while offering to let consumers pay you more to get the nicer thing they were getting before.

All of this stems, obviously, from Amazon's decision, early last year, to begin defaulting its Prime Video customers to an ad-supported tier of video streaming, with a $3 per month opt-in for those hoping to avoid the commercials. This kicked off a wave of angry protests, notably from annual Amazon Prime subscribers, who argued that by taking one of the benefits of their subscription and sticking it behind a $36-per-year paywall, Amazon had functionally raised the price on them mid-subscription, which Prime Video's own terms says it can't do.

Judge Rothstein disagreed—and has, in fact, disagreed a couple of times already, which might account for the testy tone of the legal decision she handed down this week. Noting that she's already told the plaintiffs in this case the same thing in two previously dismissed filings that ran on very slight variations on the initial argument, Rothstein lays out her binding legal opinion that the addition of ads wasn't a price increase, but a change to benefits—and that the Prime and Prime Video terms that subscribers agree to grant Amazon as much leeway as it wants to fuck with said benefits. (Again, paraphrasing.) Quoting herself (from an earlier decision that seems to have a bit less pique behind it), Rothstein acknowledges that the net effect on customers' wallets of avoiding the ads might be the same as a price raise. But everybody who signs up for Prime Video enters into a contract that grants Amazon the ability to do pretty much anything it wants to its offered benefits, and nobody can say bupkus. It can't be a deceptive practice, she argues, if you clicked the little box saying you agreed to the terms.

Anyway, the suit—which has been running, in its various forms, for a bit more than a year at this point—has now been dismissed with prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs are no longer allowed to amend it to try to take another swing.

Winning isn't everything, and in the case of one “Dancing With the Stars” runner-up, he's actually glad he didn't take home the Mirrorball Trophy. Find out why “DWTS” season 27 contestant Milo Manheim is fine with second place.

Manheim and his “DWTS” season 27 dance pro partner Witney Carson came in second, but he wasn't too torn up about losing.

During a July 2025 appearance on “The Zach Sang Show,” Manheim was asked if he's “haunted” by the loss. “To be honest, I feel like getting second place worked out in my favor because I'm reminded to this day that I was robbed,” he shared.

The “Zombie” star continued, “People come up all the time now and they're just like, ‘You killed ‘Dancing with the Stars.' And I don't think I would be getting that validation had I won.”

Manheim added, “So it's really nice.”

He also addressed how the “DWTS” voting system changed after his loss to Bobby Bones, who scored lower than Manheim.

“I will say that I was grateful that they changed the voting system after that year,” the actor noted. “So the fact that I was able to make them look at the system a little bit, that's the best thing I could have possibly hoped for.”

A post shared by Milo (@milomanheim)

Manheim has discussed his “Zombies” co-star Chandler Kinney coming in third place during “DWTS” season 33.

“I wasn't even worried for Chandler. I was like, ‘All right, she's going to avenge me.' And then, same thing happened to her. I mean, I don't want to say rigged 'cause it's not rigged. I'm not saying that.”

He added, “But I will say, I don't know, maybe it's just bias, but Chandler killed that thing and we just know how amazing she is at dancing.”

In a July 2025 interview with Us Weekly, Manheim gave his take on a possible curse. “You know the ‘Zombies' curse on ‘Dancing With the Stars' is we're always going to be runner-up,” he said.

As for the “Zombies” co-stars he would love to see take a spin on “DWTS,” the actor shared, “I would either send Meg [Donnelly] if she wanted to do it because [she] would redeem it for all of us and go win, or I would love to see Trevor [Tordjman]. Not even because he's a good dancer — because he is a fantastic dancer — but because of who he is. I think he would just kill.”

Ruffalo was seen sitting at a table while she wiped happy tears from her eyes. A band played being her as her diamond ring was very prominently on display.

The two started dating in 2022. Ruffalo works as a meteorologist for ABC7 in Los Angeles, according to PEOPLE.

Before Lucas met Ruffalo, he was married to Jessica Clencin Henriquez from 2012 to 2014. The two share a son, Noah, together.

Lucas commented in March 2018 that both he and Henriquez are committed to coparenting their son.

“We are both totally committed to raising our son and being in love with our son,” Lucas said at the time.

My goodness, Katy Perry pulled a Beyoncé! Remember when Queen Bey had that terrifying moment on her Cowboy Carter tour in Houston? During her “16 Carriages” performance, she was riding a red aerial car that tilted a bit too far to the left. 

Basically, the machine froze mid-air, and Beyoncé, ever the pro as she always is, reassured fans by joking, “If ever I fall, I know y'all call me.” This after the whole ordeal had occurred, and she was probably hyperventilating inside, of course. Still, iconic behavior if you ask us! 

Well, now it's Perry's turn, who tore a page right out of her book.

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

The “Roar” singer gave fans quite a scare on July 18 during her performance at the Chase Center in San Francisco. While singing her hit “Eye of the Tiger,” Perry took flight over the crowd on a massive butterfly prop. It was supposed to be a magical moment for everyone, until it wasn't.

Mid-performance, the butterfly suddenly dropped several inches, throwing Perry off balance. Fans could see the panic on her face as she clung on, yelling to the crowd, “Sing it now. Sing it!” Her voice broke off as the prop malfunctioned in real-time, which quickly caused a wave of gasps throughout the arena.

For a second, it looked like the entire setup might collapse, which even gave US a fright, despite it already having happened and it only being a video. But thankfully, the safety wires caught just in time. Still visibly shaken, Katy glanced at the crowd as if she was yelling, “Did you just see that?” The stunned audience responded with a mix of shocked silence and loud cheering as she regained her composure and continued singing.

Later that night, Perry took to Instagram to poke fun at the situation. She posted a candid screenshot of herself mid-scream with the caption, “Goodnight San Fran,” on her Instagram Stories. Classic Perry!

According to Page Six, a source confirmed she only sustained a minor bump and was otherwise fine. “She paused slightly but then kept singing, almost never missing a beat,” the insider shared.

The show marked one of the biggest stops on her Lifetime's North America Run, a tour that's already been making headlines for its chaotic and unpredictable stage elements. We're talking astronauts, sharks, lightsabers, yes, basically a fever dream in concert form. But let's be real, that's peak Perry. Over-the-top is her brand, and we kind of love her for it!

Perry has been having a few hard days after her longtime partner Orlando Bloom recently announced their separation. The pair began dating in 2016, on and off, and share a 4-year-old daughter, Daisy. While their romantic chapter has ended, both emphasized their commitment to co-parenting amicably and keeping Daisy their top priority.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Legendary Rock Band Tops Carrie Underwood's Dream Tour Bucket List","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/carrie-underwood-tour-guns-n-roses/","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 15:48:29 GMT","

Carrie Underwood has achieved stratospheric success since winning “American Idol,” but she still wants to check off some career bucket list items. Underwood shares her top three career highlights and says Guns N' Roses tops her dream tour list.

A post shared by SiriusXM (@siriusxm)

During a July 2025 interview with SiriusXM's Cody Alan, Underwood named “winning ‘American Idol'” as the top of her list of career moments. The singer's season 4 win launched her career, so it's not surprising that's her number 1 pick.

The country star said “becoming a Grand Ole Opry member” was next, and rounded out her top 3 with “being at Stagecoach [Festival] and getting to call Axl Rose out on stage.”

“It was something that I had been hoping for forever,” Underwood added.

The “American Idol” alum is a loyal GN'R fan who also opened for the band several times in 2023.

When asked who is on her bucket list to record with, she said, “I've gotten to sing with them, but I would love to record something with Guns N' Roses. That would be really cool.”

She was also asked, “If you could go on tour with one band, who would that be?” Underwood answered with a grin, “Who do you think?”

A post shared by Carrie Underwood (@carrieunderwood)

In a 2022 interview with Rolling Stone, Underwood shared what it was like to share the stage with Axl Rose to sing “Paradise City” and “Sweet Child o' Mine” at Stagecoach.

“I've been covering Guns N' Roses my whole life, pretty much, and definitely onstage for the past 15 years at least,” Underwood said at the time. 

She continued, “I had asked before if he would ever come sing, or if I could come to him somewhere. We had a couple almost maybes, where it almost maybe would have happened but for various reasons it wasn't the right time.”

Underwood sent Rose an email explaining “the why and what he meant to me” ahead of Stagecoach.

She explained, “The way I learned how to sing was I would pick really hard vocalists to try to emulate, and [Rose's] voice always mesmerized me. I was like, ‘How is he doing the things that he's doing?' So I told him all that … and he came!”

Underwood added, “We had rehearsals and everything went very smoothly. It was easy for all of us to be around each other. Hopefully, he had a good time.”

In May 2023, Underwood told Howard Stern, “I've been a fan [of GN'R] since almost birth.”

Of Rose, she noted, “His voice is something that just cut through the air to me … he didn't sound like everybody else and sometimes it wasn't pretty [because] that's not what the song was meant for. He was willing to, you know, get into the song and do what the song needed.”

On Friday nights, IndieWire After Dark honors fringe cinema in the streaming age with midnight movies from any moment in film history.

First, the BAIT: a weird genre pick and why we're exploring its specific niche right now. Then, the BITE: a spoiler-filled answer to the all-important question, “Is this old cult classic actually worth recommending?”

Warning: The following contains spoilers for “I Know What You Did Last Summer” (2025)
 










I genuinely want to know if anyone warned Jack Black about the post-credits scene in the new “I Know What You Did Last Summer.” He's not in it, but it's sure to draw attention to a mostly forgotten misfire from much earlier in the “Minecraft Movie” actor's career. 

Related Stories What Made Ari Aster Laugh Hard? The Song He Wanted Pedro Pascal to Play at His ‘Eddington' BBQ It's Not Too Late to Get on the Zarna Garg Train, as the Self-Made Star Just Keeps Going 

Black was 29 years old when he played Titus Telesco, a white Bahamian pool boy with a weed habit and dreads. Director Danny Cannon's 1998 sequel “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” was critically panned, and even diehard horror fans forget about the slasher series' zany second chapter. It's an expansion on the original story, set at a resort on a stormy island, that reunites final girl Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) with her love interest Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.) on screen one year after killer fisherman Ben Willis unleashed the Southport massacre. 

 










Their undergrad happiness ends when school breaks for summer. Julie and her best friend Karla Wilson (Brandy) win tickets to the Bahamas on the radio, but Ray won't come along because he has a job back home. The audience knows Freddie Prinze Charming will end up following Julie on vacation to propose marriage, but she'll complicate matters by finding a second suitor in her handsome classmate, Will Benson (Matthew Settle). 

Trapped inside a creepy resort by the weather, the twenty-somethings brew enough drama between them to fuel a dramatic feature. But when a new masked villain — once again donning a fisherman's hook, harpoon, and raincoat — starts terrorizing guests and locals, a note arrives for Julie with the hilarious message, “I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.” Translation? Someone still wants revenge for the hit-and-run accident in the first film. 

The original director Jim Gillespie stepped aside for Cannon on the sequel, and “Scream” genius Kevin Williamson handed his characters over to screenwriter Trey Callaway with mixed results. Still, the mediocre sequel has fresh wind in its sails thanks to director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson's sequel/reboot, which once again brings together Hewitt, Prinze, and several other familiar cast members in theaters. 

 










“I was watching you on the news, and you can't catch a damn break,” says Karla, after answering a surprise knock on her door near the requel's end. Better known in the movie world as Cinderella, Brandy made her genre debut in Cannon's slasher and she carries the hope of more “I Know What You Did Last Summer” sequels with her cameo in 2025. (The R&B pop sensation has only been in one other genre film, last year's profoundly hate-able “The Front Room” for A24.) 

“It isn't over,” says Julie, holding up a picture of the girls from college. 

Karla wastes no time fishing. She asks, “Who are we fucking up this time?” 

Nothing in “I Know What You Did Last Summer” (2025) technically qualifies as revisionist history, but the events of the earlier sequel are kept out of focus until this reunion. The spirit of that post-credits scene doesn't exactly line up with the movie it references (Brandy gets sidelined in the 1998 sequel more than I want to admit), but you should watch it for yourself. 

Sometimes painfully awkward but also wonderfully delusional, “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” opens with a scary dream in a Catholic confessional and goes sideways from there. Julie is wracked with guilt, but not even the ill-advised character Black plays should feel bad about this mostly harmless stinker of a movie — an artifact that shouldn't inspire nostalgia but… does?

 










Hinging on your knowledge of Brazilian geography (I swear to God), this violent maritime puzzle combines a silly whodunit with a shallow story that isn't as satisfying as the first film. That said, what it lacks in function it makes up for with a string of baffling creative decisions that are truly something to behold. Black's drug dealer character is the setting sun on that whacko horizon, doomed to die based on… well, everything about him… but he's on screen just long enough to ruin a jacuzzi makeout for Karla and her boyfriend, Ty (Mekhi Phifer). You'll be as annoyed as they are when Titus overstays his welcome, and his death is almost too dorky to take. But there's just something about him — floating in a pool, joint in his mouth, mysterious new fisherman lurking nearby — that people tend to like. 

Sure, Black is playing on dated archetypes in a movie that regrettably also includes a messy subplot about voodoo. (It's fine. You can ignore it. I give you permission.) But whether Black got that warning about the post-credits in the new requel or not, this particular performance coming back to haunt him really screams, “I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.” 

“I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” is now available to rent or buy on most platforms.
 










My critical opinion on the wildly divisive “Halloween Kills” from 2021 has waxed and waned over the years. But I maintain that too many of us fail to catch the intricate little details that make the best reboots that are specific to legacy sequels. 

No one remembers “Halloween II” like they remember the original “Halloween,” and even less can be said for fans of “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” compared to Gillespie's 1997 film. It makes sense that Easter eggs referencing follow-up movies many people haven't seen would fly over the casual viewer's head. But rewatching the “I Know What You Did Last Summer” sequel from 27 years ago, after having just seen the requel out this weekend, you gain a stronger appreciation for the homage as your commitment to the franchise deepens. 

In other words, you and Ray should've gotten your asses to the Bahamas long ago. (Yes, I am aware that the film was largely shot off the coast of Mexico. No one asked you.) 

From slapstick mannequin fake-outs to a Sarah Michelle Gellar cameo that could control tides, “I Know What You Did Last Summer” (2025) sets up the potential for a modern franchise that hasn't been confirmed but is fun to imagine. The requel ignores the events of the far lesser second sequel — the direct-to-video “I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer” from 2006  — and treats the history of Southport as a duology. 

 










There's no way you would know that going in, but if I have one regret looking back on my “B+” review of the new release, it's that I didn't recommend “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” strongly enough. There's plenty to be said about the emotional insight it offers fans into the dark romance of eventual divorcees, Julie and Ray. But it also draws out the vibrant goofiness that makes these movies' most devoted fans accept the arrival of a ghost on a beauty pageant float with a smile.

When Titus finally meets his demise, he's hitting a bong and the Fisherman pins his hand to the coffee table with a hook. As the murderer searches for another weapon, his victim squawks, “No! Seriously! Don't do that!” Caught somewhere between a stoner from the “School of Rock” and Kung Fu Panda on a tropical bender, Black is hilarious and decidedly camp. 

“I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” isn't very good, but the original isn't either. Gillespie directed Williamson's script (which was an intentional step away from horror comedy after “Scream”) as a melodrama. The property became beloved precisely because it lacked self-awareness in a way that audiences could laugh about. “I Know What You Did Last Summer” (2025) shares that sense of humor too, and if the series does continue, I hope they find a way to resurrect the spirit of Titus… even if Black shies away from a ghost cameo laced with THC.

It appears that Tyler, the Creator is gearing up for something big. The musician has been posting about July 21, and, outside his concert tonight at Barclays Center, in Brooklyn, New York, there was a large Tyler-like figure in a box that said “DON'T TAP THE GLASS.” Digital signage on the arena also promoted the website DontTapTheGlass.com. From there, fans can click through to the Golf Wang website, where vinyl records, CDs, and box sets are available to purchase. Everything ships on Monday, July 21.

Beyond the links to order merchandise, the Don't Tap the Glass website has three directives:

Tyler, the Creator has not shared much in the way of new music or videos since releasing Chromakopia last October. He posted “That Guy,” a freestyle on the beat for Kendrick Lamar's “Hey Now,” on Christmas, and he also teased a “Sticky” video that many fans are still hoping gets released in full. More recently, he featured on Clipse's Let God Sort Em Out cut “P.O.V.”

For the most part, Tyler, the Creator has been busy on his tour in support of Chromakopia. The tour began in February, and he's nearly wrapped up the second North American leg. He's still due to headline festivals (including Lollapalooza and Outside Lands) amid his traditional tour dates. He heads to the Southern Hemisphere in August for dates in New Zealand and Australia, and he'll close the tour in September with concerts in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines. See Tyler, the Creator's upcoming schedule below.

The First Family: Live at the Winchester Cathedral 1967 shows Sly and the Family Stone as a killer soul band on the cusp of developing the pungently progressive style that would make them one of the most vital acts of the hippie era. This is the band that debuted with 1967's A Whole New Thing—stylistically tricky enough that it's clear why Epic Records got dollar signs in their eyes during the Bay Area's psychedelic '60s, but not quite the laboratory of genius the group would become on the following year's Dance to the Music. Taped seven months before the release of A Whole New Thing, the live recording features just one original, opener “I Ain't Got Nobody (For Real),” which would show up on Dance to the Music. The rest are contemporary soul covers the audience might've recognized, some of them very fresh to the charts at the time.

The stakes are high for this release: This is the first archival Sly release following his death in June at the age of 82. These recordings have been cherished by fans ever since the tapes began floating around in 2002, and snippets showed up in Questlove's Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius) documentary from earlier this year, but anyone hoping for a revelatory postmortem opening of the floodgates should adjust their expectations.

Better to understand The First Family in the context of what High Moon Recordings has been doing for quite some time—unearthing high-quality rarities from the hippie era, most auspiciously Love's lost '70s album Black Beauty. The First Family comes with a lovely booklet that reveals much about the Family Stone's pre-Dance to the Music early days, opening with the disclaimer that “the story of the Winchester Tapes does not concern the creative spurt that came once Sly & the Family Stone ascended the charts and crossed over into the consciousness of music fans the world over.”

But the audience can't see into the future, and at a show like this—and at a time when popular music was only just starting to be taken seriously as high art—the audience is ultimately what matters. “In church, this goes on,” Sly says in one of the interviews included with the booklet. “If you're talking about something and people will feel it, then boom, everybody claps right on time, it's unbelievable.”

The Stone (né Stewart) family belonged to the Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal denomination whose influence on Christian music has been incalculable. Artists with COGIC roots include Sister Rosetta Tharpe, CCM legend Andraé Crouch, and the Winans gospel dynasty. Sly and his siblings Freddie, Rose, and Vet grew up singing in church, and so strong was the link between the church and Black pop that even secular performers at the time were said to be “holding church” during performances.

These literal and metaphorical definitions of communion blend together on The First Family in a performance lusty enough to make room for a cartoon-wolf version of Junior Walker's “Pucker Up Buttercup” but otherwise fitting Sly's definition of “church” to a T. Given the level of energy on display, it seems incredible that this was a seated show, let alone that people weren't ripping their chairs out of their seats during a dazzling stop-and-start rendition of Ben E. King's “What Is Soul?” that's the heart and centerpiece of this disc. It seems even more incredible that the song was only two weeks old at the time, but as Sly's beloved Beatles taught us, there's nothing like a grueling residency to coax the flowering of genius.

One of the most crucial differences between this Family and the one most people know is that Sly's sister Rose hadn't joined yet. Her exuberant vocals are crucial to the communal feeling that made the Family feel so much like a family on record, even deep in Sly's despondent solo-auteur period during the '70s. If you want to present yourself as a utopian community, it's best to have as many voices joining in as possible, and Rose and Sly's interplay was essential to the all-hands-on-deck spirit that made Dance to the Music and its deliriously goofy follow-up Life so exciting.

On The First Family, the communal aspect comes instead from the audience, which can be heard clapping and voicing approval, and which seems especially jazzed about their eight-minute rendition of “Baby I Need Your Loving,” a 1964 Four Tops single whose cover by white rocker Johnny Rivers had entered the charts less than two months before. Funnily enough, Rivers claims to have auditioned Sly on bass for his band, but Sly didn't show up until the gig was already over—an early instance of a pattern of belated arrivals and no-shows from the singer that frustrated collaborators and crowds throughout his career.

The sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. The drums are way up in the mix, which is great when you're trying to hear what drummer and inexhaustible sample source Greg Errico is doing, but not so great when you're trying to hear Sly sing. To be fair, though, it doesn't sound that much worse than the shambolic Fillmore tapes recorded 18 months later, which include a version of “St. James Infirmary Blues” that's almost identical to the one here. Unlike Bay Area contemporaries Quicksilver Messenger Service and the Grateful Dead, this is not a band whose live recordings you need to seek out to get the full picture.

What The First Family does do well is situate the listener in a time and place that seems galaxies away from the one the Beatles would birth two months later when they put out Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. This was a world that prioritized skill over inspiration, where bands had to learn the latest hits to keep the crowd happy and got paid handsomely enough to master them on short notice. It might seem like a quaint world today, but tell that to the crowd at the Winchester Cathedral, itching to burst out of their seats.

							By 

	Miles Klee



Donald Trump is sick of fielding questions about Jeffrey Epstein. But his efforts to quash lingering interest in the case of the late sex offender by downplaying it as some kind of “hoax” perpetrated by political enemies including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have failed to satisfy MAGA diehards who want the White House to release bombshell materials implicating powerful elites in Epstein's crimes, or evidence that he was killed in his jail cell in 2019 to protect those same people.


	It's a crisis of the administration's own making. While Trump had been fairly noncommittal on the campaign trail when asked whether he would declassify files related to Epstein, he then appointed conspiracists Kash Patel and Dan Bongino to lead the FBI, empowering them to investigate their wildest theories. Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, hyped a drop of Epstein documents in February, and had them distributed in binders to various right-wing influencers — but it turned out these pages were already public. The backlash was intense, though nothing compared to the furor that followed a memo from the FBI and Justice Department earlier this month, which stated that investigators had found no trace of an Epstein “client list” and concluded, once again, that he had died by suicide.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	These claims were unacceptable to Trump supporters grown frenzied on years of baseless speculation about the circumstances of Epstein's death and promises to expose his associates. Suddenly, the president was saying that the financier — his former friend — was old news and irrelevant. And while his loyalists are usually forgiving of his indifference to their expectations, it appears that this time, they're not willing to be brushed off. It certainly hasn't helped that Trump's frustrations led him to directly attack his base for caring about “bullshit,” saying that “some stupid Republicans” are stubbornly keeping the story alive. Those insults have fueled further outrage from the biggest names demanding transparency around Epstein and questioning why Trump has tried to move on.

	The white nationalist troll did not hold back after Trump wrote on Truth Social that he didn't want the support of “weaklings” convinced that the government is withholding information on Epstein and those linked to him. “Fuck you,” Fuentes said on a livestream this week, calling Trump “fat,” “stupid,” and “a joke.” He said he had never been this critical of the president before. “This entire thing has been a scam,” he declared. “We're gonna look back at MAGA movement as the biggest scam in American history.”  


	Far-right podcaster Matt Walsh was among those commentators specifically calling for Bondi to lose her job over her botched handling of Epstein disclosures — and expressing frustration that Trump had defended her. “So the Epstein Files are a ‘dumb hoax' and yet the Attorney General who deliberately peddled this ‘dumb hoax' is doing a great job, won't be fired, and we should stop criticizing her?” he complained on X. “Someone make sense of this for me.”


	Owens, a conservative influencer, called Trump's attempt to spin the Epstein files as something fabricated by Obama and other Democrats “outright embarrassing” in a post on X. She called the scandal “terminal cancer” for the MAGA movement during an episode of her podcast, accusing Trump of “gaslighting the public” and regarding his base as “stupid.” Owens also vowed not to let go of the issue. “I will be the very last person that will stop talking about Jeffrey Epstein,” she said.


	At times a close confidante of the president, the far-right activist has repeatedly attacked Bondi throughout the fracas over Epstein while seeming to defend Trump. On Wednesday, she cautioned in an interview that the fallout could “consume” his presidency. Loomer has noted that Trump's posts about Epstein are only drawing more attention to the subject, which she said on X is “not going away.” She is advocating for the appointment of a special counsel to deal with this “distraction.”

	Like Loomer, longtime conservative commentator Glenn Beck appeared to reserve most of his ire for Bondi. “Pam Bondi should resign — not because of a cover-up, but for incompetence,” he wrote on X, arguing that the Justice Department had screwed up by releasing security footage from a Manhattan jail that showed Epstein being escorted to his cell that did not provide a view of the cell itself. “This isn't about whether Epstein killed himself or not,” he continued. “What matters more is REAL transparency and justice.”

	











	The Dilbert cartoonist and Trump supporter was, like many others, unpersuaded when the president tried to deflect blame for uproar at the DOJ memo to Obama, Clinton, and others. “The new ass-covering story is the Epstein files were ‘made up' by Democrats,” he wrote on X. “I expect better bullshit from my president.”


	Trump's biggest megadonor in the 2024 election cycle publicly accused Trump of burying the Epstein files to protect himself after their relationship blew up in spectacular fashion, with Musk then announcing he would launch a new political party. The billionaire later deleted and apologized for those posts but has continued to hammer the administration for failing to prosecute anyone connected to Epstein besides Ghislaine Maxwell. “Wow I can't believe Epstein killed himself before realizing it was all a hoax,” he posted sarcastically on X on Thursday.


	Despite his large body of work as a MAGA sycophant, YouTuber Benny Johnson couldn't swallow Trump's logically torturous explanations of why his backers should just forget about Epstein. In a clip where he struggled to parse a Trump post on Truth Social, he fretted over the narrative the president was weaving. “By admitting that the Epstein Files are real, and that you've read them, and you don't like their contents, and they were written by your enemies, it doesn't make the most compelling case as far as I'm concerned,” he said. “Holy moly.” 


	Kirk was one of several right-wing pundits to indicate that he might back off of the Epstein story, having reportedly fielded a call from Trump himself on the matter. Only a day later, however, he devoted a podcast episode to questions around Epstein, arguing that the administration had to disclose more details of the case if it wanted to move on.


	The beanie-wearing podcaster who, along with Benny Johnson, was revealed last year to have accepted money from a company fronting for a Russian influence campaign, did not appreciate Trump's dismissal of Epstein truthers. “Donald Trump says the people that are interested in the Jeffrey Epstein inquiry are bad people,” Pool said on his show. “He said only bad people and the fake news are interested in the Jeffrey Epstein inquiry. I guess that puts me in the category of ‘bad people.'”


	Trump has even been taking hits from his allies in congress, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. “We should put everything out there and let the people decide,” he said in an interview, insisting that he is “for transparency.” Yet when Democrats in the House forced a procedural vote on an a legislative amendment that would have permitted congress to vote on whether to compel the Justice Department to unseal documents related to Epstein, he and other Republicans blocked it.  

	











	The GOP representative from Tennessee echoed some of the more extreme rhetoric heard from conspiracy theorists talking about the potential prosecutions of Epstein's supposed clients. “Find them guilty and hang them, publicly,” he said in a televised interview. He followed up by confirming that he doesn't believe what the Justice Department has said about the case. “I don't trust them,” he said. Burchett further called on the House Committe on Oversight and Reform to hear public testimony from Ghislaine Maxwell.


	“Of course we want answers,” the Colorado representative said in an interview about Epstein. “No one is satisfied with what has been received, or lack thereof.” She called for a special investigation into the handling of the relevant materials, suggesting that former congressman Matt Gaetz could be appointed as special counsel. The idea seemed a somewhat trollish in the context of questions about a notorious pedophile: before his exit from congress and the withdrawal of his nomination to serve as attorney general, a House Ethics Committee probe found that Gaetz had violated a statutory rape law when he paid a 17-year-old for sex in 2017.


	The Georgia representative, well known for amplifying right-wing conspiracy theories, announced Wednesday that she would co-sponsor a discharge petition on a House vote about releasing the Epstein files from libertarian-leaning Rep. Thomas Massie, who has regularly broken with Trump. “I will never protect pedophiles or the elites and their circles,” she posted on X when she shared Massie's resolution.


	Better known as the Hodgetwins, this conservative comedy and commentary duo registered their disgust at the administration's closing of the Epstein inquiry in a blunt X post. “Telling people to just get over the Epstein files = protecting pedophiles,” they wrote. “There is no other way to put it.”


	The right-wing content creator indicated that a failure to disclose more information on Epstein's dealings could come with electoral consequences for the GOP. “I honestly have no interest in voting in the 2026 midterms if Republicans have no interest in revealing the truth about Jeffrey Epstein,” he warned the party on X.


	The pseudonymous MAGA shitposter didn't go as far as attacking his beloved president, though he did join the ranks of those calling on Bondi to fix the Epstein mess. “It's amazing to me that Pam Bondi still hasn't done a news conference over her decisions on  Epstein,” he fumed on X on Monday. “It's her responsibility to explain her decisions and answer questions,  not surrogates.” He also called her “delusional” for trying to duck the topic.  


	The one-time Pizzagate promoter, who was a participant in Bondi's binder debacle in February, took a page out of Trump's playbook in seeking to paint one of the president's enemies as somehow involved in an Epstein coverup. Referring to an initial FBI investigation into the financier that ended without federal prosecution and Epstein pleading guilty to state prostitution charges in Florida, Posobiec in an X post alleged, “After Epstein gave information to the FBI, federal charges were dropped.” He went on to ask and answer: “Who was head of the FBI then?  Robert Mueller. Release the info.” There is no evidence Mueller weighed in on the investigation of Epstein, and his plea deal was handled by Alexander Acosta, then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, whom Trump appointed as Secretary of Labor in his first term. Acosta was forced to resign from the cabinet in 2019, after Epstein's re-arrest brought his role in the deal to light.


	America's conspiracy kingpin made it clear that he roundly rejected the memo from the FBI and DOJ when he shared a video of himself crying in a car and saying he was going to vomit from his feelings of betrayal. Soon enough he was sharing an image of the White House altered to resemble a building on Epstein's private island and a picture of the U.S. Capitol captioned “I am telling my children this is Epstein Island.” On his Infowars broadcast Wednesday, he criticized the administration and its supporters for trying to suppress dissent. “When somebody starts saying ‘Don't question things or you can't be in our club,' yeah, that's a cult, and I'm not a cult joiner, never have been,” he said. 


	Valorized by the QAnon movement and pardoned by Trump in 2020 for making false statements to the FBI, the former U.S. national security adviser pleaded with the president not to discredit the Epstein saga as a “hoax” in a lengthy post on X. “The roll out of this was terrible, no way around that,” he wrote, exhorting the administration to find “a way to move past this” while holding individuals responsible for their crimes against children. “It is NOT about Epstein or the left,” he insisted, challenging Trump's invocation of a shadowy plot by Democrats.


	The South Carolina representative joined many of her colleagues in demanding answers on Epstein, and arrests, asking on X, “If 1,000 kids were trafficked, how is there only one accomplice?” But she took the unusual step of speculating that Democrats were suppressing the truth. “Did the Biden Administration destroy any evidence?” she wrote. “I stand with women, children, the truth and TRUMP.” Of course, Trump would probably view it as more helpful to his cause if she stopped talking about Epstein altogether.   


	The right-wing comedian and YouTuber is another of the influencers who was duped by Bondi's binders in February, and after the FBI and DOJ memo came out this month, it sounded like Prather was still holding a grudge. One of the several videos he's released on Epstein since then is titled, in part: “WE WON'T STOP TALKING ABOUT THIS.” Another flat-out alleges that Bondi lied to the American public. “I have a lot of issues with all of this,” he said of the memo's conclusions.


	Better known by his social media handle @DC_Draino, O'Handley is another influencer who was embarrassed in “Bindergate.” Now he is consistently posting that more Epstein documents need to see the light of day. “Today is a great day to start releasing the Epstein Files,” he wrote on X on Wednesday. “Time to restore trust in the DOJ.” Previously, he had warned, “This isn't going away. It's only going to get worse. MAGA wants those Epstein files released.” 


	The conservative TV and radio host appears to believe that Trump, otherwise outperforming all expectations, could easily dispense with the Epstein drama if he wants to. “Epstein is not going away,” he posted on X  last weekend. “Best [six] months for any president in history. Everything he's doing is fantastic. Why risk it all on this stupid file? Just release it.” He also could not conceal his dismay over the controversial memo. “I must admit this Epstein file announcement is biggest [and] most ludicrous mistake ever by Trump,” he posted. “It's a disaster. Everyone knows it's pure fraud. So the question is WHY do something so foolish?”


	Known as a superspreader of medical misinformation, the podcaster was another recipient of the Bondi binder and has lately taken aim at the attorney general's “lies” around the Epstein case. She has also heavily indulged in the unproven conspiracy theory that Epstein worked for the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. On Wednesday, Wheeler touted one (accurate) statistic, noting a poll that showed almost 70 percent of Americans believe the Trump administration is withholding information on Epstein.    


	The Canadian streamer, who goes by the handle Viva Frei, said the ultimate responsibility for the Epstein fallout lay with Trump himself. “I think Trump's handling of the Epstein situation is wrong,” he wrote on X. “To his own detriment. And unnecessarily so.” Amid a torrent of posts and videos on the Epstein files in recent days, he again expressed his view that the president's comments on Epstein represented a huge strategic blunder, writing, “I say this with sincere love and respect: Does Trump not understand the damage he's doing right now?”


	The comedian and former sitcom actress, an early and vocal Hollywood supporter of Trump, was none too pleased when he wanted to drop the Epstein issue as soon as the DOJ and FBI memo came out. “Mr. President — Yes, we still care about Epstein,” she wrote on X. “Is there a time to not care about child sex trafficking? Read the damn room.” In the past months, she has replied to posts from Bondi to ask when the Epstein files will be released.


	The right-wing conspiracy theorist was aghast at Trump's decision to try to pin blame for the Epstein fiasco on Democrats. “Why he's doing this is anyone's guess,” he wrote on X. “I truly am speechless.” Cernovich fretted that Trump was not listening to his base, was now stuck playing defense, and lashed out at unnamed Trump “allies” he said had jeopardized the administration. “Whoever told Trump to shut up about Epstein fucked him over big time,” he posted.


	Last but certainly not least, the former Fox News host has used his considerable platform to go after Bondi and the Justice Department for “covering up Jeffrey Epstein's crimes and murder” and amplified the conspiracy theory that Epstein was a Mossad asset. He continues to devote hours of streaming content to speculative interviews about the case.

50 Cent‘s publishing company is suing the rapper's ex-girlfriend Shaniqua Tompkins over Instagram videos that it says violate a life rights agreement she signed over nearly 20 years ago.


	The lawsuit alleges Tompkins' videos violated a life rights agreement made in 2007 for $80,000 that gave G-Unit Books the exclusive rights to publicize her life story and a percentage of royalties from related projects. The complaint states that Tompkins, dated the rapper, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, between the 1990s and mid-2000s. They also share a son, Marquise.


	“Jackson purchased these rights to preserve them for use in future biographical or autobiographical projects, but also in part because he was concerned that Tompkins would attempt to monetize their history and his name,” reads the complaint, per Billboard. “His concerns were ultimately proven correct.”


	The lawsuit claims she was “contractually prohibited” from using said information for financial gain, alleging that the videos had “diminish[ed] the value of the exclusive rights it acquired and undermin[ed] its ability to develop and market future works based on those rights.”

	The lawsuit seeks $1 million in damages and an injunction to force her to quit posting the videos and remove content related to Jackson that has already been posted.

	Tompkins and a rep for Jackson did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment. However, the artist addressed the lawsuit by posting a screengrab from TMZ and attacked his ex's appearance: “I didn't realize how much she looks like me, girl you handsome with them baby hairs,” he wrote.

	











	This marks 50's second lawsuit in the past few months. In April, he sued the producers of an upcoming horror film Skillhouse, claiming he was never paid for his role. The lawsuit alleges that Jackson agreed to film his scenes in Skillhouse before finalizing and signing off on his contract, as he assumed he and producers would eventually work out a deal. However, a deal was allegedly never reached, and the rapper said he hasn't been compensated.

I
n the spring of 2024, while Andre Shariff Smith was leading the Ramadan community prayer, asking for forgiveness with his forehead planted in the prison mosque's carpeted floor, Netflix was releasing the first episode of its new series Homicide: New York, “Carnegie Deli Massacre.” It was about the crime he had participated in 23 years ago. But that afternoon, Smith didn't know the worst decision of his life, a robbery that left three people dead and two others wounded, was now being rehashed for millions. It would be the third-most-watched show on Netflix that week.


	I'm a journalist in the joint, been locked up for more than 23 years, and in the past few I was with Smith in Sullivan Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in New York's Catskill Mountains. Back in 2019, when I appeared on a true-crime show that reenacted the murder I committed 18 years before, it left me feeling a certain way. I've since argued that telling tales of human darkness, especially dredging up decades-old crimes, creates a thirst for punishment.

	











	The five-episode Homicide: New York showcases some of the city's “most brutal” murders. It was created by Dick Wolf, the prolific TV producer known for his many scripted crime dramas, most famously Law & Order. He's got around eight shows running right now — think One Chicago; think the FBI series — on different networks. In the past several years, as appetites for true crime have increased and murder rates in U.S. cities have decreased, Wolf has moved into the unscripted space, producing a bunch of true-crime shows for the likes of Oxygen and A&E. Today, his most prominent is arguably the Homicide series, which Netflix calls the “real-life Law & Order.”

	











	This makes sense, since several of the cases on Homicide: New York were previously fictionalized on Law & Order. It's one thing to read about crimes in the tabloids and change the names in a TV script, which is what Wolf's scribes often do, but it's quite another to use real cases and real names and real crime-scene photos, excavating real trauma to retell stories of murder for entertainment. Victims and their families have to relive the worst moments of their lives. And as for the people who caused the trauma in the first place — I see true crime, particularly this kind, as the antithesis to the idea that criminal-justice reformers espouse: We are more than the crimes we committed. There are subgenres of true crime, like true innocence, which investigates claims of wrongful conviction, that aren't as lurid — but that's not what Wolf is doing with Homicide.

	For more than 30 years, Wolf Entertainment has shaped the public's understanding of crime and punishment arguably more than any other cultural force. Wolf's shows follow a predictable narrative: “Bad guys” are identified and, after a couple of red herrings and unsuccessful interrogations, brought to “justice” by the “good guys” inside of an hour. It's classic TV writing — unlike prestige TV, which offers a slow grind of character building, blurring the line between good guys and bad guys (think Ozark), ending stories on inconclusive and haunting notes (think The Sopranos) — and I imagine viewers, both fans and those who happen upon old reruns of these shows, find Wolf's formula comforting: black, white, very little gray. It's this formula that's earned him the moniker “the king of broadcast television.”  


	Wolf Entertainment is now using this formula for true-crime shows. Take the opening scene of “Carnegie Deli Massacre”: Gunshots pop, and ominous music chills. A stiff-lipped retired medical examiner named Barbara Butcher is a recurring guest on the series. (Wolf enjoyed her performance so much he gave Butcher her own show: The Death Investigator With Barbara Butcher, produced by Wolf Entertainment, premieres on the Oxygen True Crime network this fall.) “When I got the call,” she says to the camera, “they said, ‘You got a quintuple — five homicides.'”

	It turned out to be a triple. Two people survived. 


	In May 2001, Jennifer Stahl, 39, an artist, singer, and actor, who had a minor role in Dirty Dancing, was selling exotic weed to an artsy clientele out of her sixth-floor apartment above the famous Jewish deli across the street from Carnegie Hall. One evening, as she was entertaining company, someone she knew buzzed. Moments later, Stahl lay dying with a bullet in her forehead while her friends in the next room — Charles “Trey” Helliwell, Stephen King, Anthony Veader, and Rosemond Dane — were on the floor, faces in the carpet, wrists duct-taped, probably praying for their lives. Soon after Stahl, they were all shot in the back of their heads. Veader and Dane survived, flinching just before the blasts. 

	











	The two men responsible were Smith and Sean Salley — though the prosecutor suggested that it was Salley who pulled the trigger.


	“You never want a robbery to turn into a homicide. The guy panicked, shot everyone,” Smith tells me as we lap the perimeter of the prison yard counterclockwise. (Salley, for his part, continues to maintain his innocence.) Smith, 54, wishes he could turn back time. He sports a kufi cap and high-water green pants (what most Muslims wear in prison), an easy smile, and a powerful build from years of lifting weights.


	I had listened to the Netflix show over the phone in the yard. The detectives called Smith “Dre.” Soon after, I started calling him that, too, even though everyone else called him Shariff, his middle name.


	“Why do you call me Dre?” he asks during our walk. 


	I hadn't realized I started calling him Dre after listening to Homicide: New York. And this is what true crime did: It rooted me in Dre's old identity, even though I was talking to Shariff, his new one.


	“I had a newborn son,” Smith says. “It came out at trial that one of the people who died, I think Stephen King, had a newborn daughter.”


	As we walk, Muslims greet Smith with “Assalamu alaikum,” a peace offering from God. Smith replies in kind, then finishes his thought. “His daughter is my son's age. Over the years, I've thought about how it was for her to grow up without a father.”


	In 1952, Smith's mother, Sharon, was born in jail. His grandmother, Freida, had her at 17 while she was serving time for “incorrigibility.” In 1971, Smith was born, but he would come to see his mother as more of a sister. His father wasn't around. Freida was the one who took care of Smith and his older brother, Tyrone, raising them in Newark, New Jersey. Smith knew his mother struggled with heroin. To support her habit, she boosted clothing from department stores. After she got busted, Smith would visit her on Rikers Island. He remembers cartoon characters, Minnie and Mickey Mouse, painted on the walls of the visiting room and his mother greeting him by lifting him up off his feet and squeezing him in a tight hug. When Sharon got out, their routine consisted of daily walks to the methadone clinic. Soon, his mother, who was always beautiful, started looking frail, feeling sick. Sharon had AIDS. “She would scream for me to get her dope,” Smith tells me. “She was in pain. So, I did.”

	











	In 1989, Sharon died. She was 37. Six weeks later, Smith's grandmother Freida died of a heart attack at 55. Now, Smith was on his own. He was 19.


	I grew up in a Brooklyn housing project with a single mom. My father left when I was one. Years later, Mom told me he killed himself. After that, I didn't think too much of myself. In the late Eighties, Mom and I moved with my stepfather, George, a longshoreman, to his apartment in Hell's Kitchen, the west side of midtown Manhattan. I was captivated by George's stories about the Westies, the Irish mob that reigned in the Kitchen. Just a few blocks from our rent-stabilized apartment was the Carnegie Deli, where Mom took me a few times. I ate big, fat brisket-on-rye sandwiches. This was around 1989.


	The next year, Dick Wolf's Law & Order premiered on NBC. The network loved the pilot episode but wondered where he'd find similarly gritty material. He told the NBC bosses that the bible of the show would be the front page of the New York Post. In 1990, there were 2,245 murders in New York City. He had plenty of material. (Through a representative, Wolf declined to be interviewed for this piece.)


	Around this time, Smith and I were young criminals. Our own cases would eventually make headlines in the New York Post. After Smith's grandmother and mother died, he was busted with cocaine and did a prison stint in New Jersey. Paroled in 1993, he was only out for a couple of months before he started robbing drug dealers. In Washington Heights one afternoon, he flashed cash — a few hundreds folded over a wad of singles. He told the dealer to bring an eighth of a kilo of cocaine (125 grams, which is the kind of order street dealers would request from weight dealers) and waited in a dimly lit restaurant, bachata music bumping in the background. When the dealer returned with the product, they went to the bathroom. Smith shoved the gun in the guy's gut, took the blow, then left. The guy he robbed flagged down the cops, who busted Smith.


	He wound up serving nearly three years in a New York prison (that's when he converted to Islam), then he did four more years in New Jersey for violating parole on the previous drug case. Smith, at one prison, bunked with his brother, Tyrone, who was serving time for manslaughter. Then he landed in a prison with his stepfather, who was in a medical unit dying of AIDS. When Smith asked the prison administrator if he could walk to the next building to say goodbye, they said no. His stepfather soon died. While in prison, he also reconnected with his real father, who would keep apologizing to him over the phone for never being present. Soon after, his father also died of AIDS.

	











	In early 2000, at 29, Smith got out. He already had four children with three different women. Smith tried to go straight. He had earned his high school equivalency in prison, enrolled in technical school, worked as a security guard at a homeless shelter, washed dishes at a retirement community, operated a forklift in a warehouse. He bought a hot-dog wagon, stood in line to get a permit, worked the cart on the weekend. He started dabbling in the streets. Someone shot him in his right leg; then weeks later, he slipped on some ice and broke it. He couldn't work and provide for his young family. By February 2001, his girlfriend Keasha had Smith's fifth son. Smith needed to make some money.


	Around this time, a mutual friend introduced Smith to Salley, who told Smith he knew a woman who sold high-end weed out of her Manhattan apartment. Salley had worked as a roadie with George Clinton, and that's how he got plugged into her circle. There should be several pounds of weed and cash. Smith, who'd robbed much more serious drug dealers, thought it sounded like an easy job. But he didn't like doing jobs with guys he didn't know. Had this guy ever robbed anyone?


	It was Salley's connect and Salley's job, though, so Smith, desperate for money, went along. 


	When they scoped out the place a day before, Smith saw the camera above the buzzer. Salley told him it was inoperable.


	This is what Smith tells me all these years later: When Salley rang Jennifer Stahl's bell, she buzzed him in. They climbed six flights. Upon entering, Smith held the gun on Stahl as Salley wrapped her guests' wrists behind their backs. Smith felt Salley was going overboard, taking too long. He set the gun down, snatched the tape and finished the job. Salley picked up the gun and led Stahl into the next room with the weed. Smith was headed for the door when he heard a gunshot. Smith says Salley then came back in and shot the four others in the backs of their heads as they lay face down on the carpet. Salley and Smith both fled, taking a duffel bag filled with money and weed, and leaving five people for dead. Smith's story lines up with what the prosecutor suggested at trial. (After the shootings, Salley told police he accidentally shot Stahl and then Smith shot the four others. At the trial, he and Smith blamed the other for the shootings. In 2010, in an interview on a true-crime show called I (Almost) Got Away With It, full of cheesy reenactments, Salley claims he didn't shoot anyone.)

	











	Days later, after seeing the footage of him and Salley leaving Stahl's apartment on the news — the camera worked after all — and learning that the cops were looking for him, Smith turned himself in. At first, he tried to persuade the detectives it wasn't him. Then he confessed, explaining he was only there for the weed. He claims he didn't know Salley was going to shoot everyone. A couple of months later, after he appeared on America's Most Wanted, Salley was captured fleeing a homeless shelter in Miami. 


	Months later, in December 2001, when I was a 24-year-old drug dealer and drug addict, I shot and killed a man in Brooklyn. Between 2002 and 2004, while Smith, Salley, and I were on Rikers Island awaiting our murder trials, Dick Wolf made his first foray into true crime with a show called Crime & Punishment. The execs at NBC loved it, so did Wolf, but one of the interrogators did this thing where he broke the fourth wall. After three seasons, it got canceled. Wolf stuck with his scripted crime dramas. At this point, the original Law & Order had a couple of spinoffs, SVU and Criminal Intent.


	At Salley and Smith's trial, in 2002, where each had separate juries, the prosecutor relied on forensic evidence and the testimony of Rosemond Dane and Anthony Veader, the two survivors, who couldn't definitively say who fired the shots. In his closing arguments, the assistant district attorney suggested that Salley was the lone shooter. Yet, according to the law, Smith's participation in the robbery made him just as guilty of the murders. That's how the complicated doctrine of felony murder works: Plenty of people are locked up in America for being present or even waiting outside in the getaway car, serving the same time as the ones who pull the trigger, and these massive sentences contribute to mass incarceration. To at least one juror, this didn't seem fair. 


	Lynne Harriton was the foreperson on Smith's jury. She had voted guilty, but when she learned Smith faced forever in prison like Salley, she felt duped by the system. She believed 25 to 30 years was fair for his participation. Harriton wrote the judge a letter, which later ran in The Village Voice: 


Dear Judge Berkman,I write to beg you to show leniency in your sentencing of Mr. Smith…. Information revealed by the state during trial indicates that he was shocked and horrified by the actions of the gunman, that he felt remorse, sadness and shame. Please, Judge Berkman, you consistently showed such kindness and warmth to us. Could you afford this person some years of light at the end of his life?












	The judge served Salley and Smith with more than 110 years apiece.


	In July 2004, a jury found me guilty of murder. I received 25 years to life. On top of three more I was serving for selling drugs, 28 years to life was more time than I'd been alive. I landed in Clinton Correctional Facility, in Dannemora, New York. We had 13-inch black-and-white TVs in our cells, and I'd watch Law & Order marathons on TNT, the original version with Sam Waterston as Jack McCoy. Every hour, the same iconic voiceover would play: “In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups …” Then, “dun-dun” echoed down the tier. Sometimes a voice would tumble out of a cell: “Ay, yo, who the fuck watching that cop show?”


	Wolf wasn't kidding about mining the tabloids for material. Plenty of Law & Order episodes, I'd realize, were about guys I knew. One was loosely based on my boy Dupree Harris' case. We were on trial in Brooklyn at the same time, me for murder, him for witness tampering and bribery. Harris was connected to a few cases — in one involving his half-brother, an eyewitness was set to testify but was murdered before he took the stand. Harris was not charged with that murder, but the Law & Order writers implied he was involved with the crime and used nicknames similar to Harris' case. The episode was called “Can I Get a Witness?” and it aired during his trial. Among other episodes was “Tragedy on Rye,” the one based on Smith's crime, about “three suspects who are arrested when a tourist's home video shows them leaving the victim's apartment with some stolen property.”


	Changing the names and facts of these cases at least mitigated reliving the real-life pain for those involved, but the show still had problems. My fellow prisoners were the first people to point out to me that Law & Order depicted criminal defendants as one-dimensional characters, while the detectives and prosecutors and judges were rendered as fuller ones, with desires and ideals and vulnerabilities. 


	Wolf would gradually build out the interiority of the show's heroes like Detective Lennie Briscoe, played by Jerry Orbach. Wolf once told writer Jim Longworth that he dispenses personal information with “an eyedropper instead of a soup ladle,” because that's how people get to know one another in real life. Yet Law & Order never had intimate scenes with murderers like me, like when my mom and aunt Mary Ann came up for extended visits as part of the family-reunion program. We'd stay in a modular home for 48 hours within the walls of Dannemora. In the living room, sitting on the couch, we'd channel surf, and Mom would always ask me to go back to Law & Order, her favorite show. I hadn't yet learned to think critically about the stories I consumed. She'd look over at me during a commercial. “At least we can be together,” Mom once said. “That boy you killed can't be with his mother.”

	











	In 2010, the same year Michelle Alexander published her New York Times-bestselling takedown of the criminal-justice system, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, Wolf's original Law & Order was canceled. Law & Order: Special Victims Unit continued on — Mariska Hargitay's Olivia Benson was busting rapists. In the next few years, Wolf cranked out three thriller novels with main character Detective Jeremy Fisk: In 2012, The Intercept came out; in 2014, The Execution; and in 2015, The Ultimatum. Sales were disappointing. Wolf returned to true crime — the genre had exploded in popularity since his first attempt, Crime & Punishment, ended in the early 2000s. 


	“If we could do these shows 20 to 25 percent better than what's out there, we could be a significant presence in five years,” Wolf told The Hollywood Reporter in 2015. When asked if his new interest in true crime was about money, Wolf acknowledged that “this is always a dangerous area, because anybody who says it's not about the money is lying. Obviously, it's always about the money.” Today, Wolf's net worth is reportedly $1.2 billion, and as he once said, he's “never earned a dollar that wasn't somehow writing-related.”


	It was my own writing career that led true-crime producers to me in 2018. Since then, I've thought a lot about who gets to tell our stories (it's the subject of my book, The Tragedy of True Crime: Four Guilty Men and the Stories That Define Us, out in September). That's why, when Homicide: New York came out, my book publicist, Megan Posco, explained the tone of the show to me and described some of the crimes featured. When I realized one installment was about Smith's crime, I wanted to talk to him and his loved ones about it. 


	“I didn't understand how they could make this show about him and not even reach out to him,” Smith's wife, Yvonne, tells me.


	While the ethics of true crime are often criticized nowadays, the First Amendment makes retelling these stories legal. That freedom of speech is also why I can be a journalist from the joint. But the simple reason these tragedies are constantly retold is that there is a demand for them.


	Some shows do depict incarcerated people as more than that terrible thing that landed us in prison. I recently read a transcript of HBO's Nature of the Crime, which came out in December of last year and follows three men in New York grappling with their remorse as they are repeatedly denied parole. 

	











	Instead of a sensational re-creation of the tragic events that led to their arrests decades prior, the feature-length documentary explores remorse and asks how much time in prison is enough.


	But what about the victims? While Anthony Veader, who was shot in the head and survived, did agree to participate in “Carnegie Deli Massacre,” the other survivor, Rosemond Dane, did not. (Dane declined to participate in this piece.)


	A 2024 survey by the online polling organization YouGov revealed that most Americans think true-crime creators should get permission from the victims or their families, and even a quarter of respondents believe they should get consent from the alleged criminal. 


	When I think about this golden era of true crime, I wonder what's lost when these shows and podcasts and books don't include the trauma that so many of us endure before we do what we did. 


	And when producers and writers re-create old crimes as full-blown entertainment productions so the violence is fresh for a new generation, they should consider how it will affect all of the parties involved, including the perpetrators who are paying for their crimes in prison. To understand the inner logic and layers that lead to violence, we should welcome the voices of those who are responsible for it — not as subjects to exploit, but as narrators to explain. Of course, anyone who's hurt people and attempts to explore their motivations must do so thoughtfully, with empathy and self-reflection. But our stories shouldn't simply start at the crime and end at the conviction, because any true insight can only be discovered in the before and after, reflecting on it all these years later in prison.


	I wondered how it felt for Smith to learn about this Netflix show rehashing his crime. In the hallway one evening, Smith tells me, he saw his psychology professor. He'd earned a B in her class the year before. The professor mentioned that she'd seen his show. He didn't know what to say. It wasn't his show. 


	“If I had the opportunity to watch it, I'd check it out,” Smith tells me that cloudy September day in the yard. 


	I tell him it's probably best he didn't. I explain the scene — the gunshots, the bloody crime-scene photos, their duct-taped wrists.


	“They showed that?” Smith asks.

	“There's no El Tráfico without the supporters,” says Gloria Jiménez, leader of the Angel City Brigade and a decades-long LA Galaxy fan. On Saturday, when the Galaxy face LAFC in Major League Soccer's fiercest rivalry (or El Tráfico, to the teams' perpetually gridlocked fans), the stands will be quieter than usual. Two of the Galaxy's most passionate and visible supporter groups — the drum-pounding, flag-waving Angel City Brigade and L.A. Outlawz — won't be in the stands. The groups will be staging a protest in response to how the team has handled in-game demonstrations against ICE‘s attacks on Latino communities across the country, as well as the team's failure to release a statement amid the raids and the stadium's recent ban of a member of one of the fan groups.


	Saturday's game, and the Galaxy protest around it, comes weeks into President Donald Trump's latest wave of immigration crackdowns, targeting predominantly Latino communities. In late May and early June, ICE swept through cities like Los Angeles, Nashville, and Chicago, leaving Latino soccer fans rattled, with some fearful that attending a major sporting event might put them at risk of detention and deportation.

	











	In May, a Latino-led supporter group of Nashville SC was the first to announce they wouldn't be attending a game following a wave of raids in the city. “Our community is being terrorized right now,” La Brigada de Oro founder Abel Acosta told The New York Times. “We're being hunted. That's how we feel.” And since then, fan groups of Austin FC, LA Galaxy, LAFC, Chicago Fire, and several other teams have voiced their support for their large Latino fanbase and their anger toward ICE.

	











	“To us, it's obvious. Soccer culture in America is inseparable from Latino culture. When the government is coming for our neighbors, it's insane not to speak up,” Zach Lyons, a leader of Austin FC's Los Verdes, says of the “Abolish ICE” banners they waved last month. “This is an attack on people who are part of our community. There was no hesitation. We knew we had to do something.”

	Out of the entire league, only one team — LAFC, the Galaxy's crosstown rival — spoke out in support of its immigrant fanbase. While it avoided mentioning ICE directly, the club said it stands “shoulder to shoulder with all members of our community.” Beyond the Black and Gold of the LAFC, however, the league and its franchises have remained silent. Multiple sources within Major League Soccer tell Rolling Stone that both the league and teams fear retaliation from the Trump administration, including treatment similar to that faced by the Los Angeles Dodgers, who were sued over alleged DEI practices by a conservative legal group founded by Trump immigration hawk Stephen Miller shortly after pledging $1 million to support L.A.'s immigrant community.


	Instead, teams have cracked down on fans who have pushed back at games, banning at least three in Chicago and one in L.A. for what the league labeled unauthorized political speech at games.

	“The MLS Fan Code of Conduct prohibits fans from displaying signs, symbols, or images used for commercial purposes or to advocate for or against any political candidate, party, legislative issue, or government action,” reads a statement sent to Rolling Stone by an MLS spokesperson. ”These policies are intended to keep the focus on the match and help avoid disruptions that could impact the fan experience.”


	For the Angel City Brigade and other fans of the Galaxy, the frustration stems from the team's silence around the ICE raids that rocked Southern California in early June. Throughout that month, fans expressed their frustration online and collectively decided not to attend their rivalry game against the San Jose Earthquakes in the Bay Area, in solidarity with fans who were fearful of traveling across the state.

	“That's our biggest trip of the season,” says Jiménez of the ACB. “The team hadn't offered any support: If something happens at the stadium, what's the next step?”

	











	The group then used the Galaxy's first home game since the raids, held on the Fourth of July, to stage a protest against the team for their continued silence. For the first 12 minutes of the match, the ACB skipped their typical chants and stood silently in the stands behind a tifo, a large banner display that covered much of the section, that read “Fight Ignorance, Not Immigrants.” Then, they walked out of the stadium.


	“We wanted to match their silence,” says Jiménez. “They didn't announce any proactive plans to protect our immigrant fans or tell us which charities they were supporting. So we left the game. Just like they left us.”


	Someone snuck a “Smash ICE” into that game, as well, while some fans wore shirts featuring a crossed-out ice cube. Tucked above the pro-immigrant tifo was a banner that read “AEG loves immigrant dollars but not immigrants,” specifically calling out the conglomerate owner of the team, who donated nearly $2 million to Republicans running for re-election last year, according to Billboard. The banner targeting AEG led to the indefinite ban of Bruce Martin, a photographer for the Angel City Brigade, over the alleged misuse of a credential to bring in the unapproved banner.


	The Galaxy spokesperson emphasized that the team had worked with ACB during their walkout “to ensure they felt heard and seen,” but said they had to ban Martin over for disobeying the rules. 


	“While we know fans may bring in unapproved banners, this is the first time that to our knowledge, a non-employee with credential access has used their credential to deliberately circumvent stadium protocols,” the Galaxy spokesperson tells Rolling Stone. “The abuse of that access is a serious breach of trust. As part of our regular process, an indefinite ban was issued while we reviewed the situation and his case.”


	Jiménez thinks that Martin was a scapegoat for the group's protests overall, and the AEG-directed messaging was part of it. Martin, for his part, thinks he was targeted for speaking to the Los Angeles Times about the team's silence in an interview leading up to that game.


	“The main frustration for us is that they've used the Hispanic culture in advertisements to make money, but when something is affecting the culture, they're quiet,” he tells Rolling Stone. “At the Fourth of July game, I came to the realization that this might be the last time I set foot into that stadium. … This feels like a breakup or a death. It would take a lot for me to come back.”

	











	Jiménez says that at least 100 of the nearly 800 season ticket holders in the section where the ACB stands have canceled their tickets for the season over the Galaxy's inaction. (The team didn't confirm the number, but stated that they've made exceptions to allow fans to cancel their season tickets.)


	“I don't see myself going to games anytime soon,” says Rebecah Jacobs, one fan who requested a refund for the remaining games of the season. “I know that the Galaxy is very online and seeing all the chatter going on so it's not about not knowing what's going on. … I'd need them to speak out. Being silent is not something I can support.”

	The Angel City Brigade skipped this past Wednesday night's game altogether and instead staged a protest outside of the stadium, slamming Martin's ban and the continued silence from the Galaxy. One fan held up a printout of the description for one of the team's jerseys, which to the fans now seems ironic: “Coated in our city colors, the kit represents all different Angelino cultures, no matter what border or bridge you crossed to get here. This will forever be your home.”


	But the Galaxy tells Rolling Stone, in the first statement of its kind, that it will stick to league policy, and not address the political nature of the ICE raids directly, despite fan clamors.


	“We have not issued a statement. We recognize the impact that recent events and actions have had on our community. For decades, we have honored the rich backgrounds, cultures, and experiences of our fans and staff. Our purpose as a professional sports organization is to unite and support our community around a shared love of this sport,” Jamie Alvarez, the Vice President for PR and Communications of the Galaxy, says in a statement the team asked to be published in full. “We are focusing on prioritizing the safety, well-being, and sense of belonging for our staff and for our fans.”

If you go under the  @LAGalaxy website you can find where it states that the LA KIT is “coated in our city colors representing all cultures NO MATTER WHAT BORDER YOU CROSSED. However how are they helping our community? And why can't they let us know? pic.twitter.com/zq3M2KGN70


	Separately, a Galaxy source says that working alongside AEG, the team will continue to support its longtime community partners, including Latino-focused orgs CARECEN, Heart of Los Angeles (HOLA), and All Peoples Community Center. 


	Latino fans of the Chicago Fire faced an eerily similar situation with their team. Three fans — Nate Cubeta and Edith and Julio Lopez — were banned for a year from Soldier Field and all MLS-sanctioned events over an unauthorized anti-ICE banner they refused to take down.

	











	“When the ICE raids started to become more brutal in L.A., we thought we couldn't go to the next Fire home game and not recognize what is going on. It didn't feel right,” says Cubeta. “We came up with this design that was Spanglish and tied into the Fire.”


	For three games in June, including on the day of the “No Kings” protests in mid-June, Cubeta and the Lopez siblings say they displayed a banner reading “Fire Contra ICE” — featuring an illustration of soccer legend Cuauhtémoc Blanco celebrating a goal by mimicking a dog urinating over the government agency's logo — from within the Sector Latino section of the stadium. The first two games, they say, the Fire said nothing about the banner. (A Chicago Fire source says the fans were reminded of the policy.)

🇺🇸 La MLS le aplicó derecho de admisión por un año a tres hinchas de Chicago Fire por poner una bandera contra el ICE, la policía migratoria de Estados Unidos. pic.twitter.com/ZuYjl0W60V


	It wasn't until a match on June 28 that Cubeta and the Lopez siblings were asked by the Fire to take down the banner. They refused, leading the team to ban them from Soldier Field for a year. In a statement to Rolling Stone, a Fire spokesperson says the banner had “violated” the league's code of conduct, pointing to the terms of the rulebook displayed online. (“The Chicago Fire remain committed to providing a safe and enjoyable environment for all fans,” the statement reads.)


	“The Fire will say we broke the political signage rules. We know we did. We felt compelled to disobey it at a moment like this,” says Edith Lopez. “We know that they're going to find whatever way to sanitize things, because they want to be marketable and safe. But that's not our responsibility as supporters.”


	Cubeta and the Lopez siblings, who've been season ticket holders since 2009, have no regrets about their decision to stand their ground and keep the poster up. “We want immigrants to know we are behind them and there is always a space with us,” says Edith. “We aren't intimidated.”

	After news of the ban spread, Sector Latino and other Chicago Fire supporter groups protested the Fire at a game last Saturday, which ironically happened to be Mexican Heritage Night at the stadium. They turned their backs to the field and remained silent for the first 15 minutes of the match as they held up a new banner that read in Spanish:  “We are always with you guys, but you are never with us.”


	In Austin, fans have decided to compromise with the Austin FC front office to share pro-immigrant messaging and step away from the “abolish ICE” direct messaging they displayed earlier in the summer. They've gotten banners that read “Austin Is an Immigrant City” approved and have distributed “Know Your Rights” cards during games. And they've used their platform to display important messaging including a “Don't Mess With Trans Texans” tifo that went viral earlier this year.

	











	“We are unabashedly willing to speak politics when important, even if the league doesn't allow us to be explicit on that,” says Ernie Luna of Austin FC's Los Verdes. “Our community is what we focus on first, and in our negotiations with them, it's always, ‘We want to be there for our community, so give us the space to do that.'”

A post shared by Los Verdes (@losverdesatx)


	Several sources with direct knowledge of league policy tell Rolling Stone that the nature of the protests makes it difficult for teams and MLS to speak out in support of its immigrant fans, even if they'd want to — and the league has suggested they not do so. 


	With an administration as volatile as Trump's, it's unclear what sort of punishment or retaliation he could take on teams for speaking in favor of its immigrant fanbases. Stephen Miller's American First Legal already sued the Dodgers for “engaging in unlawful discrimination under the guise of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion,'” and it isn't hard to imagine the other conservative groups, or the government itself, taking action against teams they perceive to be condoning anti-ICE messaging.


	“A lot of the teams are scared and being put in a difficult position where they want to say something, but there's a worry of retaliation,” one source says. “It's not how government should work but unfortunately it's the climate we're in and people are concerned about it.”


	As the season drags on, fans are left dealing with silence from the teams — and waiting for a political storm that targets their communities to somehow pass. Wednesday's Galaxy game had the worst turnout of the year so far, and no one in the supporter sections expects that to turn around anytime soon. The trust, for many, seems to already be broken.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","UFO sightings plummet across UK as we're all too 'distracted' looking on our phones","https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/ufo-sightings-plummet-across-uk-35580327","Sat, 19 Jul 2025 15:19:00 GMT","

UFO sightings have plummeted across Britain - because people are too glued to their mobile phones. Having previously been bombarded with hundreds of 999 calls over flying saucers, a police probe suggests UFO reports have dried up in the past year.

Some forces - like Cheshire and Gwent - revealed they had no record of any close encounters so far in 2025. It is a far cry from the galactic goggling in the 80s and 90s, when the likes of The X Files had Brits scouring the stars for little green men.

However, Britain's leading UFO investigator thinks we are still being visited by extraterrestrials - just that we've stopped noticing.

Russ Kellett, from Yorkshire, who has been abducted dozens of times, said: “There are plenty of aliens and UFOs out there, but people are too distracted to notice.

“People are too busy looking down to see what is above us. There have always been highs and lows with UFO reports - I'm currently looking at a strange report of a flying saucer landing in Scarborough a few years back - so the truth is out there.

“But the only way we will ever find it is by watching the skies - not social media.”

The Daily Star Sunday's exclusive findings follow Freedom of Information requests to forces across the UK, which previously unearthed hundreds of reports - ranging from mysterious flashing lights to one person in Belfast beamed aboard a UFO while taking a ciggie break.

Yet reports have dried up; Even in Wiltshire - the UK's crop circle capital - cops confirmed they had no record of any spooky sightings so far this year.

However, some forces did disclose details, including one caller in Northampton who had been beamed aboard a UFO - then kidnapped by bigfoot.

 July 18, 2025, 23:12 pm ET, BY Neal- Contributor| Editor: Thomas H. Kee Jr. (Follow on LinkedIn) Longer Term Trading Plans for UFO

Buy UFO near  29.38 target n/a stop loss @  29.3.  Details
The technical summary data tells us to buy UFO near 29.38, but there is no current upside target from the summary table.  In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped.  The data does tell us to set a stop loss 29.3 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade.  29.38 is the first level of support below 31.4027, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal.  In this case, if support 29.38 is being tested, a buy signal would exist.
NONE .  Details

The technical summary data tells us to buy UFO near 29.38, but there is no current upside target from the summary table.  In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped.  The data does tell us to set a stop loss 29.3 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade.  29.38 is the first level of support below 31.4027, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal.  In this case, if support 29.38 is being tested, a buy signal would exist.

NONE . There are no current resistance levels from the summary table, and therefore there are no Short resistance Plans which tell us to short upon tests of resistance.  Resistance levels have broken higher and unless the stock reverses lower and below support levels again short positions look risky.

If n/a begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy UFO just slightly over n/a, with an upside target of n/a.  The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 0 in case the stock turns against the trade.  n/a is the first level of resistance above 31.4027, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal.  In this case, n/a, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist.  Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of UFO if it tests n/a with a downside target of 31.24. We should have a stop loss in place at 0 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade.  By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal.  In this case, if resistance, n/a, is being tested a short signal would exist.  Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

If n/a begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy UFO just slightly over n/a, with an upside target of n/a.

Rivera's cause of death is pending and autopsy results are expected in about 8-10 weeks

New England Society for Psychic Research

 No, the allegedly “possessed” Annabelle doll was not in the hotel room where paranormal investigator Dan Rivera died earlier this week, according to a Pennsylvania coroner.


 In a Friday, July 18, message to PEOPLE, Francis Dutrow, the Adams County coroner confirmed that the doll was not present when he arrived at the scene on Sunday, July 13, when authorities were notified about Rivera's death. Dutrow went on to note that the doll had not been in the hotel room at all. 


 Rivera, a lead investigator for the Connecticut-based New England Society for Psychic Research, was in Gettysburg. Pa., last weekend with Annabelle as part of the Devils on the Run tour when he died at the age of 54. 


 The Pennsylvania State Police shared a report on Wednesday, July 16, detailing what happened.


 “Members from PSP Gettysburg responded to a hotel in Straban Township, Adams County for a report of a deceased [man],"" officials said. ""The decedent was discovered in his hotel room by workers.”


 “Nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene,” the agency added. His cause of death is pending.


 Dutrow earlier told PEOPLE that Rivera had been with colleagues on Sunday morning but said he was feeling sick and was going back to his room. 


 It's unclear what Rivera may have been ill with and further information is pending his autopsy results, which are expected in about 8-10 weeks.

 According to the New England Society for Psychic Research's website, Anabelle's origin goes back to 1968, when a student nurse was gifted the doll and brought it to the home where she lived with her roommate. 


 “Almost immediately, the roommates noticed strange occurrences with the doll and they were introduced to a medium who told them the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle,” the organization wrote. “The two roommates tried to accept the doll's spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent.”


 The society added that its founders, paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, were called in and determined that Annabelle was “demonically possessed.” They took the doll from the home and stored it in a glass box “to contain the evil spirited entity.”


 The story of Annabelle and the Warrens led to the development of the horror film franchise The Conjuring.


 In a statement later shared with PEOPLE on Tuesday, July 15, the New England Society for Psychic Research, which first confirmed the death on social media, paid tribute to Rivera. 


 “Dan was not only a vital part of our team for over a decade, but also a deeply compassionate, loyal, and dedicated friend,” they wrote.


 “His integrity, creativity, and generosity defined him. Dan's passion for the paranormal was rooted in a genuine desire to educate, help, and connect with others — whether through social media, conventions, or investigations with local families seeking understanding and peace,” the society continued.

 “We understand that Dan's work inspired fascination and curiosity for many, but above all, he was a father, devoted husband, and loyal friend, someone who meant the world to those closest to him,” the statement added.


 According to a Facebook post by Ryan Buell, the host of A&E's Paranormal State, Rivera, who was an Army veteran, is survived by his wife and children.

In a gripping account that blurs the line between the natural and the supernatural, animation director Larry Whitaker—whose credits include “Tiny Tunes” and “Space Jam”—recalled a chilling experience that left him shaken and transformed. Speaking with L.A. Marzulli, Whitaker described a spiritual encounter while staying in Thiruvananthapuram, India. What began as an ordinary business trip quickly turned into a vivid confrontation with evil beyond the physical realm.

Whitaker awoke in the middle of the night to find the lights in his room dimming unnaturally. What followed was a sight he says defies scientific explanation: a dense black mass, thicker than any natural shadow, began sweeping through the room. It moved with intelligence and purpose, not like fog or smoke, but as something alive. He described it as “blacker than black,” a volumetric darkness that carried an unmistakable malevolent presence.

As the entity advanced, tendrils of it reached out toward him—one touching his tongue. The sensation, Whitaker said, was like a powerful electric shock that left him paralyzed. In that terrifying moment, unable to move or speak clearly, something inside him rose up. He managed to say, “The Lord is holy.” At that declaration, the darkness reacted violently. It instantly flattened out and exited the room in a flash, as if repelled by the holiness of God's name.

Still shaken the next day, Whitaker shared the event with Christian friends, who believed it may have been a form of spiritual retaliation. Earlier during his trip, he had boldly refused to participate in a local Shiva festival and had instead told a young Indian boy, “Remember Jesus.” It was a seemingly innocent comment, but one that could have stirred spiritual opposition in a region steeped in strong religious traditions.

The spiritual tension didn't end there. The following day, while washing his hands at a seaside restaurant, Whitaker heard an unnatural growling sound emanating from a dead palm tree behind him. With no one else around and no animals in sight, he spoke against it, and the noise stopped.

In another moment of supernatural intervention, Whitaker shared how he once heard a voice while driving tell him to slow down. Seconds later, a herd of deer darted across the road—an accident narrowly avoided. These experiences, he believes, underscore the reality of spiritual warfare and divine protection for believers.

Whitaker's experience serves as a sobering reminder of the unseen battle that rages around us and the authority believers have through our faith in Christ. As Whitaker put it, “I didn't fight it. I just declared who God was—and that was enough.”

ByMarshall Shepherd,

 Senior Contributor. 

For whatever reason, many weather conspiracy theories have crawled out of the fringes and into mainstream discussions. Over the years, many of us have tried to play “Whac-A-Mole” with them, but they live on like “zombies” marching around the Internet and social media wasteland. Let's try to debunk the top six weather conspiracies currently in circulation right now.

Let's start here since it has been in the news lately. People have done there “own research” and concluded that cloud seeding caused the Texas Floods. That has been disproven. While there is plenty of information out there about cloud seeding, it is important to develop a filter to distinguish sales pitch from science. As I recently wrote in my cloud seeding primer, it is not new, and results have been found inconclusive or minimally effective at best. My colleague Tom Gill puts it best that, “The effect of cloud seeding on the kinds of floods we've seen recently is comparable to striking a match to a raging inferno.” Candidly, I wish it was more effective so that we could eradicate economically harmful drought and raging wildfires like those happening across the U.S. right now.

The concept of geoengineering has been around for decades. As scholar within the field, it has also been referred to as “climate intervention.” It has been studied by the National Academies and many credible scientific organizations. The American Meteorological Society wrote a policy statement in 2022 that stated, “Such efforts are now commonly referred to as climate intervention (also called geoengineering): the deliberate manipulation of physical, chemical, or biological aspects of the Earth system with the intention of tempering the harmful effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.”

Oddly, in recent years, I have noticed a disturbing conflation of geoengineering with misinformation about contrails. A National Weather Service website defines contrails as, “Condensation trails, frequently called Contrails…. Cloud-like streamers frequently observed to form behind aircraft flying in clear, cold, humid air.” NWS noted two processes for formation. The website went on to say, “The first method occurs when water vapor that accompanies the exhaust from a jet engine is added to the atmosphere. If the humidifying effect of this moisture addition overcomes the heat of combustion, then exhaust trails will form…. The second process for forming a condensation trail occurs in air that is clear, but almost fully saturated with water vapor. The aerodynamic pressure reduction resultant of air flowing around a propeller or wing tips can cool the air to induce condensation, thus forming 'aerodynamic trails.'”

In my over 30 years of experience as an atmospheric scientist, there are things that I have discovered about public understanding of weather. Concepts like probability of precipitation, concepts that are counter to personal mental models, and multiple processes are challenging. For example, temperature decreases as altitude increases. Most planes are flying in very cold altitudes. Though not a perfect analogy, the breath we “see” on a cold day helps to visualize what's happening with contrails. They are not mind-altering or weather-controlling sprays. The Royal Aeronautical Society has a great website debunking “chemtrails.” The American Association for the Advancement of Science is one the largest and most credible science societies in the world. AAAS also debunked them by reviewing perspectives from several top experts.

I was literally stunned to see claims that Hurricane Milton or Hurricane Helene were being controlled or created. While on a major network being interviewed about Milton, I was asked about it. Yikes! I find it to be quite disrespectful to all families impacted by such tragic storms. I certainly wish we could steer or control hurricanes so that they could be sent out to sea and not harm a single soul or piece of infrastructure. Every now and then, the idea of “nuking” hurricanes resurfaces. That thought has been around for a while too, but in a previous piece, I discussed why experts have concluded that's a bad idea.

Several years ago people claimed that the U.S. government had a massive cloud machine. It turned out to be a NASA engine test facility in Mississippi. In recent months, it has emerged that some people believe weather radars are being weaponized to control the weather or harm people. CNN's Andrew Freedman documented this trend.

Relatively speaking, the HAARP conspiracy theory might be feeling a little neglected these days. It's one that has been around for a while, but it has been in the shadows lately compared to the new batch out there. Like many of these conspiracy theories, HAARP is rooted in real science but has been distorted, conflated, and misrepresented. According to University of Alaska's website, “The High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program, or HAARP, is a scientific endeavor aimed at studying the properties and behavior of the ionosphere.” That is region of the atmosphere about 50 to 400 miles above Earth's surface. The United States Air Force transition the research facility to the university in 2015, and it continues to be used for ionospheric research not weather manipulation.

Much of what we are seeing with weather today can likely be associated with something that scientists have warned about for decades. Though weather certainly varies naturally, climate experts warned of an accelerated water cycle, intense rainstorms, sea level rise, mega-heatwaves, and changes to tropical cyclone intensities. While data continues to indicate that most people “get it” about climate change, there is about 10% of the U.S. population that is dismissive. From that crowd, you typically here “zombie theories like:”

I wrote an article in 2017 addressing these and there are several good websites out there that debunk them and other common things that we hear.

General circulation patterns.

NWS

While not technically a weather conspiracy theory, there are several aspects of weather, among other things, that disprove the notion that Earth is flat. We can start with imagery from weather satellites or spacecraft. Additionally, the vibrant colors of sunrises and sunsets is an exercise in physics but is a natural process that proves Earth is not flat.

The presence of a warm tropical regions and cold polar regions, respectively, is additional evidence. Earth's equatorial region receives more heat energy from the sun. Atmospheric circulation and ocean currents are, in part, explained by this polar-to-tropical temperature difference. Finally, weather radar beams and their ability to detect storms are affected by Earth's curvature.

People cling to conspiracy theories for a multitude of reasons. This 2020 essay provides a deep dive into literacy deficiencies, fear, psychological reasoning, disproportionate weighting of information on the Internet, and other factors that perpetuate them.

The Justice Department asked a federal court on July 18, 2025, to unseal grand jury transcripts in Jeffrey Epstein's case. The direction from President Donald Trump came after weeks of frustration among some far-right groups over his administration's refusal to release the complete and unredacted “Epstein files.” 

Epstein, a wealthy financier with high-profile connections, was arrested in 2019 on sex trafficking charges and later died by suicide in a Manhattan jail awaiting trial.

In early 2025, a federal court unsealed portions of the court documents. While names of some of the alleged clients and victims were released, many were redacted or withheld. 

Epstein's arrest and death became a central focus for QAnon followers, who saw them as proof of a hidden global elite engaged in child trafficking and protected by powerful institutions. The release – or withholding – of the Epstein files is often cited within QAnon movement circles as evidence of a broader cover-up by the so-called “deep state.”

Some followers of the MAGA – Make America Great Again – movement  and the Republican Party believe in the false claim that the United States is secretly controlled by a cabal of elites who are pedophiles, sex traffickers and satanists. 

Over time, what started as a baseless conspiracy on obscure platforms has migrated into the mainstream. It has influenced rhetoric and policy debates, and even reshaped the American political landscape. The foundational belief of many of the QAnon followers is that Trump is a heroic figure fighting the elite pedophile ring. 

Trump's attempts at downplaying or obstructing the very disclosures they believe would validate their worldview has led to confusion. To some, the delay in the release of the files feels like a betrayal, or even the possibility of his wrongdoing. Others are trying to reinterpret Trump's actions through increasingly baseless conspiracy logic. 

Trump has publicly dismissed demands for the full release of the Epstein Files as a “hoax.” He has also made false claims. On July 15, 2025, Trump said: “And I would say that, you know, these files were made up by Comey. They were made up by Obama.” 

As a scholar who studies extremism, I know that the movement views Trump as a mythological figure and it interprets Trump's actions to fit this overarching narrative – an elasticity which makes the movement both durable and dangerous.

The QAnon movement began with the Pizzagate conspiracy theory in 2016, which falsely claimed that high-ranking Democrats were operating a child sex trafficking ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria. The baseless theory gained enough online momentum that a man armed with an assault rifle stormed the restaurant, seeking to “free the children.”

In 2017, an anonymous figure called “Q” began posting cryptic messages on message boards like 4chan and 8kun. The baseless accusations of a global network of elites involved in controlling global institutions, including governments, businesses, and the media, as well as operating a child trafficking and ritual abuse, were central to the QAnon movement's narrative.

The movement has recruited followers through language like “Save the Children,” to mobilize around issues of child trafficking. 

Many QAnon adherents, particularly women, were drawn to the movement through such appeals to child protection. According to psychologists Sophia Moskalenko and Mia Bloom, this type of appeal taps into powerful emotional instincts,  making conspiracy theories like QAnon more persuasive and harder to dislodge, even in the face of contradictory evidence.

QAnon followers perceived Trump as a messianic figure working to expose this cabal in a climactic reckoning known as “The Storm” – a moment when mass arrests would finally bring justice. 

They claimed that this moment would eventually bring about a “Great Awakening,” a reference to the religious revivalist movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. In this context the phrase described the supposed political and spiritual enlightenment that would follow “The Storm” – a moment of mass realization when people would “wake up” to the truth about the “deep state.”

In 2019, the FBI identified QAnon as a domestic terrorism threat, and major social media platforms began banning related content, but by then, QAnon had bled into mainstream conservative politics. Q-endorsing candidates, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, ran for and won elected office a year later.

During Trump's first administration – from 2017 to 2021 – the QAnon movement flourished. The posts from Q claimed to reveal insider knowledge of a secret war being waged by the president, often in coordination with the military, against the powerful elite. 

Trump never explicitly endorsed the movement, but he did little to distance himself from it.

His administration also included figures, like former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who openly interacted with Q content online.

Trump's rhetoric, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, gave new life to QAnon narratives. When he questioned the integrity of the electoral process, QAnon followers interpreted it as confirmation of the deep state's meddling. 

However, after Trump's loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race, QAnon followers revised their original prophecy to maintain belief in “The Storm” and “The Great Awakening.” Some claimed the defeat was part of a larger secret plan, with Biden's presidency serving as a cover for exposing the deep state. Some believed Trump remained the true president behind the scenes, while others reframed the awakening as a spiritual rather than political event. 

Indeed, by 2020, several congressional candidates openly embraced or showed sympathy for the QAnon movement.

At various campaign rallies in 2022 and after Trump used the movement's symbolism. On Truth Social, his social media platform, he retweeted Q-affiliated accounts, and praised QAnon supporters as “people who love our country.” That same year he reposted an image of himself wearing a Q lapel pin overlaid with the words “The Storm is Coming.”

Trump's departure from the White House in January 2021 created an existential crisis for the QAnon movement. Predictions that he would declare martial law or arrest Joe Biden and other Democrats on Inauguration Day failed to materialize. Q's posts also stopped, leaving many followers adrift.

Some abandoned the theory. Others rationalized the failed predictions or embraced new conspiracy narratives, such as the belief that Trump was still secretly in charge or that the military would soon act to reinstate him. 

Some QAnon communities merged with or were absorbed into broader anti-vaccine, anti-globalist, and Christian nationalist movements.

Estimating the number of QAnon believers is difficult because many individuals do not openly identify with the movement, and those who do often hold a range of loosely connected or partial beliefs rather than adhering to a consistent or uniform ideology. Not everyone who shares a Q meme or echoes a Q talking point identifies as being part of the movement. 

That said, surveys by groups like the 2024 Public Religion Research Institute and the Associated Press have found that 15–20% of Americans believe in some of QAnon's core claims, such as the existence of a secret group of Satan-worshipping elites controlling the government. 

Among Republican voters, the number is often higher. 

This does not mean all these people are hardcore QAnon adherents, but it does show how far the narrative, or parts of it, has seeped into mainstream thinking.

The Trump administration's failure to disclose the information in Epstein files has fueled internal confusion, disillusionment and even radicalization within the movement. 

For some QAnon believers, this failure was a turning point: if Trump – once seen as the hero in the conspiracy narrative – would not or could not reveal the truth, then the “deep state” must be more entrenched than imagined.

At the same time, frustrations have grown within MAGA and the QAnon movement's spaces. Some see it as a failure to fulfill one of his most important promises: exposing elite pedophiles. Others believe the delay is strategic, another example of “the plan” requiring more patience. 

The QAnon movement continues to evolve, even as its central figure hedges and hesitates, showing how potent myths can be in times of uncertainty. In my view, understanding why this belief continues to gain traction is essential for understanding the current state of American democracy.

The Trump administration is threatening to revoke antitrust immunity for Delta Air Lines Inc. and Grupo Aeromexico's pricing agreement amid a set of new orders demanding Mexico move forward to address anticompetitive behavior. 

Mexican airlines will now be required to file schedules with US authorities and seek approval for large charter flights, according to an order issued by US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Saturday.

Donald Trump departs following a signing ceremony at White House in Washington, DC, US, July 18.

For President Donald Trump, whose political career has benefited from voter anxiety over Washington elites, the health of his predecessor and the riches of Wall Street, the past week offered a reversal of fortune.

The New York Stock Exchange

The second-quarter earnings season is off to a ripping start, with consumer strength powering resilient corporate profits. In the stock market, however, the reaction has been fairly quiet, an ominous sign that much of the good news is priced in — and investors are punishing disappointments.

Take financials, which reported blockbuster numbers this week that failed to juice their shares. “Financials have crushed 2Q earnings expectations with a 94.4% beat rate so far, yet stocks saw only muted reactions as investors largely anticipated the results,” Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Michael Casper wrote in a noteBloomberg Terminal Friday.

Dimitar Radev, who'll help set euro-zone interest rates from next year, has seen more than his fair share of political upheaval.

The 69-year-old head of Bulgaria's central bank was a Finance Ministry official in the 1980s when the Communist government abruptly closed it. After witnessing the regime's eventual collapse and the ministry's reinstatement, he helped his country emerge from a bout of hyperinflation before joining the push to make it the euro area's 21st member.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"
