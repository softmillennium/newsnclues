Living under relentless bombardment, Palestinians in Gaza share reactions to the new round of negotiations in Doha.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

As a new round of negotiations between Hamas and Israel begins in Doha, Israeli forces have intensified their military operations across the Gaza Strip. Nearly 900 Gazans have been killed by U.S.-Israeli forces while attempting to access aid by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which was set up by Israel and the U.S. in May. Each day, Palestinians live under relentless bombardment and witness horrific massacres. UNRWA, the UN agency that provides relief for Palestinian refugees, says 1 in 10 children may be malnourished due to the Israeli blockade. Every passing minute in Gaza means more lives lost, more homes reduced to rubble. It feels as if Israel is racing against time — using the cover of negotiations to kill and destroy as much as possible before any potential agreement is reached.

Yet, while grappling with unimaginable hardship and daily horrors, people in Gaza have begun clinging to the headlines, following every update on the negotiations with cautious hope. Everywhere you go, people ask one another with worry, their hearts heavy with anticipation: Will it happen this time? What's standing in the way?

For many in Gaza, the word “ceasefire” alone is enough to revive a sense of hope. It recharges the spirit of Gazans worn down by months of relentless war, as children and adults alike begin to voice dreams of the simple joys they've been denied for so long.

Even though the recent discussions are only addressing the possibility of a temporary truce, followed by further negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire, it is seen as a refuge for many — a fleeting chance to breathe freely from the suffocating burdens of war. Still, nothing is guaranteed, given our experience with the last ceasefire in January, which lasted only two months before being violated by the Israelis.

The breakdown of the last ceasefire has deeply affected how people view the possibility of another one; hope has become intertwined with mistrust and uncertainty about its durability. During the last ceasefire, people were given only a short break from daily killing, displacement, and starvation.

Amid the pain and destruction, people in Gaza found the strength to gather the broken pieces of their lives and stand up again, hoping to reclaim even a small part of the beautiful life we once knew before the war began. For the first time in a long time, we experienced moments of peace — walking freely through the streets of Gaza without living in constant fear of being killed. We tasted delicious, nourishing food, which we had been denied for far too long.

While grappling with unimaginable hardship and daily horrors, people in Gaza have begun clinging to the headlines, following every update on the negotiations with cautious hope.

However, the Israeli government apparently saw this life as a luxury Gazans cannot be allowed. Determined to continue destroying what was already broken, they resumed the war, which shattered what Palestinians had begun to rebuild and plunged people in Gaza back into the same endless cycle of suffering.

Ihsan Alkateeb, 48, told me that once Israel resumed the war in Gaza, it became even crueler than before. He explained that Israeli forces took control of large areas of the Strip, including his neighborhood in Al-Qarara, a town in the Khan Younis governorate that is now under Israeli control and completely inaccessible to its residents. This forced him to live seven kilometers away from home in a tent in the Al-Mawasi area.

He also added that Israel's starvation campaign is even more terrifying than the military assault itself. “It has drained our energy and left us in despair,” he told me, recalling how helpless he felt watching his children cry for food while he had nothing to offer. “I was forced to risk my life multiple times by following the humanitarian aid trucks and going to American aid distribution sites, which I consider death traps, just to get a bag of flour for my family.”

“We struggle to find enough water and even basic food to feed my hungry children.”

Alkateeb mentioned that, like all the people of Gaza, he is closely following the recent discussions about a 60-day ceasefire and is optimistic — hoping he can finally feed his children the food they long for and return to his neighborhood. However, he added that he is deeply concerned about the lack of guarantees from Israel regarding the resumption of war.

“If the world — and especially the American administration — doesn't exert immense pressure on Israel to prevent the resumption of war after the temporary truce ends and to push for continued negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire, the situation in Gaza will become catastrophic, and the scenario of the January ceasefire will repeat itself all over again,” he said. “Israel will return to the war with even greater bloodshed and destruction, seeking to implement its plan to occupy the Strip, empty it of its residents, and push them toward Rafah in an effort to drive us out of our land.”

Nihad Nassar, 40, told me that during the January ceasefire, she and her family had the chance to return to their home in the north after months of displacement in the south. Although the house was partially destroyed, she said they “spared no effort to make it livable again.”

Once back in her home in the Al-Shujaiya neighborhood — where she was born and raised — Nassar said she felt like the happiest person in the world. For a moment, she believed the war was truly over, and she allowed herself to dream of a better future — one filled with peace and stability.

Nassar said the resumption of the Israeli military operation in March came as a shock — something she never imagined. Once again, she was forced to flee her beloved neighborhood after Israeli forces launched a large-scale ground invasion, seeking refuge in a tent in the Al-Rimal neighborhood of Gaza.

Nassar explained that the resumption of the war has deeply worsened her situation. “I now live in a small tent in an overcrowded camp, deprived of the basic necessities of life,” she told me. “We struggle to find enough water and even basic food to feed my hungry children. On top of that, we live in constant terror of the sounds of airstrikes every single day.”

“We want to return to our homes, rebuild our lives, and live in peace. Our lives are not a game.”

Nassar also added that once she heard about the negotiation talks, she began following them anxiously. Every day, she checks the news and constantly asks her husband and neighbors if they've heard any updates.

“When I hear about obstacles or major gaps between the two parties, I feel deeply depressed,” she told me. “Every minute makes a difference. We need a permanent ceasefire now. We are human beings — we've had enough of war. This torture must end.”

She added: “We want to return to our homes, rebuild our lives, and live in peace. Our lives are not a game.”

Nassar and Alkateeb are just two examples among hundreds of thousands of Gazans who remain steadfast in their dream of peace and dignity. They ask for nothing more than a chance to live a normal life, free from war and destruction.

As international calls for an immediate ceasefire grow louder, the question remains: Will these negotiations succeed in achieving lasting peace, or will we continue to endure recurring cycles of pain and devastation? Hope still lives, but it requires genuine support and sustained action from the international community to guarantee Gaza's right to life, freedom, and peace.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Yet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining. Why? Blatant political censorship from Big Tech.

This comes less than two weeks after Trump signed into law the largest Medicaid cuts in US history.

The Trump administration on Thursday said it will restrict waivers that have allowed states to keep kids enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program beyond the 12-month period of continuous coverage required under federal law.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), led by Mehmet Oz, announced the move on Thursday, saying that it has informed states of a “clear shift away from policies that extend beyond statutory limits,” specifically restricting Section 1115 waivers that have been sought and approved in dozens of states across the U.S.

“CMS will allow currently approved initiatives to run out their course but does not anticipate extending them nor approving new waivers,” the agency said in a statement, which came less than two weeks after President Donald Trump signed into law the largest Medicaid cuts in U.S. history.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, called the CMS announcement a “terrible development” and “yet one more awful example of the Trump administration's obsession with making it as hard as possible for Americans to access the healthcare they are eligible for.”

In 2022, Oregon became the first state in the nation to receive federal approval to provide children with continuous Medicaid coverage from birth up to age 6 through a Section 1115 waiver. The policy was described as a “ground-breaking initiative” that would “help infants and young children get off to a healthy start in life without parents having to worry about renewing their Medicaid coverage annually,” regardless of temporary changes to family income or other factors.

The CMS announcement points to the Oregon policy without explicitly naming the state. Oregon's federal waiver is set to expire in 2027.

Wyden said Thursday that “the Trump administration will stop at nothing to rip coverage away from American families, even kids they claim they want to protect.”

Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families, wrote that “in the name of ‘protecting vulnerable Americans,' the Trump administration will rip away Medicaid coverage from babies and toddlers.”

CMS insisted that the newly announced changes are aimed at protecting Medicaid's finances by ensuring that those who are no longer eligible for the program are removed.

But Amaya Diana, a policy analyst at the health research organization KFF, wrote Thursday that “not everyone who loses coverage at renewal is no longer eligible.”

“During the unwinding of the [pandemic-era] Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, seven in 10 Medicaid enrollees who lost coverage were disenrolled for procedural reasons,” Diana noted. “While some were no longer eligible, others lost coverage due to barriers such as communication issues.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Move by Marco Rubio is latest attempt by Trump administration to help former president avoid justice over alleged coup

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has reportedly stripped eight of Brazil's 11 supreme court judges of their US visas as the White House escalates its campaign to help the country's former president Jair Bolsonaro avoid justice over his alleged attempt to seize power with a military coup.

Bolsonaro, a far-right populist with ties to Donald Trump's Maga movement, is on trial for allegedly masterminding a murderous plot to cling to power after losing the 2022 election to his leftwing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro is expected to be convicted by the supreme court in the coming weeks and faces a jail sentence of up to 43 years.

As the day of judgment nears, Trump has been increasing pressure on the court and President Lula's administration. On 9 July, the US president announced he would impose 50% tariffs on all Brazilian imports as of 1 August, partly as a result of the supposed persecution of his ally. The move triggered an outpouring of nationalist anger in the South American country, with Lula describing it as “unacceptable blackmail”.

On Friday, after federal police raided Bolsonaro's house and fitted him with an electronic tag to stop him absconding, Rubio announced further moves in support of the defendant, who he claimed was the victim of a “political witch hunt”.

Writing on X, Rubio said he had ordered visa revocations for the judge leading the investigation into Bolsonaro, Alexandre de Moraes, as well as “his allies on the court” and their family members. Rubio did not name his other targets but the Brazilian newspaper O Globo identified them as Luís Roberto Barroso, José Antonio Dias Toffoli, Cristiano Zanin, Flávio Dino, Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha, Luiz Edson Fachin and Gilmar Ferreira Mendes.

Two other judges who were nominated to the court during Bolsonaro's 2019-23 presidency, André Mendonça and Kassio Nunes Marques, reportedly avoided the sanction, as did a third judge, Luiz Fux.

Lula denounced what he called “another arbitrary and completely groundless measure from the US government”.

“Interference in another country's justice system is unacceptable and offends the basic principles of national sovereignty and respect between nations,” the president said on Saturday, adding: “I'm certain that no kind of intimidation or threat – from whoever it may be – will compromise the most important mission of our nation's powers and institutions, which is to act permanently to defend and safeguard the democratic rule of law.”

The Trump strategist Alex Bruesewitz welcomed Rubio's announcement, calling Bolsonaro's treatment “sick and wrong”.

Bolsonaro's congressman son, Eduardo, thanked Rubio for his decision. “Thank you very much for this fight in favor of free speech, we do believe in the same values,” tweeted Eduardo, who has been living in the US since February and has reportedly been lobbying officials there over his father's plight.

Trump's interventions have appalled millions of Brazilians who hope to see their former leader held responsible for the alleged coup attempt, which culminated in the 8 January riots in Brasília.

Lula's institutional relations minister, Gleisi Hoffmann, called the visa cancellations “an aggressive and petty retaliation” and “an affront to the Brazilian judiciary and national sovereignty”.

Even influential rightwing voices have criticised the US's attempt to meddle in one of the world's most populous democracies by imposing 50% tariffs.

On Saturday, the conservative Estado de São Paulo newspaper described Trump's behaviour as “unacceptable external interference in Brazil's domestic matters”. “Trump has not only attacked our national sovereignty … [but also] stained the history of diplomatic relations between the two largest democracies in the Americas,” the newspaper's editorial board wrote.

While the Bolsonaros have hailed Trump's actions, they also appear to have grasped how the announcement of tariffs has backfired, allowing Lula to pose as a nationalist defender of Brazilian interests and paint the Bolsonaro clan as self-serving “traitors”.

Lula, who had been facing growing public disillusionment and an uphill battle to win re-election next year, has enjoyed a bounce in the polls since Trump launched his trade war, the brunt of which will be borne by coffee producers and cattle ranchers in Bolsonaro-voting regions, such as São Paulo.

Celso Rocha de Barros, a political columnist, said he suspected the Bolsonaros had been blindsided by the scale of Trump's attack.

“I think [Bolsonaro] wanted some kind of penalty - something he could use to say: ‘Look, Brazil's being punished because of Bolsonaro's persecution. But [the tariffs] went far too far … [they] screwed Bolsonaro's base,” said Rocha de Barros, pointing to their potential impact on agribusiness.

On Friday night, Bolsonaro's senator son, Flávio, post on X, calling on Trump to suspend the tariffs and replace them with individual sanctions. Soon after, however, he deleted the post.

The masked, plainclothes ICE agents terrorizing immigrant communities are indistinguishable from racist vigilantes. 

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

For weeks, unidentifiable men and women wearing neck gaiters, mismatched camouflage attire, gloves and baseball caps have stood outside hearing rooms at the federal immigration courthouse in Lower Manhattan. They block stairwells and elevators, waiting for immigrants to leave mandatory court appointments, before handcuffing them and taking them to processing centers. Family members may wait days before finding out where their loved ones are being held — or if they're even still in the country. 

As U.S. immigration officials seek to arrest more than a million people this year, an army of plainclothes law enforcement agents has dispersed across the country. They arrive in unmarked vehicles while only their eyes peek out from a balaclava. Their bulletproof vests may identify them as “police” or a “federal agent” but often offer no hint as to their agency or division. They arrest workers at grocery stores and car washes and detain people near churches. They've been recorded smashing a car window to detain an asylum seeker, blamed for breaking doors and accused of intimidating reporters.

For undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers, the specter of an arrest lurks behind every trip outside. For people in these communities, the fear of being quickly deported is now accompanied by a new concern: that they may be kidnapped by individuals pretending to be law enforcement officers. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Legal experts, federal legislators and immigration activists told Truthout that by concealing their identities, immigration enforcement personnel have created fertile ground for impersonators to endanger the general public by posing as law police or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

“It's creating a lot of fear, of not knowing who these people are, of suddenly people approaching you to tell you and asking your name and your immigration status on the screen when they don't even have identification,” Rufina Reyes, the director of Washington-based grassroots organization La Resistencia, told Truthout while speaking through an interpreter. “Without any ID, without anything that can accredit them that they are legitimate, we could be exposed to a possible kidnapping, and that's basically what's happening.”

In February, a South Carolina man was charged with kidnapping, impersonating a law enforcement officer and other crimes after video footage emerged of him confronting a Latino driver and telling the man he was going to be sent back to Mexico. In April, a man was arrested in Florida after allegedly pulling in front of a vehicle and demanding the identification and immigration status of two men. The same month, a Florida woman was arrested after allegedly kidnapping her ex-boyfriend's wife while wearing a t-shirt that said “ICE,” referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and covering her face with a mask. In early June, a man posing as an ICE agent in Philadelphia reportedly robbed an automobile shop, zip-typing a woman in the process and saying that he “was going to take undocumented employees into custody.” Less than a week later, a man allegedly disguised as law enforcement fatally shot Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, her husband and their dog.

In recent weeks, immigration officers' deployment of face coverings has emerged as a focus for legislators across various levels of government, who have argued that their widespread use allows immigration personnel to act as an unaccountable secret police force. As agencies including the FBI and IRS assist with immigration enforcement operations, legal rights organizations have argued that the inability to identify agents poses problems for oversight.

“We would normally be trying to follow a paper trail and verify that paper trail against what we actually see happening on ground, and can't do that if you don't even know who is who is doing what,” Naureen Shah, director of government affairs for the equality division of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told Truthout.

In response, Democrats have begun introducing bills to ensure that federal immigration agents are clearly identifiable.

“We need to bring a national standard to ICE agents, and we need to bring transparency and accountability,” Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-New York), told Truthout. Velázquez introduced federal legislation in June to prohibit ICE agents from wearing facial coverings and mandate that agents have clothes displaying their name and affiliation with ICE while making arrests. “If we accept, as Americans, this kind of secrecy and abuse against immigrants, it's only a matter of time before it is used against American citizens too.”

That has already happened.

On July 2, the ACLU of Southern California and other legal organizations filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of immigration raids around Los Angeles. The legal claim noted that “numerous U.S. citizens who work, reside, or just happen to be in neighborhoods with large numbers of people of color” are “also getting swept up.” The same day, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund demanded the federal government pay $1 million in damages to a U.S. citizen who was detained by federal immigration officers at a Home Depot.

For years, legal organizations have argued that the deceptive tactics used by ICE agents to make arrests violate the Fourth Amendment. ICE agents have long represented themselves as local police officers or pretended to be delivery workers by carrying fake business emblems, according to training materials obtained by the Immigrant Defense Project in 2014. The organization has said that ICE's use of ruses has escalated since 2017.

But historians and law enforcement experts say the current omnipresent use of face coverings is a departure from longstanding practices by federal law enforcement conducting immigration operations.

Despite the legal efforts to rein in their tactics, ICE personnel have vast authority. They can conduct arrests without a warrant. They can carry out operations in areas of private businesses that are considered publicly accessible, like a restaurant dining area. They don't have to offer badge numbers or names, though they are supposed to identify themselves as an “immigration officer” after an arrest is made.

From California to New York, stories have emerged of agents refusing to state their agency affiliation while carrying out operations. In June, footage emerged of ICE agents on Long Island detaining a Hispanic U.S. citizen. Elzon Lemus, who was pulled over while driving to work, said that the agents refused to say what agency they represented even as he sat handcuffed on the street. On the other side of the country, ICE personnel arrested U.S. citizen Andrea Velez, accusing her of assaulting a federal officer. Velez said that she did not assault an officer and was racially profiled, and that the people who arrested her didn't identify themselves. 

These tactics prompted furious outcry from Democratic politicians, who have compared ICE's actions to those used by authoritarian regimes and extremist groups. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said that she “will never accept these unlawful and chaotic raids.” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu compared ICE agents to NSC-131, a New England-based neo-Nazi group. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Donald Trump was using federal immigration officers as a “modern-day Gestapo.”

“The KKK would mask themselves,” Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-New York) told Truthout during a phone call. 

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE have balked at these comparisons and framed calls to unmask agents as attempts to endanger the lives of the armed federal officers that rove in large groups. Agency officials have argued that facial coverings help protect officers.

“Every day the men and women of ICE put their lives on the line to protect and defend the lives of American citizens. Make no mistake, Democrat politicians like Hakeem Jeffries, Mayor Wu of Boston, Governor Tim Walz, and Mayor [Karen] Bass of Los Angeles are contributing to the surge in assaults of our ICE officers through their repeated vilification and demonization of ICE,” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in an email sent to Truthout via a spokesperson. “From comparisons to the modern-day Nazi gestapo to glorifying rioters, the violent rhetoric of these sanctuary politicians is despicable. This violence against ICE must end.”

In response to a query sent by Truthout, the agency claimed that assaults against ICE law enforcement have risen 700 percent, but did not provide details about how that figure was calculated or how many people have been charged for the alleged assaults. They also did not say if instances like the arrest of New York City Comptroller Brad Lander — who was arrested in June and accused of assaulting a law enforcement official after he tried to escort a migrant past agents seeking to detain him — counted toward that number. Others have noted that an increase in confrontations between officers and protesters is not surprising given the dramatic rise in encounters between ICE and the public under the Trump administration as officers seek to conduct 3,000 arrests per day to meet. 

Civil rights experts, immigrant advocacy groups and Democratic lawmakers told Truthout these arguments don't hold water and view such statements as justifications for an immigration enforcement apparatus set on drastically expanding the scope of its authority. 

Since taking office, the Trump administration has dramatically expanded the scope of immigration enforcement practices by deporting people to countries where they have no ties, refusing to communicate with local police agencies ahead of enforcement actions, ignoring court orders, ramping up arrests of people without criminal convictions, detaining green card holders and cancelling bond hearings for immigrants who arrive in the U.S. illegally, meaning they will be detained for the entirety of court proceedings.

Set against this backdrop, the unidentifiable immigration agents are just another symbol of a government agency that wants to act with unchecked power.

The masking “represents the normalization of a class of federal agents, a class of law enforcement that has even more impunity to operate as it wishes in communities,” Emanuel Gomez Gonzalez, a member of Durham, North Carolina- based immigrant-rights nonprofit Siembra NC, which helps people understand their legal rights, told Truthout. “If we are asking people to record interactions, but the officer never identifies themselves, there is never any way to hold them accountable for actions that they're captured committing that are apparent violations of constitutional rights.”

That lack of accountability has been fostered for decades, Alex Vitale, the coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College, told Truthout.

“This deportation machine was created by the Democrats. Beginning with Clinton, the Democrats created massive investments in harsher legal frameworks, massive expansions of the resources for border enforcement, [and] a rhetorical acceptance of the deportations,” Vitale said. “Obama oversaw the highest levels of deportations in the nation's history, and then Trump inherits that and further ramps it up. They're all throwing up their arms like, oh my god, fascism just fell from the sky.”

New legislative efforts to rein in ICE's authority will face both the political challenge of getting passed and the practical question of whether federal agents would adhere to new restrictions on their conduct.

Even so, those legislative efforts are occurring at the local, state, and federal level. In California, two state lawmakers introduced legislation to prohibit most law enforcement officials from covering their faces and mandate that they be identifiable by their uniform. 

Alex Marthews, the national chair of anti-surveillance group Restore the Fourth, told Truthout that his organization has been working with lawmakers in Massachusetts municipalities to pass ordinances that would require ICE officers to show proof of their agency affiliation and identity when asked by local police.

Such legislation could be “really powerful,” said Naureen Shah of the ACLU. 

“People who are in law enforcement do not want to be scrutinized by the public,” Shah said. “So if you are law enforcement who doesn't want to be questioned about what you're doing, you may be less likely to show up at a city if they are asking people for ID.”

In addition to the legislation introduced by Velázquez, Representatives Dan Goldman and Adriano Espaillat, introduced another piece of legislation that would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require that DHS officers show their faces, identify which component of DHS they work for, and wear official insignia. On July 8, two Democratic senators released legislation that would require ICE agents to display their agency affiliation and badge number or name. Such legislation is virtually certain to stall with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress, a fact Velázquez acknowledged during her call with Truthout. House Speaker Mike Johnson has scoffed at the suggestion that ICE agents should be identifiable. 

Even so, skeptics have viewed the proposals as weak efforts to rein in ICE's authority. The bill proposed by Velázquez would permit DHS to determine disciplinary action for officers who are deemed to have unnecessarily concealed their identity, while the legislation introduced by Goldman and Espaillat did not specify how agents could be punished. 

Vitale referred to these legislative efforts as “accountability theater” and argued they suffer from a more significant problem: merely requiring that law enforcement personnel are identifiable does little to curtail abuses of power. 

“The problem here is that people are stuck in a fantasy of liberal legal formalism that imagines that police are accountable to the public, but this is a fantasy people labor under that causes them to produce these completely naive and unrealistic ideas about police accountability,” Vitale said. “Even if you knew the identity of a federal agent who you believe is engaged in misconduct, there's still no effective remedy for that.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Experts warn that the dangerous ideologically driven cuts at HHS will have long-term consequences for healthcare 

The Trump administration's “war on science” appears to have entered a new phase in the aftermath of a recent supreme court decision that empowered health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a prominent vaccine sceptic, and other agency leaders, to implement mass firings – effectively greenlighting the politicization of science.

The decision comes as Kennedy abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting of a key health care advisory panel, the US Preventive Services Task Force, earlier this month. That, combined with his recent removal of a panel of more than a dozen vaccine advisers, signals that his dismantling of the science-based policymaking at HHS is likely far from over.

“The current administration is waging a war on science,” warned Celine Gounder, a professor of medicine and an infectious disease expert at New York University in a keynote talk in May to graduates of Harvard's School of Public Health.

“Today we see rising threats to the public health institutions that have kept our world safe for generations,” she said, citing “cuts to research that benefits the lives of millions, looming public health emergencies that are not being addressed with the urgency they demand, and a continued coordinated attack on the very idea of the scientific process.”

Gounder added: “Over the past few months, we have seen the Trump administration engage not only in medical misinformation, but in active censorship of scientific discourse.”

Since he took the helm at HHS, Kennedy's unscientific views on vaccines and some other medical matters coupled with the agency's widespread research and staff cuts, have prompted protests from scientists inside and outside HHS plus lawsuits.

Medical experts say Kennedy's policies are helping “sow distrust in vaccines” as measles cases soar to a more than three decade high, hurt vital healthcare research with draconian cuts, and helped foment a Trump administration “war on science” mentality.

Kennedy sparked a firestorm in June by ousting 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends vaccines to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and votes to provide updates to its vaccine schedule. He then named a new eight person vaccine panel – half of whom share Kennedy's distrust of vaccines – who quickly retracted recommendations for flu vaccines containing an ingredient which many anti-vaxxers have falsely connected to autism.

That move sparked sharp criticism from veteran doctors with a national pediatric group, which opted to boycott its first meeting.

“Among the reasons we decided not to participate was because it clearly appeared to be an orchestrated effort to sow distrust in vaccines,” Sean O'Leary who chairs a committee on infectious diseases with the American Academy of Pediatrics, told the Guardian.

Dissent has also spread at the National Institutes of Health, where dozens of science researchers and other staff in June released a detailed document, dubbed the Bethesda Declaration, warning that key missions of the premiere research agency at HHS were being damaged by the Trump administration's budget cutting.

Even before these moves, prominent healthcare scholars were sounding loud alarms about some HHS policies and the administration's anti-science mentality – including its draconian budget cuts for research and staff cuts totaling over 10,000.

Gounder said there has been a “flood of Orwellian doublespeak from public health agencies”, contributing to declining vaccination rates and making Americans more susceptible to diseases like measles, which recently hit a level not seen since 2000 when measles was declared eliminated in the US.

Her critique has been amplified by public protests from healthcare experts troubled by its vaccine policies and large cuts to research and staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the NIH and other parts of HHS.

On a separate legal front, a Rhode Island federal court in July ruled against HHS and Kennedy and put a temporary stop to the drastic revamping of HHS and some of its staff cuts.

The ruling provided a court victory to a group of 19 Democratic state attorneys general, plus the District of Columbia, which in May sued Kennedy – plus other HHS leaders such as the FDA commissioner and the CDC's acting director – attacking the restructuring as an “unconstitutional and illegal dismantling” of the agency. Kennedy, they alleged, has “systematically deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job”.

The Rhode Island judge wrote that as members of the executive branch, Kennedy and the HHS do “not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress”.

For his part, Kennedy in March issued a statement defending the early HHS move to cut 10,000 full-time jobs: “We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”

Those jobs have since been cut, as of Monday 14 July, after an 8 July order from the supreme court that allowed the restructuring plans to proceed. Many employees who were supposed to be laid off during the agency's first round of 10,000 layoffs in April have been in limbo as the order made its way through the court system and later paused by federal judges. The reorganization, in addition to cutting staff, was supposed to consolidate the department's 28 divisions into 15 and cut regional offices from 10 to five.

Democrats in Congress too have voiced strong alarms about the thousands of HHS job cuts and their adverse impacts on healthcare and science.

Ten congressional Democrats led by congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, whose district is home to thousands of NIH and FDA workers, wrote to Kennedy in March demanding the rehiring of thousands of illegally fired workers, warning of the “harmful consequences” for patient healthcare and science research.

Raskin told the Guardian that Kennedy and the Trump administration's actions reveal a “complete disregard for the law making powers of Congress. Trump wants to be both the implementer of the laws and the legislative branch, but that is not his job. It's totally unconstitutional. They're trying to cut off funds that have been lawfully appropriated by Congress”.

O'Leary and many other medical experts warn that the dangerous ideologically driven cuts at HHS will have long-term consequences.

“What we're seeing across HHS is deeply concerning,” said O'Leary “NIH funding has never been politically or ideologically driven, but clearly that's what we're seeing now. Those cuts are going to have serious consequences for our country and healthcare.”

Editor's Note: This story has been updated with new details about the attack.

Cyber specialists from Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) carried out a large-scale cyberattack against the network infrastructure of Russian energy giant Gazprom, causing significant disruptions, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent on July 18.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Gazprom and Russian authorities have not publicly commented on the reported incident.

The alleged operation took place on July 17 and targeted systems used by Gazprom and its subsidiaries, which Ukraine's intelligence claims are directly involved in supporting Russia's war effort. 

Gazprom is Russia's state-owned energy company, one of the world's largest gas producers and exporters.

The cyberattack allegedly destroyed large volumes of data and installed custom software designed to further damage the company's information systems.

"The degradation of Russian information systems to the technological Middle Ages continues," the source within the HUR told the Kyiv Independent. 

"We congratulate Russian 'cyber specialists' on this new achievement and recommend they gradually replace their mice and keyboards with hammers and pincers."

According to the source, access to Gazprom's internal systems was disabled for nearly 20,000 system administrators, and backup copies of key databases were wiped. The attack reportedly affected approximately 390 subsidiary companies and branches, including Gazprom Teplo Energo, Gazprom Obl Energo, and Gazprom Energozbyt.

In a later message on July 19, the source provided additional details on what was destroyed. 

"As a result of the cyber operation, the corporation's records of contracts, schedules, and tariffs were destroyed, including data on who and how much gas/oil should be supplied, data on payments, taxes, Gazprom's financial balances, information on the corporation's licenses and legal agreements." 

Data for systems that manage pressure, costs, gas and oil balances, and data on Gazprom's wells and networks were also destroyed, the source added. 

The source provided a video and screenshots that appeared to show access deep within the Russian databases, though the Kyiv Independent could not verify the authenticity of the evidence. 

Hundreds of terabytes of data were downloaded by the Ukrainian hackers prior to their deletion from the Russian systems, the source said. 

The sources said the attackers managed to destroy clusters of "extremely powerful" servers running 1C, a software widely used for managing documents and contracts, analytics data for pipelines, valves, pumps, and SCADA systems — key elements in operating Gazprom's technical infrastructure. 

Multiple servers reportedly had operating systems removed or disabled, and the BIOS (basic firmware) of many devices was damaged, making them inoperable without physical repairs.

President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 19 announced the updated composition of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, following the country's latest government reshuffle. While most members remain the same, one notable change is the appointment of Rustem Umerov as the council's new secretary.

A new initiative will examine how the Ukrainian language describes foreign locations while at home, with the aim of standardizing and promoting a Ukrainian spelling, said Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.

Pavlohrad, a city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast that has become a key humanitarian aid hub for those evacuating the front lines, suffered one of its most severe attacks of the war, Governor Serhii Lysak said on July 19. 

In what could be one of the last visits by journalists to Pokrovsk, the Kyiv Independent spent 24 hours in the front-line city, embedded with a drone team of Ukraine's 68th Jaeger Brigade.

At least one person was killed and three were injured as a fire engulfed a residential building amid a Russian drone attack on Odesa overnight on July 19.

Russian strikes killed at least seven people and injured 31 others in multiple regions over the past 24 hours, Ukrainian regional authorities said on July 19.

The cyberattack allegedly destroyed large volumes of data and installed custom software designed to further damage the company's information systems.

Russia has lost 1,040,950 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on July 19.

Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on July 18 signed an order withdrawing Moscow from a military technical cooperation agreement with Germany amid strained relations between the two countries.

The "Darts" twin-engine strike drone is capable of traveling over 40 kilometers (25 miles) and carries a payload of 12-14 kilograms as opposed to the company's pre-existing single engine drone which can handle a maximum of 8 kilograms.

Russian air defense units intercepted 13 drones flying towards Moscow in under two hours, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reported at around 1:46 a.m. local time on July 19.

The U.S. will send its next Patriot system to Germany rather than Switzerland, in order to speed up Berlin's shipment of two Patriot batteries to Ukraine,  officials said. 

The tanks were promised to Kyiv in October 2024, but delivery was reportedly delayed due to resistance from the U.S. The remaining tanks will arrive "in the coming months."

"I will be looking for a person to lead this area," First Deputy Prime Minister and Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov wrote.

Move seeks to quell controversy that has engulfed the administration since it said it would not release more files from Epstein's sex trafficking case

Donald Trump said on Saturday that he had asked the justice department to release all grand jury testimony in Jeffrey Epstein's case. In a post on Truth Social, the president declared that even if the court gave its “full and unwavering support” that “nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics making the request”:

I have asked the Justice Department to release all Grand Jury testimony with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, subject only to Court Approval. With that being said, and even if the Court gave its full and unwavering approval, nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics making the request. It will always be more, more, more. MAGA!

While colleges and universities slow down during summer break, Ahniwake Rose is busy wondering what the fall semester will hold for the nation's 37 tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) – and if they will be able to stay open much longer.

As the president and CEO of the Indigenous non-profit American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), Rose (Cherokee and Muscogee Creek) braces as the schools she represents face a potential nearly 90% reduction in funding starting in October.

Donald Trump's fiscal year 2026 budget includes a proposal to slash operations funding from $183.3m to $22.1m for bureau of Indian education post-secondary programs – career and technical schools, community colleges, four-year colleges and universities. On 15 July, a House appropriations subcommittee approved legislation that allotted $1.5bn to the bureau of Indian education, though it did not specify how much would go toward post-secondary programs. Congress still needs to finish approving the budget for the bureau of Indian education, a subdivision of the Department of Interior.

Maryland's Democratic representative Jamie Raskin has joined in on public calls for the Donald Trump administration to release the entirety of the Jeffrey Epstein files, saying on X:

We don't need Trump or Bondi to sift through the stack and tell America what they think is ‘credible' in the Epstein files. Thanks, but no thanks—we'll decide ourselves. The president should stop playing us for fools and suckers. Release everything—now.

Raskin echoed similar sentiments on MSNBC, saying about the Trump administration:

Their policies are hurting our people and we've got to turn it around. And let's start by having some truth and clearing the air over this whole Epstein affair as quickly as possible.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Friday it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees. One union leader said the moves “will devastate public health in our country”.

The agency's office of research and development (ORD) has long provided the scientific underpinnings for the EPA's mission to protect the environment and human health. The EPA said in May it would shift its scientific expertise and research efforts to program offices that focus on major issues such as air and water.

The agency said on Friday it is creating a new office of applied science and environmental solutions that will allow it to focus on research and science “more than ever before”.

Once fully implemented, the changes will save the EPA nearly $750m, officials said.

Amid the buzz surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files, Donald Trump insisted on Saturday that the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have completely “obliterated” the sites.

Writing on TruthSocial, Trump said:

All three nuclear sites in Iran were completely destroyed and/or OBLITERATED. It would take years to bring them back into service and, if Iran wanted to do so, they would be much better off starting anew, in three different locations, prior to those sites being obliterated, should they decide to do so. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Trump's post comes after a new NBC report, which cited five current and former US officials familiar with a recent US assessment of the strikes, said that two of the three sites were not “as badly damaged”.

The news report, which was released on Thursday, added that two out of the three sites were “degraded only to a point where nuclear enrichment could resume in the next several months if Iran wants it to”.

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has reportedly stripped eight of Brazil's 11 supreme court judges of their US visas as the White House escalates its campaign to help the country's former president Jair Bolsonaro avoid justice over his alleged attempt to seize power with a military coup.

Bolsonaro, a far-right populist with ties to Donald Trump's Maga movement, is on trial for allegedly masterminding a murderous plot to cling to power after losing the 2022 election to his leftwing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro is expected to be convicted by the supreme court in the coming weeks and faces a jail sentence of up to 43 years.

As the day of judgment nears, Trump has been increasing pressure on the court and President Lula's administration. On 9 July, the US president announced he would impose 50% tariffs on all Brazilian imports as of 1 August, partly as a result of the supposed persecution of his ally. The move triggered an outpouring of nationalist anger in the South American country, with Lula describing it as “unacceptable blackmail”.

After years of heated attacks on the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, the Trump administration has begun suggesting recent costly renovations at the central bank's Washington DC buildings could justify firing Powell.

Donald Trump's antipathy for Powell stems mainly from the central bank boss's refusal to lower interest rates – something the president has repeatedly called for.

Recent comments from the supreme court suggested firing Powell could be unconstitutional, but that hasn't stopped the White House from getting creative.

Any move by the White House to formally dismiss the Fed chair would be unprecedented. The president has historically respected the independence of the central bank, and kept out of its way – even if there was disagreement over policy.

The Trump administration has decided to destroy $9.7m worth of contraceptives rather than send them abroad to women in need.

A state department spokesperson confirmed that the decision had been made – a move that will cost US taxpayers $167,000. The contraceptives are primarily long-acting, such as IUDs and birth control implants, and were almost certainly intended for women in Africa, according to two senior congressional aides, one of whom visited a warehouse in Belgium that housed the contraceptives. It is not clear to the aides whether the destruction has already been carried out, but said they had been told that it was set to occur by the end of July.

“It is unacceptable that the state department would move forward with the destruction of more than $9m in taxpayer-funded family planning commodities purchased to support women in crisis settings, including war zones and refugee camps,” Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic senator from New Hampshire, said in a statement. Shaheen and Brian Schatz, a Democratic senator from Hawaii, have introduced legislation to stop the destruction.

“This is a waste of US taxpayer dollars and an abdication of US global leadership in preventing unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and maternal deaths,” added Shaheen, who in June sent a letter to the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, about the matter.

The department decided to destroy the contraceptives because it could not sell them to any “eligible buyers”, in part because of US laws and rules that prohibit sending US aid to organizations that provide abortion services, counsel people about the procedure or advocate for the right to it overseas, according to the state department spokesperson.

The “Make America Great Again” (Maga) base is in revolt as never before. The trigger was Donald Trump's broken promise to publicly release details about Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier and convicted sex offender, who was facing federal charges of sex-trafficking minors when he died in jail in 2019.

Spurred by the president and his allies, Trump's movement has long latched on to the Epstein scandal, claiming the existence of a secret client list and that he was murdered in his cell as part of a cover-up. But last week the justice department and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced there was no evidence that the disgraced financier kept such a list or was blackmailing powerful figures.

Far from closing the case, the memo deepened supporters' obsession and sense of grievance. A movement defined by the view that elites rig the system against them felt cheated. Trump made efforts to douse the flames with ever-shifting explanations, excuses and distractions but merely poured fuel on the fire.

To some, his erratic and evasive behaviour implies a guilty secret. It also evokes a line from President John F Kennedy's 1961 inaugural address: “Those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.” Having spent years embracing QAnon-tinged propaganda that casts him as the only saviour who can demolish the “deep state”, Trump is now seen as co-opted by its corrupt bureaucracy.

Brazil's judiciary will not be intimidated by a US decision to target officials involved in the trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro with visa bans, a senior judicial official said late on Friday, criticising the move as arbitrary, according to Reuters.

In an escalation of tensions between US President Donald Trump and the government of Latin America's largest economy, Washington imposed visa restrictions on Friday on supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes, his family and other unnamed court officials. The visa bans were a response to the supreme court's decision to issue search warrants and restraining orders targeting Trump ally Bolsonaro, who is accused of plotting a coup to overturn the results of a 2022 election he lost.

Solicitor general Jorge Messias, the top judicial official for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's executive branch, said in a statement posted on X that prosecutor general Paulo Gonet was also targeted by the ban. “Rest assured that no improper manoeuvre or sordid conspiratorial act will intimidate our country's judiciary in the independent and dignified exercise of its task,” he added.

According to Reuters, Messias said the Brazilian officials were subject to “arbitrary acts of visa revocation by a foreign nation on account of their fulfilment of their legitimate institutional responsibilities in accordance with constitutional terms”.

In addition to Moraes, seven other justices from Brazil's 11-member supreme court were also hit by the US visa restrictions, government institutional relations minister Gleisi Hoffmann said on Friday. They include justices Luís Roberto Barroso, Dias Toffoli, Cristiano Zanin, Flávio Dino, Cármen Lúcia, Edson Fachin, and Gilmar Mendes.

The prosecutor general's office and the supreme court did not immediately respond to Reuter's requests for comment.

Trump has criticised the proceedings against Bolsonaro as a “witch-hunt”, a term he has used to describe his own treatment by political opponents, and has called for the charges to be dropped. In a letter last week, he announced a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods starting 1 August, opening the message with criticism of the trial.

Bolsonaro is on trial before Brazil's supreme court on charges of plotting a coup to stop Lula from taking office in January 2023. Bolsonaro has denied that he led an attempt to overthrow the government but has acknowledged taking part in meetings aimed at reversing the election's outcome.

Cpt Adam VanGerpen, public information officer for the Los Angeles fire department told ABC that people inside the club came out to help in the minutes before emergency crews arrived to help the victims, after a vehicle drove into a crowd along Santa Monica Boulevard in East Hollywood.
 According to the Associated Press (AP), he said:

They were all standing in line going into a nightclub. There was a taco cart out there, so they were … getting some food, waiting to go in. And there's also a valet line there. The valet podium was taken out, the taco truck was taken out, and then a large number of people were impacted by the vehicle.

SINGAPORE — Ichika Kajimoto became the first-ever Japanese to capture a world title in open water swimming, taking the gold in the women's 3-kilometer knockout sprint on Saturday at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore.

Kajimoto finished first in the 500-meter final in the event that was added to the world championships program for the first time. Italy's Ginevra Taddeucci finished second, while Australia's Moesha Johnson and Hungary's Bettina Fabian tied for the bronze.

Kajimoto had finished second behind Taddeucci in their 1,500-meter preliminary heat, then second again behind Johnson in the 1,000-meter semifinals.

The victory came a day after Kajimoto won the bronze medal in the 5-kilometer open water race. On Wednesday, she placed eighth in the 10-kilometer event.

Kajimoto's journey in Singapore will not be limited to the outdoor competition. She also plans to compete in the pool in the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-meter freestyle events.

            Police in Brazil swooped on the home and political headquarters of Jair Bolsonaro early Friday, searching the properties and ordering the former president to wear an electronic ankle tag.
    


            The right-winger and ally of US President Donald Trump was also barred from speaking to foreign officials or approaching embassies, and banned from social media, under orders of Brazil's Supreme Court.
    


            The restrictions were motivated by concerns that Bolsonaro would flee the country, amid his trial over an alleged plot to overturn the results of the 2022 presidential election, which he lost to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro has denied wrongdoing.
    


            Speaking outside the police station Friday, Bolsonaro called the ankle tag a “supreme humiliation” and said that he “never thought of leaving Brazil.”
    


            “The suspicions (of me leaving the country) are an exaggeration… damn it, I'm a former president of the republic – I'm 70 years old,” he said.
    


            Bolsonaro added that police seized “about 14,000 US dollars” and claimed the money was for personal use, adding he had the receipts to prove it.
    


            Hours after the ruling, the US State Department announced visa restrictions against Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes and an unspecified number of other court officials, accusing them of carrying out a “political witch hunt” against Bolsonaro.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement said he had “ordered visa revocations for Moraes and his allies on the court, as well as their immediate family members effective immediately.”
    


            Moraes made headlines last year when he banned social media platform X, during a feud with its billionaire owner – and former Trump ally – Elon Musk, over hate speech moderation and the company's failure to name a legal representative in the country, as required by law.  The platform has since been restored in the nation of 220 million people.
    


            Lula denounced Rubio's order in a Saturday morning statement on X, characterizing the visa revocation as an “unacceptable” interference in Brazil's justice system.
    


            Friday's raid came after Trump tried to force Lula to end the criminal trial against Bolsonaro, by threatening crippling tariffs on the country. Trump linked the tariff threat to what he described as a “witch hunt” trial against Bolsonaro.
    


            About a week later, the US launched an investigation into “unfair” trading practices by Brazil, according to a statement by the United States Trade Representative.
    


            Brazil's Supreme Court on Friday accused Bolsonaro and his son Eduardo of working with the US to impose the tariffs. CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment on this allegation.
    


            The court documents highlighted a confidential meeting Bolsonaro had with a US State Department official, and highlighted Trump's letter as an “offensive” and “clear threat” to Brazilian sovereignty.
    


            In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Bolsonaro denied that anyone lobbied the US to sanction Brazilian authorities working on his case.
    


            “There isn't any lobby to sanction an authority,” Bolsonaro said.
    


Speaking exclusively to CNN Thursday, Lula said that Trump's threats had broken from protocol, and argued that his predecessor's fate cannot be part of trade negotiations.
    


            “The judiciary branch of power in Brazil is independent. The president of the Republic has no influence whatsoever,” he said, adding that Bolsonaro “is not being judged personally. He is being judged by the acts he tried to organize a coup d'etat.”

            Lula added that Trump would be standing trial if the actions he took during the insurrection of January 6, 2021 had been committed in Brazil.
    


            On Friday, Trump posted a letter to Bolsonaro on Truth Social, in which he suggested the former Brazilian leader was the victim of an “unjust system,” and said that he would be “watching closely.”
    


            Bolsonaro posted Trump's letter on his official X account and, in a subsequent video, thanked Trump for his support with “eternal gratitude.”
    


            Bolsonaro had previously appeared to be preparing for the outcome of his trial and dismissed the idea that he might be considered a flight risk, saying: “I'll face the process.”
    


            “I'm not considering doing anything, I'm not considering anything, nothing at all,” he said, adding: “I'm not a criminal, the criminal is the one persecuting me.”
    


            Bolsonaro could face more than four decades behind bars if found guilty of masterminding the coup.
    


            He is among 34 people charged with five crimes, including attempting the coup. Part of the coup plot, prosecutors allege, involved a plan to potentially assassinate Lula, his vice president and a minister of the Supreme Court.
    


            Brian Winter, executive vice president of Americas Society and Council of the Americas, told CNN that Trump's mooted use of trade levers may not be so painful to Brazil – for which the US is not as significant a trading partner as, say, China.
    


            “Brazil only sends about 11% of its exports to the United States,” Winter said. “That's half what Brazil sends to China, and for some of Brazil's exports – not all, but for some of them – they can find other markets besides the United States.”
    


            “The question is, if this keeps escalating, could President Trump use measures that are even more painful, such as financial sanctions against large groups of people?” Winter asked, noting that Trump previously threatened, among other things, a travel ban on Colombian citizens during a disagreement with the Colombian government over migrant flights.
    


            “It's possible that President Trump could continue to escalate this in a way that could eventually produce considerably more pain for the Brazilian government and for the Brazilian people,” Winter said.

The announcement came after an analysis of 2024 enrollment data from Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Affordable Care Act Exchange.

DOHA, July 19. /TASS/. The Houthis delivered a missile strike on Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, using a hypersonic ballistic missile, the Yemeni rebel group's military spokesperson Yahya Saree said.

"Missile troops <…> conducted a unique military operation delivering a strike on Lod Airport (Ben Gurion Airport - TASS), using a Palestine-2 type hypersonic ballistic missile," Saree said in a statement broadcast by the Houthi-controlled television channel Al Masirah.

According to the rebels' spokesperson, the operation "successfully achieved its objective." As a result of the strike, he claimed, Israel's key airport suspended operations, and millions of Israelis "were forced to run for shelter."

On Friday evening, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a missile launched from Yemen had been intercepted. The sirens sounded in several areas in the Jewish state amid the missile threat.

After the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the Gaza Strip in 2023, the Houthis warned that they would launch strikes on Israeli territory while barring ships associated with the Jewish state from passing through the waters of the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait until Tel Aviv ceased its military operation against Palestinian group Hamas in the embattled enclave. The attacks stopped after a ceasefire was introduced in the Palestinian enclave in mid-January but the rebels warned they would resume strikes on Israeli vessels in the Red Sea after the ceasefire regime was breached in early March. Attempts to attack facilities on Israeli soil, including Ben Gurion Airport, have been made ever since.

WESTBURY, N.Y. (AP) — A man who was pulled into an MRI machine in New York after he walked into the room wearing a large weight-training chain around his neck has died, according to police and his wife, who told a local television outlet that he waved goodbye before his body went limp.

The man, 61, had entered an MRI room while a scan was underway Wednesday afternoon at Nassau Open MRI. The machine's strong magnetic force drew him in by the metallic chain around his neck, according to a release from the Nassau County Police Department.

He died Thursday afternoon, but a police officer who answered the phone at the Nassau County police precinct where the MRI facility is located said the department had not yet been given permission to release the name Saturday.

Adrienne Jones-McAllister told News 12 Long Island in a recorded interview that she was undergoing an MRI on her knee when she asked the technician to get her husband, Keith McAllister, to help her get off the table. She said she called out to him.

She told News 12 that the technician summoned into the room her husband, who was wearing a 20-pound chain that he uses for weight training, an object they'd had a casual conversation about during a previous visit with comments like: “Ooooooh, that's a big chain!”

When he got close to her, she said, “at that instant, the machine switched him around, pulled him in and he hit the MRI.”




“I said: ‘Could you turn off the machine, call 911, do something, Turn this damn thing off!'” she recalled, as tears ran down her face. “He went limp in my arms.”

She said the technician helped her try to pull her husband off the machine but it was impossible.

“He waved goodbye to me and then his whole body went limp,” Jones-McAllister told the TV outlet.

Jones-McAllister told News 12 that McAllister suffered heart attacks after he was freed from the MRI machine.

A person who answered the phone at Nassau Open MRI on Long Island declined to comment Friday. The phone number went unanswered on Saturday.

It wasn't the first New York death to result from an MRI machine.

In 2001, 6-year-old Michael Colombini of Croton-on-Hudson was killed at the Westchester Medical Center when an oxygen tank flew into the chamber, drawn in by the MRI's 10-ton electromagnet.

In 2010, records filed in Westchester County revealed that the family settled a lawsuit for $2.9 million.

MRI machines “employ a strong magnetic field” that “exerts very powerful forces on objects of iron, some steels, and other magnetizable objects,” according to the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, which says the units are “strong enough to fling a wheelchair across the room.”

Follow:


            In the midst of a record-breaking tour in support of her landmark country album “Cowboy Carter,” Beyoncé is on top of the world.
    


            Largely credited as Beyoncé's reclamation of her country roots, last year's “Cowboy Carter” questions the lines of genre and highlights the ongoing contributions of Black country artists. When she announced the album's release, she said it was “born out of an experience” where she had felt unwelcome — a likely reference to racist comments generated by her 2016 appearance at the Country Music Awards, where some country fans claimed she had no place at the event.
    


            The album and the ensuing tour, which concludes this month, is a middle finger to those detractors. The visual landscape Beyoncé creates, both within the album and on the tour, directly points to the various roles African Americans have played throughout US history. If the establishment will try to deny them a seat at the table, Beyoncé has made it her mission to bring a chair anyway — just see the thousands of Black fans donning their cowboy boots and matching wide-brimmed hats at each tour stop.
    


            It can be powerful for an artist of Beyoncé's caliber to highlight such narratives, but the fan response is more nuanced. While some appreciate the visuals that highlight Blackness within country music and American history, others wish for more explicit statements on contemporary political matters, whether that's the US support of the war in Gaza or the aggressive ICE deportations in the US. Her messaging, they suggest, falls short.
    


            “It's very true that Beyoncé has faced really unfair critique from a lot of different sectors. She hasn't been recognized in the way that she should for her artistry,” said Stacy Lee Kong, culture critic and founder of newsletter Friday Things. “And at the same time, we also see a superficiality to her politics.”
    


            Even before the Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour kicked off in April, the album's art and lyrics specifically emphasized the role Black people have played in country music. Beyoncé's shows underline those messages further, while referencing additional Black history and traditional patriotic imagery.
    


            She performs “The Star-Spangled Banner,” set to Jimi Hendrix's distorted Woodstock rendition; a video screen flashes the message, “Never ask permission for something that already belongs to you.” She embraces red, white and blue — just see her blue leotard embellished with silver stars and the accompanying floor-length American flag fur coat from her Fourth of July show in Washington, DC.
    


            While many fans feel empowered by Beyoncé's interpretation of Americana, others feel the symbolism is lacking. Even among some of her self-proclaimed fans, the ideas presented can be sticky: “I think people's issues lie where she is silent on current injustices and issues that are happening under that flag now whilst simultaneously constantly draping herself in it,” noted one fan on X.
    


            Especially for an artist whose work is often so deeply researched and layered with meaning, Lee Kong said, the fact that Beyoncé doesn't actually say anything specifically about American politics feels fraught. Celebrating being an American, and celebrating Black people's role in America, without actually verbalizing the harm that the United States can cause feels simplistic in today's political landscape, Lee Kong said. Despite her larger artistic message, many fans simply want more from Beyoncé.
    


            “You can't sell an idea and be wishy-washy about it,” she said. “This is a really difficult line to walk, no matter what, and it has become more difficult as audiences have become more sophisticated and more aware of the complicated politics that are informing our lives.”
    


            The complexity of this line is perhaps best exhibited by Beyoncé's Buffalo Soldiers T-shirt, worn during her Juneteenth performance in Paris. The white shirt featured an image of the Buffalo Soldiers, Black soldiers who served in the US Army following the Civil War and were instrumental in the country's westward expansion, conducting campaigns against the Native Americans living in the West (who are credited with coining the “Buffalo” in their name).
    


            On the back of her shirt was a block of text, which read in part: “their antagonists were the enemies of peace, order and settlement: warring Indians, bandits, cattle thieves, murderous gunmen, bootleggers, trespassers, and Mexican revolutionaries.”
    


            The message sparked intense debate. While some praised the highlighting of the Black soldiers, others critiqued the simultaneous disparaging of Native and Mexican Americans, arguing that the shirt insinuates that these groups exist in contrast to the United States. Beyoncé has not spoken publicly about the controversy.
    


            Beyoncé is not new to this type of critique — and she hasn't been completely silent about political topics over the years. During her performance at the Super Bowl in 2016, Beyoncé and her dancers appeared in all-black costumes with fists raised, a clear nod to the Black Panthers. She went on to speak in favor of the Black Lives Matter movement in a 2020 commencement speech.
    


            In 2023, as her “Renaissance” tour film played in Israel amid the war in Gaza, with videos surfacing of pro-IDF Israelis singing the single, “Break My Soul,” critics argued that the artist who could incorporate explicit political messaging into her 2016 performance should also speak up about the war.
    


            “She's a person who has curated a space, has made herself a political figure, whether she likes it or not,” said B.A. Parker, co-host of NPR's “Code Switch,” at the time.
    


            Does an artist owe fans an explicit political statement? Swifties have long analyzed the political motives of Taylor Swift, who until recently has kept mum on political issues. At this year's Super Bowl, Kendrick Lamar seemingly rejected these notions altogether, proclaiming: “The revolution's about to be televised. You picked the right time but the wrong guy.”
    


            “She is one of the most powerful women in the entertainment industry,” said Melvin Williams, a professor at Pace University who studies race, gender and sexuality in celebrity culture. “That she now has to be an expert of everything, stand up for all causes, while performing and showing up flawlessly — that is an impossible standard for any human being.”
    


            Beyoncé did endorse Kamala Harris's presidential bid last year, and she has also made more subtle political references during the tour. The Jimi Hendrix version of the national anthem — performed during the Vietnam War — has been widely interpreted as a form of protest, though the legendary guitarist's intent is still subject to debate. In one image from the Cowboy Carter tour book, Beyoncé is pictured sitting at a sewing machine while stitching the American flag, in tribute to Grace Wisher, a Black girl who helped sew the original Star-Spangled Banner. Her veiled, white dress — potentially a callback to the “veil” analyzed by W.E.B. DuBois, a metaphor used to explain the color line between White and Black Americans — is splattered with blood.
    


            “Cowboy Carter” was a risk, Williams said, both creatively and in its messaging around genre and race. As a celebrity, Beyoncé is adept at initiating social commentary, yet she rarely gives interviews. She speaks almost exclusively through her work. To some, her message is clear, and demands for more are taken as examples of the undue expectations society places on Black women.
    


            Despite pushes to do so, it's unlikely that she will ever “explicitly grapple with, for example, America's history of empire building or the persistence of capitalism in America,” Williams said.
    


            But Beyoncé's work presents an entry point into thinking more deeply about the world around us, Lee Kong said. As a result of the album and the tour, those conversations are being had anyway — with or without her input.

WASHINGTON (AP) — “Mr. President, this is the gavel used to enact the ‘big, beautiful bill,'” House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a White House signing ceremony on the Fourth of July.

“I want you to have it,” he said.

Handing over the gavel delighted President Donald Trump who, seated behind a desk outdoors, immediately tested it out with a few quick thumps.

The moment left a memorable mark on a historic day. The gesture reflected a traditional nod of honor, from one leader to another, a milestone of the Republican Party's priority legislation becoming law. But the imagery also underscored a symbolic transfer of political power, from Capitol Hill to the White House as a compliant Congress is ceding more and more of its prerogative to the presidency.

Since Trump's return to the White House in January, and particularly in the past few weeks, Republicans in control of the House and Senate have shown an unusual willingness to give the president of their party what he wants, regardless of the potential risk to themselves, their constituents and Congress itself.

Republicans raced to put the big package of tax breaks and spending cuts on Trump's desk by his Independence Day deadline. Senators had quickly confirmed almost all of Trump's outsider Cabinet nominees despite grave reservations over Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary, Pete Hegseth as the Pentagon chief and others. House Republicans pursued Trump's interest in investigating his perceived foes, including investigating Democratic President Joe Biden'suse of the autopen. 

But at the same time, Congress hit the brakes on one of its own priorities, legislation imposing steep sanctions on Russia over its war on Ukraine, after Trump announced he was allowing President Vladimir Putin an additional 50 days to negotiate a peace deal, dashing hopes for a swifter end to the conflict.




This past week, Congress was tested anew, delivering on Trump's request to rescind some $9 billion that lawmakers had approved but that the administration wanted to eliminate, including money for public broadcasting and overseas aid. It was a rare presidential request, a challenge to the legislative branch's power of the purse, that has not been used in decades.

“We're lawmakers. We should be legislating,” said a defiant Sen. Lisa Murkowksi, R-Alaska, as she refused to support the White House's demand to rescind money for National Public Radio and others.

“What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told, ‘This is the priority. We want you to execute on it. We'll be back with you with another round,'” she said. “I don't accept that.”

Congress, the branch of government the Founding Fathers placed first in the Constitution, is at a familiar crossroads. During the first Trump administration, Republicans frightened by Trump's angry tweets of disapproval would keep their criticisms private. Those who did speak up — Liz Cheney of Wyoming in the House and Mitt Romney of Utah in the Senate, among others — are gone from Capitol Hill.

One former GOP senator, Jeff Flake of Arizona, who announced in 2017 during Trump's first term that he would not seek reelection the next year, is imploring Republicans to find a better way.

“The fever still hasn't broken,” he wrote recently in The New York Times. “In today's Republican Party, voting your conscience is essentially disqualifying.”

But this time, the halls of Congress are filled with many Republicans who came of political age with Trump's “Make America Great Again” movement and owe their ascent to the president himself. Many are emulating his brand and style as they shape their own. 

A new generation of GOP leaders, Johnson in the House and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, have pulled closer to Trump. They are utilizing the power of the presidency in ways large and small — to broker deals, encourage wayward lawmakers to fall in line, even to set schedules.

Johnson, R-La., has openly pined for what he calls a “normal Congress.” But short of that, the speaker relies on Trump to help stay on track. When Republicans hit an impasse on cryptocurrency legislation, a Trump priority, it was the president who met with holdouts in the Oval Office late Tuesday night as Johnson called in by phone.

The result is a perceptible imbalance of power as the executive exerts greater authority while the legislative branch dims. The judicial branch has been left to do the heavy lift of checks and balances with the courts processing hundreds of lawsuits over the administration's actions.

“The genius of our Constitution is the separation of power,” said Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the former speaker, in an interview on SiriusXM's “Mornings with Zerlina.” 

“That the Republicans in Congress would be so ignoring of the institution that they represent, and that have just melted the power of the incredibly shrinking speakership” and Senate leadership positions, “to do all of these things, to cater to the executive branch,” she said.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., endured Trump's criticism over his opposition to the tax and spending cuts bill. The senator raised concerns about steep cuts to hospitals, but the president threatened to campaign against him. Tillis announced he would not seek reelection in 2026.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, voted against that bill and the rescissions package despite Trump's threat to campaign against any dissenters. 

One Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, appears to be pressing on, unphased. He recently proposed legislation to force the administration to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, something the president had been reluctant to do.

“Nowhere in the Constitution does it say that if the president wants something, you must do it,” said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, in a Senate speech. “We don't have to do this. We don't have to operate under the assumption that this man is uniquely so powerful.”

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons joins Americas Newsroom to discuss the Democrats resistance to the Trump administrations crackdown on illegal immigration. 

Military bases in both New Jersey and Indiana will soon be used by Homeland Security to house illegal immigrants, drawing a furious response from Democratic lawmakers.

Parts of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey and Camp Atterbury in Indiana will be repurposed and used as "temporary soft-sided holding facilities," the Defense Department told Fox News Digital, citing a decision by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

New Jersey Democrats blasted the decision, warning it would harm military readiness and urging Republicans to join them in helping reverse it. Both bases were previously used to house thousands of Afghan refugees following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.

"This is an inappropriate use of our national defense system and militarizes a radical immigration policy that has resulted in the inhumane treatment of undocumented immigrants and unlawful deportation of U.S. citizens, including children, across the country," the group of Democrats said in a joint statement.

"Using our country's military to detain and hold undocumented immigrants jeopardizes military preparedness and paves the way for ICE immigration raids in every New Jersey community. We have the greatest military in the world and using it as a domestic political tool is unacceptable and shameful."

The statement was made by Reps. Herb Conaway, LaMonica McIver, Donald Norcross, Rob Menendez, Frank Pallone, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Josh Gottheimer and Nellie Pou as well as Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim.

It is unclear when either site will open and a decision will depend on operational requirements and coordination with Homeland Security, the Defense Department said. 

Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst is a joint military base operated by U.S. Air Force, Army and Navy — the only tri-service base in the country. Spanning 42,00 acres, it's home to 45,000 military and civilian personnel, making it one of the largest and most strategically important on the East Coast.

Camp Atterbury is an Army and Air National Guard base near Edinburgh that spans 34,000 acres and has been used for training brigades and hosting large-scale operations. 

Under the Trump administration, Homeland Security has been using detention facilities to house migrants while they await asylum hearings or deportation. 

The lawmakers said that Hegseth wrote to Conoway informing him of the decision. Hegseth wrote in the letter that the move would not negatively affect military training, operations, readiness, or any other military requirements, per NJ Spotlight News.

New Jersey is already home to Delaney Hall and the Elizabeth Detention Center which are being used as immigration detention facilities, although they are privately operated. Delaney Hall was the scene where Democrat Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested and charged with trespassing in a clash with federal immigration officials in May. Rep. LaMonica McIver, D‑N.J., was later federally charged for allegedly interfering with federal officers during the same incident.

The news comes two weeks after President Donald Trump signed the Big Beautiful Bill into law, which allocated between $150 billion and $170 billion towards immigration enforcement over the next several years, $45 billion of which was carved out to expand immigration detention facilities. The funds are part of the Trump administration's efforts to carry out the largest deportation operation in the nation's history. 

Earlier this month, the Trump administration opened an immigration detention camp in Florida's Everglades that is surrounded by alligators dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz."

Medical devices in the brain are already making a difference for countless patients.

When you hear the word “neurotechnology,” you may picture Black Mirror headsets prying open the last private place we have — our own skulls — or the cyber-samurai of William Gibson's Neuromancer. That dread is natural, but it can blind us to the real potential being realized in neurotech to address the long intractable medical challenges found in our brains. In just the past 18 months, brain tech has cleared three hurdles at once: smarter algorithms, shrunken hardware, and — most important — proof that people can feel the difference in their bodies and their moods.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

Keith Krehbiel has battled Parkinson's disease for nearly a quarter-century. By 2020, as Nature recently reported, the tremors were winning — until neurosurgeons slipped Medtronic's Percept device into his head. Unlike older deep-brain stimulators that carpet-bomb movement control regions in the brain with steady current, the Percept listens first. It hunts the beta-wave “bursts” in the brain that mark a Parkinson's flare and then fires back millisecond by millisecond, an adaptive approach that mimics the way a cardiac pacemaker paces an arrhythmic heart.

In the ADAPT-PD study, patients like Krehbiel moved more smoothly, took fewer pills, and overwhelmingly preferred the adaptive mode to the regular one. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic agreed: The system now has US and EU clearance.

Because the electrodes spark only when symptoms do, total energy use is reduced, increasing battery life and delaying the next skull-opening surgery. Better yet, because every Percept shipped since 2020 already has the sensing chip, the adaptive mode can be activated with a simple firmware push, the way you'd update your iPhone.

Scientists applied the same listen-then-zap logic farther down the spinal cord this year. In a Nature Medicine pilot, researchers in Pittsburgh laid two slender electrode strips over the sensory roots of the lumbar spine in three adults with spinal muscular atrophy. Gentle pulses “reawakened” half-dormant motor neurons: Every participant walked farther, tired less, and — astonishingly — one person strode from home to the lab without resting.

Half a world away, surgeons at Nankai University threaded a 50-micron-thick “stent-electrode” through a patient's jugular vein, fanned it against the motor cortex, and paired it with a sleeve that twitched his arm muscles. No craniotomy, no ICU — just a quick catheter procedure that let a stroke survivor lift objects and move a cursor. High-tech rehab is inching toward outpatient care.

The brain isn't only wires and muscles; mood lives there, too. In March, the Food and Drug Administration tagged a visor-like headset from Pulvinar Neuro as a Breakthrough Device for major-depressive disorder. The unit drips alternating and direct currents while an onboard algorithm reads brain rhythms on the fly, and clinicians can tweak the recipe over the cloud. The technology offers a ray of hope for patients whose depression has resisted conventional treatments like drugs.

Cochlear implants for people with hearing loss once sounded like sci-fi; today more than 1 million people hear through them. That proof-of-scale has emboldened a new wave of brain-computer interfaces, including from Elon Musk's startup Neuralink. The company's first user, 30-year-old quadriplegic Noland Arbaugh, told Wired last year he now “multitasks constantly” with a thought-controlled cursor, clawing back some of the independence lost to a 2016 spinal-cord injury. Neuralink isn't as far along as Musk often claims — Arbaugh's device experienced some problems, with some threads detaching from the brain — but the promise is there.

On the speech front, new systems are decoding neural signals into text on a computer screen, or even synthesized voice. In 2023 researchers from Stanford and the University of California San Francisco installed brain implants in two women who had lost the ability to speak, and managing to hit decoding times of 62 and 78 words per minute, far faster than previous brain tech interfaces. That's still much slower than the 160 words per minute of natural English speech, but more recent advances are getting closer to that rate.

Yes, neurotech has a shadow. Brain signals could reveal a person's mood, maybe even a voting preference. Europe's new AI Act now treats “neuro-biometric categorization” — technologies that can classify individuals by biometric information, including brain data — as high-risk, demanding transparency and opt-outs, while the US BRAIN Initiative 2.0 is paying for open-source toolkits so anyone can pop the hood on the algorithms.

And remember the other risk: doing nothing. Refusing a proven therapy because it feels futuristic is a little like turning down antibiotics in 1925 because a drug that came from mold seemed weird.

Twentieth-century medicine tamed the chemistry of the body; 21st-century medicine is learning to tune the electrical symphony inside the skull. When it works, neurotech acts less like a hammer than a tuning fork — nudging each section back on pitch, then stepping aside so the music can play.

Real patients are walking farther, talking faster, and, in some cases, simply feeling like themselves again. The challenge now is to keep our fears proportional to the risks — and our imaginations wide enough to see the gains already in hand.

            Most people don't expect Mimi Hymel to remember Hurricane Katrina. After all, she was only 3 when the Category 5 storm slammed into her Louisiana home in 2005.
    


            But nearly 20 years later, as Hymel watched news of the floodwaters inundating Texas Hill Country and saw the harrowing images of destruction from Camp Mystic, she said those memories came back with sharp clarity.
    


            She can still recall the moment her family decided they couldn't ride out Katrina and the sinking feeling she felt as her mom placed Hymel and her sister in their car and drove away, leaving their dad behind to work at a nearby hospital.
    


            But most of all, Hymel said, she remembers how she struggled to fall asleep for days after they escaped the storm because she didn't have her favorite stuffed animal.
    


            “I just had no idea if my dad was OK or even coming home at all,” she recalled. “I had a teddy bear named Cuddles that I didn't get to take in the car with me. In a scary time like that, I really wanted it for comfort.”
    


            Indeed, the importance of these plush companions was apparent as the floodwaters began seeping through the Chatterbox cabin at Camp Mystic, prompting a 9-year-old to offer her top bunk as a safe place for campers to store their stuffies during the storm.
    


            Hymel said the trauma of escaping a natural disaster has a way of changing you.
    


            But all these years later, she's found a way of channeling her experience during Katrina into helping today's youngest survivors.
    


            In the immediate aftermath of Katrina, Hymel said there was no shortage of local organizations and kind neighbors who tried to meet her family's immediate needs for food, clothes and shelter.
    


            But as a child, she said she struggled to process such dramatic and rapid change.
    


            “When we finally did get back to our house, everything was destroyed,” she recalled.
    


            And Cuddles had been lost to the floodwaters.
    


            Studies have long shown blankets or stuffed animals can help children adapt to unfamiliar or distressing situations and they become even more important when a child is processing grief.
    


            Although the family ultimately resettled in Texas, as she grew older, Hymel said she noticed how some first responders or families would share photos of stuffed animals they recovered after a disaster.
    


            “I was once that child so it's always just emotional seeing those photos,” she said. “I realized that kids experience disasters a little bit differently, so relief needs to work a little differently for them too.”
    


            That realization sparked Hymel to mobilize after catastrophes, coordinating with local businesses to host donation drives for stuffies and then partnering with first responders and other organizations to help distribute the plush toys in the aftermath of a tragedy.
    


            After the success of her early donation efforts, Hymel founded Comfort Bears in a Catastrophe. The nonprofit not only provides kids with a new stuffed animal after a crisis, but they also connect families to mental health resources.
    


            Each stuffed animal is tagged with a card offering free crisis counseling through the national Disaster Distress Helpline, which offers children and their families help navigating traumatic events.
    


            As interest in her work grew, so did the need. From the Miami Surfside condo collapse to the destructive fires in Maui and Los Angeles and countless floods and tornadoes, these days the steady drumbeat of disasters has been relentless, Hymel said.
    


            And so far, the nonprofit has donated more than 50,000 stuffed animals to children in need, Hymel said.
    


            She has also written a series of children's books called “Miss Prepared and Captain Ready.”
    


            “It teaches them important skills to know if a disaster were to hit, but it also encourages kids to get involved in their own way,” she said.
    


            But nothing, Hymel added, can compare to the joy of seeing a child receive a new stuffed animal and finding a sense of comfort in the midst of a crisis.
    


            “After Hurricane Ian, I was able to donate to the hospital I was actually born in,” Hymel said. “That was just kind of full circle.”
    


            From her home in Houston earlier this month, Annie Gully and her daughter watched as reports of flooding in the Texas Hill Country grew more dire by the hour.
    


            A close friend, she later learned, lost her niece, 8-year-old Blakely McCrory, in the floodwaters at Camp Mystic.

            “It's just unfathomable to even wrap your head around something like this happening,” she said. “You kind of have to go through the sadness and then you're like, ‘OK, what can we do to help.'”
    


            Gully, who owns Tree House Arts and Crafts, a local children's art studio, said over the years she's seen how a child's favorite stuffed animal can become like a family member.
    


            So, when her daughter suggested a donation drive for kids, she leaped at the idea. She reached out to Comfort Bears on social media and within hours they had a game plan.
    


            Gully's donation drive was covered on the local news and “that day alone, I think we collected 600” stuffed animals, she said.
    


            After three days they received more than 1,100 donations to be distributed throughout the state.
    


            “Children don't really have an outlet to help” after a crisis, Gully said. “You could tell their parents had explained to them that other kids have lost their lovies and how sad would it be if you lost your(s).”
    


            Gully is also selling “Mystic Strong” artwork, and the proceeds will be donated to charity in honor of McCrory and the other lives lost at Camp Mystic.
    


            “I feel like every time you turn on the news, there's just something worse that you hear about,” Gully said.
    


            But, she added, watching her community come together to donate comfort to the smallest victims of the floods in Kerr County has given her a reason to hope.
    


            “No one cares who you are, what you look like or who you voted for,” she said, “We're all just doing things together to help.”

Democrats will be put to the test next week when Senate Republicans bring to a vote the first of several bipartisan government funding bills for next fiscal year.

But fresh off a Republican-controlled Congress clawing back $9 billion in DOGE-inspired cuts from money that both parties previously approved, Democrats are at a crossroads regarding whether to provide critical votes to fund the government without GOP assurances portions won't be rescinded.

“They stabbed us in the back, and if they commit to us that they won't do that again, then we might be able to write bills,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), a member of leadership and the Appropriations Committee. “The vibe today is, ‘we're going to trade baseball cards with you, and then we're going to sneak into your house later today and take our cards back.'”

Murphy, visibly irritated, added: “They're literally telling us that they are going to violate the bipartisan deals immediately. What do you do with that?”

The consternation over how to move forward has become a point of contention both internally among Democrats and in conversations with their GOP colleagues. Appropriators Murphy and Sen. Katie Britt (R-AL) engaged Thursday in what appeared to be a tense floor conversation shortly before the Democrat teed off on Republicans. 

“We debated it at length in the [Appropriations] Committee,” Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) told the Washington Examiner. “We're trying our best to make a bipartisan appropriations process. We'll see.”

Republicans are largely brushing off the government shutdown threats that have been led by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), messaging that the Democratic leader has softened slightly in recent days as the party debates next steps to counter a Republican-dominated Washington.

To complicate matters further, White House budget office director Russ Vought batted down demands for assurances from Democrats by saying the appropriations process “has to be less bipartisan.” The White House tried to clean up the remarks by claiming Vought meant the opposite.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) conceded that less bipartisanship would undercut efforts to overcome the 60-vote filibuster, a threshold that the White House rescission request was able to avoid.

“That runs contrary to what the math tells us around here,” Thune said of Vought's remarks. “We need 60 on [appropriations] bills, 60 to fund the government. And my expectation is, at least I hope, we plan to move [appropriations] bills that will have cooperation.”

But Democrats say the onus is on Republicans to extend offers that convince them back to the negotiating table, such as public assurances or potential stipulations inked into funding bills. 

“The idea that this is on Democrats is just absolutely preposterous,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), a leadership member, told the Washington Examiner. “Republicans are presiding over the evisceration of their own power, and they've been politically lobotomized. I'm done trying to sort them. They have to sort themselves.”

The $9 billion rescission package took back foreign aid money for global health programs and public broadcast funding that Republicans assailed as government waste, some of which they said was allocated by federal bureaucrats for inappropriate programs. The tranche amounted to only 0.10% of the $7 trillion budget, leaving many conservative fiscal hawks admittedly desiring steeper cuts with more rescissions after the 2026 government funding process that's due Oct. 1.

“If 10 Democrats don't want to work with us on cutting out all this NPR funding when they're actively, overtly partisan, then we have a responsibility to act on our own,” Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO), who was tapped by the White House to lead the rescission vote-wrangling effort, told the Washington Examiner. “That's what we did.”

But a recent schism between a group of Senate Republicans, including several close allies to President Donald Trump, tested the bounds in which GOP lawmakers were willing to let the administration alter how Congress intended appropriated funds to be used. The Department of Education, which Trump is seeking to dismantle, has since released money for state education programs after alarms were raised by senators that it was improperly being withheld, according to Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV).

“When we have authorized and appropriated to these [states], the grants have gone out, and now all of a sudden, they mysteriously paused. Let us know what's going on,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) told the Washington Examiner. “It's not right to our school districts to be held in this state of limbo.”

In a small but positive step toward a funding solution between the two parties, the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday advanced with bipartisan support its latest two measures that comprise the 12-bill annual budget.

TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces an increasingly uphill battle in Sunday's upper house election, and a loss could worsen political instability at a time of daunting challenges, such as rising prices and high U.S. tariffs.

A poor performance would not immediately trigger a change of government but it would deepen uncertainty over his fate and Japan's future path. 

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a humiliating loss in a lower house election in October as its usual supporters registered their unhappiness over past corruption scandals and high prices. Ishiba is struggling to regain voter confidence. 

His minority government has since been forced into making concessions to the opposition to get legislation through the Diet, or parliament. That has hindered its ability to quickly deliver effective measures to curb rising prices and win wage increases. On top of shortages and soaring prices for rice, a traditional staple, Ishiba has been stymied by President Donald Trump's tariff demands.

Frustrated voters are rapidly turning to emerging populist parties, including one that is promoting anti-foreign policies and backpedaling on gender equality and diversity.

Here's a look at Sunday's election:




Ishiba has set a low bar for the vote — a simple majority. Half of the 248 seats for six-year terms in the upper house are being decided, and the LDP and its junior coalition partner Komeito would need to win a combined 50. Added to the 75 coalition-held seats that are not being contested in this election, it would be a big retreat from the 141 seats the coalition held before the election.

If the ruling coalition fails to secure a majority, “there will be a move within the LDP to dump Ishiba,” said Yu Uchiyama, a University of Tokyo professor of political science. “It makes a leadership very unstable.” Under any successor, the ruling coalition would be a minority in both houses, he said. 

If Ishiba's coalition secures a majority and he stays on, his leadership will remain weak, with little hope of improved support ratings, Uchiyama said. “Either way, it is essential for the minority government to seek opposition parties' cooperation to achieve any policy.”

Measures to mitigate soaring prices, lagging incomes and burdensome social security payments are the top focus of frustrated, cash-strapped voters.

Rice prices have doubled since last year due to supply shortages, overly complex distribution systems and other reasons related to Japan's farming, causing panic buying as Ishiba has struggled to resolve the crisis.

Trump has added to that pressure, complaining about a lack of progress in trade negotiations, blaming a lack of sales of U.S. autos and American-grown rice to Japan despite a shortfall in domestic stocks of the grain. A 25% tariff due to take effect Aug. 1 has been another blow for Ishiba. 

Ishiba has resisted any compromise before the election, but the prospect for a breakthrough after the election is just as unclear because the minority government would have difficulty forming a consensus with the opposition.

The rice issue has cost Ishiba one farm minister. Rice prices remain high even after the farm minister's replacement, Shinjiro Koizumi, moved quickly and boldly to address the problem by ordering the emergency release of stored rice from reserves, helping to refill grocery store shelves in time for the election. 

Koizumi, son of popular former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, is a potential challenger to Ishiba.

Stricter measures targeting foreign residents and visitors have suddenly emerged as a key issue. 

The Sanseito party stands out with the toughest anti-foreigner stance with its “Japanese First” platform that proposes a new agency to centralize policies related to foreigners. It wants stricter screening for allowing Japanese citizenship and to exclude non-Japanese from welfare benefits. The party's populist platform is also anti-vaccine, anti-globalism and favors traditional gender roles.

Its stance has encouraged the spread of xenophobic rhetoric in the election campaign and on social media, critics say. A typical claim is that a rapid increase in foreign workers has hurt Japanese workers' wages and that foreigners use a large share of welfare benefits and have made Japanese society unsafe. 

“Foreigners are used as targets to vent their discontent and unease,” Uchiyama said, comparing the scapegoating to that in Europe and the United States under Trump. 

Experts say most of the rhetoric is disinformation aimed at frustrations among Japanese struggling to get by. Government statistics show foreign residents account for about 3% of both Japan's total population and of welfare benefit recipients. 

The Liberal Democrats, under a slogan “zero illegal immigrants,” have pledged to crack down on growing illegal employment of foreigners and against allowing them to default on social insurance payments or medical bills. The party also set up a task force to promote an orderly society, a move aimed at enforcing stricter measures on foreigners to address growing public unease. The rising conservative Democratic Party for the People, or the DPP, also is calling to restrict foreign ownership of Japanese real estate. 

The move triggered protests by human rights activists and alarmed foreign residents.

Given that its population is rapidly aging and shrinking, Japan needs foreign workers. It should discuss immigration policy more strategically, Takahide Kiuchi, an executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a recent analysis.

Conservative to centrist opposition groups, including the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, or CDPJ, the DPP, and Sanseito have gained significant ground at the Liberal Democrats' expense. Headed by charismatic Sohei Kamiya, a former local assembly member and a member of the defense reserve, Sanseito ranked as second favorite in the opposition after the CDPJ in some recent surveys.

They are believed to be raking in conservative supporters of the ruling party who are disappointed by Ishiba's leadership and flip-flops on policies. Ishiba is caught between his party's ultraconservatives and mainstream opposition leaders.

Still, the eight main opposition groups are too fractured to forge a common platform as a united front and gain voter support as a viable alternative.

When Ishiba lost big in October, there was speculation about a trilateral coalition government with the Komeito and the DPP or another conservative group, the Japan Innovation Party. But they've since cooperated only on certain legislation. If the ruling coalition loses its upper house majority, that could spark a regrouping among coalitions.

Yoshihiko Noda, a former prime minister and head of the opposition CDPJ, said the loss of ruling coalition majorities in both houses of parliament would enable opposition parties to push policies blocked by the LDP. Those include cuts in the consumption tax, recognition of same-sex marriages, and a law allowing married couples the option of each keeping their own names.

A Russian lawmaker who regulates the country's IT said Friday that WhatsApp should prepare to leave the Russian market, warning that the messaging app would likely be put on a list of restricted software.

Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the lower house of parliament's information technology committee, said in a statement that MAX, a state-backed messaging app integrated with government services, could gain market share if WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, left the country.

"It's time for WhatsApp to prepare to leave the Russian market," Gorelkin said, adding that Meta is designated as an extremist organization in Russia.

Facebook and Instagram, both also owned by Meta, have been banned in Russia since 2022, when Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in a war that continues.

Gorelkin made his comments after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law last month authorizing the development of MAX as Russia seeks to reduce its dependence on platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram.

Russian lawmakers approved sweeping legal amendments this week, proposing fines of up to 5,000 rubles, or $63, for anyone searching for material online the government considers to be extremist, including Instagram and Facebook, and opposition politicians and activists.

The proposal sparked criticism, including from some Kremlin backers like Margarita Simonyan, a state media executive who said journalists would be unable to investigate the activities of opposition groups such as the Anti-Corruption Fund founded by deceased opposition figure Alexei Navalny.

Anton Nemkin, a member of the parliament's IT committee, said it was determined that WhatsApp would leave Russia.

"The presence of such a service in Russia's digital space is, in fact, a legal breach of national security," Nemkin said, according to TASS, a state-owned news agency.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said all services must follow Russian law when asked if WhatsApp may leave the country.

Russia has long attempted to establish what it describes as digital sovereignty by promoting home-grown services.

But critics have expressed concerns that Russia's new state-backed messaging app may track its users' activities and have suggested Russia could slow WhatsApp's speeds to encourage downloads of the new app.

YouTube has had its audience in Russia decline significantly in the last year to fewer than 10 million daily users from more than 40 million in mid-2024 because slower download speeds have made it more difficult for people to access the video platform.

Shares in state-controlled technology company VK, which is developing homegrown digital services like VK Video, a rival to YouTube, grew 1.9% Friday.

The Kremlin released a list of instructions this week from Putin, including a directive to introduce additional restrictions on the use in Russia of software, including communication services produced in "unfriendly countries" that have imposed sanctions against Russia.

Putin gave a deadline of Sept. 1.

Referring to Putin's order, Gorelkin said WhatsApp would likely be among the communication services to face new restrictions.

New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, appeared on the ‘Far Left Show' podcast in August 2020, where he espoused several radical far-left views.

New York City's leading mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani, a self-proclaimed socialist, is raising eyebrows once again for appearing to suggest prisons are not important in a recently resurfaced video.

Mamdani, a New York state assemblyman and the Democratic nominee for mayor, made the comments in a 2020 interview while running for state office.

Asked whether he thought prisons were obsolete, Mamdani responded, "I think that frankly – I mean – what purpose do they serve? I think that we have to ask ourselves that."

The Democratic mayoral candidate added, "I think a lot of people who defend the carceral state, they defend the idea of it and the way it makes them feel. They're not defending the reality of it and the practices that are part and parcel of it.

"Because if you actually break it down and ask people how many people come out of the prison system better than they went into the prison system, how much harm is actually being prevented versus created, I think when you ask these kinds of questions, people don't always have clear answers."

Mamdani added that, when discussing the prison system, "What they always want to pivot to is, ‘What are you going to do about murderers? What are you going to do about rapists?'

"Sometimes you have to ask them, ‘What are you doing about them right now?'" he added. "We need a system of justice that will repair the harm that has been caused and address it in a serious way because right now we don't have it, and it makes everyone more unsafe."

Mamdani also claimed "the power of the executive is almost limitless here in New York State" and criticized then-New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo for refusing to "let people out and letting people go home."

Mamdani, who has promised to overhaul New York City and launch massive new government programs, has been endorsed by progressive politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

As the Democratic nominee in heavily blue New York City, Mamdani is the likely frontrunner to unseat the current mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, who is running for re-election as an independent. Mamdani is also facing off against Cuomo, who is running as an independent, and activist Curtis Sliwa, who is the Republican Party nominee.

Mamdani is seen by many as a controversial candidate, partially due to his socialist policy proposals and heavy criticism of the state of Israel. He has declined to say whether Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state and initially refused to condemn the phrase "globalize the intifada." However, he recently began distancing himself from the phrase. 

Fox News Digital reached out to the Mamdani campaign but did not receive a response.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold 75,000 shares on Friday, valued at about $12.94 million, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Friday's sale is part of a plan adopted in March for Huang to sell up to 6 million shares of the leading artificial intelligence company. Earlier this week, Huang sold 225,000 shares of the chipmaker, totaling about $37 million, according to a separate SEC filing. The CEO began trading stock per the plan last month.

Surging demand for AI and the graphics processing units that power large language models has significantly boosted Huang's net worth and pushed Nvidia's market capitalization beyond $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company.

Nvidia announced this week that it expects to resume sales of its H20 chips to China soon, following signals from the Trump administration that it would approve export licenses. Earlier this year, U.S. officials had stated that Nvidia would require special permission to ship the chips, which are specifically designed for the Chinese market.

"The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon," the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Huang said during a news conference on Wednesday in Beijing that he wants to sell chips more advanced than the H20 to China at some point.

The Trump administration said on Saturday it is taking a series of actions against Mexico over the Mexican government's decisions to rescind some flight slots for U.S. carriers and force U.S. cargo carriers to relocate operations in Mexico City.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement the department could disapprove flight requests from Mexico if the government fails to address U.S. concerns over decisions made in 2022 and 2023. The department is also proposing to withdraw antitrust immunity from the Delta Air Lines joint venture with Aeromexico to address competitive issues in the market.

Mexico is the most popular international destination among U.S. airline travelers.

Delta said if the U.S. Department of Transportation withdraws approval, it "would cause significant harm to consumers traveling between the U.S. and Mexico, as well as U.S. jobs, communities, and transborder competition."

The Transportation Department said Mexico has not been in compliance with a bilateral air agreement since 2022 when it abruptly rescinded slots and then forced U.S. all-cargo carriers to relocate operations in 2023.

Mexico's Transport Ministry and major Mexican airlines, including Aeromexico, could not be immediately reached for comment.

Duffy said Mexico was expected to complete construction to alleviate congestion  at Mexico City's Benito Juarez International Airport (MEX), but that has yet to materialize three years later.

"By restricting slots and mandating that all-cargo operations move out of MEX, Mexico has broken its promise, disrupted the market, and left American businesses holding the bag for millions in increased costs," the department said.

The USDOT also said it could take action against European countries over limitations at airports. "We are monitoring European States to ensure that they apply the Balanced Approach process for noise abatement at their airports and do not implement unjustified operational restrictions," the department said.

The Transportation Department issued a pair of orders requiring Mexican airlines to file schedules with the department for all their U.S. operations by July 29 and requiring prior U.S. approval before operating any large passenger or cargo aircraft charter flights to or from the United States.

"Mexico has altered the playing field significantly for airlines in ways that reduce competition and allow predominant competitors to gain an unfair advantage in the U.S.-Mexico market," the department said. "Mexico's actions harm airlines seeking to enter the market, existing competitor airlines, consumers of air travel and products relying on time-sensitive air cargo shipments traded between the two countries, and other stakeholders in the American economy."

If the U.S. rescinds antitrust approval for Delta and Aeromexico, they would be required to discontinue cooperation on common pricing, capacity management, and revenue sharing, but Delta would also be able to retain its equity stake in Aeromexico, maintain all of its existing flying in the U.S.-Mexico market unimpeded and continue a partnership.

President Donald Trump said Saturday that even if the courts release the grand jury transcripts in the criminal cases of notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his convicted procurer of young girls, Ghislaine Maxwell, "nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics."

"It will always be more, more, more. MAGA!" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Trump's post comes one day after the Department of Justice asked federal judges to unseal the grand jury testimonies in the criminal cases, following a request by Trump.

Trump on Thursday said that he had asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to "produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval."

The request to the DOJ comes amid growing pressure on Trump, including from some of his most loyal supporters, to release files in connection with Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.

Trump's Saturday Truth Social post suggests that the pressure campaign, which has lasted for weeks, is not abating.

The president also appeared to signal that he is not planning to take further steps in response to the critics' concerns.

"I have asked the Justice Department to release all Grand Jury testimony with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, subject only to Court Approval," Trump wrote on his social media.

"With that being said, and even if the Court gave its full and unwavering approval, nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics making the request," he continued.

Trump's Truth Social post also reflects a subtle change in his language about the request.

On Saturday, he stated that he had requested the Justice Department release "all" grand jury testimony in connection with the criminal cases, in contrast to Thursday, when he said he had requested the release of "pertinent" testimony.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the difference in the two posts.

Trump's post also comes one day after he sued media mogul Rupert Murdoch after The Wall Street Journal — which Murdoch owns — published an article describing a "bawdy" letter that Trump sent for Epstein's 50th birthday.

Trump has denied that the letter is his. He is seeking damages of at least $10 billion in the defamation lawsuit.

What would it take for you to feel financially comfortable?

For most of the people who work with Joy Slabaugh, a certified financial planner, licensed therapist and founder of Wealth Alignment Institute, the answer is the same.

"It's always a little bit more than what they have," she says. "Regardless of how much money they have, it's just a little bit more."

On average, Americans say they'd need a net worth of $839,000 to feel financially comfortable, according to a recent survey from Charles Schwab. Members of Gen Z say they'd be comfortable with less — just $329,000, on average.

You may be wondering what net worth could afford you a comfortable life — and what your current net worth actually is.

If you're not sure the answer to either, don't worry. While financial experts say tracking net worth can be a useful tool in your money management arsenal, it presents an incomplete picture of your financial life.

"It's just one metric — and often a misleading one. I've seen clients fixated on their net worth while completely disconnected from their financial reality," Slabaugh says. "Tracking net worth without tracking values or lifestyle intentions is like watching your pulse without knowing if your heart is healthy."

Your net worth is the total value of everything you own, after accounting for money that you owe, and is a useful shorthand for overall wealth. To call yourself a millionaire, for example, you generally need a net worth of $1 million or more.

To find yours, add up your assets, such as bank accounts, stock holdings, physical valuables and home equity, before subtracting your liabilities, which include credit card debt, student loans and mortgage balances.

Theoretically, this number gives you a pretty decent overview of your actual wealth. Someone may appear to be wealthy if they have a $1 million house, for instance. Not so much if they also have $2 million in debt.

It's not always a very practical yardstick, however. For one thing, two people with the same net worth could have wildly different financial situations. One person may have a big chunk of assets in liquid cash, giving them plenty of spending power, while the other has the bulk of their wealth tied up in retirement accounts.

Rather than focusing on one number, you're better off examining how money flows in and out of your life, and whether or not you're making progress toward your goals, experts say.

"[Net worth is] a 'snapshot' of one's financial position at a single point in time," says Randy Bruns, a CFP and principle at Model Wealth in Naperville, Illinois. "In contrast, their cash flow statement acts more like the 'video,' capturing the ongoing movement of money in and out that ultimately shapes their net worth."

When it comes to feeling financially comfortable, it's smart to make sure you have a few critical bases covered, says Slabaugh. These include not only making ends meet, but having enough breathing room to pay down debt, build emergency savings and invest for the future.

Beyond that, no number in particular is going to bring you comfort unless you get to the heart of what you want from your money, she says. For many of Slabaugh's clients, building wealth means having security. For others, money is a means to flexibility and freedom.

"In nearly every case, the comfort isn't just financial — it's emotional," Slabaugh says.

Financial comfort, she says, comes when your money management aligns with your core values. Someone who values freedom, for instance, could aim to beef up their travel savings while looking for misaligned areas in their budget to slash.

"It could be, 'I'm spending hundreds of dollars a month on streaming services to escape the fact that I feel stuck. Let me divert that to a vacation fund, and now I can actually save to go to some of these places that I'm dreaming about while watching these shows,'" Slabaugh says.

Instead of striving for a particular number in your bank account, ask yourself what about having that amount of money would do for you and what about your life would change if you already had it, Slabaugh says.

"These questions are often more revealing — and more actionable — than a net worth target ever could be."

If President Donald Trump tries to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, it would almost certainly set off a courtroom battle that legal and policy experts say is bound to get messy, with uncertain impacts on the central bank, financial markets and the economy.

The tempestuous situation poses a myriad of thorny questions for which there are no easy answers considering no president ever has tried to unseat a Fed chair.

Among them:

"What is extraordinary here is the president going back and forth and discussing loudly whether he might fire or try to fire the Fed chair," said Bill English, the Fed's former director of monetary affairs and now a Yale professor. "Of course, we've never gone through that, so we don't know legally how that would work and how the courts would see that and so on. So, I think it's all things that we haven't seen before, and raises real uncertainties."

Even by Trump's standards, the events surrounding Powell of late have been stunning.

After an extended campaign of ad hominem attacks on Powell and demands for lower interest rates, Trump met with Republican congressional members Tuesday evening and asked them if he should fire the Fed chair, according to a senior administration official.

After the GOP members showed their backing for the move, the president indicated to them he would move on Powell "soon," the official said.

However, no sooner did news break of the meeting then Trump told reporters that he's not considering a move, saying it's "highly unlikely" while simultaneously wondering out loud whether alleged mismanagement of the $2.5 billion expansion might qualify as cause.

Subsequent reports suggested that Trump's lawyers indicated that he would have a hard time legally dismissing Powell. The Supreme Court's ruling in Trump v. Wilcox this year called the Fed a "uniquely structured, quasi-private entity" whose governors enjoy insulation from removal for political or policy reasons.

That, of course, does not mean Trump won't try.

"It's a very high bar legally, but there also haven't been really any historical precedents for it," Jonathan Kanter, former assistant attorney general during the Biden administration, said on CNBC. "So it would get litigated in court, probably be quite a bit of a circus, but, yeah, the standard is very high. It has to be for cause, and it has to be for neglect, malfeasance, abuse."

Powell's options would entail suing and asking for a stay on any Trump removal action, Kanter said. The tactic itself could push resolution past the expiration of the Fed chair's term in May 2026.

As it winds through the legal system, the case would draw close attention and either could act as a bulwark for Fed independence, or reduce the normally sacrosanct central bank to just another political body subject to the whims of the Oval Office.

"The Supreme Court has signaled it would likely side with the Fed chair," Kanter said. "It views the Fed as historically different than other independent agencies. Then it would kick the case right back down to a district court, which would determine whether the president had a basis to fire the Fed chair."

Despite seemingly low chances of success, going after Powell still could serve a political purpose for Trump.

"I think Trump is setting it up so that there's a sword of Damocles hanging over Powell's head throughout the rest of his tenure," Kanter said. "If there is a sustained period of inflation or stagflation, Trump has the ability to say, well, it's this guy's fault because he didn't lower interest rates."

Indeed, the Trump-Powell dispute by all appearances runs deeper than qualms over the building renovations.

Trump wants sharply lower interest rates, and he wants them now, economic consequences be damned.

The president was on the attack again Friday, railing against Powell and his fellow central bankers. In a Truth Social post, Trump charged Powell and the FOMC officials are "choking out the housing market with their high rate, making it difficult for people, especially the young, to buy a house. He is truly one of my worst appointments."

Up until recently, Trump has reserved most of his criticism for Powell individually. But on Friday, he also said, "the Fed Board has done nothing to stop this 'numbskull' from hurting so many people. In many ways the Board is equally to blame!" Finally, using his nickname for Powell, he said, "I can't tell you how dumb Too Late is - So bad for our Country!"

Besides Powell, Trump has two appointees on the board dating back to his first term: governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both of whom have said they are leaning toward a rate cut when the FOMC meets at the end of July.

Beyond those two, though, other members have not expressed any appetite for easing before the September meeting. There are 12 voters on the FOMC, and the chair is just one of them. Fed watchers including English, who served as the FOMC secretary, see policymakers pushed into a corner where cutting in July would seem like acquiescing to Trump's demands.

That's part of a larger concern on Wall Street over the reputational fallout the Fed faces as the Trump White House ramps up its efforts to use politics to influence monetary policy.

"The experience of other countries in which governments have suppressed central bank independence has generally been a combination of a slippery slope and the occasional sudden drop," Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economists at Capital Economics, said in a recent note. "Unlike raising tariffs, which can be withdrawn before the real damage is done, the reputational costs from firing Powell would be harder to undo."

Then there are the market and economic issues.

Firing Powell would be unlikely to change the committee's approach to monetary policy, and in fact could harden its position on rates.

Even if the FOMC did cut, it could do more harm than good to Trump's goal of lowering finance costs on the national debt. The last time the Fed cut, in the final four months of 2024, Treasury yields rose almost in perfect reverse correlation to the rate reductions, and the same thing could happen again if markets perceive the Fed is surrendering its inflation-fighting credentials to placate Trump.

"The historical record suggests that political interference contributed to poor monetary policy in the late '60s and early '70s, with unfavorable consequences for inflation developments," JPMorgan Chase chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli wrote. "Any reduction in the independence of the Fed would likely add upside risks to an inflation outlook that is already subject to upward pressures from tariffs and somewhat elevated inflation expectations."

While Trump wants the Fed to slash its key borrowing rate by 3 percentage points, such a move could raise inflation expectations, causing fixed income investors to demand higher yields, "thereby increasing longer-term interest rates, weighing on the outlook for economic activity, and worsening the fiscal position," Feroli added.

For the time being, Powell and Co. is expected to continue to conduct business and make decisions based on data, with the constant drumbeat of Trump serving as a distraction that doesn't seem like it will go away, even if the president ultimately never tries to fire the Fed chief.

"Well, it isn't helpful to have the president be so aggressively antagonistic trying to pressure the Fed. It's not unprecedented that a president has views on monetary policy. We've seen that over time. But I think what's different about this time is that it's been pretty persistent and unrelenting," former Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Friday on CNBC. "That will not change how the Fed goes about making its decisions on monetary policy."

Activist Commentary: Elliott is a very successful and astute activist investor. The firm's team includes analysts from leading tech private equity firms, engineers, operating partners – former technology CEOs and COOs. When evaluating an investment, the firm also hires specialty and general management consultants, expert cost analysts and industry specialists. Elliott often watches companies for many years before investing and has an extensive stable of impressive board candidates. The firm has historically focused on strategic activism in the technology sector and has been very successful with that strategy. However, over the past several years its activism group has grown, and Elliott has been doing a lot more governance-oriented activism and creating value from a board level at a much larger breadth of companies.

Elliott has taken a position in Global Payments.

Global Payments is a leading provider of payment processing and software solutions, focused on serving small and medium-sized merchants and select mid-market and enterprise customers. The company operates through two segments: Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions. Merchant Solutions, contributing about three-fourths of total sales, provides payment solutions to enable customers to accept card, check, and digital payments, offering authorization, settlement, funding and other services. Simply put, Global Payments, as a merchant acquirer, acts as a middleman between the merchant and card network to authorize and facilitate transactions. Through its Issuer Solutions segment, Global Payments provides comprehensive commerce solutions supporting the payment ecosystem for issuers through offerings like core processing, enterprise tokenization and more. This segment was formed in 2019 following the combination of Global Payments and Total System Services ("TSYS") in an all-stock merger of equals to create a leading payments company with a presence in both merchant acquiring and issuer services.

Peaking in 2021 at roughly $220 per share and an enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EV/EBITDA) multiple of about 25-times, the company today trades around $80 per share and at a high single-digit multiple. The company managed to tread water during the pandemic despite the global slowdown in transactions and its focus on small and medium enterprises. However, sales growth has slowed significantly since 2020, now below the core acquiring market's high-single growth rate, implying market share loss to disruptors like Stripe, Fiserv's Clover, Shopify and others. That is all very interesting, but not what this activist campaign is about. This is about a company that made a poorly received "bet the farm" acquisition and is now at an inflection point that will determine its future.

On April 17, Global Payments announced that it had agreed to acquire Worldpay from Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) and private equity firm GTCR. The three-way cash-and-share acquisition also involved Global Payments divesting its Issuer Solutions (previously known as TSYS) business to FIS in a deal which valued Worldpay at $24.25 billion and Issuer Solutions at $13.5 billion. Global Payments' shares fell 17% following the announcement for many good reasons: (i) this acquisition was announced after management's commitments at their 2024 Investor Day to pursue increased shareholder returns, divestments, and, at most, small bolt-on acquisitions, (ii) management has a poor track record of integrating (or failing to integrate) acquisitions such as TSYS and AdvancedMD, and (iii) the company paid too much for Worldpay – acquiring it at 10.5-times EBITDA versus the 6.5-times multiple Global Payments trades at. Moreover, investors have grown skeptical of deals of this sort in the payments space after two of the three largest deals made in a 2019 wave of consolidation have been unwound (Global Payments – TSYS and FIS – Worldpay).

But the good news is that failure is priced in. Management thinks the Worldpay transaction makes strategic sense for Global Payments, simplifying its business model into a pure-play commerce solutions provider, and that it will provide $600 million in annual cost synergies and $200 million in revenue synergies. The market is not believing this or has little faith that management can achieve these synergies. From where the stock trades today, if management can come anywhere close to achieving these synergies and executing on this transaction, it will be a nice return for stockholders. What this company needs right now is help in execution and enhanced credibility, and Elliott can provide both.

There are companies that could use shareholder representation on the board and companies that need it. Global Payments is much closer to the latter. A reconstituted board that holds management accountable, commits to an M&A moratorium and adds members with experience integrating large acquisitions will almost immediately restore investor confidence in the company. Thereafter, the board can start to de-lever and possibly buy back shares at the appropriate time if Global Payments' stock is still significantly undervalued. We would also expect the board to do the most important thing boards do – oversee and evaluate senior management, but we do not think there would be any material management changes ahead of such a large acquisition like this.

Given the almost universal opposition to the Worldpay acquisition and the low investor confidence in management, we would expect that Elliott will be able to walk onto this board with any reasonable slate. In a contested situation for the 10-person unitary board using a universal proxy card, Global Payments would almost certainly face significant defeat. Elliott recently won two of four seats at Phillips 66 in a proxy fight with a much higher degree of difficulty. The fund made its reputation as an activist almost two decades ago as primarily a strategic activist in technology companies, making great returns getting companies sold or participating in the acquisition. However, Elliott has since evolved into a much broader and comprehensive activist in strategy, sector and geography. Today, the firm often does its best activism from the board level. We believe that a reconstituted board that includes an Elliott representative will restore investor confidence and increase the probability of a successful integration of Worldpay.

The landmark crypto bill that just passed in Congress paves the way for more businesses to issue their own stablecoins. 

This corner of the crypto market has received a lot of attention as the GENIUS Act moved toward becoming law, with crypto proponents cheering the huge show of legislative support. 

These digital assets are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to fiat money like the US dollar. Right now, they're mostly used by crypto traders to easily buy other tokens. 

However, stablecoins used for payments would be a monumental shift in the foundations of commerce. 

In June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Walmart and Amazon were considering launching their own stablecoins. Now that the GENIUS Act has cleared the final legislative hurdle, crypto experts expect big changes to the payments ecosystem. 

Here's what to know. 

It isn't hard to see the incentive for big companies like Walmart or Amazon. 

Businesses could save significant amounts in credit card processing fees, cutting out an expensive intermediary by having people use their proprietary crypto as payment. 

"Retailers currently lose an estimated 2% to 3% of every transaction to credit card processing fees," CoinRoutes co-founder Dave Weisberger, said.

"For companies with billions in sales, eliminating even a portion of that margin drag could unlock 10s of millions in savings. Stablecoins offer a potential alternative that reduces frictional costs, accelerates settlement times, and gives merchants more control over payment rails."

Eliminating that type of cost would be a boon for Walmart and Amazon, but would be a blow to credit card issuers like Visa and Mastercard. 

"If a fraction of their customer base starts using a store-issued stablecoin instead of a Visa-backed card, that's billions in interchange fees gone overnight," Will Reeves, CEO of bitcoin rewards app Fold, told Business Insider.

Visa recently issued a statement on the passing of the GENIUS Act, noting that it anticipated the market shift brought on by stablecoin adoption. It stated that it is "laying the groundwork by building and supporting blockchain-based solutions that help our partners and clients integrate stablecoins into the future of mainstream payments."

For people shopping with a retailer like Amazon or Walmart, a stablecoin payment system might not feel all that different from what they're doing now.

According to Kevin Lehtiniitty, CEO of stablecoin network Borderless.xyz, a stablecoin issued by a big retailer would feel similar to using a gift card. 

Reeves shared a similar perspective. 

"On the surface, not much changes - you tap your phone, check out, maybe earn extra rewards or save on fees. But underneath, everything shifts. Walmart and Amazon aren't just retailers anymore—they're now your bank and your payment network."

The benefit for shoppers could ultimately be lower prices if companies pass what they save in transaction fees to their customers.

"Competition at this scale drives down transaction costs, and that means consumers will likely see lower prices, better rewards, or both," Reeves added.

Dan Silverman, CEO of Balcony Technology Group, noted that the rise of corporate stablecoins could also prove beneficial to unbanked people, as it would allow them to access digital currency through their phones.

"The big thing I could also imagine is for loyalty points or rewards to be baked into the token itself," he stated. "Think about when you get that long printed out receipt that has savings on it that you end up throwing out and never taking advantage of. The savings could be issued automatically on-chain."

In order for either company's stablecoin initiative to succeed, its customers would have to trust them.

A potential downside for consumers is that stablecoins could add another layer to a process that's become pretty simple over the years. Shoppers would have to buy the stablecoins first and then use them to transact. For many people, it could be simpler to just keep using credit or debit cards already on file. 

Another risk for consumers is the management of stablecoin reserves. To hold their value, the tokens must be backed by an equivalent amount of liquid reserves, such as cash or short-term Treasurys. If these reserves are mismanaged or the issuing entity runs into financial trouble, the stablecoins could untether from their fiat peg and lose their value.

Dimitar Radev, who'll help set euro-zone interest rates from next year, has seen more than his fair share of political upheaval.

The 69-year-old head of Bulgaria's central bank was a Finance Ministry official in the 1980s when the Communist government abruptly closed it. After witnessing the regime's eventual collapse and the ministry's reinstatement, he helped his country emerge from a bout of hyperinflation before joining the push to make it the euro area's 21st member.

Along the "last road in Ireland," on the country's rugged west coast, June O'Connell's business Skellig Six18 makes gin and whiskey — a time-intensive process guided by the wind, rain and cool temperatures that roll in year-round off the Atlantic.

America was a natural target market once their first spirits were ready to sell in 2019, according to O'Connell, given its strong familiarity with Ireland and big appetite for premium drinks. As an independent supplier, negotiations with distributors, marketers and retailers took more than a year, and her first products left County Kerry in November 2023 for a U.S. launch in early 2024.

Then the political tide started turning in the White House.

"Once it became clear which way things were heading, people were trying to get a lot of product stateside ahead of tariffs. We did do some of that, but now warehouses are full, importers are saying don't send any more, and it's only the big customers who are getting priority," O'Connell told CNBC.

Since the start of the year, President Donald Trump's unpredictable tariff announcements have been roiling businesses of all sizes.

The European Union in particular has drawn Trump's ire for its 198 billion euro ($231 billion) trade surplus in goods with the U.S.

He argues tariffs are needed to create a more balanced relationship; EU officials, however, argue that trade is more even across goods, services and investments, and have pledged to increase oil and gas purchases to narrow the gap.

Last weekend, Trump announced he is planning to hit the EU with a blanket tariff rate of 30% from Aug. 1, after last-minute negotiations failed to produce a framework deal. Huge uncertainty now hangs over whether an agreement can be struck in the next two weeks, and what details or compromises it might contain.

The Trump administration has already imposed a 10% baseline duty on EU imports, along with higher rates for automotives and metals.

The fact that the U.K.'s trade deal with the U.S. maintained a 10% baseline tariff with some sector exemptions has led many to believe that this could be Europe's best hope. The Financial Times reported Friday that Trump is now taking a harder line in EU negotiations and pushing for minimum tariffs of 15-20%, citing people briefed on the talks. CNBC has not independently confirmed the report.

The EU's food and drink trade with the U.S. is worth almost 30 billion euros, and trade group FoodDrinkEurope warned this week that any escalation in tariffs — which are generally paid by the importer — would hit European producers and farmers, while limiting choice and driving up costs for U.S. consumers.

Even the 10% U.S. import tariff imposed in April has been a blow to business, Skellig Six18's O'Connell said, with the final price impact on the consumer being much higher once additional costs have been passed up the supply chain.

"In terms of pricing, 30% [tariffs] would be untenable. The whole situation definitely stifles your ambition stateside," she added.

For Franck Choisne, president of French distillery Combier, a 10% tariff has been just about manageable. Founded in 1834, Combier is best known for making the liqueur triple sec – used in margarita cocktails – and the U.S. represents around 25% of its overall sales.

However, Choisne notes that the 10% tariff comes on top of a hit from the currency market. A weaker U.S. dollar this year has made it more expensive for the U.S. to import foreign goods, an additional dampener on demand.

A 30% tariff, plus exchange rate effects, would mean an overall rate of 45-50% is reflected in final consumer prices, he said, a level that could halve his company's U.S. sales.

"We understand President Trump wants a better balance between imports and exports, but at that 30% level then of course the EU will respond, trade will be hit and it will be a lose-lose situation," he said.

U.S. exporters of products such as bourbon would also suffer, a factor Choisne said kept him optimistic that the two sides will eventually negotiate a zero-tariff deal for the spirits industry.

In Italy's Lombardy countryside, more than half a million huge wheels of Grana Padano cheese roll off the supply lines of family-run business Zanetti each year. The company, which also makes parmesan and other hard cheeses, exports over 70% of its products, and the U.S. accounts for 15% of total turnover.

According to its president and CEO Attilio Zenetti, the volatility created by tariffs this year has been unlike any before, with contradictory announcements generating a huge amount of additional admin.

"It gives a lot of uncertainty and does not allow us to organise a real strategy," he said, bar trying to ship as many products as possible before higher rates potentially come into effect.

Zenetti said that the weaker dollar plus tariffs had already increased the company's U.S. retail prices by 25%. "Further increases would of course directly reflect again on U.S. wholesale and retail prices and we fear that this will affect volumes," he said.

For some businesses, mitigating the tariff impact has meant looking at new supply chain options.

Alex Altmann, partner at accounting firm Lubbock Fine and VP of the British Chamber of Commerce in Germany, said that some EU manufacturers were considering moving their assembly lines to the U.K. to try to take advantage of its existing 10% agreement. In doing so, they must navigate the complexity of "rules of origin" that determine the source of a product for tax purposes.

Altmann gave the example of a German kitchen appliance manufacturer with strong demand in the U.S. The company sources most of its materials cheaply from Asia and imports them into the EU at a low tariff rate. It is not too difficult to then shift the final assembly process to a factory in the U.K., he said, to benefit from a 10% — instead of a potential 30% — tariff on products as they enters the U.S.

"We might not be facing these big tariff differences for a long time, but even if you cash in for a few months it's quite significant money," he added.

Elsewhere, big corporations are considering shifting at least some manufacturing to the U.S. German industrial giant Siemens, for example, told CNBC it had taken steps to localize manufacturing, and engineering group Bosch likewise said it was prioritizing a local-for-local model as it looks to expand its North America business.

However, for Skellig Six18's O'Connell, moving production is not possible. That's because the production of "origin protected" items — like an Irish whiskey, Italian parma ham or French champagne — can't be moved elsewhere.

Instead, O'Connell's is focusing on new potential markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America, but noted the difficulty of doing so in places without solid existing whiskey sales. Combier distillery's Franck Choisne, meanwhile, pointed out that becoming established somewhere new is resource-intensive, costly and could take years. In other words, it's no easy fix for a decline in U.S. sales.

"At times like this I just try to remember that I'm in an industry that's nearly 700 years old, requires patience and reminds you that things don't last forever," O'Connell said. "You just have to keep controlling the controllables."

Bitcoin's price action has turned somewhat sluggish after its unprecedented climb to a new all-time high of $122,838 on July 14. The rapid push to that level was preceded by a week of frenzied trading and heavy inflows, with BTC breaking through multiple resistance zones in quick succession. However, once that peak was hit, a series of volatile intraday movements followed to give a pullback to $116,000 and Bitcoin is now back to trading between the $117,000 and $118,500 price zone.

A notable bearish call came from crypto analyst Melikatrader94, who posted a technical breakdown on the TradingView platform that might send Bitcoin down to $113,000.

QML Zone Rejection Points To Downtrend Toward $113,600

According to the hourly candlestick chart shared by Melikatrader94, Bitcoin is currently exhibiting a Quasimodo Level (QML) structure. The Quasimodo Level (QML) structure is characterized by three peaks in a bearish scenario or three troughs in a bullish scenario, with the middle one being the most prominent, identifying the price. The post predicted that Bitcoin's entry into the $119,000–$121,000 zone would draw sellers, and this was indeed the case. 

The quick rejection after its all-time high confirms a bearish shift in structure, and now the momentum is tilted to the downside. This rejection came after a significant price move that engulfed a previous structural support level.

“BTC rejected from QML zone and the selloff confirms bears are active,” the analyst noted. 

The bearish outlook remains valid as long as Bitcoin stays below the QML zone, with the next critical support level situated at $113,600. This area could serve as a potential point for either a bounce or short-term consolidation if the price continues downward. However, a pullback is likely to occur around $116,000 before Bitcoin falls to $113,600.



Altcoins Under Threat As BTC Price Weakens

The potential Bitcoin crash to the $113,000 region could have serious implications for many altcoins that are already starting to post massive gains. However, these altcoins, which often follow Bitcoin's lead, are already showing signs of nervousness as BTC struggles to maintain upward momentum. 

Among the notable movers, XRP finally broke its eight-year-old resistance to hit a new all-time high of $3.65. However, the rally appears to be stalling, with the token now showing early signs of a correction around the $3.45 zone. Ethereum, which also surged on the back of Bitcoin's push to $122,000, climbed above $3,600 for the first time in months but has since settled into a consolidation phase just below $3,500.

Should the leading cryptocurrency break below $116,000 in the coming days, it may cause a cascade of outflows from altcoins and lead to increased selling pressure across the board. However, we could see these major altcoins finally detach from Bitcoin's movement. This would lead to an altcoin season where major altcoins outperform Bitcoin for some time.

SharpLink Gaming shares closed down 20% on Friday, a day after the gambling marketing company said it was looking to boost a stock sale from $1 billion to $6 billion in a regulatory filing—its latest move in an ongoing effort to build its Ethereum treasury.

SharpLink (SBET), according to Yahoo Finance, was was still up about 16% for a week that included two major ETH purchases.

The Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company's stock has reacted positively to previous announcements tied to its strategic shift to become the world's largest corporate accumulator of ETH, a position it now holds, based on Arkham data. SBET jumped 16% after picking up $48 million on Monday and then $225 million on Tuesday

SBET has spiked more than 330% since late May when it took initial steps to pivot its focus from affiliate marketing with a $425 million private placement largely earmarked for Ethereum buying.


With Thursday purchases of more than $115 million in ETH, the firm holds about $1.3 billion worth of the asset, according to Arkham.

In a Thursday supplement to a prospectus filed May 30 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it would increase its stock sale goal by $5 billion.

"We are increasing the total amount of common stock that may be sold under the sales agreement to $6 billion, comprising of up to $1 billion under the prior prospectus and an additional $5 billion under this prospectus supplement," the company said in the latest filing.

Ethereum was recently trading at about $3,550, a 2% dip over the past 24 hours, according to crypto markets data provider CoinGecko. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value has risen more than 41% over the past 14 days as a number of companies with ETH treasuries have added to their holdings, and amid rising optimism about the underlying Ethereum network's usefulness.

On Friday, Bit Digital (BTBT), which previously focused on Bitcoin mining, announced the purchase of approximately 19,683 ETH. The company holds about 120,306 Ethereum worth nearly $70 million. BTBT's share price sank more than 4% on Friday, although it is up about 60% this year.

On Thursday, the Peter Thiel-backed BitMine Immersion, which also moved from mining to Ethereum holding, surpassed $1 billion in Ethereum after adding $500 million in ETH to its holdings. The firm, which hopes to control 5% of all Ethereum held or staked, debuted its strategy earlier this month.

Those firms have followed a model pioneered by Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which shifted from software development to Bitcoin purchasing in 2020 after years of struggling and low share prices. Strategy now holds more than 601,500 Bitcoin worth over $71 billion based on BTC's current price, according to bitcointreasuries.net.

Cardano (ADA) just broke past the $0.80 mark, and the crypto community is buzzing with excitement. The odds of an ETF approval are climbing to 84%. Yeah, that's right. Traders are keeping a close watch to see how this might reshape the altcoin landscape. But what does it really mean for crypto payroll and the broader market?

Cardano's price has recently crossed above $0.80, which is quite a turnaround after weeks of hovering below key resistance levels. This jump comes after a solid 14% rally over the past week, bouncing back from a low of $0.54. The rise in price is closely linked to the growing likelihood of a spot ADA ETF being approved, which has now hit 84% on Polymarket. This shift in sentiment seems to reflect a growing confidence among traders, fueled by speculation around new crypto products and clearer regulations in the U.S.

People have also noted a rounding bottom on the chart, which is often a sign of a shift in market direction. The increase in ETF approval odds came alongside more buying activity, so whether ADA continues to rise depends on whether it can maintain its position above these crucial levels.

Regulatory clarity is a big deal for crypto payroll solutions. Especially in Asia, where countries are putting clearer legal frameworks in place for cryptocurrencies. Once businesses understand the compliance requirements better, it reduces the risk of legal penalties, thus encouraging more companies to adopt crypto payroll. This could lead to greater acceptance of crypto payments, particularly stablecoins, which are less volatile than traditional cryptocurrencies.

The implications of regulatory clarity go beyond compliance; they also encourage innovation and investment in crypto. As institutional interest increases, startups can utilize this momentum to create crypto-friendly payroll platforms that meet the needs of both businesses and employees. The rise of crypto payroll for startups and the trend of "Pay Me in Bitcoin" among tech workers show how salary payments are changing.

Aside from the ETF chatter, Cardano's network has also seen a spike in activity, with over $100 million locked in Cardano-based decentralized applications since late June. This increase suggests that more people are adopting the blockchain's offerings, like lending, trading, and liquidity pools. The uptick in on-chain activity supports Cardano's price rise, as users engage more with ADA-based applications.

For startups, this growth offers a chance to incorporate crypto solutions into their financial operations. As Cardano's ecosystem expands, businesses can take advantage of its technology to access decentralized financial services and innovative payment solutions more easily. Plus, the focus on stablecoins in Cardano's treasury strategy highlights their role in providing stable value and facilitating smoother crypto payments.

Looking ahead, analysts think that if ADA gets an ETF approval, it could draw more institutional interest and push prices up across the altcoin market. An approved Cardano ETF would likely unleash billions from institutional investors, increasing demand and liquidity for ADA and possibly other altcoins. This could enhance market credibility and encourage broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance.

But, let's not forget that short-term pullbacks often follow previous rallies linked to ETF approvals in crypto. Traders are on high alert, especially regarding the regulatory response to the current bid for a Cardano spot ETF. These developments will significantly impact market dynamics.

Cardano's recent price surge and rising ETF approval odds have sparked new interest in the project. With substantial trading volumes and increased activity on the blockchain, ADA may be positioned for more gains. The combination of regulatory clarity and network growth presents an opportunity for crypto payroll solutions to thrive, signaling a shift in how businesses are incorporating cryptocurrency into their financial operations.

As the landscape for crypto payroll evolves, companies need to be informed and flexible to make the most of this growing market. The future of crypto payroll looks promising, and Cardano's developments could be a catalyst for innovation and adoption across the industry.

According to an on-chain analyst on X, Bitcoin has decoupled from other cryptocurrencies or altcoins, which could lead to a severe price downturn within the market over the next day.

Why Traders Should Brace For Impact

In a July 18 post on the social media platform X, Joao Wedson, founder of crypto analytics firm Alphractal, reported that the Bitcoin price might witness a significant drop over the next day. The crypto analyst based his conclusion on multiple results obtained from on-chain analysis using three major metrics. 

First, Wedson referenced an earlier post made on X by Alphractal, saying that the market is currently dominated by long positions. According to the analyst, the effect of these long positions wouldn't necessarily last long in a market where the shorts have been liquidated — a phenomenon which also holds for the reverse case. 

The chart above is from the Correlation Heatmap – BTCUSDT versus ALTCOINS metric, which reads the trajectory of the two crypto categories and compares them. Using the chart as a foundation, Wedson mentioned that altcoins are decoupling from Bitcoin. 

When altcoins cease to follow the premier cryptocurrency's lead, the development could be subject to a couple of interpretations, which affect market sentiment. As a result, it is normal to expect increased market volatility.

Wedson also referenced the Altcoin Season Index Vs Bitcoin metric, which is used to measure if altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin within a specific period. According to the analyst, this Altcoin Season Index is currently on the rise, which is typically a positive sign for the altcoins. 

However, if historical trends are anything to go by, a rising Altcoin Season Index might be a negative signal for Bitcoin. Wedson explained that the Bitcoin market might experience a dump, dragging along with it the currently rising Altcoins, to re-establish market balance.

The crypto pundit also cited the Alpha Quant Signal as an influence in his conclusion. Wedson pointed out that the metric flashed a sell, which was expected, seeing as some significant whales recently added to the sell pressure on Bitcoin by selling a fraction of their holdings.

Outlook For The Altcoins

Even as the market flashes ominous signs, Joao Wedson expressed optimism in the viability of the beginning of an altcoin rally, saying he doesn't believe this is the final leg down for the crypto market. “But it's likely a sign that the market is about to form a new price base. So be cautious with the traps that might show up along the way,” the analyst added. 

As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $117,783, reflecting a mere 0.2% price increase in the past 24 hours. Representing the other camp, Ethereum, the “king of altcoins,” jumped by 2.23% in 24 hours and is currently valued at $3,562.

Oops, something went wrong

Wall Street's most prominent crypto bull just made his biggest bet yet—and it's not on Bitcoin. Tom Lee, the Fundstrat strategist known for his prescient bitcoin price forecasts, has been appointed chair of BitMine Immersion Technologies, a little-known company positioning itself as the “MicroStrategy of Ethereum.”

In a recent CNBC interview, Lee laid out his case for why Ethereum could be the next trillion-dollar opportunity, while also defending the market's concentration in AI leaders like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). His insights offer a roadmap for investors navigating today's tech-heavy, AI-driven market.

Lee's enthusiasm for Ethereum centers on what he calls the “rediscovery of Ethereum” as institutional adoption accelerates. The catalyst? Stablecoins. Lee described stablecoin development by companies like Circle (NYSE:CRCL) as the “ChatGPT moment for crypto,” driving unprecedented Wall Street interest in building on Ethereum's blockchain.

The numbers support his thesis. Currently, 30% of Ethereum's network usage comes from stablecoins, with JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) stablecoin and Robinhood's (NASDAQ:HOOD) tokenizing business choosing Ethereum as their foundation. More than 60% of all tokenized real-world assets now live on Ethereum, establishing it as Wall Street's “preferred choice” for blockchain infrastructure.

Lee referenced former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen‘s prediction that stablecoins could grow to over $2 trillion, which he sees as “exponential usage of Ethereum and the Ethereum token.” This institutional adoption story mirrors Bitcoin's corporate treasury adoption narrative that drove its meteoric rise.

Through BitMine Immersion Technologies, Lee is executing a bold capital markets strategy. The company recently completed a private investment in public equity transaction, selling 55 million shares at around $4.50 each for $250 million. Lee confirmed this money is being used primarily to buy Ethereum, leveraging “whatever relative premium exists to actually use capital markets to grow their Ethereum holdings.”

However, investors should understand the valuation dynamics. With the PIPE shares bringing total outstanding shares to at least 61 million—significantly higher than the 6 million often reported—the company's market capitalization runs into billions, even at lower stock prices. This means investors are paying “many multiples of the value of the ether you're buying,” betting on Ethereum's future appreciation rather than getting exposure at net asset value.

Lee's market perspective extends beyond crypto to the broader AI revolution. He argues in a CNBC interview that companies like Nvidia, which he calls “scarcer than da Vinci,” deserve their premium valuations. Trading at around 30 times earnings, Nvidia's multiple “is not that extended given how important they are to the AI ecosystem.

His defense of market concentration addresses a common investor concern: the top 10 companies represent 40% of market capitalization, with Nvidia alone comprising nearly 8%. Lee counters that these companies represent a “huge share of earnings growth,” particularly as the S&P 500 benefits from being “at the center of AI.”

He points to a counterintuitive valuation argument: despite the market enduring “six essentially black swans in the last five years” and thriving in terms of earnings, the mean S&P multiple (equal weight) sits around 16—lower than the 17.9 multiple on the eve of Covid. Companies producing “durable, sustained earnings growth” like Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), Nvidia, and Tesla deserve higher multiples, Lee told CNBC.

Lee's dual thesis—defending AI leaders while betting big on Ethereum—reflects a broader shift in how institutional investors view technology infrastructure. His argument that financial innovation, including Circle and other cryptocurrencies, contributes significant earnings growth to the S&P suggests crypto adoption has moved beyond speculative trading to become a legitimate earnings driver.

For investors, Lee's strategy offers a template: identify the infrastructure plays that will benefit from massive capital expenditure trends, whether that's Nvidia for AI computation or Ethereum for financial tokenization. However, his BitMine play also illustrates the premium investors pay for exposure to these themes through public markets.

The question for investors isn't whether these megatrends will continue—Lee's track record suggests they will. It's whether the current valuations, from Nvidia's 30x multiple to BitMine's significant premium to its Ethereum holdings, already reflect these opportunities or still offer room for growth.

Welcome to Gotham 2.0.

Mayor Eric Adams said he plans to rely much more on artificial intelligence to assist New Yorkers if he's re-elected to a second term.

“We're gonna run a smarter city,” he told The Post Thursday during an interview at Gracie Mansion.

“I'm talking about having an opportunity now to use everything from artificial intelligence to blockchain, new technology that's out there that could make our city smarter, so that our working class people can get the proper delivery of services.”

One example being explored is using blockchain technology to speed up the process for providing copies of birth and death certificates to the public, the Mayor's Office said.

Another is using AI to quickly translate English to other languages when needed, such as helping authorities better assist victims when they use voice-controlled drones during search-and-rescue missions and other emergencies.

Adams has embraced the tech industry and digital currency since becoming mayor in 2022, as he's pledged to help make NYC the crypto capital of the world.

He put his money where his mouth early on by agreeing to take his first three paychecks in bitcoin. Adams, who earns $258,750 a year as mayor, reported the value of the bitcoin ranging from $5,000 to nearly $55,000 in his financial disclosure statement for 2024 filed with the NYC Conflicts of Interest Board.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

The US Congress has concluded its Crypto Week with significant developments in cryptocurrency legislation. The House of Representatives passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark stablecoin bill, with bipartisan support after several revisions. This bill is now headed to the president's desk for signature. The GENIUS Act will come into effect 18 months after the president's signature or 120 days after the final regulations are published by the US Treasury and Federal Reserve. Once in effect, stablecoin issuers will be subject to strict reserve requirements and the Bank Secrecy Act. 

The House also passed the CLARITY Act, a market structure bill championed by the blockchain industry, and a bill banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). These two bills will now proceed to the Senate, where they may face further deliberation and amendments due to the slimmer pro-crypto Republican majority. 

The GENIUS Act, once signed into law, will compel many American stablecoin issuers to become banks, as they will be limited solely to stablecoin issuance. Most US stablecoin issuers currently offer more services, and pursuing a bank charter would allow them to issue stablecoins along with a wider range of activities without needing state-to-state licenses. However, the final version of the bill does not include a provision for stablecoin issuers to offer interest on customer stablecoin reserves, a point of contention for some industry leaders. 

Three years after the bill is signed, no foreign stablecoin issuers that aren't approved in the US will be able to offer a stablecoin in the country, with some exceptions if the US Treasury deems the issuer's country of origin has a comparable regulatory regime. 

The CLARITY Act aims to offer "digital commodities on mature blockchains" an exemption from the Securities Act of 1933 and reassign regulatory oversight from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Despite criticism from some House Democrats, the act enjoyed significant bipartisan support. 

Senate Democrats who supported the GENIUS Act may also vote in favor of the CLARITY Act, despite vocal criticism from crypto-skeptic Democrats. The vote on the Anti-CBDC bill was closer, reflecting a more partisan divide on whether the Fed should be prevented from issuing a digital dollar. If a few Senate Democrats vote for the bill, it could have a chance at passing. 

The crypto industry is optimistic about these developments, viewing them as a significant step towards the full integration of crypto into the country's financial system. Industry leaders believe that pro-crypto laws in the US could influence laws abroad and help the US reclaim digital asset leadership. With more politicians swinging pro-crypto, the passage of these bills seems more a matter of "when" than "if."

Movement on the crypto front at the federal level has the potential to usher in substantial change. Here's what it means for your portfolio.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Since President Donald Trump won the election in November, the price of bitcoin has surged from about $70,000 to roughly $120,000. This massive climb is due to high expectations for looser regulation, along with a crypto-friendly regime in both Congress and in the White House.

And Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, sees even bigger gains ahead. "With policy, macro, and flows aligning, bitcoin may be setting up for a bullish end to the year – where a push toward $200,000 is no longer just a long shot, but a growing probability," he says.

While the realities of finding consensus among lawmakers on cryptocurrency have delayed some progress so far, the passage of the GENIUS Act in late July, which we detail below, shows that the industry is poised to score some major wins.

And with two other crypto-related bills on lawmakers' radar, it's worth sizing up the legislative landscape. Indeed, these bills have the potential to deliver tremendous impacts to those with exposure to the space, from retail investors to traditional banks to eager fintech and blockchain startups.

If you're wondering what bitcoin investors need to know about the crypto bills in Congress right now, here's a quick rundown.

The GENIUS Act, short for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, was passed by legislators in late July and signed into law by President Trump. It marks the first crypto bill to make it over the finish line in the 119th Congress.

This legislation will establish a framework to accelerate the development of stablecoins, which are a type of digital currency designed to minimize volatility by having their value pegged to a more stable secondary asset such as the U.S. dollar.

The goal is the same as legacy currency, in that the value remains constant so that businesses and consumers can transact with confidence. The regulation allows for the privacy that crypto enthusiasts want, as well as the benefits of quick and cheap transfers on digital payment rails.

One challenge stablecoins face is the built-in privacy of cryptocurrencies, which offers a serious stumbling block for regulators and law enforcement professionals.

Take tether, the leading stablecoin that is estimated to have a $160 billion market value. It continues to face regulatory scrutiny regarding loose "Know Your Customer" requirements, which are standard at traditional banks to ensure these institutions are not supporting war criminals or terrorist states.

But the GENIUS Act looks to find a middle ground, proposing "permitted stablecoin issuers" who are subject to state and federal licensing and oversight.

This is expected to bring a measure of accountability to the space without forcing the issuers to follow traditional banking rules or undercutting some of the privacy features that make stablecoins popular to begin with.

Why it matters for bitcoin investors: Adoption and support for stablecoins will make more mainstream consumers and businesses increasingly comfortable with crypto as they look beyond the legacy financial system.

In a recent earnings call, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon admitted his firm has to focus on internal stablecoin development if it wants to fend off competition on payments processing, deposits and even credit card rewards.

The billions of dollars currently held in tether stablecoins seem to indicate these digital assets can and will coexist with minimal impact on the value proposition of bitcoin.

In truth, many investors see bitcoin's volatility as a feature – so long as that volatility continues to generally provide upside, of course.

But continued confidence in digital currencies used for normal consumer and business transactions would be undeniably good for bitcoin, providing yet another proof point that this digital asset is far more than just a fad.

The CLARITY Act, also known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, aims to clarify registration requirements and regulatory structures for bitcoin market participants, including digital commodity exchanges, brokers and dealers.

The hard reality is that a multi-year turf war between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over jurisdictional issues has created headaches for companies that want to get involved with bitcoin or crypto, but don't know who is in charge of enforcement or oversight.

Consider major exchange Coinbase Global (COIN), which even brought a lawsuit to federal courts in an effort to force the SEC to respond to one of its requests after years of foot-dragging.

When a regulator is so disengaged or confused that they ignore market participants rather than answering "yes" or "no" on new products or approaches, it is not a good signal for companies that are looking to innovate or challenge the old way of doing business.

The situation is further complicated by proposals that have been floated to do away with the CFTC altogether and roll the organization into the SEC.

And considering the CFTC has just two commissioners at present, one of whom announced in May she would be leaving the agency, there is an urgent need to figure out who's the boss.

As for the CLARITY Act, the bill passed in the House of Representatives on July 17 and now heads to the Senate for consideration.

Why it matters for bitcoin investors: Some bitcoin-related entities operate offshore, and sometimes in unscrupulous ways. So, regulatory clarity is a critical step in building investor confidence as well as supporting market structure providers.

In many ways, it's pretty amazing that bitcoin has grown as much as it has in the face of this confusing situation between the SEC and CFTC.

Disruptive technologies often force public policy stakeholders to rethink the ruleset. But bitcoin has existed since 2009 and has had institutional interest on Wall Street for roughly a decade.

So the glass-half-full take on the lack of clarity at present could be that there are great tools, eager market participants and next-gen applications waiting in the wings for regulatory clarity.

And if not, at minimum, the CLARITY Act would provide the long-term path to a regulated and safe environment – but also one that becomes more competitive as startups gain confidence that their next big idea is worth pursuing as it falls within congressionally approved parameters.

Part of the reason movement on crypto regulation has been hard is that some of these bills get tied together. In fact, some lawmakers tried to include language from the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act into the CLARITY Act that would ban efforts to establish central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the U.S.

The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act was eventually passed in the House of Representatives on July 17 as a separate piece of legislation that now heads to the Senate.

CBDCs can be thought of as a digital dollar or digital euro, a form of currency that is issued and backed by a local central bank – just like hard currencies.

For some hardline conservatives, this idea of government-sponsored blockchains of citizen transactions veers too close to Big Brother financial surveillance. Hence, the name of the bill includes opposition to both CBDC as well as the "surveillance state."

According to Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-IN), the passage of the bill that he sponsored will "codify President Trump's effort to prevent the development of a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, and ensure the United States' digital currency policy remains in the hands of the American people, and not the Administrative state."

Why it matters for bitcoin investors: To many bitcoin believers, CBDCs are the antithesis of the cryptocurrency promise. After all, the very prefix "crypto" implies something hidden or secret – and the privacy offered by digital assets that operate outside the traditional financial system has in many ways fueled its appeal.

Many experts have speculated that increased movement or even discussions around CBDCs will drive more folks to bitcoin because of its proven record of privacy, and its global nature that is separate from national politics and central banking.

Time will tell if this provision advances in the Senate, or more importantly, whether the U.S. Federal Reserve or any other Western bank launches a CBDC that catches on.

Even the European Central Bank, which is far more advanced in its quest for a digital currency, hasn't moved beyond initial preparation and stakeholder discussions. That means there's little risk of bitcoin losing its appeal anytime soon to a CBDC.

 Charles Schwab plans to offer spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum, aiming to attract clients who want to consolidate crypto holdings with their traditional assets. 

Charles Schwab is preparing to expand its crypto offerings by launching spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to CEO Rick Wurster.

In an interview with CNBC on Friday, Wurster said Schwab clients already hold significant exposure to crypto via exchange-traded products (ETPs), owning more than 20% of the industry's crypto ETP market. However, he noted that crypto still represents a relatively small portion of clients' total wealth, around $25 billion out of $10.8 trillion.

“We anticipate launching Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) sometime soon so that our clients have access to that,” he said. “We think that will be an acceleration of our growth.”

The CEO claimed that many clients currently keep 98% of their wealth with Schwab but hold just 1% to 2% of their crypto assets with digital-native firms. “They really want to bring it back to Schwab because they trust us. They want us to sit alongside their other assets,” he added.

Wurster said that Schwab is “absolutely” looking to compete against crypto exchanges like Coinbase by introducing spot crypto trading. “If they're buying their crypto at Coinbase, we would love to see them bring their crypto back to Schwab,” he said.

Earlier this year, Wurster said the company expects an April 2026 launch window to provide spot Bitcoin trading services to Schwab clients. At the time, he cited a 400% increase in traffic to Schwab's crypto website as evidence of investor interest in digital assets.

Schwab has increased its involvement in the crypto sector amid growing regulatory clarity. In 2025, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Reserve rescinded earlier restrictive guidelines issued after the FTX collapse. The change allows banks to participate in crypto activities such as custody and trading.

Following approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Schwab added Bitcoin and Ether ETFs to its platform. The company also provides other crypto-related products, including mixed ETFs, mutual funds, and Bitcoin options, according to its website.

A survey conducted in March by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon found that 83% of institutional investors intend to increase their crypto holdings in 2025, with many already investing in altcoins beyond Bitcoin and Ether.

The survey identified XRP (XRP) and Solana (SOL) as the most favored assets among respondents. It also showed that most expect to allocate 5% or more of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies this year.

Similarly, a May report by Fireblocks found that 90% of institutional players are using or exploring stablecoins, with almost half already deploying them for payments.

The House of Representatives yesterday passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act alongside legislation for stablecoins (GENIUS Act) and crypto market infrastructure (Clarity Act). While the GENIUS Act has already passed the Senate, the Anti-CBDC bill still requires a Senate vote.

The current version of the Anti-CBDC bill has refined its language to block only retail central bank digital currencies. Earlier drafts could potentially have prevented the Federal Reserve from using distributed ledger technology (DLT) for a wholesale CBDC only usable by institutional users.

The legislation defines a central bank digital currency as “a form of digital money or monetary value that is—    (i) denominated in the national unit of account;    (ii) a direct liability of the Federal Reserve System; and    (iii) widely available to the general public.”

This distinction matters because wholesale CBDCs are not “widely available to the general public.” A Financial Times opinion piece published today suggested the legislation could isolate “the dollar from the rapid expansion of wholesale CBDCs, which allow faster and cheaper settlements among commercial banks and between central banks themselves.” However, this interpretation appears to misunderstand the current bill's scope.

The Federal Reserve began exploring the classification of wholesale CBDCs a couple of years ago in response to Republican opposition to government digital currencies. The central bank distinguishes between tokenized reserves, which represent existing central bank balances using different technology, and wholesale CBDCs, which create separate legal liabilities. Even if the Anti-CBDC legislation had failed to exclude wholesale CBDC, the Federal Reserve could have argued that a tokenized reserve is no different to current reserves. This is one of the reasons why central banks now prefer to use the term tokenized reserves instead of wholesale CBDCs.

 Cayman Islands-based Bullish has filed for IPO registration with the SEC, aiming to list on NYSE as “BLSH.” 

Bullish, a cryptocurrency exchange owned by Bullish Global, has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. The Cayman Islands-based firm plans to list its ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “BLSH.”

The exact number of shares to be offered and the price range remain unspecified, according to a Friday F-1 registration statement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the exchange has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase additional shares.

For fiscal year 2024, Bullish reported a net income of approximately $80 million. However, despite this positive full-year result, the company experienced a significant downturn in the first quarter of 2025, reporting a net loss of $349 million compared to a $104.8 million net profit in the same quarter of 2024.

Furthermore, the exchange claims over $1.9 billion in liquid assets, including cash, Bitcoin (BTC), stablecoins and other digital assets.

Bullish operates through subsidiaries across multiple jurisdictions, including Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Gibraltar.

Its Hong Kong subsidiaries play a crucial role in the exchange's operations, providing engineering, cybersecurity, custody, and technology services, per the filing. Bullish HK Markets Limited holds regulatory licenses in Hong Kong to facilitate digital asset trading.

Last month, the Financial Times reported that Bullish has filed confidential paperwork with the SEC for a US IPO. The report said that American investment bank Jefferies was selected as the lead underwriter for the offering.

The exchange, which previously attempted to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal in 2021, saw its earlier efforts collapse as markets soured amid rising interest rates.

Bullish's move comes amid recent successes in the crypto IPO space. Circle, the issuer of the USDC (USDC) stablecoin, raised $1.1 billion in its public debut last month, exceeding expectations and marking a record-setting 167% gain on its first day of trading.

On June 6, Gemini, the exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, also filed confidentially for a US listing. Both brothers supported Trump's reelection bid and have backed crypto-focused political action committees.

President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act on Friday, marking the first major US legislation to regulate cryptocurrency, especially the $250 billion stablecoin market. The bill had passed the House with bipartisan support from 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.

The signing ceremony included members of Congress and leaders from major crypto firms like Robinhood, Tether, and Gemini. The bill's progress was briefly blocked by a dozen conservative Republicans but was cleared after negotiations.

Dogecoin rebounded aggressively during the July 18 06:00 to July 19 05:00 session, recovering from steep mid-session losses to close with a sharp 8% gain. The token carved out a volatile $0.2267–$0.2560 range, bouncing off the $0.2267 session floor after heavy selling pressure and surging to tag $0.2561 in the final stretch. Bit Origin's $500 million treasury move and mounting DOGE ETF chatter helped restore confidence as volume surged above key thresholds throughout the recovery.

Bit Origin announced a $500 million institutional allocation plan to build DOGE-denominated treasury reserves, marking the largest known corporate move into the meme coin to date. The announcement coincided with a broader resurgence in the memecoin market, which has gained $17 billion this month. Meanwhile, traders are pricing in an 80% chance of a DOGE ETF approval by September, according to prediction platform Polymarket. These developments come as DOGE breaks out from a 10-month consolidation phase.

The 24-hour session opened at $0.2437, before sellers dragged DOGE to $0.2267 around 20:00. Volume surged to 1.102 billion—well above the 873.9 million average—as whales defended key support levels. A sharp post-midnight reversal pushed DOGE to $0.2533, delivering a 7.7% rebound off session lows.

In the final hour, DOGE traded within a tight 1.85% band between $0.2514 and $0.2561. Price hit session highs at 04:34 before retreating slightly on profit-taking. Notably, volume exploded to 1.66 billion during the rally and exceeded 45 million during the peak formation, signaling institutional participation.

DOGE's ability to hold above $0.25 will be key for any continuation higher. Traders are monitoring ETF headlines and broader memecoin sentiment, while breakout targets of $0.36 to $1.00 are now in play if institutional flows continue. The current volume profile supports short-term consolidation before a possible next leg up.

XRP surged to a fresh all-time high near $3.61 on the back of major U.S. crypto legislation advances and institutional ETF filings, before sliding into a volatile correction that tested bulls' conviction. The token shed 7.5% intraday but clawed back losses to close the session near $3.45 — suggesting consolidation rather than a full reversal.

• XRP hit a record high of $3.61 before falling to $3.34 — then rebounded to close at $3.45, down 4.4% from session open• Massive 308 million volume spike at $3.34 hints at institutional accumulation zone• Traders now eye $3.47-$3.48 as short-term resistance as bulls attempt to stabilize

Momentum picked up after the U.S. House passed three crypto-related bills — including the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts — which aim to provide clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets. In parallel, ProShares filed for the first XRP futures ETF, while 11 other asset managers submitted products tied to XRP price action. Traders are increasingly pricing in an 88% probability of spot XRP ETF approval by December 2025.

XRP opened the session on July 18 at $3.61 and declined steadily to an intraday low of $3.34 by 15:00, marking a 7.48% drawdown.• Key support emerged between $3.34–$3.37, bolstered by heavy volume prints of 280 million and 308 million at 07:00 and 08:00 respectively — more than 2x the 24h average.• XRP recovered 3.24% from the low to close at $3.45, signaling strategic buying interest rather than panic selloff.

• Session range: $3.61 (high) to $3.34 (low), a 7.48% swing• Recovery phase: From 15:00 onward, XRP stabilized in the $3.43–$3.45 zone with low-volume accumulation• Final hour: Sharp but failed breakout to $3.4759 at 04:34 on 2.88 million volume, followed by institutional profit-taking that pushed price back to $3.4380• Resistance remains firm at $3.47–$3.48• Support zone confirmed at $3.34–$3.37, reinforced by intraday whale buys

Despite the aggressive selloff from ATHs, XRP's ability to defend the $3.34–$3.37 zone and recover toward $3.45 points to ongoing institutional support and a bullish medium-term structure. Traders are now watching whether XRP can build fresh momentum above $3.48 to challenge the $3.60–$3.64 zone once more. The $3.34 floor remains the key level to hold if short-term bullish sentiment is to stay intact.

                    The crypto rally also powered gains in linked equities, with Coinbase and Robinhood climbing to all-time highs on Friday [File]

The crypto sector's market value hit $4 trillion on Friday, according to CoinGecko, marking a milestone that reflects its shift from a nascent asset class to a central part of the global investment landscape.

A wave of renewed optimism, regulatory clarity in key markets and rising institutional flows have catapulted the crypto sector to a new valuation peak.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to create a regulatory framework for U.S.-dollar-pegged cryptocurrency tokens, known as stablecoins, sending the bill to U.S. President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it into law.

"The arrival of the Trump legislation signaled an about-turn in attitudes towards the crypto industry, but legislators are still exercising some caution," said Derren Nathan, head of equity research, Hargreaves Lansdown.

House lawmakers also passed two other crypto bills, sending them next to the Senate for consideration. One lays out a regulatory framework for crypto, while the other seeks to ban the U.S. from issuing a central bank digital currency.

The $4 trillion milestone underscores how far the crypto industry has come from its speculative, fringe origins. With growing interest from asset managers, new exchange-traded products and broader adoption among retail and corporate users, digital assets are increasingly shaping conversations in global finance.

Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value, usually a 1:1 dollar peg, are commonly used by crypto traders to move funds between tokens. Their use has grown rapidly in recent years, and proponents say they could be used to send payments instantly.

"The Genius Act will go down in history as a law that served as a foundational step in mainstreaming of crypto as an asset class," said Chris Perkins, president, CoinFund.

Corporate treasury allocations to bitcoin are also gaining pace, with a growing number of public companies adding the token to their balance sheets as a long-term store of value.

The sector was last trading at a combined market value of $3.92 trillion, as bitcoin — the world's largest cryptocurrency — fell 1.8%.

Bitcoin crossed the $120,000 mark earlier this week, setting a record. Brokerage Bernstein forecast it could climb to $200,000 by end-2025.

Ether, the second-biggest crypto token, was last up 4.5%. It has more than doubled over the past three months.

The crypto rally also powered gains in linked equities, with Coinbase and Robinhood climbing to all-time highs on Friday.

Shares of the crypto exchange were last up 1%, while the retail trading platform, which also supports crypto trades, gained 3%.

Ether-focused stocks also saw broad gains.

 Bitcoiner Peter McCormack says the police "have failed" the town of Bedford and insists he can do a better job by deploying his own security team. 

Prominent Bitcoin podcaster and Real Bedford FC owner Peter McCormack claims he can tackle Bedford's rising crime rate better than the local police force, taking on a role some might liken to a real-life Batman.

However, the legal implications of his plan are still unknown.

“As I promised, if the police won't keep the town safe for our women and children, I will,” McCormack said in an X post on Friday, explaining that he is personally funding a pilot project to provide security in his hometown of Bedford, UK, with 10 guards patrolling the town center every Saturday.

“Why? Because the police have failed us. More crackheads, more aggressive beggars, more shoplifters, and therefore fewer people coming into town. Women are being harassed, shops are closing, and families no longer feel safe,” McCormack said.

McCormack said the announcement came only after he warned the police force. “The police aren't delivering. I put the police on notice regarding this,” he said.

McCormack is a vocal advocate for Bedford, a town of approximately 185,800 residents located less than two hours from London, according to Total Population data. He owns several businesses in the town as well as the local football club, Real Bedford FC — often dubbed the “Bitcoin soccer team” and backed by investment from Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

He said he has surveyed Bedford residents about the crime problem and has invited the local community to attend a meeting to help rally further support.

How these private security guards would operate in public and the extent of their authority is unclear, as vigilantism is illegal in the UK, according to JD Spicer Zeb Solicitors. 

However, they might instead serve more as informants to the police by providing video footage, much like the increasing number of traffic vigilantes around the country.

Although the idea of privately funded security for the town might sound unusual, some experts say it is becoming increasingly common. 

Lieutenant Eric J. Altorfer of the San Francisco Police Department said in May that police staffing shortages have increasingly led communities to turn to private security firms to fill gaps.

“Private security is already playing a crucial role in public safety by filling in where our department lacks resources,” Altorfer said.

However, he emphasized that such partnerships only succeed when cooperation between private firms and public law enforcement exists. 

“The challenge now is formalizing that relationship in a way that maintains accountability and effectiveness,” he said.

Cointelegraph reached out to Peter McCormack for comment, but did not receive a response by time of publication.

Washington — President Trump signed a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing the "exciting new frontier" for the technology one day after the bill passed the House.

The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, is the first major law governing digital currency, and establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.

"We worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS Act. They named it after me," the president joked in the East Room of the White House. "I want to thank you. This is a hell of an act." 

Members of Congress and top executives from Robinhood, Tether, Gemini and other crypto and financial firms were in attendance for the signing ceremony.

The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill.

"The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' 'Sir, you have my vote.' Boom. 'Sir, you have my vote.' I really just, they just want a little love," he said. "Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people." 

David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president "stepped in and saved this bill." Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through. 

The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) establishes guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins. The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins. 

With the GENIUS Act signed into law, banks, nonbanks and credit unions can dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins. 

Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor, said stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments "nearly instantaneously," rather than taking weeks. 

"Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins," Mr. Trump said. "This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that."

The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed "one-for-one" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, "strengthening the dollar" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a "21st-century upgrade." 

Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed "Crypto Week" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. The legislation is seen by the Trump administration and the crypto community as a way of bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.

"Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out," the president said. "You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation."

The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year. 

The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.

The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week. 

Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.

"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED….BUT NO MORE," Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. "THIS IS BIG!!!"

Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act took place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence. 

"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval," the president wrote on Truth Social. "This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!"

Bondi said the Justice Department is "ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts." A judge will make the final call on whether the material can be made public, and the process could take weeks or months.

"The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' 'Sir, you have my vote.' Boom. 'Sir, you have my vote.' I really just, they just want a little love," he said. "Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people." 

David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president "stepped in and saved this bill." Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through. 

The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) establishes guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins. The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins. 

With the GENIUS Act signed into law, banks, nonbanks and credit unions can dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins. 

Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor, said stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments "nearly instantaneously," rather than taking weeks. 

"Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins," Mr. Trump said. "This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that."

The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed "one-for-one" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, "strengthening the dollar" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a "21st-century upgrade." 

Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed "Crypto Week" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. The legislation is seen by the Trump administration and the crypto community as a way of bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.

"Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out," the president said. "You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation."

The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year. 

The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.

The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week. 

Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.

"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED….BUT NO MORE," Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. "THIS IS BIG!!!"

Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act took place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence. 

"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval," the president wrote on Truth Social. "This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!"

Bondi said the Justice Department is "ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts." A judge will make the final call on whether the material can be made public, and the process could take weeks or months.

In the minutes after President Donald Trump signed a bill that joins the crypto world's stablecoins to the U.S. financial system, two of the chief stablecoin architects made the case in the Washington summer heat outside the White House that their companies are ready to embrace the new law.



Before he'd signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law after it swept through both chambers of Congress with major bipartisan votes, Trump basked in cheers and thanked several industry leaders in the East Room audience, including Tether CEO Paulo Ardoino, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Outside, the executives talked about next steps.



Ardoino amplified his plans for moving some of his global business into the U.S., where he said the focus will be on institutional users for a new token, but he added that he also intends to have Tether's stablecoin powerhouse USDT comply with the GENIUS Act as a foreign issuer. That'll mean a new auditing regime and changes to the vast reserves the company already maintains, which he says will require "an adjustment" but noted — with a smile — that his company "made $13 billion in profits" last year and will be able to manage it.



"Tether will comply with the GENIUS Act," he said, adding that the company will get to work now meeting the foreign-issuer standards. He said Tether has three years to work on getting into the U.S., and the company intends to manage two different versions of its stablecoins domestically — a jurisdiction it currently steers clear of.



The U.S.-centric coin — a second flavor of Tether that hasn't yet been hatched — is envisioned as serving a very different purpose.



"Institutions are used to super efficient markets, and they will count the single basis point; and so, for that reason, we need to build something that is proper for this new market," he told CoinDesk in the interview. The product built for those institutions will "focus on payments and high, high, high efficiency."





For Circle — a public company based in the U.S. — CEO Allaire said that the GENIUS Act "really enshrines into law Circle's way of doing business."

"We have always been trusted, transparent; we've been publicly audited for five years," he said.



But he noted that the U.S. landscape for stablecoins has already been rapidly changing in anticipation of the new law, with "major technology companies, major commerce firms, financial institutions" lining up to participate, which he said he welcomes.



"Once you have that federal law, it really is a green light to all these types of institutions to know that they can depend on this technology, build on this technology, integrated into how they store and move money into other innovations that can be done with smart contracts and programabilities," Allaire said.



To do business in the U.S., the GENIUS Act demands that extremely limited, highly liquid assets — mostly U.S. Treasuries — will back issuers' coins dollar-for-dollar, and it requires a stringent auditing process to constantly ensure that the assets are there.



Tether's Ardoino said his company's new chief financial officer, Simon McWilliams, "started to work" to land a "Big Four" audit firm — one of the global leaders in financial auditing — which has only been a possibility because of the recent support from the Trump administration. His company has a special relationship with the administration, too, in which the former CEO of Tether's chief U.S. reserves manager, Cantor Fitzgerald, is Trump's secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick.



Ardoino's appearance at the White House and direct thanks from the president is a sharp reversal of Tether's U.S. history, in which it settled investigations with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and New York Department of Financial Services. But past reports that the company remained under further U.S. investigation never developed into actions against the company or its officers.



Trump boasted repeatedly on Friday that he dug the crypto industry out of legal trouble with his predecessor's administration.





A company that's developed into a lobbying and political giant in Washington in a short period, Coinbase, was represented in Trump's front row at the White House event, and CEO Brian Armstrong called the new law the "beginning of a big financial revolution in the U.S."



Armstrong has spent a lot of time and effort, though, on the next major legislation pursued by the industry: a bill that sets regulations for crypto markets in the U.S.



"One down; one to go," he said. "We've got to get the market structure bill through, as well. Seven percent of crypto market cap is stabecoins, so that's a very important first step. The other 93% is going to be addressed by that market structure bill."



In the minutes before passing the GENIUS Act, the House of Representatives also voted 294-134 to send its market structure legislation known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act to the Senate with a resounding bipartisan result.



Armstrong's company has been one of the primary backers of political action committee Fairshake, a towering super PAC that's spent incredible amounts of money congressional races, supporting candidates who commit to pro-crypto legislation. After success in dozens of races last year, Coinbase's largesse continued with another recent $25 million addition that brought Fairshake's war chest to $141 million well before the genuine start of next year's races.



"We feel like it's important to stand up for our customers' rights, and the job's not done yet," he said. Even after the market structure bill, he said, "I'm sure there'll be other things that come up in the future."



Armstrong said that Trump's chief crypto adviser, David Sacks, has assured the industry that he's serious about a recently discussed deadline for the next congressional effort: September 30.



For his part, President Trump talked about the GENIUS Act as if he'd already accomplished the monumental task of lifting U.S. crypto into place to modernize the financial system.



"Under this bill, the entire ancient system will be eligible for a 21st Century upgrade, using the state-of-the-art crypto technology," the president said before sitting at a table to sign the bill, mobbed by Republican lawmakers and crypto executives.



"Tomorrow is a new day, a new era," Ardoino said after the event. "We are very proud to be here and to be called out directly from the president, because it is the testament of all the good work that our team has done for the last years."

Congressman Byron Donalds votes to establish a digital asset framework and prevent Central Bank Digital Currency in the U.S.

U.S. Congressman Byron Donalds announced his support for a financial services package aimed at blocking the establishment of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the U.S. and creating a framework for digital assets. He stated, "This is wrong, this is a dangerous threat to freedom," emphasizing the need for regulatory clarity.

The legislative package includes three key bills: the CLARITY Act, the GENIUS Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act. Each aims to enhance consumer protection and regulate the digital asset market more effectively.

Following the vote, which saw bipartisan support, Donalds echoed concerns regarding CBDCs, stating they could enable "unelected bureaucrats" to control citizens' finances. He expressed pride in advancing measures to protect financial privacy and innovation.

From low-carb ice cream to keto protein bars to "sugar-free" soda, the decades-old sweetener erythritol is everywhere.

But new University of Colorado Boulder research shows the popular sugar substitute and specialty food additive comes with serious downsides, impacting brain cells in numerous ways that can boost risk of stroke.

The study was published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.

"Our study adds to the evidence suggesting that non-nutritive sweeteners that have generally been purported to be safe, may not come without negative health consequences," said senior author Christopher DeSouza, professor of integrative physiology and director of the Integrative Vascular Biology Lab.

First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001, erythritol is a sugar alcohol, often produced by fermenting corn and found in hundreds of products. It has almost no calories, is about 80% as sweet as table sugar, and has negligible impact on insulin levels, making it a favorite for people trying to lose weight, keep their blood sugar in check or avoid carbohydrates.

But recent research has begun to shed light on its risks.

One recent study involving 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe found that men and women with higher circulating levels of erythritol were significantly more likely to have a heart attack or stroke within the next three years.

DeSouza and first author Auburn Berry, a graduate student in his lab, set out to understand what might be driving that increased risk.

Researchers in the lab treated human cells that line blood vessels in the brain for three hours with about the same amount of erythritol contained in a typical sugar-free beverage.

They observed that the treated cells were altered in numerous ways: They expressed significantly less nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and widens blood vessels, and more endothelin-1, a protein that constricts blood vessels. Meanwhile, when challenged with a clot-forming compound called thrombin, cellular production of the natural clot-busting compound t-PA was "markedly blunted." The erythritol-treated cells also produced more reactive oxygen species (ROS), a.k.a. "free radicals," metabolic byproducts which can age and damage cells and inflame tissue.

"Big picture, if your vessels are more constricted and your ability to break down blood clots is lowered, your risk of stroke goes up," said Berry. "Our research demonstrates not only that, but how erythritol has the potential to increase stroke risk."

DeSouza notes that their study used only a serving-size worth of the sugar substitute. For those who consume multiple servings per day, the impact, presumably, could be worse.

The authors caution that their study was a laboratory study, conducted on cells, and larger studies in people are needed.

That said, De Souza encourages consumers to read labels, looking for erythritol or "sugar alcohol" on the label.

"Given the epidemiological study that inspired our work, and now our cellular findings, we believe it would be prudent for people to monitor their consumption of non-nutrient-sweeteners such as this one," he said.

E. coli outbreaks in romaine lettuce have long been a public health concern. and now a new Cornell University paper suggests that a combination of efforts in the field, and even postharvest techniques, can minimize risk to human health.

Co-authored by Renata Ivanek, a professor in the department of population medicine and diagnostic sciences, and Martin Wiedmann, professor in food safety, the paper outlines interventions likely to make a concrete difference in the safety of the nation's romaine.

"This study supports that interventions should focus on reducing produce contamination via contaminated irrigation water, on assuring that produce washes applied during processing consistently deliver reasonably high reductions of bacterial numbers, and on improving temperature control during distribution," Wiedmann said.

"We tried to describe the system as holistically as possible to account for different risk factors and how they could have interactions," Ivanek said. "There's not just one intervention that will save us all. We spent a lot of time trying to understand the preharvest component, especially the irrigation water piece and how much risk can be explained by that."

Study results suggested that much contamination originates from irrigation with untreated surface water applied through overhead spray irrigation systems. They found that risk from irrigation was reduced either through water treatments or by switching to furrow or drip irrigation.

"While not the most common system, spray irrigation is used in a number of fields for its benefits during germination, its cooling effect on plants and other reasons. But drip or furrow irrigation reduces the probability that water directly touches the leaves," Ivanek said, acknowledging that switching to these other irrigation systems introduces significant potential additional costs to grower.

Ivanek and her co-authors also explored the importance of maintaining proper cold storage temperatures along the entire supply chain to romaine's final destination.

"Time and temperature play a role in food safety, and also in food quality and shelf life," she said, describing a "perfect storm" if contamination happens at the farm or processing level and then improper transportation temperatures allow bacteria to grow.

The comprehensive practices and interventions explored in this study intend to aid decision-makers in establishing and enhancing food safety best management practices, Ivanek said.

"The big message is the American food supply chain is extremely safe compared to other countries," she said. "We're exploring how can we make it even safer and where we should put additional effort."

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Although only one species of hominin (a tribe of the subfamily Homininae) exists on the planet today—good ole Homo sapiens—the human family, throughout more geologically-recent Earth history, was comprised of a complex tableaux of members. And over the years, scientists have tried to get a clearer picture of that prehistoric story by excavating ancient human sites around the world. 

Now, anthropologists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Hawai'i are illustrating a previously unknown—or, rather, uncategorized—chapter of that story with the introduction of a new human species, H. juluensis. The researchers published the details of this new species in the journals Nature Communications and PaleoAnthropology.

H. juluensis—the name for which means “big head”—thrived in eastern Asia from 300,000 years ago to around 50,000 years ago, when the species died out. According to the researchers, this group likely hunted wild horses, fashioned stoned tools, and even processed animal hides to survive frigid winters. University of Hawai'i's Christopher J. Bae said the breakthrough for discovering this possibly new species came when he and his team were devising a new system for organizing fossil evidence. 

“Although we started this project several years ago, we did not expect being able to propose a new hominin (human ancestor) species and then to be able to organize the hominin fossils from Asia into different groups,” Bae said in a press statement. “This study clarifies a hominin fossil record that has tended to include anything that cannot easily be assigned to Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis or Homo sapiens.”

One possible member of the new species H. juluensis isn't a newcomer to science by any stretch. Denisovans—first identified in 2010 via DNA extracted from a young girl's fingerbone found in Siberia—have never been given a species classification, but Bae believes that they could belong to this new species. 

H. juluensis also potentially solves another mystery of the Xujiayao hominin fossils, which have long perplexed researchers, as the remains display a mix of H. erectus and H. sapiens  features. According to a study by the scientists in the journal PaleoAnthropology, these remains have been confused for a variety of taxonomic representations, but note that differences in the cranium (spoiler: it's big), the teeth and jaws, and a few other features denote a new species represented in fossil remains including Penghu 1 (jawbone), Xiahe (mandible), Xuchang (partial crania), and a variety of Denisova fossils. 

Although this is a convincing argument that these particular specimens belong to a previously unknown human species, more research will be needed before anthropologists bust out the “Welcome to the Family” banners. But because these fossils still defy species classification, it's likely only a matter of time before the hominin tribe increases by one (or more).

Przemysław “Psyho” Dębiak, a 42-year-old programmer from Gdynia, Poland, made history by defeating OpenAI's custom AI model at the AtCoder World Tour Finals (AWTF) 2025 "Humans vs AI" contest in Tokyo. Considered one of the most prestigious coding tournaments in the world, the AWTF invites just 12 of the top-ranked human programmers—and, for the first time, an AI competitor—to tackle its grueling challenges. After a 10-hour coding marathon, Dębiak edged out the AI by roughly 9.5%, clinching first place while the OpenAI-built model settled for second.

“Humanity has prevailed (for now)!” Dębiak wrote on X, confessing he'd slept only around 10 hours over three days while pushing himself to the limit. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman aptly responded with, “Good job, Psyho.” The AI model, branded OpenAIAHC, was widely expected to dominate the market. Still, Dębiak's innovative, heuristic-driven approach—using problem-solving shortcuts and educated guesses instead of brute-force calculation—secured the win. Contest administrator Yoichi Iwata praised his distinctive method, noting that while the AI excelled at raw optimization, it “fell short of human creativity.”

Humanity has prevailed (for now!)I'm completely exhausted. I figured, I had 10h of sleep in the last 3 days and I'm barely alive.I'll post more about the contest when I get some rest. (To be clear, those are provisional results, but my lead should be big enough) pic.twitter.com/fIMo0ifNCdJuly 16, 2025

The AtCoder World Tour Finals (AWTF) is regarded as the ultimate stage for heuristic programming contests that focus on “good-enough” solutions to complex, unsolvable problems rather than perfect ones. This year's challenge tasked competitors with plotting a robot's path across a 30×30 grid using the fewest possible moves, an NP-hard optimization problem with countless possible outcomes. With no access to external libraries or documentation, success relied on intuition, creativity, and adaptability—qualities where human ingenuity can still outthink the raw speed and precision of AI models.

Dębiak, a former OpenAI engineer who helped develop OpenAI Five (the Dota 2 AI), competed using only Visual Studio Code with basic autocomplete and admitted the AI pushed him to his limits: “I was close to the model's score, and that pushed me to give everything.” Near the end of the 10-hour marathon, he overtook OpenAIAHC to claim victory and a 500,000 yen prize. A veteran algorithmic competitor, Mensa member, and four-time TopCoder Open Marathon champion, Dębiak has never held a full-time job and once even joked about considering careers from DJing to professional poker. His win carries symbolic weight, a human triumphing over AI in a field where machines typically excel.

Update: I'm alive and wellThe results are official now and my lead over AI increased from 5.5% to 9.5%😎Honestly, the hype feels kind of bizarre. Never expected so many people would be interested in programming contests. Guess this means I should drop in here more often👀 pic.twitter.com/RsLD8lECNqJuly 17, 2025

All that being said, AI's steady progress is undeniable—Stanford's 2025 AI Index found coding benchmarks jumped from 4.4% AI success in 2023 to 71.7% in 2024. With tools like GitHub Copilot used daily by over 90% of developers, AI is reshaping workflows. However, this win highlights that creativity, endurance, and intuition —especially in long-form heuristic challenges —remain human strengths.

Dębiak isn't naive about the challenge ahead, saying, “It's easy to imagine a different problem where AI would win and humans would be far behind.”. Still, this feels like a human John Henry moment—a testament not just to sheer human will, but to the spark of creativity machines haven't replicated and (hopefully) will never be able to.

Days after AI coding startup Windsurf announced that it's being acquired by Cognition, Windsurf startup Jeff Wang took to X to offer more details about the drama and uncertainty around the deal.

Windsurf was previously reported to be in acquisition talks with OpenAI, but that deal fell apart, with Google DeepMind instead hiring the startup's CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and some of its top researchers. Google would reportedly license Windsurf's technology as part of the $2.4 billion deal — but not take an equity stake in the company.

This looked like the latest in the trend of “reverse acquihires,” in which large tech companies seek to avoid antitrust scrutiny by hiring key startup team members and licensing their technology, rather than acquiring startups outright.

But what happens to the startups and the employees who get left behind? As we discussed on the latest episode of Equity, one startup founder compared the departing Windsurf executives to a captain abandoning his crew aboard a sinking ship. 

Wang, who had been Windsurf's head of business, became the company's interim CEO after Mohan's departure. In his post on X, he offered some sympathy to Mohan and Chen, who he described as “ great founders” in a situation that “must have been difficult for them as well.” 

Still, Wang recounted an all-hands meeting on Friday, June 11, where most team members were expecting to hear about the OpenAI acquisition. Instead, he had to share the news about the Google deal and resulting departures.

“The mood was very bleak,” Wang said. “Some people were upset about financial outcomes or colleagues leaving, while others were worried about the future. A few were in tears, and the Q&A had been understandably hostile.”

In Wang's view, although the company “had lost some great people and taken a serious blow to morale,” it still had “all of our IP, product, and strong talent including an excellent [go-to-market] machine.” So Windsurf could still try to raise more money, sell, or just keep going.

That evening, however, Wang heard from Cognition executives Scott Wu and Russell Kaplan, and he said Windsurf leadership “took the Cognition approach very seriously from the start and launched right into negotiations.” In his telling, what followed was a frantic weekend of discussions with Cognition, while considering inbound interest from other potential acquirers and meeting with Windsurf's remaining engineers to convince them not to leave. (And as all that was happening, “the timeline was exploding with memes and commentary.”)

The two companies were a good fit, Wang argued, in part because of complementary teams.

“While they had overinvested in engineering, they had frankly underinvested in GTM and Marketing, and our teams in those functions are nothing short of world class,” he said. “On the other hand, we now were missing a Core Engineering team, and there's no better group of AI engineers than the lineup Cognition has assembled.”

Plus, Wang said he and Wu (pictured together above) were aligned on the need to “take care of all Windsurf employees.”

“That resulted in a key part of the deal: structuring it to give a payout to every employee, to waive all cliffs, and to accelerate all vesting for Windsurf equity,” he said.

The acquisition agreement was apparently signed at 9:30am on Monday morning, announced to the team shortly afterwards at another all-hands, then announced to the public shortly after that.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Wang described that Friday all-hands as “probably the worst day of 250 people's lives,” followed Monday by “probably the best day.”

It wants to bury poop deep underground to counter all the pollution that its data centers generate.

Microsoft has just signed a deal with Vaulted Deep, paying it to remove 4.9 million metric tons of waste over 12 years sourced from manure, sewage, and agricultural byproducts for injection deep underground. According to Inc., the current cost of CO2 removal with the company is $350 per ton. If you multiply that by Microsoft's contract, that makes it worth more than $1.7 billion. However, neither entity has disclosed the actual terms of the deal, and its CEO, Julia Reichelstein, says that the company expects its costs to drop over time, and that the mentioned price isn't the actual sum that the tech giant paid.

This isn't the first time Redmond has paid another company to help offset its greenhouse gas emissions; Microsoft signed a deal with AtmosClear in April of this year to sequester 6.75 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. However, Vaulted's technique is unique — instead of extracting carbon dioxide from the air or electricity production, it collects organic waste. It combines it into a thick slurry, which is then injected about 5,000 feet underground. This prevents them from being dumped at a waste disposal site, where they would eventually decompose and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

“Generally, what happens to these wastes today is they go to a landfill, they get dumped in a waterway, or they're just spread on land for the purpose of disposal. In all of those cases, they're decomposing into CO2 and methane,” said Reichelstein to Inc. “That's contributing to climate change. And then oftentimes, especially when it's spread on land, all those pathogens are going directly into people's groundwater.”

Projects such as these enable Microsoft and other tech giants to offset the massive amounts of carbon emissions produced by data centers, particularly as they consume a significant amount of electrical power, often generated from fossil fuels. For example, Musk is facing legal action in Memphis, Tennessee, after his company, xAI, is accused of polluting the air by using under-reported power generators at the Colossus Supercomputer. Aside from that, many companies, including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, and others, are investing in small modular reactor research to establish their clean energy sources for their expanding data center businesses.

Przemysław “Psyho” Dębiak, a 42-year-old programmer from Gdynia, Poland, made history by defeating OpenAI's custom AI model at the AtCoder World Tour Finals (AWTF) 2025 "Humans vs AI" contest in Tokyo. Considered one of the most prestigious coding tournaments in the world, the AWTF invites just 12 of the top-ranked human programmers—and, for the first time, an AI competitor—to tackle its grueling challenges. After a 10-hour coding marathon, Dębiak edged out the AI by roughly 9.5%, clinching first place while the OpenAI-built model settled for second.

“Humanity has prevailed (for now)!” Dębiak wrote on X, confessing he'd slept only around 10 hours over three days while pushing himself to the limit. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman aptly responded with, “Good job, Psyho.” The AI model, branded OpenAIAHC, was widely expected to dominate the market. Still, Dębiak's innovative, heuristic-driven approach—using problem-solving shortcuts and educated guesses instead of brute-force calculation—secured the win. Contest administrator Yoichi Iwata praised his distinctive method, noting that while the AI excelled at raw optimization, it “fell short of human creativity.”

Humanity has prevailed (for now!)I'm completely exhausted. I figured, I had 10h of sleep in the last 3 days and I'm barely alive.I'll post more about the contest when I get some rest. (To be clear, those are provisional results, but my lead should be big enough) pic.twitter.com/fIMo0ifNCdJuly 16, 2025

The AtCoder World Tour Finals (AWTF) is regarded as the ultimate stage for heuristic programming contests that focus on “good-enough” solutions to complex, unsolvable problems rather than perfect ones. This year's challenge tasked competitors with plotting a robot's path across a 30×30 grid using the fewest possible moves, an NP-hard optimization problem with countless possible outcomes. With no access to external libraries or documentation, success relied on intuition, creativity, and adaptability—qualities where human ingenuity can still outthink the raw speed and precision of AI models.

Dębiak, a former OpenAI engineer who helped develop OpenAI Five (the Dota 2 AI), competed using only Visual Studio Code with basic autocomplete and admitted the AI pushed him to his limits: “I was close to the model's score, and that pushed me to give everything.” Near the end of the 10-hour marathon, he overtook OpenAIAHC to claim victory and a 500,000 yen prize. A veteran algorithmic competitor, Mensa member, and four-time TopCoder Open Marathon champion, Dębiak has never held a full-time job and once even joked about considering careers from DJing to professional poker. His win carries symbolic weight, a human triumphing over AI in a field where machines typically excel.

Update: I'm alive and wellThe results are official now and my lead over AI increased from 5.5% to 9.5%😎Honestly, the hype feels kind of bizarre. Never expected so many people would be interested in programming contests. Guess this means I should drop in here more often👀 pic.twitter.com/RsLD8lECNqJuly 17, 2025

All that being said, AI's steady progress is undeniable—Stanford's 2025 AI Index found coding benchmarks jumped from 4.4% AI success in 2023 to 71.7% in 2024. With tools like GitHub Copilot used daily by over 90% of developers, AI is reshaping workflows. However, this win highlights that creativity, endurance, and intuition —especially in long-form heuristic challenges —remain human strengths.

Dębiak isn't naive about the challenge ahead, saying, “It's easy to imagine a different problem where AI would win and humans would be far behind.”. Still, this feels like a human John Henry moment—a testament not just to sheer human will, but to the spark of creativity machines haven't replicated and (hopefully) will never be able to.

Most founders eventually have to pitch venture firms in hopes of raising capital. Tiffany Luck, a partner at NEA, took the stage at TechCrunch's All Stage event in Boston to answer how to craft the perfect one.

“I like to think of a VC pitch as your initial way for assessing founder-investor fit,” she told the crowd before diving into her presentation. One of the most important slides to have in a pitch is “The What,” she said, meaning, “‘The What' are you building.” That's followed by “The Why” you are the right person for the job and why you have a unique solution. But there's another Why, too: “‘Why' is now the perfect time to do it.”

Then there is “The Who,” she continued, “Who have you recruited to do this crazy thing with?” And finally, “The How.” 

“How are you going to get there? How are you getting there today? How will you get there over time?” she said. 

Then, of course, “some sense of numbers,” she added, saying that part depends on what state a company is trying to fundraise for — pre-seed, seed, Series A, and so forth.  “These are just meant to be the fundamental basics.” 

As Luck explained, “The What” sets the stage, telling the investor what the problem is, how it affects people, followed by what solutions exist today and where lies room for disruption. 

Showcasing a product demo during “The What” is a good idea, she said, and that a lot of investors love product demos. “If you think a picture is worth 100 words, I think a demo is worth 1,000 hours,” she said. “When you see the product, you actually get it quickly.” 

Luck said there are two different “Whys” every founder should address. First, there is the deeper Why, where a founder goes into their origin story and explains their unique perspective on a solution. 

Obsession is key here, she said, adding that investors want to see and understand that a founder is completely consumed by a problem and solution. This this passion is what will keep everyone motivated to keep building, she said.

Following this is the “Why now,” which means going into the market dynamics and readiness. 

“It's telling the story of why the market is ready for what you have or what you're building,” she said. 

The Why now leads into “The Who,” where the founder is expected to talk about the team they've assembled, how everyone's skills complement each other, and why everyone is obsessed with the mission of the product. 

“The shared conviction piece is really important,” Luck said. “It's ‘how are you all envisioning the future together?'” 

“The How,” is where a founder is supposed to talk about “milestones.” 

Here, she said, investors want to know what the minimum viable product (MVP) is? Who are the early users ? And what feedback the product is getting from them so far? 

“And again, explain where you are today. Where are you going? What have you learned?” she asked, listing off the questions. 

Talking about pivoting, if necessary, is also good here. 

Luck noted that she often talks to founders who pivoted early or at some point in their journey. It helps investors learn more about the early phases of a company, of “where not to go, what not to do, and it will help with the rest of the journey,” she said.

Finally, she weighed in on the importance of numbers. 

“Investors do love numbers,” she said. “I think a lot of the important numbers also involve storytelling.” Here, investors want to know about the market size and any traction a product might have. “Why do customers love this product? Why do you imagine that it's not only going to grow, but grow sustainably in a way that has great retention?” 

She likes to see a company talk about how much cash it's burning through, and what the runway looks like. The most important thing, though, is the ask: how much a founder is looking to raise this round and what they will do with the money. 

All together, the Who, What, How, and (two) Whys serve as a starting point, helping founders as they go forth on the entrepreneurship journey. 

“Founding a company is like extreme sports,” she said, likening it to climbing Everest in particular. “You're going up on milestones, different camps. You're encountering challenges, you're weathering storms, and you know, eventually you're trying to make it to the top, to the summit.”

Less than two years after its hyped-up debut, Tesla is making an aggressive, almost desperate, move to salvage the Cybertruck, a vehicle widely seen as one of the biggest busts in recent automotive history.

Faced with production woes, quality control nightmares, and underwhelming sales, the company has added its polarizing truck to a massive sales event, offering a powerful incentive it has historically reserved for its most loyal customers: a free transfer of its $12,000 Full Self-Driving (FSD) software.

It's a stunning concession and a clear signal that the company is willing to sacrifice a significant revenue stream to get the angular, stainless-steel behemoths off of lots and onto the road.

The offer, quietly added to Tesla's “Current Offers” page, allows existing Tesla owners who have already purchased FSD to transfer that capability to a new Cybertruck, free of charge. For years, FSD was locked to the vehicle, not the owner. Making it transferable has been the single most requested feature from Tesla's loyal fanbase, and until now, the company had only offered it for its high-volume Model 3, Y, S, and X vehicles during brief promotional periods.

Adding the Cybertruck to that list is a strategic gamble. On one hand, it's a powerful lure for the thousands of dedicated Tesla owners who might be on the fence about the unconventional truck. On the other, it's an admission that the Cybertruck cannot sell on its own merits.

Tesla's Cybertruck Is a Bust

The move comes amid a broader sales blitz as Tesla braces for the September 30 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. The company is offering deep inventory discounts and 10,000 free Supercharging miles across its lineup. But the Cybertruck's inclusion in the FSD transfer promotion is unique, targeting the only group of people who might still be interested: the Tesla faithful.

Since its launch, the Cybertruck has been plagued by problems. Early models were criticized for inconsistent panel gaps, susceptibility to rust spots, and a host of software glitches. More importantly, its radical design and high price point have failed to attract mainstream truck buyers, who continue to flock to established models like the Chevrolet's Silverado EV, which leans into a more conventional design.

While Tesla does not release specific sales figures for the Cybertruck, industry analysts and registration data suggest that deliveries have fallen far short of initial projections. The truck is a rare sight on American roads, a far cry from the ubiquitous presence of the Model Y or Model 3. In the second quarter of 2025, Tesla sold just 4,306 Cybertrucks, down a staggering 50.8% from the 8,755 units it delivered during the same period last year, according to new data from Kelley Blue Book.

By offering the FSD transfer, Tesla is essentially subsidizing the Cybertruck with its most profitable product. It's a short-term solution to a long-term problem: how do you sell a vehicle that the market seems to have rejected? For now, the answer appears to be leaning on the loyalty of existing customers and giving away the family jewels to close the deal. Whether it's enough to turn the tide for the beleaguered truck remains to be seen.

As the auto industry races toward autonomy, most companies are rolling out driver-assist features with one hand while handing out waivers, disclaimers, and legal fine print with the other. Not BYD.

The Chinese EV giant just made an unprecedented move: it's offering a public, financial guarantee for its autonomous parking system. If the system malfunctions, even due to an algorithmic failure, BYD will cover all resulting damages, including repair costs, third-party property damage, and compensation for personal injury.

“We are first in the world to propose a guarantee for autonomous parking,” the company said in a statement posted on social media Weibo. “Our move reflects absolute confidence in God's Eye ADAS.”

It's a bold promise that could set a new global benchmark for how automakers take—or avoid—responsibility for their autonomous technology.

While Tesla Warns, BYD Backs It Up

The announcement draws a sharp contrast with Tesla, whose Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is still marketed as a beta feature. Despite its name, FSD requires full driver supervision, and Tesla repeatedly reminds users that they, not the company, are legally responsible for anything that happens on the road.

BYD's stance flips that logic on its head. It's not just promising a smarter system; it's promising corporate accountability, a component that has been largely missing from the discussion around consumer-grade autonomy.

This guarantee is being delivered via a simple over-the-air (OTA) software update, not as part of a flashy concept car. With the upcoming God's Eye B update, BYD will enhance scene recognition, active safety, and precision parking in all conditions, including new functions like three-speed parking, U-turn assistance, and bypass maneuvers.

The First Real Liability Shift?

BYD wants to establish legal and financial trust. For years, regulators and safety advocates have warned that carmakers were deploying autonomous features too quickly without clearly defining who is to blame when something goes wrong. BYD's pledge may be the first real-world test of shifting liability from the user back to the manufacturer.

The move could have significant ripple effects. If one company is willing to put its money on the line for Level 4-style autonomous parking, will competitors be pressured to match that promise or risk being seen as reckless?

China First, But Not for Long?

For now, BYD's guarantee is limited to China. But the company's growing international presence, including its aggressive push into Europe and Latin America, raises a critical question: will BYD bring this liability pledge to Western markets?

If it does, it could force U.S. and European regulators to reexamine how they treat self-driving technology. It would also put immense pressure on companies like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, and GM to offer similar guarantees or risk appearing evasive to consumers.

After all, if a Chinese automaker can afford to own the risk of its AI, what's stopping Silicon Valley's richest car company?

The Bottom Line

BYD is attempting to rewrite the rules of who owns the consequences when AI is driving the car. In a world where most automakers treat autonomy as a “use at your own risk” feature, BYD's move is both rare and radical. They're not just betting on their technology; they're betting on earning your trust.

And unlike Tesla, they aren't asking you to sign a waiver. They're asking you to believe them, with their wallet.

Nintendo did a poor job of disposing of its old SD cards.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A console hacker named WinCurious obtained some discarded SD cards from a Nintendo factory that the company used for the factory setup process of Wii and Wii U systems. According to DeadlyFoez, the cards contained a boot image that Nintendo used for the factory setup of the Wii U console. They were able to recover data on some of the damaged SD cards, after which another member of their team discovered an exploit that could be used to restore software-bricked Wii U consoles.

The first challenge they faced was that all the cards were damaged, with approximately 25% of them having a destroyed die and flash memory IC. However, the remaining 75% only had PCB damage — some of them required resoldering work or PCB replacement, while others needed only straightening before they could be read. After the repairs were completed, the next step was to read the contents of the SD cards.

Unfortunately, it's not as simple as plugging the SD cards into a reader and then copying and pasting them to another drive on your Windows PC. One solution to this was to use an external programmer to read the NAND flash memory directly, but this wasn't viable because DeadlyFoez did not have one that was compatible with the TSOP 48 chips used on the Nintendo SD cards. The dumped data would not represent what was actually on the card because it didn't go through its controller chip.

Thankfully, WinCurious had an idea — they suggested using a donor SD card and replacing its NAND chip with a TSOP 48 clip. They would then remove the NAND chips from the SD cards that they wanted to read (but had damaged or defective PCBs) and place them on a working SD card. This workaround enabled the group to access the data on the discarded memory cards, albeit with difficulty.

“I can not express how incredibly difficult it is to solder these TSOP 48 clips onto anything at all. They melt at a rather lower temperature. If the solder is melted, then the plastic of these will be soft and malleable. In most cases, the solder pads of the PCB are the same size as the pins of the clip, making it impossibly difficult to see even with magnification,” says DeadlyFoez. “To solder these on you must tin the pads of the PCB first, then place the TSOP 48 clip directly on top of the peaks of the tinned pads. Finally, you must reflow the solder. The right way to do it would be with a reflow oven and using solder paste with a stencil, but I do not have those. I do have my infrared preheater, which works well enough for these things.”

Nevertheless, the system was successful, enabling them to recover 14 SD cards. From here, another member of the group, Rairii, snooped around the dumped data and discovered an SDBoot1 image. This vulnerability was initially discovered during the Wii U's factory setup, allowing the group to run their code when the console boots. They then wrote an exploit to take advantage of this, called “paid the beak”, and uploaded it on GitHub.

Since SDBoot1 runs even on consoles with empty flash memory, it can recover almost any Wii U that has suffered from a software brick. The only devices it cannot save are those that have experienced issues with Seeprom or have suffered actual hardware failure. Note that you'd still need a rare Nintendo jig, a Raspberry Pi Pico, or a PICAXE 08M2 microcontroller to trigger UNSTBL_PWR on your console for it to boot from the SD card.

Once you have them all, you can now put the card on your Wii U, use the jig or its alternative, and turn on your Wii U console. From there, it should load whatever you put on the SD card, allowing you to do anything you want on your old hardware. Another mod chip, called de_Fuse, can also perform a similar function and even recover Seeprom failures, but it requires more advanced skills and knowledge. This technique makes playing with the Wii U's hardware a little more accessible, allowing more people to experiment with it without having to disassemble their consoles and use specialized soldering skills.

Ken DiCross is building the infrastructure to connect blockchains, and he's doing it with AI. The founder of Wire Network, a blockchain interoperability company, DiCross says he uses AI for everything from pitching investors to stress-testing white papers. In this week's edition of How Do You Use AI?, he explains how it saves him hours every day, why he doesn't trust it blindly, and why decentralized AI could be the next big revolution. No TED Talk nonsense, just real life.

Episode 2: Ken DiCross—Crypto Believer.

Gizmodo: How do you use AI right now?

DiCross: I use AI for everything I possibly can; from helping with my schedule to categorizing and helping with email responses. I definitely use it for search. I can't tell you the last time I went to Google. I think that is just atrocious. I use it for business plans, for pitch decks. I use it to compare other interoperability or blockchain or AI companies.

Gizmodo: How does that work?

DiCross: I go to their website, grab their white paper, and download it into the LLM. Then I start asking a series of questions until I can find the issue. It's always centralization. Rather than solving it properly in a decentralized way, they just add a fix that creates some kind of risk—security, cost, or time. I create my list and send it off to my team or investors to show we still have a moat. That would take an enormous amount of time if I did it manually. AI helps me get it done in five minutes.

Gizmodo: What was the last thing AI helped you do?

DiCross: I created a contract. We're starting to bring on advisors, ambassadors, and consultants. I took all the requirements for what we want these people to do and asked the AI to categorize them—what belongs in each role—and generate a base contract. I still send it to legal, but it saves me an hour-long call or a lengthy email. I just feed it in real time and it gets me 80% there.

Gizmodo: Are there tasks you've completely handed over to AI?

DiCross: Yes, especially presentations. I don't create slides from scratch anymore. I just prompt it with the bullet points, and it fills out the rest. The LLM already knows Wire; we feed it everything. The output is fast and on point. It's the same for my devs. My top-tier engineers use it so efficiently that they're basically two or three people in one. We don't need junior-level devs anymore.

Gizmodo: Do you trust AI completely?

DiCross: No. It still hallucinates. I gave it a math problem the other day, and it botched it; something a six-year-old could do. I had to walk it through the right answer. So when people do “vibe coding” with AI, it can be dangerous. If you don't understand the code, you won't know if the AI's output is secure. You still need experts in the loop.

Gizmodo: Do you use it in your personal life?

DiCross: Definitely. I use it for search all the time. I don't use Yelp or Google anymore. If I'm traveling, I ask for the best restaurants nearby, their hours, anything. I pick up 5 or 10 minutes here and there and end up with a few extra hours in my day.

Gizmodo: Has AI ever surprised you?

DiCross: It's not the answers that surprise me. It's when it won't answer something. You hit a wall and don't always know why. It's frustrating. That's why we need decentralized AI: so people can get the information they need without worrying that it's being filtered or censored.

Gizmodo: What do you say to people who are scared AI knows too much?

DiCross: That's exactly why it has to be decentralized. I agree with them. Every time I use ChatGPT, I sigh. I know it's building a profile on me. You want your data encrypted and private. Right now, if you type in something like a medical concern, that data can be sold. Your insurance could go up in minutes. That's dystopian. We need decentralized, encrypted AI that works for us, not for Microsoft.

Gizmodo: Do you feel uneasy using it?

DiCross: Yes, because I know my data is getting hoovered up. But I also feel optimistic. Decentralized AI is coming. Just like Linux became the backbone of every server, we'll have open-source AI that anyone can use without fear. That's where the future is heading.

This isn't how we usually build PCs.

The Alienware Area-51 is a pre-built gaming PC, but we put together one on our own. Only this one isn't made of metal and components, but rather Lego bricks. The 318-piece model that we constructed is a set being doled out by Alienware to members of its Alienware Arena fan community, but we got to go hands on a kit to try. .Usually, this kit — which uses real Lego bricks but is not at all affiliated with Lego, multiple pieces of legalese remind me — goes for 9,999 Alienware Rewards Points. Those points are earned by fans by spending time on community forums and participating in the Discord, achieving login streaks, playing partner games on Steam, competing in giveaways, and more. (Buying Alienware products doesn't earn ARP). For the purposes of this so-called PC build, Alienware just shipped us one. Some people are already trying to sell them sealed on eBay for $400 to $500, though it's unclear if anyone has bitten at that price.

What I wanted to see was just how close to the original system this kit could get, and whether or not a Lego kit could capture the fun (and stress!) of building a PC.

The package sure looks like a Lego set, minus any branding. Inside, the instruction manual is also a pretty solid Lego knockoff, and there are 11 bags of pieces. There was also a card advertising BuildaMOC, which sells custom Lego kits and builds bespoke models for businesses.



I found out quickly that I would not be building each component, then installing it. Instead, the build started with building the bottom of the case, followed by the power supply shroud and its two fans. There's a QR code on the PSU shroud, just like on the actual Area-51, which has many QR codes with instructions on upgrading parts. Here, that QR code works, and takes you to the Alienware homepage. The back of the case also features the A51 inscription. I noticed that side of the case wasn't all uniformly gray. Some of the pieces were a bit off-color.

With the bottom of the case and the back wall built, you move on to the motherboard, which was easily my least favorite part of the build. I don't usually mind lots of detail work with tiny pieces, but this is where I found that the distribution of the parts in the bags sometimes didn't make a ton of sense, and I constantly switched between bags looking for the next tiny part. I would've been better off dumping it all on the floor.There are some fun novelties on the motherboard, my personal favorite is the choice of Wolverine claws to serve as the power cables to the board. Unfortunately, there's only one RAM stick. On the one hand, this is a Lego model. On the other hand, can't that Lego model let me fantasize about the most powerful rig possible? Single-channel RAM is a no-no on any serious gaming PC.

The GPU and cooler are also built onto the motherboard. No word if the graphics card is supposed to be an RTX 5090, but it's certainly cheaper. The cooler was my least favorite part, as it got knocked off several times when I was installing the next part, the case's see-through window, but eventually I got it all attached.

I feel like the case's window is a weak point. It consists of 12 small panels and two large panels. You can see into the case, but there are a lot of lines and connectors obstructing the view of the internals. This is where I think a real partnership with Lego might've helped: custom pieces probably would have been a better fit.

Next came the top of the case, which also includes the 360 mm radiator (good news:it has three fans). This also included customized pieces to show off the honeycomb venting and the ports on the top. This was followed by the front, including two fans and the RGB light ring, as well as the back, with a clear series of PCIe slots and the PSU.

Often, I've been left over with a few extra parts when building Lego sets. I was hoping to have an extra fan piece to put at the rear of the system. The Alienware Area-51 doesn't have a fan in the back, but I thought that, on a Lego set, I could add the rear exhaust, faithfulness to the original PC be damned. Oh well.

Finishing the build is the end of it. I couldn't boot the system up for benchmarking. I guess you could say that it was bricked out of the box.

The Area-51 is a behemoth of a desktop at 24.04 x 22.42 x 9.12 inches. The Lego set fits far more comfortably on my desk; it's 5.3 inches long, 2.2 inches wide, and 5 inches high.

The width and depth are both about 1:4.63 in scale, while the height gets a bit more lopped off at 1:4.38.

If you're looking for a good idea of the size, Apple's latest Mac Mini is 5 x 5 x 2 inches — almost the exact size as this model, but with a real computer in it.

I've often heard people describe PC building as "Legos for adults." I disagree. Lego is Lego for adults. But PC building and Lego building do share the same satisfying feeling of putting something together methodically and being able to admire your handiwork. (OK, fine, the PC is also a bit more useful in other ways).I'm not sure I see Alienware getting into the toy business. But I'd love to see Lego get into the PC business, making models of famous rigs. It wouldn't be far-fetched: the company already made the Atari 2600 and the Nintendo Entertainment System. It would be great to see an IBM PC Model 5150, a Bondi Blue 1998-era iMac, or even the Alienware Area-51 Predator 1 in its striking green chassis. Heck, even building a bunch of generic components and making a life-size PC would be a ton of fun for the right people. If Lego doesn't do it, maybe another one of these companies repurposing official bricks will.Whether you're enough of a die-hard Alienware fan to save up points to get this kit is up to you — I've never been a member of a fan club. I just wish there were more chances to build PCs in this fashion.

It's fun to see a PC recreated in this way, but the Area-51 is also still new. It's not iconic yet. It makes the brick kit more novelty than trophy, but if you're spending tons of time on Alienware's website and community forums, it's probably the type of thing you'll admire.

With Donkey Kong Bananza now making its case as the real launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2, I needed a controller that could keep up with Kong's crashing fists. When it came to a game that epitomized joy and catharsis in equal measure, Nintendo's own Pro device proved a leading contender as best all-around, but not for the reasons you may think.

I spent my own money on an $85 Switch 2 Pro controller. Accounting for tax, it was closer to $95, which is nearly one-fifth of the total price I paid for my Switch 2. It's currently one of the most expensive gamepads you can buy for the Nintendo's new handheld, which is partially why the device has caused its own controversy. The repair gurus at iFixit called it “a piss poor excuse” for a gamepad. They excoriated it not just for how it's basically impossible to take apart, but for its lack of Hall effect joysticks. Those kinds of sticks use a magnetic field to reduce the risk of stick drift. The Pro 2 still uses potentiometer joysticks, which can wear out over time and create issues where the controller imagines inputs you didn't intend. When I brought my controller to the checkout counter, the retail worker asked if I wanted insurance. “The sticks can start to drift,” she said. Not a good first impression.

Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller

It feels good in-hand, but there are better options if you can deal with connectivity issues.

Pros

Cons

These complaints are more than warranted, but the Pro controller does feel purpose-built for modern titles like Bananza. It's comfortable for most players, both big and small, thanks to its overly large face buttons and the smooth, rubbery feel of the sticks. I would prefer triggers with more depth to each pull, but Switch 2 games won't require any kind of pressure-sensitive trigger unless you play a GameCube title. In that case, Nintendo's recreated $65 GameCube controller is still your best bet for accurate gameplay. My main gripes with the controls are the soft L and R buttons and the spongy D-pad that won't pass muster for any fighting game aficionado. Is it the kind of device I would spend nearly $100 on? Normally, no. The problem is that third-party controllers on Switch 2 lack several features of the Pro 2 controller, which seems like a deliberate act on Nintendo's part.

The hedges of Nintendo's walled garden are as high and floral as they've ever been. Players who bought Nintendo's $450 handheld have a range of choices for a case or cameras if they're truly jonesing to see their choppy face represented in GameChat, but gamepads are another story. From a controller perspective, Nintendo's system is designed first and foremost for first-party. Sure, you could say that about any console, but Nintendo's device makes connecting third-party controllers a chore.

For review, both 8BitDo and Gulikit sent me their latest controllers to pair with Switch 2. Both makers have solid track records, and I would have expected an easy time linking them and the Switch 2. 8BitDo's $60 Ultimate 2 controller and Gulikit's latest $50 Elves 2 Pro—made to look like a classic Genesis gamepad—lack a “C” button for GameChat. That's not a heavy knock against either device since you can still access the voice chat function through the home menu. The issue for both was how hard it became to pair them with Nintendo's handheld. Both require new firmware updates through their respective websites. Even then, pairing them to the console could take two seconds or more than a minute.

See 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller at Amazon

See Elves 2 Pro Controller at Amazon

Gulikit told Gizmodo that the Switch 2 is using a different connection protocol than the original Switch. This means all third-party device makers had to adjust on the fly to what Nintendo changed. For one, Nintendo's Pro 2 controller is the only gamepad that lets you use Nintendo's software to program the GR and GL back buttons. The option doesn't come up on any controller, not even the officially licensed, wired PowerA Advantage controller at $40. Instead, you have to hold down the “PGRM” button on the back, select a button you want to map, and then hit one of the two AGR or AGL buttons on the rear.

See Power A Advantage Controller at Amazon

The inconsistencies mount when trying to get gyro controls working. There were rare instances when the Ultimate 2 wouldn't recognize them. Otherwise, both 8BitDo's controller and Elves 2 Pro had gyros just as accurate, if not more so, than Nintendo's device. Bonanza uses gyros only when aiming a chunk in Bananza or when adding a second player to control Pauline as DK's vocal turret. I prefer gyro aiming for Nintendo's games and in third-party games like Cyberpunk 2077, so the lack of it on the PowerA Advantage controller doesn't help it stand out despite its lower price.

While Donkey Kong Bananza wants you to feel like DK with every swing of your fist, Nintendo's Pro 2 controller lacks an evocative rumble. It barely shuddered my hands. 8BitDo's Ultimate 2 was like a jackhammer in comparison. Every cracked stone hit my wrists with a satisfying shudder. The Elves 2 Pro and Power A lack rumble, but I would also suggest you look at Gulikit's KK3 Max. It has solid rumble and gyro controls. It also has the same connection problems as the rest of these devices.

See Gulikit's KK3 Max at Amazon

Nintendo also ensured that only its first-party controllers could wake the console from sleep. It's just another annoying fact that gives Nintendo's Pro controller an edge. The Ultimate 2 or KK3 Max are both great first options if you can stomach those connectivity issues, but after several multiplayer sessions where controllers inexplicably disconnect, the problems aren't something you can ignore. Put together, it's enough to make me wish I were Donkey Kong—only thinking of his next banana fix—and with no care for walled gardens or expensive controllers.

An electronics, metalworking, and 3D printing enthusiast has created some Reference Circuit Books where the ‘pages' are PCBs. Published by Bolt Industries, there are presently two volumes available, with their content produced by the aforementioned expert enthusiast and Burqueño, Ian Dunn. The first book focuses on DC Circuit Fundamentals, while the other explores LEDs, transistors, and oscillators. The ‘books' are available now and sell for $37 each.



Bolt Industries boasts that these books “bring circuits to life!” That seems to be more accurate than the average similar claim, with the books being built from PCBs that a PSB-C PD charger can power. Each book contains four live, hands-on circuits designed to demonstrate key electrical principles. They are interactive, too, featuring buttons and switches, with some models sporting lights and sounds, and so on. Thus, they are pitched as “invaluable tools for both learning and reference.”

The two PCB books currently available are described by Bolt Industries as follows:

Each book weighs in at 3.95 ounces (112g) and has just four ring-bound pages. However, remember that these are relatively thick, fiberglass-reinforced, interactive, USB-C-powered pages. If you don't have a spare USB-C wall wart or power bank and are out and about with the books (not likely?), Bolt Industries highlights that you can even use your PD-compatible phone as the power source.

For some hands-on PCB books action, check out Sydneysider Dave Jones sharing news of the new reference works on his extremely popular EEVblog YouTube channel, earlier this week. After watching the video segment, it's pretty safe to assume Dave likes these books, giving them a “huge thumbs up.”

The mailbag section of the video discussing the new PCB books begins at 3 minutes and 39 seconds.

What about AMD's Instinct MI308?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Earlier this week, the U.S. government lifted its ban on shipments of AMD's Instinct MI308 and Nvidia's H20 processors for AI to Chinese entities, which pleased the companies, their Chinese customers, and investors. However, John Moolenaar (R), the head of a House of Representatives panel on China, has sent a formal letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick criticizing the move and requesting a briefing to discuss the decision and future actions of the executive branch. There is an interesting part: he does not call for a ban on the said GPUs again, but to develop a new set of rules.

"I could not agree more, which is why I strongly supported the administration's ban on H20 sales [to Chinese entities] — we must not allow U.S. companies to sell these vital artificial intelligence (AI) assets to Chinese entities," the letter signed by John Moolenaar on behalf of the panel reads. "The H20 chip significantly outperforms anything Chinese chipmakers like Huawei can currently produce, particularly in high-bandwidth memory — a critical factor for AI inference workloads."

Nvidia's H20 HGX GPU for AI applications was developed in response to the U.S. government's ban on shipments of more powerful H100 and H800 GPUs to Chinese entities in late 2023. Although the H100 can be 3.3 – 6.69 times faster than cut-down H20 HGX with AI data formats, H20 HGX is a massively successful product in China not only because it outperforms the vast majority of AI processors that can be produced in volume domestically, but also because Chinese companies prefer to use Nvidia's CUDA platform as it by far outclasses everything that Chinese companies have to offer.

The congressman cited growing signs that Chinese companies are using Nvidia's H20 processors in ways that may breach current export rules. Among other things, he mentioned Tencent's reported use of Nvidia's H20s to train its Hunyuan-Large model, which likely required over 200 PFLOPS of computing power. A cluster of this capability would meet the U.S. government's definition of a supercomputer, placing it under restricted usage guidelines.

Moolenaar also outlined the disparity between U.S. and Chinese production capabilities. While Huawei's partner SMIC is expected to produce only 200,000 of the company's Ascend 910B processors in 2025 (which is based on an assumption that SMIC produced 200,000 compute chiplets for the Ascend 910B last year and its production capabilities remained the same in 2025), American companies plan to deploy over 14 million AI processors (made by their manufacturing partners) this year. Given the disparity in production capabilities, approval of mass Nvidia H20 sales to Chinese entities could enable China to create powerful AI models and distribute them globally, possibly at no cost, as part of a strategy to capture a significant share of the AI market.

The congressman criticizes the idea of comparing H20s to top-tier U.S. chips, arguing this misses the point. In his view, the correct reference point should be the most powerful chip China can produce at scale. Because the H20 substantially exceeds that level, Moolenaar warns that it would significantly advance China's AI sector if allowed to enter the market there.

Moolenaar recommends that export rules adopt a dynamic standard that stays just ahead of China's known domestic capabilities, rather than relying on fixed U.S. performance metrics.

While such a move would enable AMD, Nvidia, and other American companies to compete against China's AI processors that local companies can produce domestically, their shipments will not allow Chinese entities to develop something they could not using only domestic solutions. In addition, this could put a roadblock on the expansion of China's AI hardware outside of China, addressing concerns that companies like Huawei could set their own AI standards globally.

There is a catch, though. Export controls are intended to prevent China's People's Liberation Army from acquiring advanced AI technologies prematurely. However, PLA does not necessarily need to use mass-produced processors, but can rely on hardware that is not built in high volumes, yet delivers performance that is actually higher than that offered by American companies.

In his letter, Moolenaar requested a detailed briefing from the Commerce Department by August 8, 2025. He asks for clarity on licensing decisions, projected shipment volumes, risk assessments, enforcement mechanisms, and any potential policy updates related to AI technologies and export controls.

AI is being forced on us in pretty much every facet of life, from phones and apps to search engines and even drive-throughs, for some reason. The fact that we're now getting web browsers with baked-in AI assistants and chatbots shows that the way some people are using the internet to seek out and consume information today is very different from even a few years ago.

But AI tools are more and more asking for gross levels of access to your personal data under the guise of needing it to work. This kind of access is not normal, nor should it be normalized. 

Not so long ago, you would be right to question why a seemingly innocuous-looking free “flashlight” or “calculator” app in the app store would try to request access to your contacts, photos, and even your real-time location data. These apps may not need that data to function, but they will request it if they think they can make a buck or two by monetizing your data. 

These days, AI isn't all that different. 

Take Perplexity's latest AI-powered web browser, Comet, as an example. Comet lets users find answers with its built-in AI search engine and automate routine tasks, like summarizing emails and calendar events. 

In a recent hands-on with the browser, TechCrunch found that when Perplexity requests access to a user's Google Calendar, the browser asks for a broad swath of permissions to the user's Google Account, including the ability to manage drafts and send emails, download your contacts, view and edit events on all of your calendars, and even the ability to take a copy of your company's entire employee directory.

Perplexity says much of this data is stored locally on your device, but you're still granting the company rights to access and use your personal information, including to improve its AI models for everyone else.

Perplexity isn't alone in asking for access to your data. There is a trend of AI apps that promise to save you time by transcribing your calls or work meetings, for example, but which require an AI assistant to access your real-time private conversations, your calendars, contacts, and more. Meta, too, has been testing the limits of what its AI apps can ask for access to, including tapping into the photos stored in a user's camera roll that haven't been uploaded yet.

Signal president Meredith Whittaker recently likened the use of AI agents and assistants to “putting your brain in a jar.” Whittaker explained how some AI products can promise to do all kinds of mundane tasks, like reserving a table at a restaurant or booking a ticket for a concert. But to do that, AI will say it needs your permission to open your browser to load the website (which can allow the AI access to your stored passwords, bookmarks, and your browsing history), a credit card to make the reservation, your calendar to mark the date, and it may also ask to open your contacts so you can share the booking with a friend.

There are serious security and privacy risks associated with using AI assistants that rely on your data. In allowing access, you're instantly and irreversibly handing over the rights to an entire snapshot of your most personal information as of that moment in time, from your inbox, messages, and calendar entries dating back years, and more. All of this for the sake of performing a task that ostensibly saves you time — or, to Whittaker's point, saves you from having to actively think about it.

You're also granting the AI agent permission to act autonomously on your behalf, requiring you to put an enormous amount of trust in a technology that is already prone to getting things wrong or flatly making things up. Using AI further requires you to trust the profit-seeking companies developing these AI products, which rely on your data to try to make their AI models perform better. When things go wrong (and they do, a lot), it's common practice for humans at AI companies to look over your private prompts to figure out why things didn't work.

From a security and privacy point of view, a simple cost-benefit analysis of connecting AI to your most personal data just isn't worth giving up access to your most private information. Any AI app asking for these levels of permissions should send your alarm bells ringing, just like the flashlight app wanting to know your location at any moment in time. 

Given the reams of data that you hand over to AI companies, ask yourself if what you get out of it is really worth it.

Prime Day may have passed nearly two weeks ago but summer is not a time for Amazon to take a break. If you're looking for a portable power station for van life or camping, there is no better time than now: Jackery Explorer models are very popular and they're currently on sale at Amazon.

Today, the Jackery portable power station Explorer 300 is an all-time low at Amazon, dropping to just $169 from its usual $259 price. The 35% discount puts it at the lower end for power stations available on the market for both planned holidays and unexpected power outages.

See at Amazon

The Jackery Explorer 300 boasts a 293Wh lithium-ion battery pack housed in a light and compact body and weighs only 7 pounds. Even though it's small, you have plenty of power which is strong enough to charge essentials such as smartphones, cameras, drones, laptops, and small appliances when you're out of the house.

Six devices are chargeable at the same time by users because of a wide variety of ports: two pure sine wave AC ports for continuous charging, a USB-C PD 60W port that is both input and output, a Quick Charge 3.0 port, a common USB-A, and a DC car port.

One of the major advantages is how fast the Explorer 300 can recharge: Using a standard wall plug and the USB-C PD charging input, you can charge up to 80% in just two hours from flat. Road life is taken care of by charging the power station from your car plug, or (if you own a Jackery SolarSaga 100 solar panel) by topping off on sunshine.

Because it is battery-powered and not gasoline, there are no fumes, no sound, and no upkeep to worry about, no complicated installation to navigate. Put it alongside the campsite, in a van, or in your living room in the event of a blackout.

With summer in full swing, Amazon's current deal won't last long.

The year 2025 is only half over. But for some of global automakers' most ambitious electric vehicle projects, the In Memoriam segment is already shaping up to be a sad one. Major manufacturers including Honda, Stellantis, and Nissan publicly backed off plans to build and sell battery-electric vehicles, joining others who have made similar admissions in the past two years.

Vehicle program cancellations aren't the sign of a thriving industry. Traditional automakers work on five- to seven-year product cycles, which means they've already started spending money to design, plan, and produce vehicles that won't roll onto dealers' lots for years. Nixing those vehicles means losing money and leaving holes in their portfolios—something automakers won't do without good reason.

The good reason here seems to mostly come down to utter chaos in the EV market. Some five years ago, automakers seemed desperate to catch up with Tesla and its sky-high valuation, and so made grand pledges. Mercedes-Benz and Volvo said they would go all-electric by 2030; General Motors targeted 2035. Then the Covid-19 pandemic hit and scrambled supply chains. Then governments, including the US government, used a mix of subsidies and regulations to ratchet up pressure for automakers to produce zero-emission cars. Then EV sales growth slowed. Now, in the US, the federal government has used the GOP's One Big Beautiful Bill to bring a sudden halt to years of EV and battery manufacturing boosterism. Plus, its tariff policy has upended global supply chains. Now many of those automakers' big electric promises have quietly gone away.

Which is to say, the cancellations make some sense. “It's business as usual in the sense that disruption is the main driver of the last five years,” says Mark Wakefield, the global automotive lead at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. “There's a speed bump every year.” This year, the firm dropped its 2030 sales predictions for battery-electric and hybrid cars by a whopping 46 percent compared to last year's projections.

Cancellations might also be signs that automakers are learning from their mistakes and even beginning to adapt more quickly. “There's a lot happening and a lot also being questioned and then abandoned,” says Wakefield. Making faster lineup changes should be key to keeping up with Chinese automakers, who have been able to shepherd new EVs from conception to the roads in less than two years.

Which is to say, more changes are likely on the way. All the way down the automotive supply chain, “companies are going quiet about their EV projects,” says Hannah Hess, the associate director of the energy and climate practice at the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Manufacturers tend not to announce their cancellations but instead hope that people forget about their original proposals. So WIRED made a list of the canceled and postponed EVs of the past two years.

RIP to them—and expect a few more losses along the way.

Ford Three-Row EV SUVDied August 2024

Ford said last summer that it had rethought its electric vehicle strategy, cutting its annual EV program spend and devoting more resources to hybrids. "What we've learned is that customers want choice, and so we're providing that choice, with a full lineup of EVs, hybrid, electric, gas, and diesel products," Ford CFO John Lawler said at the time. Among the casualties of the shift was a three-row electric SUV.

Honda Five- and Seven-Seat EV SUVDied July 2025

This month, Honda reportedly nixed a new EV series meant to hit the roads starting in 2026. The company reconsidered its plans in light of falling demand for EVs in the US and will reportedly refocus on increasing hybrid production. Honda is moving forward with its “0 Series” sedan and midsize SUV EVs, which are set to debut next year.

Mercedes-Benz MB.EA-Large PlatformDied May 2024

Mercedes-Benz was supposed to build a new electric vehicle platform to support the next versions of its EQS and EQE sedans and SUVs, plus other future luxury EV models, starting in 2028. But poor initial sales for the EQS and EQE reportedly led the company to focus on its current platform instead.

Nissan and Infiniti EV SedansDied April 2025

Nissan North America Chair Christian Meunier told Automotive News this spring that the automaker was “listening to market data” and its US customers, who were demanding fewer EVs and more SUVs. “The sedan market is shrinking,” he said. “We need to face reality.” Two EV sedans, by Nissan and its luxury division Infiniti, are out, and Nissan will build at least two electric SUVs instead.

Volvo All-EV LineupDied September 2024

Volvo said in 2021 that it planned to become a fully electric car company by 2030. Just three years later, it changed its tune. The company wrote in a press release that it “decided to adjust its electrification ambitions due to changing market conditions and customer demands.”

Maserati MC20 FolgoreDied March 2025

Stellantis' luxury Maserati brand killed off its planned MC20 sports car earlier this year. A spokesperson told Reuters that its customers “are not ready to switch to BEV (battery electric vehicles) in a foreseeable future.”

Apple CarDied February 2024

Apple's ambitious Project Titan, a plan to build an electric, autonomous car, operated in deep secrecy for a decade. Then the company reportedly pulled the plug in February 2024. The big problems plaguing the program included many, many changes in strategy and personnel, a cooling electric vehicle market, issues with the self-driving part of the project, the lack of support from a traditional automaker, and Apple's big push into other artificial intelligence projects. Some on the car team were reportedly moved into alternative AI efforts.

Fisker PearDied June 2024

The Fisker Pear, announced in 2022, was supposed to be a compact electric produced by the scrappy startup helmed by serial car company founder and designer Henrik Fisker. But the program was paused amid "financial difficulty” in March 2024. By that summer, Fisker had filed for bankruptcy.

Buick EVDelayed July 2024

At one point, General Motors' Buick brand was positioned as the automaker's greenest. Now, a spokesperson for Buick says its first electrified car is postponed. Meanwhile, GM's 2018 promise to sell only electric vehicles by 2035 has been quietly scrapped. Just last month, GM said it would spend $4 billion in the next two years to increase production of electric and gasoline vehicles.

Ferrari EV 2Delayed June 2025

Ferrari's second EV model was meant to debut at the end of 2026; now it reportedly won't make an entrance until at least 2028. Reuters reported that the automaker doesn't see sustainable demand for an electric sports car and is concerned about the effects of heavy EV batteries on the experience of driving a zippy ride.

Lamborghini LanzadorDelayed 2024

Lamborghini's first all-electric vehicle was announced in 2023 for a 2028 production date; now, it won't make an appearance until 2029 at least. CEO Stephan Winkelmann cited slower-than-predicted electric vehicle adoption and changing regulations. “Life cycles are becoming shorter due to a lot of new regulations coming in each and every year. This is making our life more complex,” he said this month.

Lamborghini UrusDelayed July 2025

Also delayed, for an even longer while, is Lamborghini's “Super SUV” EV. The Urus will reportedly remain a plug-in hybrid until 2035.

Porsche 718 EVDelayed May 2025

Porsche last said that its next-gen, electric 718 was due out “mid-decade.” Perhaps wisely, Porsche never committed to a firm date. Now the vehicle is reportedly delayed not just due to lower-than-expected EV demand but because of supply chain troubles: Battery supplier Northvolt went suddenly bankrupt this year.

Tesla Model 2Delayed?

Last year, Tesla downgraded long-time plans to build a truly affordable electric car in favor of a revamped but still cheaper offering. At the time, the company said it would begin production of this new vehicle in June 2025. But as the electric-car company emphasizes its small, supervised self-driving taxi service launch in Austin, Texas, it has made no noise about this newer car. Expect an update from CEO Elon Musk this coming week, when the company holds its quarterly earnings call.

It's been speculated on. It's been rumored. It's been hoped for. And according to an interview with TechRadar, it's happening. Android ecosystem president Sameer Samat says Google plans to combine Chrome OS and Android “into a single platform.”

Google has kept its phone and tablet operating systems distinct from its laptop platform. There has been plenty of crossover over the years—the biggest being the introduction of Android apps to Chromebooks back in 2016—but they have always coexisted. With Samat's new statement, though, change is afoot.

In the interview, Samat also followed up on a comment made to WIRED's Julian Chokkattu at Google I/O this year, hinting at a future Google laptop, stating that “he's interested in how people are using their laptops these days.” The last Google laptop was the Pixelbook Go in 2019, which followed the ill-fated Pixel Slate 2-in-1 in 2017. If Google does plan to merge the new platforms, having flagship Google hardware on hand is a must. —Luke Larsen

In other Google news, the company has set a date for its Made by Google event, where it's expected to debut the Pixel 10 series smartphones, a new Pixel Watch, and new wireless earbuds. The keynote takes place on August 20 in Brooklyn, New York, and it kicks off at 1 pm ET (10 am Pacific). It'll be livestreamed as usual.

Google used to hold its big hardware event in October, but changed things up last year, putting the Pixel release date ahead of the iPhone, with more breathing room ahead of the holiday shopping season. The highlight of this year's release—other than marking 10 years of Pixel—is that Google is rumored to be moving to TSMC chips for its Tensor G5 chipset due to issues with Samsung's foundry.

Sony has dropped a new full-frame camera out of the blue, the RX1R III. The RX1R series was last updated nine years ago. Why now? If I had to guess, I'd say it has a lot to do with the success of compact fixed-lens cameras, like the Leica Q series, Fujifilm X100 series, and the Fujifilm GFX100RF. Sorry you had to wait almost 10 years, RX1 fans, but better late than never.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

What do you get out of a 10-year development cycle? Turns out … not that much. The RX1R III is pretty much a repackaged a7R V in terms of image capabilities. There's the same 61-megapixel full-frame sensor paired with the a7R V's Bionz XR image processor and the dedicated AI chip. That's a significant upgrade for this camera relative to the last model in the series, but there's no brand-new tech here.

More interesting are the design changes. The RX1R III ditches the pop-up electronic viewfinder of the RX1R II in favor of a rear-mounted viewfinder, making it look a bit like Sony's high-res travel camera, the a7R C. Also, Sony dropped the articulating rear screen; this one is fixed like the very first RX1R. Probably the best upgrade here is that the RX1R III uses Sony's larger batteries, the NP-FW50, which will dramatically improve battery life.

One thing that hasn't changed at all since this series was launched in 2012 is the built-in Zeiss Sonnar T* 35-mm f/2 lens. The big question here is, how will this more-than-a-decade-old lens work with the latest and greatest autofocus? We'll let you know when we get our hands on a review unit later this year. —Scott Gilbertson

Omega this week dropped a bright, summery version of its excellent Seamaster Diver 300M, following on February's bronze gold and burgundy watch. While, yes, it's not exactly a groundbreaking departure from last year's original, it hits all the right notes, mainly thanks to how strong November's first iteration was. However, this model has an edge over its siblings.

The aluminum bezel and stylish mesh bracelet remain, but look closely and you'll see subtle changes, most pleasing of which is that the wave-pattern on the dial has been replaced with a flat, matte-textured black. For the orange enthusiasts, note the lollipop seconds hand, and indices at 12, 3, 6, and 9 have all been given a pop of color. A final flourish is the matching orange “Seamaster” dial signature.

As with last year's 42-mm original, we'd still opt for the mesh bracelet ($6,800), but if you want to go totally tangerine, then spec the integrated orange rubber strap at $6,500. Regardless of strap selection, with the Caliber 8806 inside (certified as a Master Chronometer by METAS) and water resistance to 300 meters, this piece—either in orange or the original black—is currently WIRED's pick of Omega's lineup. —Jeremy White

Whether you're worried about power outages or unpredictable weather events, or looking to better manage rising energy costs, EcoFlow's new Ocean Pro system is targeting you. This whole-home energy backup system pairs modular 10-kWh batteries (expandable up to 80 kWh) with an inverter that can handle up to 40-kW solar panel arrays. Ocean Pro can output up to 24 kW continuously, enough to fully power most households, including HVAC systems, EV chargers, and other appliances.

The brain of the Ocean Pro system is its Smart Home Panel, allowing for real-time energy monitoring and AI forecasting on weather, pricing, and usage to automate your smart home systems. The system can act as a backup with a 10-millisecond switchover time should the grid fail. Ocean Pro can also export power to the grid, and there's support for the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) network to export excess energy based on need and electricity prices.

EcoFlow offers a 15-year warranty, with an IP67 rating for water resistance and flood resistance up to 2.6 feet. The kit can handle extreme temperatures (from –4 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) and has built-in fire prevention. The Ocean Pro also passed the UL 9540B safety certification for energy storage systems. Most folks install them on the side of their house, so the batteries come in a choice of aluminum, carbon fiber, or walnut finishes.

These systems are a big jump up from the EcoFlow portable power stations and power banks we've tested, but the company has been selling its PowerOcean home batteries in Europe for a while, and they have a decent reputation.

The Ocean Pro beats Tesla's Powerwall 3 on two key fronts: It can handle more solar (double) and it can store more energy (Tesla maxes out at 54 kWh). But Ocean Pro will not be cheap. Exact pricing depends on your home and the size of the system, but just a couple of batteries and the inverter will cost around $10,000. Ocean Pro is available directly from EcoFlow now. —Simon Hill

Purveyor of gaming-focused virtual display glasses, Viture just announced a whole new lineup. The Luma Series has four models: Luma, Luma Pro, Luma Ultra, and the Beast. Aside from a sharper display across the board, Viture's main addition in the top three models is a front-facing camera to allow for spatial capture and 6 degrees of freedom (dof) using its Spacewalker app, though this is not available yet.

The Luma Pro I have been testing gives you a 152-inch virtual display with a 52-degree field of view at up to 1200p resolution and 1,000 nits of brightness. Viture describes them as 4K-like, despite the resolution, but what it means is that this is its sharpest display yet. The clarity and brightness are excellent. There's also electrochromic film to darken the shades, and full customization with nose pieces, diopter dials, and adjustable temples with lighting effects.

Viture's Pro XR glasses topped our Best Smart Glasses guide until the Xreal One Pro displaced them. The key advantage Xreal's glasses have is a hardware chip that allows 3 dof, so you can pin screens in place. Up until now, Viture's virtual displays moved with you when you moved your head (unless you used its Pro Neckband wearable Android computer or Spacewalker app). But the Luma Pro and up will support 6 dof, allowing you to move in 3D space, though it will still be handled through software on your connected device. Viture also offers AI-powered 2D to 3D conversion across its glasses.

The entry-level Luma ($399) lacks the camera and is set to land in September. The Luma Pro ($499) is available now, but the 6-dof functionality will be enabled via Spacewalker later. The Luma Ultra ($599), coming in August, gets a little brighter with newer Sony Micro-OLED panels, and also sports dual-depth cameras and wider 6-dof platform support, including MacBook and Windows. The flagship model, the Beast ($549), landing in October, ups the field of view to 58 degrees and the display size to 176 inches, and it has built-in hardware to enable 3 dof, with 6 dof via software, and a built-in microphone. —Simon Hill

Sony is jumping into business with the National Football League. The two megabrands announced a partnership this week that includes a custom-developed Sony headset as the primary communications device for NFL head coaches. The headset may look familiar to fans of Sony's popular wireless headphones, as the design borrows heavily from the brand's flagship WH-1000X series, from engineering insights to the look and feel of the earcups.

Sony says the headset has undergone extensive testing in rain, snow, cold, and extreme heat to take on the notoriously bad-weather games NFL coaches endure, as well as drop testing for mishaps (and presumably flaring tempers).

Sony not only brought its years of noise-canceling experience to the system, but also optimized it for real-game environments using crowd noise at over 100 decibels, according to Sony Audio product manager Gator Nakahashi. Sideline communication will be handled by a custom mic transmitted over Verizon Business' Private Wireless Solution. The headsets will hit the field at the start of the 2025 season as the Cowboys take on the Eagles on September 4. —Ryan Waniata

Four types of exercise may be the best ways to improve sleep quality and avoid insomnia: yoga, Tai Chi, walking, and jogging.

A new meta-study — a study of other studies — found that for people seeking better sleep, yoga, tai chi, walking, and jogging rivaled cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) in effectiveness.

While authoritative statistics on insomnia worldwide are elusive, the latest research suggests that 16.2% of the global population suffers from the condition, and 7.9% have severe insomnia. In the U.S., according to a survey study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 14.5% of adults had trouble falling or staying asleep within a 30-day period.

Getting sufficient sleep is important for good health. Seven to nine hours is the recommended amount of sleep each night for adults.

While CBT-i is the current “gold standard” for treating sleeplessness. It typically involves a series of one-on-one sessions with a sleep therapist.

However, exercise may be more readily accessible to some, can be easily integrated into one's life on a long-term basis, and can serve as a complement to CBT-i. 

As such, the meta-study's findings will be of interest to many:

The study is published in the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.

The 22 trials encompassed in the meta-study involved 1,348 participants and explored 13 different therapies intended to relieve insomnia. The studies ran from 6 to 26 weeks in length.

Seven of the studies investigated exercise-based activities. These were yoga, Tai Chi, walking or jogging, aerobic plus strength exercise, strength training alone, aerobic exercise combined with therapy, and mixed aerobic exercises.

An issue with any meta-study is that the quality of the trials it includes varies. Conclusions that can be drawn are often tempered with questions regarding certainty. Among those concerns is an inevitable lack of detail that can cloud conclusions somewhat.

“For example, what is the age group, gender, ethnicity, and overall clinical profile of the participants from the 22 studies included in this meta-analysis? What type of co-morbidities do they have, if any?” asked Carleara Weiss, MD, Ph.D., MSH, RN, of Aeroflow Sleep, who was not involved in the study.

Jonathan Cedernaes, PhD, a sleep researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden, who was also not involved in the study, acknowledged that the study was “quite a comprehensive analysis which seems to be robustly done.” However, he cautioned:

“While the authors' findings suggest that different exercise modalities may benefit different aspects of sleep, I think we need more evidence to draw those types of conclusions.”

Leah Kaylor, PhD, clinical psychologist specializing in trauma and sleep, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today:

“Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disturbances. It's rarely caused by a single factor. Instead, insomnia typically arises from an interplay of biological, psychological, and environmental contributors.”

Cedernaes cites “the high demands of our 24/7 society, with high stress from trying to manage both a successful career and family life.”

“We saw that rates [of insomnia] increased during the COVID-19 pandemic,” recalled Cedernaes, “which may have to do with further increases in stress. Periods of uncertainty, which can include financial ones, have been tied to increased risk of insomnia.”

“There is also evidence that the increased use of artificial light can contribute, as well as increased (especially evening or nighttime) use of social media,” he said.

An increasing awareness of sleep issues may also be aggravating the problem, pointed out Kaylor. 

“People with insomnia often develop dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, such as catastrophizing the effects of poor sleep or believing they must ‘force' sleep. These thoughts can lead to pre-sleep rumination, sleep performance anxiety, and paradoxical wakefulness — making it even harder to fall asleep.”— Leah Kaylor, PhD

In addition, Kaylor said, “Mental health conditions like anxiety and depression further intensify these cognitive loops. Chronic pain, gastrointestinal disorders, PTSD, depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's) are all strongly associated with insomnia.”

Kaylor proposed a likely mechanism at work:

“Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system — our fight-or-flight response — can lead to hyperarousal, a key feature of insomnia.”

“Practices like yoga and Tai Chi have been shown to decrease sympathetic tone and increase parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) activity, supporting the down-regulation of arousal prior to sleep onset.”— Leah Kaylor, PhD

On a brain-chemistry level, Cedernaes said these activities may “activate the parasympathetic nervous system, and relatedly, may also reduce cortisol levels by lowering activity in the HPA axis that regulates cortisol.”

“Slow, rhythmic movements combined with breath control enhance vagal tone, which is associated with a calmer physiological state conducive to sleep,” added Kaylor.

Recent research, say the authors, supports the idea that exercise in general helps people fall asleep more easily. Laboratory studies suggest that it enhances neuroplasticity and strengthens connectivity in key brain regions involved in sleep.

“For walking,” noted Weiss, “scientific evidence suggests [as factors] reduced stress, improved circadian rhythms (when keeping consistent timing and exposure to light), and increased BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which is critical for sleep regulation.”

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) - like chronic or gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia - are among the leading causes of maternal and infant death in the United States. 

Between 2017 to 2019, 16% of all U.S. pregnancies were complicated by an HDP diagnosis, with much higher rates seen among non-Hispanic Black/African American and American Indian/Alaskan Native women. But HDPs don't just affect women in the short term; these disorders can increase their long-term risk for heart disease, kidney disease, and stroke. 

But there could be an opportunity to mitigate these longer-term health risks through breastfeeding, Yale researchers have found. In a new study, they discovered that an HDP diagnosis before or during pregnancy related to higher odds of never breastfeeding, or for those who initiated breastfeeding, higher probability of stopping. The findings suggest women with HDPs may benefit from targeted interventions that promote their exposure to the cardioprotective benefits of breastfeeding.

The findings are published in the journal JAMA Network Open.

We looked at breastfeeding initiation, or whether you ever started breastfeeding. We also looked at breastfeeding duration. So, if you did start, how long did you breastfeed for? Having a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy was associated with worse outcomes for both of these measures."

Deanna Nardella, instructor of pediatrics and physician-scientist with Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and first author of the study

There can be many barriers to starting, and sustaining, breastfeeding after childbirth, from facing lactation challenges and inadequate parental leave policies to lack of breastfeeding education among patients and healthcare providers alike. In the U.S., 83% of women start breastfeeding, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but only 25% continue to exclusively breastfeed through the first six months - the recommended duration by leading health organizations. 

"These statistics beg the question, why is that the case?," Nardella said. "As a practicing pediatrician in the New Haven community, it is not often I see parents who truly do not want to breastfeed. Rather, I frequently see parents try to breastfeed, shortly thereafter encountering common - and often addressable - challenges, such as pain, latch difficulties, and milk supply concerns. 

"Unfortunately, many families do not get the timely care they need to address such challenges, resulting in breastfeeding cessation. I believe that the attrition we see in U.S. breastfeeding rates, particularly within the early weeks to months postpartum, in large part reflect systems level issues."

Other maternal comorbidities, including chronic and gestational diabetes, have been shown to negatively influence breastfeeding outcomes, but little is known about the breastfeeding outcomes for those with HDP despite its high prevalence among pregnant people in the United States. For Nardella, understanding this relationship is critical to promoting health equity. 

"We know that Black and Native women in the U.S. have higher rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy," she said. "These communities also have the lowest breastfeeding rates. Though we cannot say that HDPs directly cause these observed inequities, understanding the mechanisms of the relationship between HDP and breastfeeding initiation and duration could promote more equitable long term cardiometabolic outcomes for pregnant individuals and infants from these communities."

For the new study, researchers sought to better understand this relationship by analyzing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). PRAMS surveys women across the U.S., usually around four months postpartum, on their attitudes, beliefs, and experiences during their pregnancy, prenatal, and postpartum periods. 

Their sample included women who had delivered a live infant between January 2016 and November 2021 and who had provided complete data for HDP and non-initiation or cessation of breastfeeding. The researchers defined HDP as self-reported high blood pressure or hypertension, preeclampsia, or eclampsia before or during pregnancy. Women were determined to have never breastfed if they reported "no" to ever breastfeeding on the survey. Among those who reported breastfeeding, researchers defined time to cessation as 0.5 weeks if they reported breastfeeding less than one week, their exact breastfeeding duration (in weeks) if provided, or infant age at the time of survey completion (in weeks) if they reported they were still breastfeeding. 

Their analytic sample included 205,247 participants - a weighted sample representing nearly 11 million U.S. women - from 43 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, and across all socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. They found that women with an HDP had 11% higher odds of never breastfeeding and, among those who did start breastfeeding, a 17% higher probability of stopping at some point during the postpartum period. The median time for breastfeeding cessation was 17 weeks shorter for women with HDP than those without HDP. These findings suggest a negative association between HDP and breastfeeding outcomes. 

"Over 80% of U.S. families choose to breastfeed their infant," said Sarah Taylor, professor of pediatrics (neonatal-perinatal medicine) at YSM and co-author of the study. "However, most do not reach the goal, set by the American Academy of Pediatrics, to exclusively do breastfeeding for six months. Research, such as this study showing an association between HDPs and shorter breastfeeding duration, guides the development of strategies to help all families reach their breastfeeding goal."

Future studies to identify the mechanisms that underlie this relationship between HDP and breastfeeding are required to develop targeted, innovative strategies to improve breastfeeding outcomes for people with HDP, researchers said.

"Such strategies could include having a standard, dedicated prenatal lactation consultation for those individuals who wish to try breastfeeding and have risk factors for experiencing worse breastfeeding outcomes, such as HDP," Nardella said. "Pregnancy is a critical, and often underutilized, period for lactation education and support."

She added: "This paper provides foundational knowledge on which to build future studies to understand how our health systems can best support those individuals with hypertension in reaching their personal infant feeding goals. As a system, we must do better about supporting women with HDP in reaching whatever their infant feeding goal may be, particularly if it involves any amount of breastfeeding. Such support could promise long term improvements in health outcomes for many pregnant individuals and their infants, especially among communities with high risk of cardiometabolic disease and breastfeeding cessation."

The study was supported by grants from the Yale Pediatric Scholars Program, the Yale National Clinician Scholars Program, and the Clinical and Translational Science Awards from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Inhaling agricultural dust may pose significant risks to gut health for workers in animal agriculture, a University of California, Riverside, study has found. 

Led by Declan McCole, a professor of biomedical sciences in the UCR School of Medicine, the study expands on prior findings that hog farm dust causes airway inflammation. The researchers now report in the Journal of Applied Toxicology that inhaling this dust also alters the gut microbiome and impairs intestinal function, including increased "leaky gut" or intestinal permeability. Leaky gut is associated with a range of chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and type 1 diabetes.

"Exposure to swine farm dust, which contains high levels of bacteria and endotoxins, caused both airway inflammation and increased passage of gut bacterial products into the bloodstream in our mouse models," said Meli'sa Crawford, a former postdoctoral researcher in McCole's lab and the paper's first author. "But what's especially striking is the impact we observed on the gut microbiome and metabolism."

The researchers exposed mice intranasally to hog dust extract for three weeks. The mice showed a significant drop in beneficial bacterial species, including Akkermansia muciniphila, Clostridium sp. ASF356, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium. 

The research team also found decreased levels of critical compounds in the gut of the mice, such as riboflavin, nicotinic acid, inosine, and leucine - key players in energy metabolism, immune regulation, and gut barrier maintenance.

While most research has focused on the respiratory effects of farm dust, our findings clearly show that inhaled pollutants can have systemic consequences. This research underscores the importance of considering the gut–lung axis when assessing the health risks of bioaerosol exposure in agriculture."

Declan McCole, professor of biomedical sciences, UCR School of Medicine

The study builds on growing evidence that pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations can impact multiple organ systems. 

"Agricultural dust is rich in fine particulate matter and resistant bacteria, presenting a complex threat to farmworkers' health," McCole said. "Our earlier work showed that inhaled hog dust extract leads to neutrophilic lung inflammation. We now show the link to intestinal barrier dysfunction and microbial imbalance, highlighting the need for improved workplace protections for agricultural workers to mitigate long-term health consequences."

The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health; University of California, Davis-Western Center for Agricultural Health and Safety; and University of California Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship Program. Crawford is now an assistant professor in the Department of Animal Sciences at Rutgers University in New Jersey.

The title of the research paper is "Respiratory Exposure to Agriculture Dust Extract Alters Gut Commensal Species and Key Metabolites in Mice."

A new study from Emory University reveals that maintaining optimal cardiovascular health can significantly improve overall physical and psychological well-being.

Published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association, the study synthesizes findings from nearly 500 peer-reviewed studies. It confirms that the benefits of heart-healthy behaviors extend far beyond the heart, positively impacting brain function, vision, hearing, muscle strength, and even reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and dementia.

"While we recently learned that heart-health and brain health are closely tied, in this review we found that almost every organ system and bodily function from head to toe benefit from a heart-healthy lifestyle," says Liliana Aguayo, PhD, MPH, research assistant professor at the Emory University Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing and core faculty member at Emory's Global Diabetes Research Center, who led the study. 

The review is the first of its kind to systematically examine how the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7™ metrics - which include not smoking, healthy eating, regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar - influence health outcomes across multiple organ systems. The updated Life's Essential 8™ also includes sleep as a key factor.

Among the key findings were that those with heart-healthy habits:

The study was supported in part by the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health. It calls for further research in underrepresented populations, including children and pregnant women, and emphasizes the need to understand how even minor lifestyle improvements yield significant health benefits.

As youth engagement in high-energy sports surges, so does the prevalence of sport-related injuries. Among them, tibial tubercle avulsion fractures (TTAFs) represent a small but serious subset, accounting for less than 3% of pediatric fractures. These injuries commonly affect adolescent boys and are associated with risk factors such as delayed skeletal maturity, Osgood-Schlatter disease, and abnormal body mass index. Diagnosis can be complex, as symptoms mimic other knee conditions, and imaging beyond basic X-rays is often required. Despite several classification systems, no consensus exists on standardized treatment protocols. Due to these challenges, there is a growing need for in-depth studies to better understand and manage TTAFs.

In a recent review (DOI: 10.1002/pdi3.2521) published in Pediatric Discovery (2025), researchers from the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and Sichuan University examined the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of TTAFs in children and adolescents. These injuries, though rare, are becoming more frequent due to rising sports participation among youth. The article reviews decades of literature and new clinical findings to offer guidance for orthopedic surgeons facing this unique challenge in pediatric care.

The study delves into how TTAFs occur—often during sudden movements like jumping or landing, when the quadriceps muscle forcefully contracts and pulls on the tibial tubercle. The authors explain how specific anatomical features and the stages of bone development make adolescents particularly vulnerable. While boys face higher risk due to later growth plate closure and greater quadriceps strength, the presence of Osgood-Schlatter disease or extreme BMI—whether high or low—also heightens susceptibility. Diagnostic tools such as CT and MRI are recommended to detect hidden soft tissue damage and guide surgical planning. Multiple classification systems are discussed, with the Ogden system remaining the most widely used despite its limitations. Treatment options range from conservative casting for stable fractures to surgical methods like open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for displaced or complex cases. The review underscores the variability in clinical decisions due to the lack of evidence-based guidelines and highlights the importance of monitoring for complications like compartment syndrome, which can be life-altering if untreated.

Many of these young patients are active in sports and unaware of their risk until an injury sidelines them. What this review emphasizes is the need for vigilance—not just in diagnosis, but in understanding the subtle risk factors like growth plate maturity and muscle force imbalances. With proper identification and early treatment, most children recover fully and return to their activities."

Dr. Xing Liu, senior orthopedic surgeon at Chongqing Medical University

This study provides clinicians with a critical update on recognizing and treating TTAFs in pediatric patients. Its insights help bridge the gap between injury mechanism, clinical presentation, and long-term recovery strategies. As sports-related injuries in children grow more common, this knowledge equips orthopedic specialists with the tools to make timely interventions and reduce complications. Looking forward, developing unified clinical guidelines and further exploring risk factors like BMI and OSD may improve both treatment precision and outcomes. With appropriate care, young patients can return to full function—sometimes even stronger than before.

Nearly one-third of the nation's K-12 U.S. public schools mandate mental health screening for students, with most offering in-person treatment or referral to a community mental health professional if a student is identified as having depression or anxiety, according to a new study.

About 40% of principals surveyed said it was very hard or somewhat hard to ensure that students receive appropriate care, while 38% said it was easy or very easy to find adequate care for students. The findings are published in the journal JAMA Network Open.

Our results suggest that there are multiple barriers to mental health screening in schools, including a lack of resources and knowledge of screening mechanics, as well as concerns about increased workload of identifying students."

Jonathan Cantor, study's lead author and a policy researcher at RAND

In 2021, the U.S. Surgeon General declared a youth mental health emergency. Researchers say that public schools are strategic resources for screening, treatment and referral for mental health services for young people who face barriers in other settings.

Researchers wanted to understand screening for mental health at U.S. public schools, given increased concerns about youth mental health following the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In October 2024, the RAND study surveyed 1,019 principals who participate in the RAND American School Leader panel, a nationally representative sample of K-12 public school principals.

They were asked whether their school mandated screening for mental health issues, what steps are taken if a student is identified as having depression or anxiety, and how easy or difficult it is to ensure that such students received adequate services.

Researchers found that 30.5% of responding principals said their school required screening of students with mental health problems, with nearly 80% reporting that parents typically are notified if students screen positive for depression or anxiety.

More than 70% of principals reported that their school offers in-person treatment for students who screen positive, while 53% of principals said they may refer a student to a community mental health care professional.

The study found higher rates of mental health screenings in schools with 450 or more students and in districts with mostly racial and ethnic minority groups as the student populations.

"Policies that promote federal and state funding for school mental health, reimbursement for school-based mental health screening, and adequate school mental health staff ratios may increase screening rates and increase the likelihood of successfully connecting the student to treatment," Cantor said.

Support for the study was provided by the National Institute of Mental Health.

Other authors of the study are Ryan K. McBain, Aaron Kofner, Joshua Breslau and Bradley D. Stein, all of RAND; Jacquelin Rankine of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine; Fang Zhang, Hao Yu and Alyssa Burnett, all of the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute; and Ateev Mehrotra of the Brown University School of Public Health.

The Blues stand to make a big profit on the wantaway winger despite the indifferent nature of his spell at Stamford Bridge

We have been waiting some time to witness Chelsea's bewildering new transfer strategy yield some semblance of success, but, all of a sudden, it has started to bear fruit. Fresh from their incredibly young squad claiming a second trophy in as many months, the Blues are set to make a cool profit on one of their expendable wantaways.

Noni Madueke is set to complete a costly £52 million ($70m) transfer across the English capital to fierce rivals Arsenal, and the imminent deal means Chelsea stand to gain more than £20m ($27m) - despite the winger largely flattering to deceive since arriving from PSV for £30.5m ($41m) in January 2023.

This is the new master plan in action, and with tangible success finally being delivered on the pitch, the club's hierarchy will believe that their often baffling approach to the transfer market is now paying off...

Gotta earn it

Chelsea have been world champions for almost an entire week now, and since this new Club World Cup tournament is only held every four years (like the actual World Cup), we will get to call ourselves world champions for the next four years.  Pretty cool.  (The annual format lives on as the brand new “FIFA Intercontinental Cup”, first held last December.)

However, our participation in the next Club World Cup, to potentially defend our title, is not guaranteed.  This runs contrary to most club competitions at UEFA level, where the winners automatically qualify for next year's tournament (or qualify for the higher level competition, such as the Europa League winner going into next year's Champions League).  It is however in line with the way FIFA do things.  The winners of the World Cup used to get an automatic spot, but that was changed in 2000, and now every national team except the host nation's (or nations') has to qualify.

The Athletic do point out that FIFA have not actually adopted a “definitive” position on this issue, and have plenty of leeway built into their regulations to easily decide to change their policies either officially or unofficially (like when they granted Inter Miami a place in this year's tournament as the “host country representative team”, a provision they invented on the spot).

But as things stand, we will have to earn our way back in — by either winning the Champions League in the next three years, or by performing at a high level consistently enough to get an at-large bid. Ironically, runners-up PSG are already qualified as the 2025 Champions League-winners.

AirBnB has been named the official accommodation for the thousands of soccer fans attending the 2026 FIFA World Cup matches. For those who own homes or businesses in South Florida, it's a great opportunity.

Local FIFA fans aren't just getting ready to cheer on their favorite teams but potentially reap the benefits of the thousands of visitors who will come to the United States to watch any of the 78 matches that will be played across 11 cities. One of those cities is Miami.

“We as hosts we really specialize and really pride ourselves on providing an experience, more than just a stay,” shares Andres Aguirre, a host with AirBnB.

Aguirre is an AirBnB owner in Aventura. He says his summer 2026 bookings are ready to welcome soccer fans to one of his properties located just 10 minutes from Hard Rock Stadium, the host of 7 World Cup Games.

“We have four bedrooms and two bathrooms, with a pool, a heated pool,” Aguirre shares as he showcases the property. “We also have a hot tub, fire pit and an outdoor area where you can just relax and enjoy your time here.”

A house like Andres' in September could rent for $550 a night, but during the World Cup, which runs from June 11th to July 19th of next year the price practically doubles. The week of June 11th, the same house costs $1,111 a night.

“At the end of the day we expect an average host to make more than $3,000 dollars during the event in 2026, so it's important to think of this as a great economic opportunity, while still remaining a casual host, and don't make this a full time activity for you,” said Jordi Torres Mallol, the America Regional Director of AirBnB.



Mallol added that the influx of tourists will yield in a major economic boost. 

“We expect hundreds of thousands of travelers coming into the US, Canada and Mexico. In particular, in Miami, we expect more than $30,000. This adds up to economic opportunity and economic impact of $3.6 billion dollars, and in the case of Miami, $380 million dollars,” explained Mallol. 

And if that wasn't enough, the accommodation platform will offer exclusive experiences for fans.

Mallol said some of the fan experiences include training with soccer legend Tim Howard in the context of the FIFA tournament, or catching the game from the stands with the former LA Galaxy player.

And closer to home, tour guides like Diana Contreras are just one of the many business owners that are hoping to give fans a unique experience to learn about the city in which the games are being played.

“I love this neighborhood so much, I have been here 13 years, so this is very natural for me, to give tours of my favorite neighborhood and the artists that I know as my friends and my own art as well,” Contreras said.

According to a Deloitte and Touche study, AirBnB hosts in the 11 World Cup host cities could generate up to $210 million dollars in profits -- a financial goal!

AirBnB said that it's contributing $5 million dollars to host cities to go towards different projects. The specific projects will be selected in the next few weeks.

Major League Soccer, not Serie A, would offer the Dortmund midfielder the perfect opportunity rediscover his game

As Borussia Dortmund took on Mamelodi Sundowns in their second Club World Cup group stage fixture, Gio Reyna could only watch from the locker room at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati. In fairness, he wasn't alone. Half of the Dortmund bench had joined him there, the German side watching their teammates toil in the scorching summer sun.

But that image - one that went viral on both sides of the Atlantic - summed up Reyna's position in Dortmund right now. It was, in effect, the perfect metaphor. Reyna the outcast, watching from afar, not even relevant enough to be on the bench.

And that's pretty much where the Reyna saga is these days. And yes, it is a saga. The Dortmund attacking midfielder is an immense talent. He is perhaps the most naturally gifted player in the USMNT setup. But at Dortmund, he has become, to put things generously, an afterthought. Niko Kovac clearly doesn't trust him even for garbage time minutes, let alone the high intensity grind of the Bundesliga that Reyna, on talent alone, is good enough to star in.

For a few years now, the story has been one of "How Reyna is going to turn things around at Dortmund." But now, transfer talk has kicked up for good. His Dortmund future was in doubt before. Now it just seems non-existent. A move is inevitable. Landing spots are tough to evaluate. Another Bundesliga club might make sense. A more permanent home for a lower level Premier League team could also work

Recently, two links have popped up: MLS and Serie A. LAFC and NYCFC have been mentioned in the domestic U.S. league. Parma seem a potential Serie A destination - with reports suggesting a deal for a $7 million switch could be in the works.

But for this iteration of Reyna, 22, full of quality but in dire need of a fresh start, MLS simply has to be his immediate future. It is the only way he can play his way into the USMNT picture. And, more broadly, it would seem to be a career-saving move for an immense talent steadily fading into irrelevance.

Cole Palmer and his influencer girlfriend Connie Grace have unfollowed each other on social media just days after the Chelsea star won the Club World cup.

The Chelsea star and his partner have also removed all pictures of one another from their respective accounts. 

It comes after the 23-year-old starred in the Club World Cup final, scoring two goals and claiming an assist for Joao Pedro, as Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain to become world champions.

Grace had travelled to the US during the tournament but was not among the wives or girlfriends who celebrated the win on the pitch at the MetLife Stadium.

Now the pair have both unfollowed one another on Instagram.

Palmer this week said he was looking forward to being reunited with his girlfriend, but that he first wanted to visit St Kitts and Nevis.

Mail Sport exclusively accompanied Palmer as he returned to his ancestral Caribbean homeland for the first time, where his paternal grandfather was born. 

He was given a hero's welcome as he arrived on the island, 4,000 miles from the Manchester suburb of Wythenshawe where the Chelsea and England star grew up.

The 23-year-old even held a reception with the country's prime minister.

Meanwhile, Grace is continuing to enjoy a holiday in Miami, posting a picture of herself in the city on her Instagram on Friday.

Palmer and Grace went public together in November last year at the GQ Men of the Year Awards and are around eleven months into their relationship. 

Grace, a nail technician and Instagram influencer with 38,000 followers, is also from Manchester. 

The duo met when they were 17 through mutual friends.

In March she said: 'Cole now is still the same Cole that I met when I was 17. Obviously, he's changed, he's grown up, and his life now is completely different, but he's still the same boy, he's still laid-back Cole.

'Cole will adapt to whatever situation he's in. He's not bothered that he's that far from home because all he wants to do is play football and if it means leaving home and being in a place which is completely different to where he's from, he'll do it.

'He's not bothered about the whole fame side of it and he's not bothered what people think of him. He is only just bothered about scoring goals and doing well for his team, doing well for his country, and you've got to love him for that.'

Palmer is currently enjoying his summer break after another impressive season, where he guided Chelsea to the Europa Conference League title.

He scored 18 goals and provided 14 assists in all competitions, scoring 15 and assisting nine in the Premier League, as Chelsea qualified for the Champions League for the first time in three years.

The Blues take on Erik Ten Hag's Bayer Leverkusen in less than three weeks in their opening pre-season game, before hosting AC Milan two days later.

They then begin their Premier League campaign by welcoming Crystal Palace to Stamford Bridge on August 17.

Mauricio Pochettino's stoic grin and pondering eyes may not capture much emotion on the sidelines with the U.S. men's national team, but don't take that for a lack of care. 

In the moments after the USMNT watched Mexico lift its 10th Concacaf Gold Cup trophy in June, the Argentine manager spoke eloquently to his players in the locker room. While many hung their heads, Pochettino's eyes watered as he addressed the group, likely before moving to speak with the assembled media. 

“You deserved more. The way that you worked, the staff, everyone, I think today we deserved more to lift the trophy because I think the performance was there,” Pochettino told the dejected players and staff in a speech now unveiled in a recent U.S. Soccer video. “I think you fought with too many adversities and too many factors against you...that's not going to kill us, it's going to make us stronger, and I want you never to give up.

“I think we still have time to be better, [so] keep improving, but please don't change. That's the way we can build to the next, and the next and the next, until we get to the World Cup.”

Surrounded by several staff members and officials from U.S. Soccer, the shots offer a unique insight into how much the tournament and the loss in the final genuinely mattered to the USMNT ahead of the co-hosted 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

Even without key star players such as Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun, among others, the opportunity to navigate a group stage and knockout phase, while keeping the group together for over a month, was invaluable. 

And despite the several players within the Gold Cup team that likely won't crack a final World Cup roster, the tournament and pre-tournament friendlies offered an opportunity to re-establish a culture surrounding the international game for the USMNT. 

“I think we all realize that we can be competitive and we can win. We were so close and the people started to understand, because Mexico now was saying ‘well done, how you've played and how the team is so strong, and how difficult it is to play against you,” Pochettino added in his speech. 

“It's so painful, but I think we need to have our heads up because you did everything. I am so proud, and I think all of the people outside will feel the same...I hope we can keep this feeling, that we want to work together and work for the team.”

Although his emotional and gentle approach with the players and staff evoked a special meaning around the tournament, as the Americans' efforts to reach the final after a disappointing fourth-place finish at the Concacaf Nations League, Pochettino quickly changed his tone when talking to the press. 

In front of reporters, Pochettino blamed the match officials, particularly for the handball instance involving Jorge Sánchez, whose hand fell on top of the ball and went uncalled, despite strong appeals from the USMNT players and staff. 

Additionally, he expressed his frustrations that Mexico's 77th-minute winning goal from Edson Álvarez was allowed to stand, after initially being ruled offside. 

“I'm not going to cry,” Pochettino said in the press availability. “I wanted to tell the truth, and the truth was that if that happened in the opposite [box], for sure it's a penalty. The was the player with the knee on the floor. He pushed the hand over the ball. It's not that the hand was on the floor and the ball touched.

“OK, well, the excuses now, but you know that was [a] penalty and maybe 2-1 for us, and maybe we now [would be] celebrating the trophy. I think that it is clear and it's not about to cry, it's not about to complain. For me, it was embarrassing to see that situation, and it's a shame.”

Yet, all of the noise around the Gold Cup is slowly fading into the rearview, as players look ahead to new European seasons and the continuation of the MLS campaign. For Pochettino, though, all eyes are on September and October and friendlies against South Korea, Japan, Colombia and Ecuador, as he continues to build the USMNT to next summer's World Cup. 

“That is this sport, it's so cruel, because we were so close and you nearly touched it and it disappeared,” he told the players. “That's why when we push you... It's because, here inside, we always need more. If we push it, it's because the goal for you is to be the best.”

Premier League trio Manchester United, Liverpool, and Manchester City have been ‘stripped' of one of their most prestigious titles following a controversial FIFA decision this week. It appears the world football governing body is attempting to rewrite Club World Cup history as part of its ongoing efforts to raise the tournament's profile.

Among the changes already made to what was once seen as a glorified mid-season friendly by the top European clubs are the expansion of the competition to 32 teams, a stricter qualification process, and the introduction of a lucrative £125 million prize for the winners.

But perhaps the most controversial change of all is FIFA's decision to disregard all past winners of the tournament and start from scratch. They have now officially declared Chelsea as the ‘first ever' Club World Cup champions following their emphatic 3-0 win over Champions League holders PSG last Sunday at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, according to the Daily Mail.

After winning club football's most lucrative competition, Chelsea aren't guaranteed to be present to defend their title in 2029.

Previous winners of the Club World Cup are now labelled by FIFA as "FIFA Intercontinental Champions." As such, though, the likes of Liverpool, Man City, Man United, Real Madrid and Barcelona are no longer considered world champions.

The competition was first played in 2000 as the Club World Championship, before returning in 2005, and was played annually until 2023, before adopting its current form. FIFA appeared to confirm the news themselves on Sunday night, as they shared a social media photo of Chelsea lifting the trophy with the caption:

"The first ever FIFA CWC Champions."

While City won the original competition in 2023, Liverpool lifted it in 2019 and United in 2008. Chelsea had also won it previously in 2021. Real Madrid won it the most times with five - most recently in 2022 - while Barcelona won it four times, and Chelsea, Corinthians, and Bayern Munich twice.

A change in trophy appears to have brought with it an official change in who can claim to have won the Club World Cup. However, the previous editions haven't been completely erased - suggesting a revamp similar to the 1992 transformation of the old European Cup into what we now know as the Champions League.

The length of the half-time show has caused controversy.

Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City have all been stripped of a major title by FIFA.

All three teams watched on as Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 to win the Club World Cup final last weekend.

Cole Palmer scored a brace in New Jersey, with Joao Pedro's strike making it 3-0 before half-time and proving to be the final goal of the game.

Advert

Enzo Maresca's side lifted the Club World Cup trophy for the first time, having lost in the final to Corinthians back in 2012.

This year's Club World Cup was played under an entirely new format, with a group and knockout phase consisting of 32 teams from six confederations.

FIFA have now made a decision over how they recognise the new tournament - and it is bad news for United, Liverpool and City.

Advert

They have decided to recognise Chelsea as the 'first-ever' Club World Cup winners, meaning they are now the only club side who can be considered as 'world champions'.

According to the Daily Mail, the above three English clubs - and all other previous winners - will now be known as 'FIFA Intercontinental Champions'.

There is a similarly-named tournament known as the FIFA Intercontinental Cup, which sees each of the six teams that won their confederation's continental cup compete in a mini-tournament in December.

That is, it must be added, different to the other FIFA Intercontinental Cup, which ran between 1970 and 2004 and was contested between the UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores winners.

Advert

The new Club World Cup brought with it a new trophy - though the trophy for the previous format also had the 'Club World Cup' title branded on it.

After all that, we're left with something of a roll of honour that recognises just one world champion - and many more now-former world champions.

The Club World Cup is set to return in 2029, with PSG, Pyramids, Al Hilal and Cruz Azul already qualified after winning their continental championships last season.

Players born on or after Jan. 1, 2005 are age-eligible for this year's FIFA U-20 World Cup, set for Sept. 27-Oct. 19 in Chile. For this training camp, Mitrović called up 14 players born in 2005, six born in 2006 and two born in 2007.

Originally called up for the U-19 MNT's camp in Marbella, Spain next week, defender Luca Bombino and forward Zavier Gozo will now join the U-20 MNT for the matches against Colombia and Egypt.

A total of 14 Major League Soccer clubs are represented on the roster, led by two players from Atlanta United. Six players are based abroad, with two plying the trade in Spain and one each coming Denmark, England, Germany and Portugal.

Goalkeepers (2): Gavin Beavers (Brondby/DEN; Henderson, Nev.), Diego Kochen (FC Barcelona/ESP; Miramar, Fla.)

Defenders (8): Matai Akinmboni (Bournemouth/ENG; Upper Marlboro, Md.), Reed Baker-Whiting (Seattle Sounders; Seattle, Wash.), Luca Bombino (San Diego FC; Saugus, Calif.), Noah Cobb (Atlanta United; Chattanooga, Tenn.), Tate Johnson (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; Tampa, Fla.), Ethan Kohler (Werder Bremen/GER; Campbell, Calif.), Nolan Norris (FC Dallas; Fort Worth, Texas), Francis Westfield (Philadelphia Union; Philadelphia, Pa.)

Midfielders (6): Matthew Corcoran (Nashville SC; Dallas, Texas), Benjamin Cremaschi (Inter Miami; Key Biscayne, Fla.), Taha Habroune (Columbus Crew; Columbus, Ohio), Sergio Oregel Jr. (Chicago Fire; Chicago, Ill.), Brooklyn Raines (Houston Dynamo; Chicago, Ill.), Pedro Soma (FC Barcelona/ESP; Coconut Creek, Fla.)

Forwards (6): Luke Brennan (Atlanta United; Atlanta, Ga.), Kristian Fletcher (D.C. United; Bowie, Md.), Zavier Gozo (Real Salt Lake; Eagle Mountain, Utah), Peyton Miller (New England Revolution; Unionville, Conn.), Serge Ngoma Jr. (New York Red Bulls; North Plainfield, N.J.), Marcos Zambrano (Vitoria Guimaraes/POR; Gladwyne, Pa.)

Fourteen players return from the U-20 MNT's March training camp in L'Albir, Spain where they defeated Mexico 3-0 and drew with 1-1 with Japan. The U.S. took control of the match against Mexico early thanks to a Luke Brennan goal three minutes into the match. Kristian Fletcher notched a brace to complete the scoring for the USA. Against Japan, the U.S. went down 1-0 in the first half but battled back to earn a 1-1 draw.

Ten players on the June camp roster helped the USA secure its U-20 World Cup berth with a runner-up showing at the 2024 Concacaf U-20 Championship in Mexico: Luca Bombino, Noah Cobb, Zavier Gozo, Taha Habroune, Ethan Kohler, Nolan Norris, Sergio Oregel Jr., Brooklyn Raines, Pedro Soma and Marco Zombrano.

A number of players already have represented the United States on some of the game's biggest stages. Three players were a part of the U.S. roster at the 2023 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Indonesia, leading the squad to the knockout stage before a narrow defeat to eventual champion Germany: Matthew Corcoran, Habroune, and Soma.

In addition, three players helped the U.S. finish fourth at the 2023 PanAmerican Games, the USA's best showing at the tournament since 1999: Norris, Oregel Jr. and Raines.

BEHIND THE NEWS:

With the 2026 World Cup set to take place at several sites known for extreme heat, such as Mexico City's Azteca Stadium, FIFA is taking precautions for player safety.

Extreme heat is becoming soccer's most pressing challenge, as dramatically demonstrated during this summer's FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. As global temperatures continue to rise, traditional summer tournaments are evolving into health hazards for both players and spectators. Climate scientists are sounding alarm bells, warning that June and July competitions could soon become breeding grounds for life-threatening heat-related illnesses.

Despite FIFA's introduction of cooling measures — including additional water breaks and shaded bench areas — players have voiced serious concerns about tournament conditions. Many experts now advocate for a fundamental shift toward cooler months, though such changes would upend soccer's deeply entrenched seasonal calendar. With the 2026 World Cup set for North America and 2030 set for North Africa, both notoriously hot regions, FIFA faces mounting pressure to confront this climate reality before it's too late.

Impact on players and the game

Intense heat during matches raises the risk of heat-related illnesses, with players reporting dizziness, exhaustion and difficulty maintaining performance during high-stress games [1]. At the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the U.S., players struggled with a “brutal heat wave,” leading to complaints even from high-level professionals like Chelsea's Enzo Fernández, who urged organizers to avoid afternoon kickoffs [2].

Medical experts warn that playing high-intensity sports in such heat can be dangerous, particularly when Wet Bulb Globe Temperature — which considers temperature, humidity, wind and sunlight — exceeds 89.6 degrees[3]. Prolonged exposure to heat can also impair cognitive performance, affecting referees' decision-making and potentially the integrity of the game [4].

 

Measures implemented and their challenges

 

Resistance to change

Critics oppose moving the World Cup to winter months for several major reasons:

 

Impact on fans

Fans are also at increased risk of heatstroke, dehydration and other heat-related illnesses[7]. At recent tournaments, local authorities and clubs have issued heat mitigation guidelines for fans, and some matches saw visibly depleted crowds or earlier departures due to oppressive conditions[2].

While most major games still draw large crowds, extreme heat has deterred some fans from attending matches, particularly those played in open stadiums during afternoon hours[2]. Uncomfortably hot conditions hurt the overall fan experience, diminishing enjoyment and potentially leading to financial losses for hosts dependent on ticket and concession sales.

Cole Palmer and his girlfriend Connie Grace have unfollowed each other on Instagram, sparking fresh rumours of a split. 

This development comes hot on the heels of Chelsea's emphatic victory over PSG in the Club World Cup final.

According to reports, the pair, both 23, have severed their social‑media connection, igniting speculation about their relationship's status

Fans were quick to pick up on the lack of mutual follows, but equally telling was Connie's conspicuous absence from Chelsea's title celebrations at the MetLife Stadium.

It is also claimed that Palmer's likes are no longer visible on Connie's Instagram posts.

She is claimed to have initially accompanied Palmer to the U.S. and was present for the final — yet she didn't join the on-field festivities after their triumph. 

Her absence has led many to wonder if tensions began during the tournament itself.

Meanwhile, Palmer touched down in St Kitts and Nevis for a warm summer holiday, where he received a hero's welcome in his paternal grandfather's Caribbean homeland. 

A post shared by Cole Jermaine Palmer (@colepalmer10)

Connie, however, did not accompany him.

However, as at the time of this report, neither Palmer nor Grace have officially confirmed the end of their relationship.

The pair were first spotted together in July 2024 during a holiday in Ibiza following the UEFA European Championships.

Since then, many fans have been drawn by Connie's stylish presence and high–profile appearances next to Palmer.

Palmer, a Wythenshawe native, went public with his romance with Grace at the 2024 GQ Men of the Year Awards.

The pair frequently engaged with each other online — liking posts, and making mutual appearances at football matches. 

 Connie previously opened up about their long-term relationship, revealing that they met when they were both 17.  

Speaking in the Amazon Prime documentary titled ‘England's Lions: A New Generation', the Manchester-based manicurist and influencer spoke candidly about their relationship, describing Palmer as “warm and cuddly” and admitting, “you've got to love him.” 

She said: “We met when we were 17. I think he knew me through mutual friends, so I think he probably had his eye on me. Oh, he's warm and cuddly. Well, with me, hopefully with no one else.”  

But now their relationship, believed to be approximately three years old, seems to have ended.

FIFA have officially announced Chelsea as the 'first ever' Club World Cup champions after their triumph in New Jersey on Sunday night. 

The Blues beat Champions League winners, and favourites for the Club World Cup, Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday night after a Cole Palmer masterclass - the forward scoring two and assisting another. 

It was a shock result, but an emphatic win on the night, with Chelsea now taking home the all-new trophy, as well as a hefty cash prize. 

However, their success has seemingly had an impact beyond that match, with previous Club World Cup winners now known as 'FIFA Intercontinental Champions'. 

As such, though the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona are no longer world champions. 

The competition was first played in 2000 as the Club World Championship, before returning in 2005, and was played annually until 2023, before adopting its current form. 

This summer's competition saw it expanded to 32 teams for the first time, having previously been fought between just six (2020) and eight (2000).

Four English teams had won the Club World Cup prior to Chelsea's second crown on Sunday, though they will now seemingly be recorded as FIFA Intercontinental Champions titles.

FIFA appeared to confirm the news themselves on Sunday night, as they shared a social media photo of Chelsea lifting the trophy with the caption: 'The first ever FIFA CWC Champions.'

While City won the original competition in 2023, Liverpool lifted it in 2019 and United in 2008. Chelsea had also won it previously in 2021.

Real Madrid won it the most times with five - most recently in 2022 - while Barcelona won it four times, and Chelsea, Corinthians, and Bayern Munich twice.

It was a Club World Cup final like no other before it, with President Donald Trump joining Chelsea for the trophy lift. 

Having been given VIP treatment during the match alongside First Lady Melania and FIFA president Gianni Infantino, Trump took centre stage during the trophy presentation.

Trump, who was booed by a section of the crowd, presented Robert Sanchez with the tournament's golden glove award.

Viewers of DAZN's coverage were then able to watch an unlikely exchange, as Infantino introduced Trump to Palmer, as the Chelsea and England star walked up to collect his player of the tournament prize.

Lip reading expert Jeremy Freeman revealed Trump had words of admiration for Palmer, after watching his stunning performance in the final.

'Chelsea's biggest fan. I'm a big fan of you. So well done you,' Trump said, according to Freeman.

Palmer, who has be known to offer few words in post-match interviews, reportedly replied 'Thank you' before rejoining his team-mates.

The 23-year-old's reaction to Trump's decision to remain on stage during Chelsea's trophy presentation, however, has garnered the biggest reaction from fans.

The US President had been given the honour of presenting the trophy to Blues captain Reece James, with the expectation that he would then step aside, as is customary.

Infantino was seen attempting to usher Trump away from Chelsea players, but the US president remained in place, standing either side of James and Sanchez. 

Trump's refusal to leave the stage left Chelsea players bewildered with Palmer appearing to say, 'What's he doing?'.

Speaking post-match, Palmer admitted 'I knew he was going to be here but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy so I was a bit confused, yeah.'

Further light has been shed on Trump's presence in the trophy presentation, with his interactions with Chelsea captain James and goalkeeper Sanchez having been revealed.

While Palmer appeared confused in the background, Freeman revealed James had asked for Trump's permission to lift the trophy.

As Palmer said 'No, no, just wait, wait…wait…wait', James was seen turning to the US President to seek his approval. 

James reportedly said 'I can lift?', with Trump responding 'Oh we can, good!'

According to Freeman, Sanchez had been open to Trump remaining on the stage and being part of the celebrations.

'Please, sir,' the goalkeeper said to Trump, according to Freeman, before asking him 'Want us to lift the trophy next to you?'

With Trump having signalled his approval, Sanchez was seen motioning for James to lift the trophy and kick-start the celebrations.

The Professional Bull Riders organization (PBR) is moving its 2026 World Finals championship back to Fort Worth due to the upcoming FIFA World Cup.

Next year's World Finals championship rounds will take place from May 14-17 at Dickies Arena, the Fort Worth-based PBR announced on Friday. The early rounds, from May 7-10, will be hosted at Cowtown Coliseum in the Stockyards.

For the past two years, the PBR has split the World Finals between Fort Worth's Cowtown Coliseum for the early rounds and Arlington's AT&T Stadium for the championship. 

Now, it will all be in one city next year.

“With the 2026 FIFA World Cup coming to AT&T Stadium, PBR World Finals – Championship will shift to a new home for the season – Dickies Arena,” PBR CEO and commissioner Sean Gleason said in a press release. “We're proud to keep the toughest championship in sports right here in Texas, starting the journey at historic Cowtown Coliseum and culminating with crowning our new World Champion at Dickies Arena — also home to the Fort Worth Rattlers of PBR Teams.”

This is not the first time Fort Worth and Dickies Arena have hosted the PBR World Finals.

In 2022 and 2023, Fort Worth hosted all rounds of the World Finals at both the Cowtown Coliseum and Dickies Arena. The following two years, World Finals events were split between Fort Worth and Arlington.

The PBR's shift back to Fort Worth comes as Arlington gears up to host nine matches in the 2026 FIFA World Cup next summer.

Hosting duties for next year's global soccer event is split between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Matches will be played at over a dozen venues across the three counties starting in June 2026.

Here's a look at when Arlington's AT&T Stadium will host matches next summer:

The annual PBR World Finals sees the best bull riders in the world compete for more than $1 million in prize money.

Pre-sale tickets for Dickies Arena and Cowtown Coliseum events begin on Aug. 18, ahead of the public sale on Aug. 25. Fans can register for first access to tickets on the PBR World Final's website.

In addition, there will also be a slate of free-to-attend programming around the World Finals in Fort Worth.

I wasn't born a cynic, let alone a skeptic. Believing what I was told — especially as delivered through our black-and-white, wait-to-warm-up Zenith — I was fully sold on Mr. Green Jeans' overalls being green, like the Red Sox's new uniforms. 

Covering sports has made me cynical. I even eye the celebrations of Wimbledon victors with a conditioned suspicion. 

Last Saturday, after Iga Swiatek crushed Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in 57 minutes to win her sixth major and first Wimbledon, Swiatek's response after the last point seemed, well, excessive — as if she were putting on a show for photographers, sponsors and all gathered media.

It seemed, as they say over there, that the pudding was overly egged, as if the match's foregone conclusion ended an epic, hard-fought marathon. She threw herself on the ground, face up, fists clenched in dramatic flamboyance — as if she didn't know this match was something of a walkover farce.

The revamped US Open mixed doubles event has certainly divided opinion since its announcement.

Earlier this year it was announced that the US Open would be overhauling mixed doubles to give priority to singles players.

This was clear when the initial lineup was announced, featuring teams including Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, as well as Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro.

The US Open's decision has been criticised by last year's champions amongst many others, and now the WTA doubles world number one has revealed if she thinks she will be able to play the event.

Katerina Siniakova is an 11-time Grand Slam champion in doubles and the current world number one, and has also won two Olympic gold medals, one in women's doubles and her most recent in mixed.

The Czech, who has been ranked as high as world number 27, has just won her first Grand Slam mixed doubles title at Wimbledon alongside Sem Verbeek.

Following her latest major title victory, Siniakova spoke to Tennis Channel where she was asked about the US Open mixed doubles event.

Siniakova explained that she was unsure of whether she would be able to enter the tournament, admitting she would not be surprised to be snubbed from the event.

“I think I would give it a five (out of 10),” Siniakova said when rating her chances of playing. “I mean I wouldn't be surprised if I won't get it actually, so yeah I just keep it like this.”

The US Open mixed doubles event will feature 16 teams this year, with Holger Rune revealing the entry list closed at the end of June.

Despite being unclear of her participation status, Siniakova suggested she could have a partner lined up, but did not want to reveal who that would be.

“Oh I'm going to keep it a secret,” added Siniakova. “I don't want any troubles you know!”

The US Open certainly got the stronger lineup they were hoping for, with all but two of the top 10 singles players on both the ATP and WTA Tours appearing in the initial list.

One of the two missing from this lineup is Coco Gauff, who has explained why she is not playing the event.

Some players including Alcaraz and Raducanu will be making their Grand Slam doubles debut, while defending champions Andrea Vavassori and Sara Errani are the only doubles specialist pair appearing in this lineup.

It remains unclear how much this lineup will change before the US Open mixed doubles event comes around.

The US Open mixed doubles tournament is scheduled to take place on August 19-20.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are the two men to beat on the ATP Tour, and at the moment, they appear to be head and shoulders above everyone else. 

With the last seven Grand Slam titles split between them, Alcaraz and Sinner look set to dominate men's tennis for the foreseeable future. 

In the most recent edition of the rivalry between the two, the Italian emerged victorious to become the first from his country to clinch a Wimbledon singles crown. 

His triumph meant Sinner snapped a five-match losing streak against Alcaraz, which dated back to the China Open in 2023. 

The head-to-head record is now 8-5 in favour of the Spaniard, who also leads his rival 3-2 in Grand Slam events.

Both players are evenly matched at their highest level, but world number 29 Tallon Griekspoor says there are some things the world number two can do that his Wimbledon conqueror simply can't.

On the ‘Changeover Podcast', Griekspoor said: “For me personally, I've always had more chances against Sinner than I had against Alcaraz. I feel like with Sinner, you know what's coming.

“He does it unbelievably well. He's the best player in the world. But at the same time, he doesn't have the net skills and the net game that Alcaraz has.

“He doesn't have the drop shot. He doesn't have the backhand slice. The things he does are unbelievable.

“[Sinner has an] unbelievable level, but I think Alcaraz has a bit more options. And I think why Alcaraz is also a little bit more up and down is because he maybe is not using the right options at the right time.

“But, on the other hand, in trouble, I think Alcaraz can do much more. I think Alcaraz, his peak can be higher than Sinner's peak.

“I just think that Alcaraz has more options. He's more complete than Sinner is. But whatever Sinner does, he's the best in the world at doing that.”

After beating him in the semi-final of the China Open in 2023, Sinner couldn't buy a win against Alcaraz on the tour.

In 2024, he lost to him three times, the first of which came at the Indian Wells Open, where he was overcome in three sets. 

At Roland Garros that year, Alcaraz won their second career bout on clay, beating Sinner in a five-set thriller to advance to the final in Paris. 

The five-time major champion won their last match in 2024 in the final of the China Open to deny his opponent a title defence. 

Alcaraz defeated Sinner in the championship matches of both the Italian Open and the French Open this year before finally losing to him at the All England Club.

2025 hasn't really gone according to Novak Djokovic's plan, but tennis legend Jimmy Connors feels that the veteran has a ace up his sleeve for the upcoming US Open. Connors had a warning for the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, claiming that Djokovic wasn't yet done.

Djokovic has reached three Grand Slam semi-finals this year. He had to retire vs Alexander Zverev in Melbourne, and then lost in the French Open and Wimbledon semi-finals.

Speaking on a podcast, Connors said, “I am not counting him out yet. When you have got guts, you have got guts. And sometimes those guts are going to come out.”

“I got a feeling that as much as he would have liked to have won Wimbledon, that result in the semi, he didn't like that. Losing three straight sets like that. He is not used to that, that's not him, that's not his game. So believe me, the guy can come up with something up his sleeve for the US Open, which might just surprise a lot of people and you know what, I would love to see it,” he added.

2025 is also expected to be Djokovic's swansong year, but after the Wimbledon semi-final, he hinted that he would be back next year.

Meanwhile, Aussie ace Nick Kyrgios, who has a good relationship with Djokovic, feels that he will be retiring soon. “I think he's got to be finished soon,” he said.

“Like, come on, what more? I asked him this at Indian Wells this year. We were in the locker room and I said ‘why are you here? Why are you playing?' He just goes ‘I don't know.'”

Kyrgios also feels that Djokovic will be more inclined to spend time with his family. “I go ‘what about your kids, I know you want to spend time with your family'. He said ‘yeah, I don't know'. That was the first time I think he missed his family a lot,” he said.

“I can't see him playing for more than another year. Not again. Not the whole year again. He is so professional. I am just speaking from my experience if I had a family like his and kid,” he added.

As the summer tennis season reaches its peak, attention is rapidly turning from the grass courts of London to the hard courts of New York. 

Wimbledon have just concluded, crowning their latest champions, Jannik Sinner in the Men's Singles and Iga Swiatek in the Women's Singles, after two weeks of exciting action. 

Now, with the US Open around the corner, starting on August 24th, fans and players alike are setting their sights on the final Grand Slam of the year.

Beyond the prestige and the trophies, a significant motivator for elite athletes is the substantial prize money on offer. Each Grand Slam competes to provide the most lucrative rewards, reflecting their status at the pinnacle of the sport. 

While all four majors offer life-changing sums, the financial stakes often vary; therefore, Tennis Gazette has taken a closer look at which tournament truly offers the biggest paycheque.

To wrap up, while all Grand Slams offer immense financial rewards, the US Open generally stands out as the most lucrative for its singles champions, with a projected $4.3 million payout for 2025. 

Closely following is Wimbledon, offering approximately $3.83 – $4.09 million USD to its winners. The French Open and Australian Open round out the top four, with champion payouts of roughly $2.72 – $2.91 million USD and $2.37 – $2.13 million USD respectively. 

While the prestige of a Grand Slam title is paramount, the significant prize money on offer adds a compelling financial incentive for the world's best tennis players.

Holger Rune is working on strengthening his team after a 2025 season that hasn't lived up to his ambitions

After the trial collaboration between Alexander Zverev and Toni Nadal at the Rafa Nadal Academy, a new duo is stepping into the spotlight this Saturday! As the North American swing is set to begin next week, Holger Rune was spotted training in Washington with Andre Agassi.

According to our information, the American is not yet officially part of the Danish player's team. The two will work together for three days in the United States before deciding what comes next. Andre Agassi is there to bring a fresh perspective to the Rune project, whose main coach remains Lars Christensen, also present in Washington.

A video published by the YouTube channel Open Court shows Holger Rune and Andre Agassi training together.



Holger Rune is currently working on strengthening his team after a first half of the season marked by ups and downs. 

He claimed the fifth title of his career on the clay courts of Barcelona and reached the final of the Indian Wells Masters 1000. However, he has not gone beyond the round of 16 in any Grand Slam and was knocked out in the first round at Wimbledon.

This is the second time in his career that the Danish player, currently ranked No. 8 in the world, will compete at the Washington tournament. He won't have many ATP points to defend during the North American hard-court swing this season. In 2024, he lost in the third round in Montreal, reached the semifinals in Cincinnati, and suffered a first-round exit at the US Open.

Ahead of the semifinals, most were expecting a final showdown between Andrey Rublev and Denis Shapovalov, but Aleksandar Kovacevic has thrown a spanner in the works by beating Rublev in an ATP 250 semfinal for the second time this year (Montpellier) to reach a second career final and have another opportunity for a maiden title. Shapovalov, meanwhile, will be determined to win another title after an up-and-season so far for the Canadian. But who will come out on top?

Head-to-head: first meeting

 While this final won't have the same star quality as Rublev vs Shapovalov, Kovacevic has been playing some great tennis this week and produced a great final in Montpellier (where he came very close to beating Shapovalov's countryman Felix Auger-Aliassime) and will back himself to put in another good performance against Shapovalov.

On paper, this is perhaps the first final in Shapovalov's career where he starts as a very clear favourite, given his much higher ranking and also how well he has been playing so far this week, dropping no sets and only 12 games en route to the final. If he maintains the kind of level he has shown so far this week, there might be little that Kovacevic can do to stop him. That said, the Canadian is known for his inconsistency and Kovacevic has been playing some very good tennis, not least in getting a second career top 10 win in the semifinals here, both against Rublev this year in the semifinals of ATP 250 events.

Just like in Montpelier, he will have to follow up his win over Rublev against a Canadian opponent; he was very close to beating Felix in France and will be hoping to go one better against Shapovalov. With this week's performance, the American has already secured a new career high ranking and a title would really cap off a dream week, but under normal circumstances Shapovalov should be a bit too much for him at this point.

Prediction: Shapovalov in 2

Twenty-nine different men have reached world No 1 on the ATP Rankings since the system was first launched in 1973.

Among them are tennis icons and all-time greats of the sport, but who are the tallest ATP Tour stars to reach the pinnacle of their sport?

Here, using official information from the ATP Tour website, we list the eight tallest men to reach world No 1 in the singles rankings.

Our list starts with reigning world No 1 Sinner, who has now remained at the top of the ATP Rankings since first rising to the top in June 2024.

The Italian is already joint-12th all-time for most weeks as the ATP world No 1, and is the winner of four Grand Slam titles to date.

At 191cm/6'3, Sinner is the joint-third-tallest world No 1 in ATP Rankings history.

The same height as Sinner, Spanish star Moya spent two weeks as the world No 1 in March 1999.

Moya first broke through with a surprise run to the Australian Open final in 1997, before winning his sole Grand Slam singles title at the 1998 French Open.

The Spaniard rose to world No 1 after reaching the 1999 Indian Wells final, and he remains the joint-third-tallest, though he will always be the first ATP world No 1 from his nation.

The first Russian player, male or female, to reach world No 1 in the singles rankings in the Open Era, Kafelnikov was one of the leading stars of the late 1990s.

The Russian triumphed at the 1996 French Open and 1999 Australian Open, and would strike gold at the Olympic Games in 2000.

Kafelnikov, the winner of 26 ATP Tour titles, is another world No 1 who measures 6'3/191cm in height.

One of the leading players of his era, Becker won six Grand Slam singles titles and spent a total of 12 weeks as the world No 1.

Becker won three Wimbledon titles, two Australian Open titles, and a US Open title across his career, and spent two small spells as the world No 1 in 1991.

The German is one of five world No 1's listed as 6'3/191cm, though he was the tallest-ever world No 1 when he first rose to the top in January 1991.

After years of being held off the top spot by his ‘Big 3' rivals, Murray finally surged to world No 1 in November 2016, and held the top ranking for 41 straight weeks.

The Brit was famously a two-time Wimbledon champion, triumphing in 2013 and 2016, though he also prevailed at the US Open in 2012.

So far the only Briton, male or female, to be ranked world No 1 in the Open Era, Murray is another player who is 6'3/191cm tall.

The only Brazilian player to reach world No 1 in the Open Era, Kuerten spent 43 weeks atop the ATP Rankings across three separate spells over 2000 and 2011.

Kuerten is, of course, best remembered for his Roland Garros success, lifting the title in 1997, 2000, and 2001.

The Brazilian is part of a group of six world No 1's listed as 6'3/191cm tall on the ATP Tour website.

The winner of two Grand Slam singles titles, Safin was the second Russian man to reach world No 1 and spent nine weeks atop the ATP Rankings.

Safin is best remembered for winning the 2000 US Open and 2005 Australian Open, with his nine weeks as No 1 spread across two separate spells in 2001.

At 6'4/194cm tall, the Russian is officially the second-tallest world No 1 in ATP Tour history.

Just two centimetres shy of two metres tall, will the ATP Tour ever see another world No 1 as tall as Medvedev?

The Russian has spent 16 weeks of his career as the No 1, across two spells in 2022, and lifted the US Open title in 2021 – alongside a further five runner-up finishes at majors.

Medvedev is listed as 6'6'/198cm tall on the ATP website, making him the tallest man to ever reach the top of the ATP Rankings.

Roger Federer's former coach Ivan Ljubicic has slammed John McEnroe for his "nonsense" claims about Rafael Nadal during the French Open last month. The American tennis icon sparked controversy when he said after Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz's legendary clash that either player could have defeated 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal at his peak on the Paris clay.

As the two new standard bearers for men's tennis, Sinner and Alcaraz did not disappoint, producing an instant classic in the Roland-Garros final. The Spaniard, 22, came from two sets behind and saved three Championship points to claim his second French Open title and fifth major overall in astonishing fashion.

The pair faced off again at Wimbledon earlier this month, where Sinner, 23, avenged his gruelling defeat to Alcaraz to claim his fourth Grand Slam title.

After witnessing what many considered to be one of the all-time great Grand Slam finals, McEnroe said on TNT Sports: “You took a look at them bringing their A-game right now – I'm saying Sinner and Alcaraz against Nadal on clay – you would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favoured to beat Nadal, at his best.

"Do I think they're going to reach 20, 24 titles either one of them? No. Because I think that plateau is so hard it's almost impossible; there's more depth in the game, bigger hitters, and more things happen.

“But these two guys right now, it's like when you watch the NBA and you say nobody could be better than Michael Jordan. The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen.”

Those comments were interpreted by some as disrespectful towards Nadal, who retired last year after clinching an incredible 14 French Open titles. One person who most notably took issue was former tennis player Ljubicic, who coached Nadal's long-time rival Federer between 2016 and 2022.

"It was a very, very, very good final,” the Croatian said. “And the drama was perfect with the match points saved. But people always exaggerate.

“John McEnroe said Nadal wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys. That's nonsense. We haven't seen the best of Alcaraz and Sinner yet. They still have a lot of room for improvement.

"But I don't think they're ahead just yet. I sometimes watch matches from 2005, 2008, 2012, 2015 [between] Roger and Rafa. That was already incredible tennis."

McEnroe has already taken the step to clarify his earlier comments, saying during Alcaraz's Wimbledon quarter-final victory over Cameron Norrie: “I made a comment during the French [Open] where I said these guys [Alcaraz and Sinner] would have a shot… I didn't say they would beat Nadal every time.

“I said the fact that you would think these two players would actually go onto the court really believing they could do it – with Nadal in his prime – it shows you how much the level of the game has changed even in a couple of years.”

Boris Becker has re-emerged to deliver some hard truths to Novak Djokovic about his future.

After all, Wimbledon marked another near-miss for the 38-year-old in his never-ending conquest for a 25th Grand Slam title.

The Serbian's sole remaining mission within the sport is clear, and his continued presence within the sport is centred around it.

However, he faces two stumbling blocks that he seemingly cannot surpass, particularly with Jannik Sinner.

The Italian has won his last five matches against the legendary veteran, and along with Carlos Alcaraz, this duo have won all of the last seven majors.

It's clear why Djokovic is sticking around, but Becker is starting to question it.

Speaking on his podcast with Andrea Petkovic, he began by stating: “That's the big question now, because to win a Grand Slam, he probably has to beat both [Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner].

“That's how it was with Wimbledon, and he said Wimbledon was the tournament where he had his best chance of winning a Grand Slam.

“As a reminder, he has already won the tournament seven times. He's now reached the semifinals of Wimbledon 14 times, just imagine. That's so absurd, it's an insane number.”

However, the German then turned from adulation into advice, continuing: “He also has to realise, yes, he did injure himself a bit on match point against [Flavio] Cobolli, but at 38, you get injured more easily.

“Against [Jannik] Sinner, in the first two sets, I think he was relatively fit. Sinner, of course, was the better player, because for me, Sinner is Djokovic 2.0; he's another version of Djokovic, 15 years younger. Novak knows that, too.

“I'm glad he reached the semifinals; he played a great tournament, but is that enough for him?

“He's still playing tennis because he wants to win 25 Grand Slams, to become the sole record holder.

“But it must be said that on their good days, Sinner and Alcaraz are better than Djokovic is on his good days. That frustrates him, but he's a realist.

“The question is, how realistic are the chances he'll win another Grand Slam now, because time is running out for him?”

It seems strange that people are questioning the decision for Djokovic to keep playing tennis, when this year he has reached the semi-finals of all three Grand Slams.

For most on tour, that would represent their best-ever season. For the 24-time Grand Slam winner, it is not enough.

But, if he remains ever-present and continues to reach these latter stages, he at least puts himself in contention.

Eventually, one of Alcaraz or Sinner will have to fall early, giving him the opportunity to claim that elusive 25th title whilst only having to play one of them.

At Wimbledon, had Djokovic beaten the eventual champion, the Spaniard would have awaited him in the final. He had lost the last two finals to him, and so to overcome both of them in one event would've been near-impossible.

He needs a little luck, but if he keeps himself present, he gives himself a chance. He'll likely continue doing this either until he gets that slice of luck or his body no longer lets him. Regardless, a figure as legendary as he has earned that right.

LOS CABOS - Canada's Denis Shapovalov has a chance to win his second ATP title this year.

Shapovalov reached the Mifel Tennis Open final with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Australia's Adam Walton at the ATP 250 event Friday.

"It definitely helps my confidence, it helps my belief a little bit," Shapovalov told reporters after the match. "I came into the tournament not trying to focus on results too much, just trying to focus on getting back to my game offensively, trying to go for it.

"It's paying off."

The third-seeded Shapovalov hit seven aces and saved four break points while converting all four of his break-point opportunities.

He needed one hour six minutes to win the match over Walton, the tournament's eighth seed.

The 26-year-old from Richmond Hill, Ont., won the Dallas Open in February. The former world No. 10 has won three career ATP titles.

Shapovalov will face the winner of a semifinal matchup between top seed Andrey Rublev of Russia and seventh seed Aleksandar Kovacevic of the United States in the final.

Dubai: Three years after lifting the US Open girls' singles trophy, Alex Eala is set to return to New York — this time as a history-making Filipina making her main draw debut in the women's singles at the final Grand Slam of the year.

Eala, now ranked No 56 in the WTA Rankings, has been included in the official entry list for the US Open, scheduled from August 24 to September 7. It marks the 20-year-old's third Grand Slam appearance of the season following her campaigns at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

But this trip to Flushing Meadows holds extra meaning. In 2022, a then 17-year-old Eala captured the junior title in emphatic fashion, becoming the first Filipino to win a Grand Slam singles trophy. And this year, she returns not as a promising junior, but as a fully fledged professional — and the first Filipina to ever contest a main draw match at the US Open.

The milestone comes at the end of a breakthrough season that has seen Eala firmly establish herself on the WTA Tour. Her run to the fourth round of the Miami Open back in March helped her break into the world's top 100 for the first time. She followed it up with her maiden WTA final appearance at Eastbourne and main draw entries at two Grand Slams.

Alongside her rise in the rankings has come significant financial reward. So far in 2025, Eala has earned approximately $591,592 (around P33.8 million) in prize money, putting her 53rd among all players on the WTA earnings list this year. That total includes her $88,468 (approx. P5.1 million) payout from Wimbledon, where she fell to defending champion Barbora Krejcikova in the first round after a spirited start.

Her Wimbledon showing also pushed her career earnings past the $1 million mark — a landmark feat for any young tennis professional, and a sign of her growing stature on tour.

Eala's US Open debut won't come in isolation. The product of the Rafael Nadal Tennis Academy is gearing up for a busy hard-court swing in North America, with entries in two high-profile WTA 1000 events — the National Bank Open in Montreal (July 26 — August 7) and the Cincinnati Open (August 5—18). Both tournaments will be first-time appearances for Eala, who now qualifies directly for main draws thanks to her ranking.

In both events, she will rub shoulders with the biggest stars of the sport — including world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, French Open champion Coco Gauff, Wimbledon winner Iga Swiatek, and Australian Open champion Madison Keys.

From a junior dream in New York to a million-dollar career on the professional circuit, Eala's story is still unfolding. But with history already made and more firsts in sight, the Filipina ace heads into the US Open with growing belief — and a nation behind her.

She gives viewers a tour of the house that she and her team rented in Wimbledon village and takes them with her for a launch event for her new brand deal with the David Beckham-backed IM8 health supplements. She also goes behind-the-scenes of her viral pre-tournament practice session with Novak Djokovic, where a friendly wager resulted in Sabalenka dishing out a custom acai bowl for the 24-time Grand Slam singles champion.Read more: Mixed madness!

Iga Swiatek, Wimbledon champion, received a special LEGO model of a giant strawberry, as a gift from her corporate partner, LEGO. Swiatek loves to build LEGO models as an off-court hobby.

We're gonna need a bigger bowl! Iga Swiatek arrived home after winning Wimbledon to a special keepsake to commemorate a historic victory as SW19: a LEGO model of a giant strawberry.

The model of Wimbledon's most famous snack (and Swiatek's favorite pasta topping) was a gift to the 24-year-old by the toy company, for whom she has been an ambassador in Poland for the last year. In her time at the top of the game, Swiatek has confessed to enjoying building LEGO models away from the court, and credits the creative outlet helping to keep her mind sharp on the tennis court.

“I like the process so much as it helps me to clam, focus on here and now, just be in the moment when I need it, for instance when I'm waiting for hours for my matches,” she told Forbes last year.

 “I like what the process does, it helps me be grounded, concentrated and calm.”

Her newest model, made of 3,000 LEGO bricks, also features a miniature figurine of Swiatek holding a bowl of strawberries and cream, and two tiny tennis racquets.

"[This] will remind me how important the small pleasures and joys in life are," she wrote when revealing her present on Instagram.

The big berry adds to a menagerie of custom LEGO sets that Swiatek has been gifted by the brand for career milestones.

Last year, after winning her fourth Roland Garros crown and to celebrate her 23rd birthday, she received a model of Court Philippe-Chatrier complete with an attached "Iga's Bakery" -- inspired by a Parisian bakery  -- that weighed 26 pounds. Present were mini figurines of herself, her team, her cat Grappa, and other Easter eggs like the cast of "Friends" -- her favorite show -- and soccer star Robert Lewandowski sitting in the stands.

She was also once gifted a model of her Tecnifibre racquet made entirely of LEGO. 

"I appreciate Lego's team creativity a lot," Swiatek says. "It's a whole new level of what people's imagination can do.”

As Jack McBrayer returns for season two of HGTV's runaway hit “Zillow Gone Wild” on July 18, 2025, the comedic actor and zany host has revealed that when the network asked him to star on the show, he had one adorable condition: he didn't want to make fun of anybody's wild and crazy house. 

“I was like, ‘Hey, I'm not the comedian who's like, you know, snarky or going to tear you down or or embarrass you or anything,'” he recalled telling HGTV during an interview with Too Fab. “And they're like, ‘Perfect. We want this to be positive and exploratory and celebratory.”

But they also had one rule for him: no peeking ahead of time. 

The first season of “Zillow Gone Wild” premiered in May 2024, hosted by McBrayer, who rose to fame on the hit NBC sitcom “30 Rock.” The show is inspired by the hugely popular “Zillow Gone Wild” Instagram account, which features some of the weirdest and wildest homes on the market for its nearly two million followers. 

McBrayer goes into each house sight unseen and is often blown away, giddy as a schoolkid, about what he finds — and is genuinely interested in what made the homeowner buy or transform their house to be so unique. He told TooFab he realizes he may come across as a “living cartoon character.”

“I'm not going to lie, I know people, like, roll their eyes and think I'm just like saccharine sweet,” McBrayer told TooFab, “but my whole thing is like, it doesn't feel good to me to wake up angry. It doesn't feel good to me to make anyone else feel bad. And one thing I loved about stepping into improvisation as, you know, like my career, inherently it is all about teamwork and collaboration — an ensemble. Taking care of your partner, making your partner look better than you. I like that.” 

Just like the houses and people he showcases on “Zillow Gone Wild,” he loves to highlight and celebrate his friends who are doing cool things. 

“I'm just at an age and a stage in my career (where) I don't need attention,” McBrayer told Too Fab. “I don't need that stuff. It's fun for me to root for my buddies. It's fun for me to celebrate anyone with a passion, anyone with direction and motivation. Like, let's see more of that. Let's do for it. Go for it. Go be the best version of that that you can do. That feels good to me.”

“I kind of like just having the curiosity of a kid going into these houses,” he told Too Fab. “And I mean, sometimes you can't help it. You're like, ‘Oh, dude, you slide in your house!' Or you know, like, ‘Whoa, everything is pink!'” 

McBrayer can authentically react on-camera to each odd house he sees because he has no idea what he's walking into. Before the show aired in 2024, he told the New York Post, “My only assignment was to not look at the Instagram page, because they wanted me to see (each house) and catch that reaction on camera. So, if someone gives you an assignment of ‘No homework,' you say yes!” 

The comedian told Too Fab that the same rule was in place for season two, explaining, “The producers are pretty insistent that I do not do any homework because they want to capture those reactions live on camera, which is super great. I really do just like being surprised, too. So, I kind of enjoy that part of it.”

“Zillow Gone Wild” season two premieres on July 18 at 9:30 p.m. Eastern time, and will air each Friday night at the same time.

In 2022, as the Pamela Anderson renaissance was in its infancy, the former “Baywatch” star dipped her toe into live performance. Well, toe-dip is an understatement. She jumped right into the water, starring as Roxie Hart in the Broadway production of “Chicago.” As that song-and-dance performance earned raves, it comes as no surprise that Anderson is now showing off her vocal chops once again — this time with what is sure to be a memorable jazz scat number in “The Naked Gun,” out August 1 in theaters.

“I was like, ‘How am I going to remember this?' It's an absolutely nutty scat solo,” Anderson told Entertainment Weekly. “But I did, and I sing it all the time, just walking around the house. I can't get it out of my head.”

The song has an appropriately “Naked Gun” title, “Sassafras Chicken in D,” and it was written by Elizabeth Gillies and Joel McNeely. The film‘s director Akiva Schaffer explained that the tune is “all Pam,” and that she performed it live to a pre-recorded track every take (the final cut blends live and pre-recorded performance). “She performed it like a musical number,” Schaffer said.

 










While Anderson admits that it took “courage” to do the scat, she said her “happy place” is when she is “terrified.”

“I actually really enjoy singing. I love being on stage… The feeling is so rewarding because I feel like we repress so much of ourselves, and especially as an artist, and I love to write and journal and write poetry, but performing and working on a movie is another way to express yourself because everything is loaded,” she said. “All the words to that song, I'm thinking of personal experiences in my life, and so I'm able to get it out even in a crazy scene like that. So it's not just spitting out the words, it's performing some of your innermost thoughts.”

Co-star Danny Huston — who owns the club Anderson's character sings in… and all of this is part of a plot to distract him as Liam Neeson's Frank Drebin Jr. does some super secret detective work — said he was “spellbound” by Anderson.

“I was sitting at this table in this restaurant club and had the joy to see her perform time and time and time again….I was all a tizzy,” he said.

“The Naked Gun” arrives just months after Anderson scored her first Golden Globe and SAG nominations  for her performance in “The Last Showgirl.” Last year, Anderson spoke with IndieWire about her resurgence as a full fledged movie star.

 










“I took a quite the unorthodox route to get here,” Anderson said. “I know I kind of did it backwards. This is just the beginning of my career, instead of the end.”

“The Naked Gun” is in theaters everywhere August 1. Watch the trailer below.

	As summer at the box office heats up, MCU fans are sharing their first reactions to The Fantastic Four: First Steps.


	Following first screenings for the debut entry in Marvel Studios‘ Phase 6, which hits theaters July 24, audiences have praised the visual artistry, impeccable writing and performances from Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Julia Garner.


	On X, one fan called it “Quite possibly the best Marvel Studios film ever released. Absolutely loaded with talent and standout performances from Vanessa Kirby and Joseph Quinn. If you thought the MCU died with Endgame, think again. Thoughtfully crafted and easily a genre-defining classic.”

	Several fans praised the VFX of the movie, including the design of Julia Garner‘s Galactus. “#FantasticFour First Steps is visually one of the best things Marvel has ever made. Parts feel like Interstellar & demand IMAX,” wrote another fan. “Galactus is awesome. Silver Surfer looks really, really good. VFX were often immaculate. Cosmically and on Earth, Matt Shakman dropped a visual feast.”


	Others also noted their appreciation for the film's social and political commentary. “#FantasticFour is a triumph. A pitch-perfect script backed by great performances — particularly from Pedro Pascal — turns what could be a simple superhero movie into a sharp commentary on our society that makes its nuance palatable for those that may not take it at face value,” one person posted.

	Following James Gunn's DCU launch with Superman‘s $220 million opening weekend, Matt Shakman‘s The Fantastic Four: First Steps is tracking for a $100-110M opening. It's a needed win for Marvel Studios after several box office upsets in recent years.

Katy Perry had a near-disastrous moment at her San Francisco concert Friday as the singer's giant butterfly prop plunged several feet while the singer was riding on it.


	One of the set pieces of the Lifetimes Tour features Perry saddled atop the butterfly prop as it floats above the audience during her performance of “Roar.” However, at the Chase Center on Friday, the prop suffered a brief malfunction and suddenly descended several feet mid-flight, startling Perry and likely the crowd below her:

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)


	After the initial scare, Perry calmly collected herself and — once the butterfly steadied — jumped back into “Roar.” The rest of the performance continued incident-free.


	Perry later joked about the near-disaster on Instagram, sharing a screen-grab of a close-up of her face the exact moment the butterfly dropped. “Goodnight San Fran,” she quipped.

	The “Roar” incident marks the second time this summer that a floating concert prop nearly put the artist and the audience at risk: In late June, Beyonce faced a similar situation when her flying car tilted and stalled above a Houston crowd during “16 Carriages,” causing a brief delay (and the song's temporary removal from the Cowboy Carter Tour set list, until the car was replaced with a horse).

	











	As People notes, Perry endured a previous stage malfunction during the tour's Australian leg when a flying sphere she rides in began tilting mid-performance, forcing her to cling to the cables connected to the sphere.

SPOILERS: This post contains details about I Know What You Did Last Summer (2025)


	As I Know What You Did Last Summer slashes its way into a new generation, Jennifer Kaytin Robinson‘s requel has plenty of surprises in store for fans of the OG.


	The latest horror franchise to come back from the dead, amid the likes of Halloween and Scream, the followup to the 1997 slasher flick and its '98 sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer takes some big swings with its killer reveal, as well as some top-secret cameos that longtime fans will appreciate.


	With Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprising their roles from the previous two films as survivors and high school sweethearts Julie James and Ray Bronson, nostalgia was inevitably going to be a major factor in this new installment, which also boasts a young cast of new potential victims (and suspects), including Chase Sui Wonders, Madelyn Cline, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers and Sarah Pidgeon.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	In addition to several Easter eggs—including a freight elevator, a parade float, a steamy gym locker room and a Scooby Doo reference—the sequel keeps longtime fans hooked with a few massive twists.


	Read on for some major SPOILERS about I Know What You Did Last Summer (2025).


	“I am dead,” Sarah Michelle Gellar previously offered as a response to whether she'd reprise her role from the OG as Helen Shivers, following her family's set visit in Australia with husband and former co-star Prinze.

	











	A close friend of the director, it turns out Gellar was just playing coy about the fact that she makes a digitally de-aged cameo as Helen's snarky ghost in a dream sequence of the guilt-laden Danica Richards (Cline), a fellow former Croaker Queen. Her cameo follows some heavy references to the doomed beauty queen, including a visit to what was once Shivers Department Store.


	The moment earned a passionate response from the audience at the movie's world premiere this week in Los Angeles, and it's sure to have the same impact in theaters on opening weekend, ahead of Gellar's highly-anticipated return to Buffy the Vampire Slayer.


	Stick around for the credits, as a stinger brings back another survivor of the franchise, Brandy Norwood‘s Karla Wilson from the '98 Bahamian-set sequel, a cameo Robinson also teased.


	Reacting to the news of another vengeful massacre in Southport, North Carolina, Karla receives a menacing knock at the door. Could it be… Nick Fury? No, it's Julie warning her with another letter she received, along with a throwback photo of them, featuring a red X over Karla's face.


	With a couple of new ‘final girls' joining the franchise, Julie and Karla seem poised to team up against the remaining killer for another potential installment. 


	Following a pretty similar plot and format as writer Kevin Williamson and director Jim Gillespie's feature adaptation of Lois Duncan's 1973 novel, Robinson and co-writer Sam Lansky took a big swing with the reveal of their requel's killer, one that no other horror franchise has taken, at least in recent memory.


	Avenging the death of her spiritual peer and sober buddy, Pidgeon's Stevie Ward reveals in her big menacing monologue that she decided to take revenge on the group of former friends who covered up his death, after previously deserting her during her darkest days.


	What first seems heartbreaking for Ray, who is established as Stevie's employer and father figure, soon turns out to be an even more shocking reveal. Coming face to face with Julie, he confesses to guiding Stevie's murderous impulses to take revenge on the gentrified town that erased the trauma he endured (and for which he has apparently never sought help) nearly 30 years before.


	With Julie and Wonders' Ava Brooks defeating Ray, his homicidal protege is still out there and ready to take revenge in another installment.

If you've seen “Eddington,” you know the scene. Mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal) is hosting a barbecue for his supporters at his New Mexico home when his nemesis and re-election opponent, Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix), arrives to disrupt the event. Katy Perry's 2010 hit “Firework” is blasting as Cross struts toward Garcia to demand he turn it down, leading to a stand-off.

On this week's episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, writer/director Ari Aster broke down the scene that is sure to become one of his most memorable.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“The truth is, that wasn't the first song we tried,” said Aster. “We tried to get ‘Empire State of Mind,' the Jay-Z, Alicia Keys [track].”

On the podcast, Aster discussed how, in casting Pascal, he wanted to play into and off of just how beloved “the internet's daddy” had become to the audience. With Mayor Ted, Aster created a charming, but hypocritical progressive politician who campaigns on bringing the small western town into the economic and tech future, but is ultimately just selling it out to an Amazon-Google-like tech giant (the fictional solidgoldmagikarp corporation) that wants to build an enormous, energy-sucking data center in the Eddington desert. “Empire State of Mind” played perfectly for Aster's dark humor.

 










“That was, for me, the funniest thing in the world, was this party, in this tiny town in New Mexico, and just this New York anthem playing. It just felt like what Pedro Pascal‘s character would absolutely have been playing at that party,” said Aster. “It was so funny to me, nothing made me laugh harder than that.”

In addition to the humor, Aster fell in love with the way the scene worked when set to the NYC anthem, but the “Eddington” team was never able to secure the rights.

“I think [Jay-Z] was distracted at the moment, and didn't have a chance to actually watch the film,” said Aster. “ Then it became, ‘Okay, so what do we use?' And we went through hundreds of songs.”

Prior to the scene, Cross had publicly accused Garcia of sexually assaulting his wife Louise (Emma Stone), and comes to the party ready to throw his weight around, but on his walk toward the confrontation, he sees an interview clip of Louise declaring him a liar.

Shot in a long, continuous camera following Phoenix, the rollercoaster of emotions his character experiences on his anger-fueled walk down the long outdoor porch to confront Garcia, and the humiliating retreat back to his truck – after getting slapped and the music being cranked even louder — is embodied in the use of the Perry track. Aster discussed how sound and score were used to capture Cross's world unraveling in the second half of the film. While “Firework” could replace the cultural and humor aspects brought by “Empire State of Mind,” Aster discovered he could mix it into his film in a way that marked another sonic beat in his protagonist's descent.

 










“I wanted a song that kind of represented the culture, and have the culture like pounding in your ear. There's a great bass to [‘Firework'], and when you push the bass, it's really queasy-making. It was very exciting to land on that,” said Aster.

A24's “Eddington” is now in theaters.

My goodness, Katy Perry pulled a Beyoncé! Remember when Queen Bey had that terrifying moment on her Cowboy Carter tour in Houston? During her “16 Carriages” performance, she was riding a red aerial car that tilted a bit too far to the left. 

Basically, the machine froze mid-air, and Beyoncé, ever the pro as she always is, reassured fans by joking, “If ever I fall, I know y'all call me.” This after the whole ordeal had occurred, and she was probably hyperventilating inside, of course. Still, iconic behavior if you ask us! 

Well, now it's Perry's turn, who tore a page right out of her book.

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

The “Roar” singer gave fans quite a scare on July 18 during her performance at the Chase Center in San Francisco. While singing her hit “Eye of the Tiger,” Perry took flight over the crowd on a massive butterfly prop. It was supposed to be a magical moment for everyone, until it wasn't.

Mid-performance, the butterfly suddenly dropped several inches, throwing Perry off balance. Fans could see the panic on her face as she clung on, yelling to the crowd, “Sing it now. Sing it!” Her voice broke off as the prop malfunctioned in real-time, which quickly caused a wave of gasps throughout the arena.

For a second, it looked like the entire setup might collapse, which even gave US a fright, despite it already having happened and it only being a video. But thankfully, the safety wires caught just in time. Still visibly shaken, Katy glanced at the crowd as if she was yelling, “Did you just see that?” The stunned audience responded with a mix of shocked silence and loud cheering as she regained her composure and continued singing.

Later that night, Perry took to Instagram to poke fun at the situation. She posted a candid screenshot of herself mid-scream with the caption, “Goodnight San Fran,” on her Instagram Stories. Classic Perry!

According to Page Six, a source confirmed she only sustained a minor bump and was otherwise fine. “She paused slightly but then kept singing, almost never missing a beat,” the insider shared.

The show marked one of the biggest stops on her Lifetime's North America Run, a tour that's already been making headlines for its chaotic and unpredictable stage elements. We're talking astronauts, sharks, lightsabers, yes, basically a fever dream in concert form. But let's be real, that's peak Perry. Over-the-top is her brand, and we kind of love her for it!

Perry has been having a few hard days after her longtime partner Orlando Bloom recently announced their separation. The pair began dating in 2016, on and off, and share a 4-year-old daughter, Daisy. While their romantic chapter has ended, both emphasized their commitment to co-parenting amicably and keeping Daisy their top priority.

Carrie Underwood has achieved stratospheric success since winning “American Idol,” but she still wants to check off some career bucket list items. Underwood shares her top three career highlights and says Guns N' Roses tops her dream tour list.

A post shared by SiriusXM (@siriusxm)

During a July 2025 interview with SiriusXM's Cody Alan, Underwood named “winning ‘American Idol'” as the top of her list of career moments. The singer's season 4 win launched her career, so it's not surprising that's her number 1 pick.

The country star said “becoming a Grand Ole Opry member” was next, and rounded out her top 3 with “being at Stagecoach [Festival] and getting to call Axl Rose out on stage.”

“It was something that I had been hoping for forever,” Underwood added.

The “American Idol” alum is a loyal GN'R fan who also opened for the band several times in 2023.

When asked who is on her bucket list to record with, she said, “I've gotten to sing with them, but I would love to record something with Guns N' Roses. That would be really cool.”

She was also asked, “If you could go on tour with one band, who would that be?” Underwood answered with a grin, “Who do you think?”

A post shared by Carrie Underwood (@carrieunderwood)

In a 2022 interview with Rolling Stone, Underwood shared what it was like to share the stage with Axl Rose to sing “Paradise City” and “Sweet Child o' Mine” at Stagecoach.

“I've been covering Guns N' Roses my whole life, pretty much, and definitely onstage for the past 15 years at least,” Underwood said at the time. 

She continued, “I had asked before if he would ever come sing, or if I could come to him somewhere. We had a couple almost maybes, where it almost maybe would have happened but for various reasons it wasn't the right time.”

Underwood sent Rose an email explaining “the why and what he meant to me” ahead of Stagecoach.

She explained, “The way I learned how to sing was I would pick really hard vocalists to try to emulate, and [Rose's] voice always mesmerized me. I was like, ‘How is he doing the things that he's doing?' So I told him all that … and he came!”

Underwood added, “We had rehearsals and everything went very smoothly. It was easy for all of us to be around each other. Hopefully, he had a good time.”

In May 2023, Underwood told Howard Stern, “I've been a fan [of GN'R] since almost birth.”

Of Rose, she noted, “His voice is something that just cut through the air to me … he didn't sound like everybody else and sometimes it wasn't pretty [because] that's not what the song was meant for. He was willing to, you know, get into the song and do what the song needed.”

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SATURDAY AM: DC Studios and Warner Bros' Superman is coursing to a second weekend of $57M, with a chance for upside. That's an ease of -54%, a second weekend percentile decline on par with Deadpool & Wolverine, and better than the second weekend superhero holds we've seen YTD, Thunderbolts (-56%) and Captain America: Brave New World (-68%).


	Word of mouth remains excellent with continued Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak polling showing a high definite recommend at 74%, with parents at 70% and kids under 12 at 65%. Warners is having a great weekend overall, the fourth weekend of Apple Original Films' F1 is only down -23%.

	











	Overall weekend for all titles before Marvel Studios' The Fantastic Four: First Steps gives the summer box office another $100M+ bump is $135.2M, which is -9% off from a year ago when Twisters opened to $81.2M.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The new stuff isn't really impressive. Paramount Animation's Smurfs is coming in at $12M, which is better than expected (there was a fear the blue guys and gal would get crushed in the high single digits). Again, it's an international and consumer products play. No one was going into this thinking they were going to re-invent the wheel and soar these grosses into some rebooted stratosphere. It's a very old property (gosh, 1980s?) sans the coolness of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The first movie in pre-streaming 2011 opened to $35.6M (and finaled at north of $142M+) — because at that time there had never been a Smurfs movie before. The movie cost a net $58M before P&A. The Rihanna-starring Smurfs gets a B+, which is the lowest CinemaScore in the series of four films to date. The previous one, The Lost Village, received the franchise's only A grade.

	











	There's a big reach on social with Smurfs at 309M across Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube with “Rihanna fully activated and cross-promoting her beauty brand, feeding 420M fans and pumping materials along with Nick Offerman at 3.4M fans with other cast not activated.” Rihanna has also been a trooper showing up to do extensive press at the pic's Belgian premiere and LA fan event.


	Definite recommend at 50% isn't a rush. Per Comscore/Screen Engine's PostTrak, 59% of the audience are parents with a child and mostly moms at 73%. Younger-skewing property for kids, as we told you and PostTrak shows that with 68% under 9 years old (47% between 7-9). Mostly girls here at 61%. Female leaning at 61%. Under 35 is 69%. Kids under 12 gave the movie an 80% positive, with a low 44% must-see right away. Grosses are evenly spread throughout the country but best in East, South and South Central. AMC MJ Harlem is the leading cinema stateside with close to $19K.


	Diversity demos are 47% Caucasian, 29% Latino and Hispanic, 13% Black, and 4% Asian American. 


	Despite any heralding of profit by Sony on I Know What You Did Last Summer with a net production cost of $18M, $13M-$14M opening isn't a win. It doesn't indicate any kind of revived interest in this '90s fave property. Some rivals are betting the movie comes in lower, like $12M, but the reboot 27 years later after its previous sequel is bound for the lowest opening in the theatrical pic franchise. That's not the grand B.O. plan when it comes to reviving these classic horror IPs. Sony was richer in their reboot of 28 Years Later debuting to $30M, and with a current running total of $68.7M. Snarked one film finance source about Summer, “It didn't feel like there was any stickiness in the marketing materials.”  Overall social media universe reach was 196.8M, which was even below Sinners‘ 222M and under the original M3GAN‘s 330M reach. In regards to CinemaScore, I Know What You Did Last Summer gets a C+, the lowest in the series next to the 1997 original's B-, and the 1998 sequel's B. Sure, a sequel can be pulled off at a low cost, but with a depreciating scale of grosses. 


	Says social media monitor RelishMix, “negative chatter on the new I Know What You Did Last Summer is filled with critiques and doubts. Since this feature-length revival comes not even four years after the television adaptation of the franchise, some are quick to judge its quality: ‘Looks like the TV series, which was awful,' and ‘This looks like a straight to streaming movie. It does not look like it was meant for the theater. It reminds me of the Scream TV show that aired on MTV.' Even the return of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. falls short of satisfying fans, ‘Bringing back aged old casts feels cliché. I just knew they would do this. Another movie that no one asked for. Original version always is better.'” 


	Low definite recommend on Summer at 43%. 50/50 male to female showed up. Demo breakdown is men over 25 (36%), female over 25 (30%), female under 25 (20%), and men under 25 (14%). Sixty-one percent 18-34 turnout. Even cash flow across the country, but South is the best. AMC Grove in LA is the highest cinema for the pic with just over $22K. Few PLFs on Summer since they're staying with the Man of Steel. 


	Ari Aster's Eddington gets a C+, which is the same grade as the director's Midsommar. Definite recommend on PostTrak is 39%. Aster loves being divisive. The opening now is at an estimated $4.8M after a first day/previews of $1.88M. Midsommar, a genre movie, posted a 3-day of $6.5M in what was a $10.9M 5-day start. Hereditary with a D+ CinemaScore remains Aster's best opening at $13.5M. The wow here given Eddington‘s mash-up of two genres –70s Altman comedy and Rambo— is that it's guns-a-blazing ahead of Aster and Joaquin Phoenix's previous partnership, Beau Is Afraid which died with a $2.66M semi-wide break at 965 theaters, and $8.1M domestic gross. Seriously, coming away from the pic's premiere at Cannes, the sentiment felt Eddington was destined for the B.O. nightmares of Beau Is Afraid (that VFX filled movie carried at net production cost of $35M; we've heard gross is as high as $50M). The movie is playing on the coasts, which is no surprise, with AMC Burbank the highest grossing venue for the movie with just over $21K. Demo breakdown is men over 25 (46%), women over 25 (27%), men under 25 (15%) and women under 25 (11%). 18-34 turnout is 60%. Who loves this movie? Per PostTrak 13-17 year olds (2% turnout, 80% grade) and 35-44 year olds (44% showed up, 79% positive grade). Diversity demos are 61% Caucasian, 18% Latino and Hispanic, 8% Black, and 8% Asian American.

	10. 28 Years Later (Sony) 1,219 (-989) theaters, Fri $400K (-52%) 3-day $1.36M (-51%), Total $68.7M/Wk 5


FRIDAY PM: Not a gangbusters weekend, but solid enough to make exhibition content. Warner Bros/DC Studios' Superman is looking at $16M, -71%, in its second Friday, for what's looking to be a $55M second weekend at 4,275 theaters, for a decline on the high-end that's in the -56% realm. Worldwide all in by Sunday is looking like $400M. 


	Matt Reeves' The Batman fell -50% in weekend 2 for a $66.5M take, while James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 eased -56% for a $65.2M second weekend. On the high side, Superman will stand at $232.7M by Sunday end of day. 


	Standing strong above the new stuff in second is Universal's third weekend of Jurassic World Rebirth with $21.5M at 3,854. The Gareth Edwards directed movie dips -47% with a running cume by Sunday of $274.2M. 


	Columbia Pictures and Screen Gems I Know What You Did Last Summer is seeing just under $6M today for what's hoped to be a $13M-$15M opening at 3,206 sites. Rivals believe it's in a fight for third with Paramount Animation's Smurfs which is seeing $4M today at 3,504 locations, and a $12M 3-day. The last one under Sony, 2017's Smurfs: The Lost Village opened to $13.2M. Smurfs is a much younger skewing movie among kids under 12. The IP always does better abroad, and the upside for those studios getting involved with the property is the share of the merchandise revs.  Paramount Global is handling the consumer products licensing for the Smurfs in most international territories including North America. 


I Know What You Did Last Summer 1 back in 1997 opened to $15.8M, while party 2 in 1998 debuted to $16.5M. That's unadjusted for inflation. 


	Apple Original Films' F1 is seeing a fourth Friday of $2.6M at 3,094 theaters, and 3-day of $9.4M, -28%, for a running cume of $153.4M. 


	A24's Eddington at 2,111 sites is looking at $1.9M today and $4.5M for the weekend. That's under what another Cannes premiere, Wes Anderson's Phoenician Scheme, did in its wide break at 1,678, $6.2M at 1,678. Eddington cost $25M net shot with New Mexico tax credits, which is under the reported $30M that Focus Features shelled out for Phoenician Scheme. 


FRIDAY AM: Columbia Pictures and Screen Gems' reboot of I Know What You Did Last Summer banked $2.2 million in previews from showtimes that began at 2 p.m. Thursday, while A24's Ari Aster socio-political Western Eddington did $625,000.


	Neither film, nor Paramount Animation's Smurfs, is expected to over swell with Warner Bros/DC Studios' Superman still a fortress atop the box office chart with an expected second weekend of $55M-$60M, after the James Gunn movie ended its first week with $177.7M. Superman is pacing ahead of the first week of Matt Reeves' The Batman by 3% ($172.5M, final domestic $369.3M), 16% ahead of Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($152.7M first week, $359M final domestic) and 3% behind the first week of GOTG Vol. 2 ($183.1M, final domestic $389.3M).

	











I Know What You Did Last Summer is eyeing around $13M+, while Smurfs is anywhere in the high single digits to low teens. Eddington is expected to land in the under-$5M range.


	The Jennifer Kaytin Robinson-directed I Know What You Did Last Summer counts previews that are higher than Blumhouse/Universal's Wolf Man ($1.4M previews, $10.8M opening) from earlier this year, and 62% less than Sony's reboot of 28 Years Later ($5.8M previews, $30M opening). Critics have settled at 38% Rotten on I Know What You Did Last Summer while the Rotten Tomatoes audience meter is at 69%. That latter score is the best in franchise, ahead of the original 1997 installment at 41% and the 1998 sequel at 29%.


	The 1997 movie, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and the late Anne Heche, opened to $15.8M and legged out to $72.5M domestic, $125.5M worldwide. The 1998 sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer debuted to $16.5M and ended its run at $40M. The movies made $165M combined. The third movie, I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer starring Brooke Nevin, went direct to home video in 2006. The new installment features the return of Hewitt and Prinze Jr alongside newcomers Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers, Sarah Pidgeon and Gabbriette Bechtel.


Eddington‘s critical score stands at 66%, which is under the 90% certified fresh of Aster's horror opus Hereditary, and his Swedish solstice genre pic run amok Midsommar (83% certified fresh), and 2 points under his trippy Joaquin Phoenix pic Beau Is Afraid (68% fresh).


Smurfs didn't hold previews last night.

Captain America 4, Thunderbolts and Fantastic Four combined might not even beat the total that Deadpool & Wolverine got by itself just last summer.

At the most, those 3 movies combined will make about $1.3 billion in theaters this year, compared to the $1.338 billion that Deadpool & Wolverine made.

And while Superman will end up higher than all 3 of the Marvel movies this year with about $600 million total, it is still a flop in theaters because of its budget and marketing.

4 superhero flops in one year is an absolute disaster!

Why Spider-Man and Batman movies have great appeal both in US and overseas while Superman just in the US?

Fantastic Four the First Family lol

Oy. As noted, this week now decently behind last year. Next week will continue. Even if FF is strong, it'll be nowhere close to Deadpool. Puts a lot of pressure on Bad Guys, Naked Gun, Freakier Friday and Weapons. Possible some of those perform well. Also possible…not. And that's just to keep pace with It Ends With Us and Alien: Romulus. Late August looks even more atrocious than last year unless those early ones overperforms and hold. A strong May boost met with a meh June…I'll be curious where the summer to summer comps end up after what was supposed to be the “best slate of summer releases” in years. I'm hopeful for some of those named above but worried: “What if this is as good as it gets?” anymore.

Pretty good hold for Superman and overall a decent result at the domestic BO.

The question is why international is massively underperforming compared to previous DC movies and Man of Steel specifically? In Germany it opened behind Jurassic World and F1 (!) and it's expected to fall to #4 this weekend behind Smurfs. I doubt anyone expected that.

	The popular EDM festival Tomorrowland in Belgium is taking place this weekend despite a massive fire that “severely damaged” the main stage just a day before the fest was slated to begin. And, according to Martin Garrix, festival goers have Metallica to thank for Tomorrowland continuing on despite the blaze.


	On Wednesday, a day before Tomorrowland's July 17 start, a “serious” fire destroyed the festival's “beloved Mainstage,” and while no one was hurt in the incident, the blaze threatened the cancelation of headlining sets by EDM giants like Swedish House Mafia, David Guetta, Steve Aoki, Dillon Francis, Deadmau5, and Eric Prydz.


	After the fire was extinguised, organizers pledged to soldier on with the festivalm, as Tomorrowland spokesperson Debby Wilmsen said, “Years of love and passion have gone into building that stage. Those teams are devastated. Tomorrow, 38,000 festival-goers will arrive, we're really looking forward to that, and we're going to give them a warm welcome. We're going to make it a wonderful festival.”

	











	“We are focused on finding solutions for the festival weekend,” organizers added. Those solutions came courtesy of Metallica, whose stage from their M72 World Tour was being kept in storage in Austria and was quickly airlifted to Belgium overnight, HLN reports.


	Garrix, who performed at Tomorrowland, was the first to acknowledge Metallica's involvement in saving the festival. “I can not believe I'm actually typing this… but my set at Tomorrowland is still happening!”, Garrix wrote on Instagram alongside of photo of him and Lars Ulrich.

	










A post shared by Martin Garrix (@martingarrix)


	“Massive love and a big shoutout to the incredible Tomorrowland team for pulling off miracles — and to Metallica for coming through with the new stage parts…”

Donald Trump is sick of fielding questions about Jeffrey Epstein. But his efforts to quash lingering interest in the case of the late sex offender by downplaying it as some kind of “hoax” perpetrated by political enemies including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have failed to satisfy MAGA diehards who want the White House to release bombshell materials implicating powerful elites in Epstein's crimes, or evidence that he was killed in his jail cell in 2019 to protect those same people.


	It's a crisis of the administration's own making. While Trump had been fairly noncommittal on the campaign trail when asked whether he would declassify files related to Epstein, he then appointed conspiracists Kash Patel and Dan Bongino to lead the FBI, empowering them to investigate their wildest theories. Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, hyped a drop of Epstein documents in February, and had them distributed in binders to various right-wing influencers — but it turned out these pages were already public. The backlash was intense, though nothing compared to the furor that followed a memo from the FBI and Justice Department earlier this month, which stated that investigators had found no trace of an Epstein “client list” and concluded, once again, that he had died by suicide.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	These claims were unacceptable to Trump supporters grown frenzied on years of baseless speculation about the circumstances of Epstein's death and promises to expose his associates. Suddenly, the president was saying that the financier — his former friend — was old news and irrelevant. And while his loyalists are usually forgiving of his indifference to their expectations, it appears that this time, they're not willing to be brushed off. It certainly hasn't helped that Trump's frustrations led him to directly attack his base for caring about “bullshit,” saying that “some stupid Republicans” are stubbornly keeping the story alive. Those insults have fueled further outrage from the biggest names demanding transparency around Epstein and questioning why Trump has tried to move on.

	The white nationalist troll did not hold back after Trump wrote on Truth Social that he didn't want the support of “weaklings” convinced that the government is withholding information on Epstein and those linked to him. “Fuck you,” Fuentes said on a livestream this week, calling Trump “fat,” “stupid,” and “a joke.” He said he had never been this critical of the president before. “This entire thing has been a scam,” he declared. “We're gonna look back at MAGA movement as the biggest scam in American history.”  


	Far-right podcaster Matt Walsh was among those commentators specifically calling for Bondi to lose her job over her botched handling of Epstein disclosures — and expressing frustration that Trump had defended her. “So the Epstein Files are a ‘dumb hoax' and yet the Attorney General who deliberately peddled this ‘dumb hoax' is doing a great job, won't be fired, and we should stop criticizing her?” he complained on X. “Someone make sense of this for me.”


	Owens, a conservative influencer, called Trump's attempt to spin the Epstein files as something fabricated by Obama and other Democrats “outright embarrassing” in a post on X. She called the scandal “terminal cancer” for the MAGA movement during an episode of her podcast, accusing Trump of “gaslighting the public” and regarding his base as “stupid.” Owens also vowed not to let go of the issue. “I will be the very last person that will stop talking about Jeffrey Epstein,” she said.


	At times a close confidante of the president, the far-right activist has repeatedly attacked Bondi throughout the fracas over Epstein while seeming to defend Trump. On Wednesday, she cautioned in an interview that the fallout could “consume” his presidency. Loomer has noted that Trump's posts about Epstein are only drawing more attention to the subject, which she said on X is “not going away.” She is advocating for the appointment of a special counsel to deal with this “distraction.”

	Like Loomer, longtime conservative commentator Glenn Beck appeared to reserve most of his ire for Bondi. “Pam Bondi should resign — not because of a cover-up, but for incompetence,” he wrote on X, arguing that the Justice Department had screwed up by releasing security footage from a Manhattan jail that showed Epstein being escorted to his cell that did not provide a view of the cell itself. “This isn't about whether Epstein killed himself or not,” he continued. “What matters more is REAL transparency and justice.”

	











	The Dilbert cartoonist and Trump supporter was, like many others, unpersuaded when the president tried to deflect blame for uproar at the DOJ memo to Obama, Clinton, and others. “The new ass-covering story is the Epstein files were ‘made up' by Democrats,” he wrote on X. “I expect better bullshit from my president.”


	Trump's biggest megadonor in the 2024 election cycle publicly accused Trump of burying the Epstein files to protect himself after their relationship blew up in spectacular fashion, with Musk then announcing he would launch a new political party. The billionaire later deleted and apologized for those posts but has continued to hammer the administration for failing to prosecute anyone connected to Epstein besides Ghislaine Maxwell. “Wow I can't believe Epstein killed himself before realizing it was all a hoax,” he posted sarcastically on X on Thursday.


	Despite his large body of work as a MAGA sycophant, YouTuber Benny Johnson couldn't swallow Trump's logically torturous explanations of why his backers should just forget about Epstein. In a clip where he struggled to parse a Trump post on Truth Social, he fretted over the narrative the president was weaving. “By admitting that the Epstein Files are real, and that you've read them, and you don't like their contents, and they were written by your enemies, it doesn't make the most compelling case as far as I'm concerned,” he said. “Holy moly.” 


	Kirk was one of several right-wing pundits to indicate that he might back off of the Epstein story, having reportedly fielded a call from Trump himself on the matter. Only a day later, however, he devoted a podcast episode to questions around Epstein, arguing that the administration had to disclose more details of the case if it wanted to move on.


	The beanie-wearing podcaster who, along with Benny Johnson, was revealed last year to have accepted money from a company fronting for a Russian influence campaign, did not appreciate Trump's dismissal of Epstein truthers. “Donald Trump says the people that are interested in the Jeffrey Epstein inquiry are bad people,” Pool said on his show. “He said only bad people and the fake news are interested in the Jeffrey Epstein inquiry. I guess that puts me in the category of ‘bad people.'”


	Trump has even been taking hits from his allies in congress, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. “We should put everything out there and let the people decide,” he said in an interview, insisting that he is “for transparency.” Yet when Democrats in the House forced a procedural vote on an a legislative amendment that would have permitted congress to vote on whether to compel the Justice Department to unseal documents related to Epstein, he and other Republicans blocked it.  

	











	The GOP representative from Tennessee echoed some of the more extreme rhetoric heard from conspiracy theorists talking about the potential prosecutions of Epstein's supposed clients. “Find them guilty and hang them, publicly,” he said in a televised interview. He followed up by confirming that he doesn't believe what the Justice Department has said about the case. “I don't trust them,” he said. Burchett further called on the House Committe on Oversight and Reform to hear public testimony from Ghislaine Maxwell.


	“Of course we want answers,” the Colorado representative said in an interview about Epstein. “No one is satisfied with what has been received, or lack thereof.” She called for a special investigation into the handling of the relevant materials, suggesting that former congressman Matt Gaetz could be appointed as special counsel. The idea seemed a somewhat trollish in the context of questions about a notorious pedophile: before his exit from congress and the withdrawal of his nomination to serve as attorney general, a House Ethics Committee probe found that Gaetz had violated a statutory rape law when he paid a 17-year-old for sex in 2017.


	The Georgia representative, well known for amplifying right-wing conspiracy theories, announced Wednesday that she would co-sponsor a discharge petition on a House vote about releasing the Epstein files from libertarian-leaning Rep. Thomas Massie, who has regularly broken with Trump. “I will never protect pedophiles or the elites and their circles,” she posted on X when she shared Massie's resolution.


	Better known as the Hodgetwins, this conservative comedy and commentary duo registered their disgust at the administration's closing of the Epstein inquiry in a blunt X post. “Telling people to just get over the Epstein files = protecting pedophiles,” they wrote. “There is no other way to put it.”


	The right-wing content creator indicated that a failure to disclose more information on Epstein's dealings could come with electoral consequences for the GOP. “I honestly have no interest in voting in the 2026 midterms if Republicans have no interest in revealing the truth about Jeffrey Epstein,” he warned the party on X.


	The pseudonymous MAGA shitposter didn't go as far as attacking his beloved president, though he did join the ranks of those calling on Bondi to fix the Epstein mess. “It's amazing to me that Pam Bondi still hasn't done a news conference over her decisions on  Epstein,” he fumed on X on Monday. “It's her responsibility to explain her decisions and answer questions,  not surrogates.” He also called her “delusional” for trying to duck the topic.  


	The one-time Pizzagate promoter, who was a participant in Bondi's binder debacle in February, took a page out of Trump's playbook in seeking to paint one of the president's enemies as somehow involved in an Epstein coverup. Referring to an initial FBI investigation into the financier that ended without federal prosecution and Epstein pleading guilty to state prostitution charges in Florida, Posobiec in an X post alleged, “After Epstein gave information to the FBI, federal charges were dropped.” He went on to ask and answer: “Who was head of the FBI then?  Robert Mueller. Release the info.” There is no evidence Mueller weighed in on the investigation of Epstein, and his plea deal was handled by Alexander Acosta, then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, whom Trump appointed as Secretary of Labor in his first term. Acosta was forced to resign from the cabinet in 2019, after Epstein's re-arrest brought his role in the deal to light.


	America's conspiracy kingpin made it clear that he roundly rejected the memo from the FBI and DOJ when he shared a video of himself crying in a car and saying he was going to vomit from his feelings of betrayal. Soon enough he was sharing an image of the White House altered to resemble a building on Epstein's private island and a picture of the U.S. Capitol captioned “I am telling my children this is Epstein Island.” On his Infowars broadcast Wednesday, he criticized the administration and its supporters for trying to suppress dissent. “When somebody starts saying ‘Don't question things or you can't be in our club,' yeah, that's a cult, and I'm not a cult joiner, never have been,” he said. 


	Valorized by the QAnon movement and pardoned by Trump in 2020 for making false statements to the FBI, the former U.S. national security adviser pleaded with the president not to discredit the Epstein saga as a “hoax” in a lengthy post on X. “The roll out of this was terrible, no way around that,” he wrote, exhorting the administration to find “a way to move past this” while holding individuals responsible for their crimes against children. “It is NOT about Epstein or the left,” he insisted, challenging Trump's invocation of a shadowy plot by Democrats.


	The South Carolina representative joined many of her colleagues in demanding answers on Epstein, and arrests, asking on X, “If 1,000 kids were trafficked, how is there only one accomplice?” But she took the unusual step of speculating that Democrats were suppressing the truth. “Did the Biden Administration destroy any evidence?” she wrote. “I stand with women, children, the truth and TRUMP.” Of course, Trump would probably view it as more helpful to his cause if she stopped talking about Epstein altogether.   


	The right-wing comedian and YouTuber is another of the influencers who was duped by Bondi's binders in February, and after the FBI and DOJ memo came out this month, it sounded like Prather was still holding a grudge. One of the several videos he's released on Epstein since then is titled, in part: “WE WON'T STOP TALKING ABOUT THIS.” Another flat-out alleges that Bondi lied to the American public. “I have a lot of issues with all of this,” he said of the memo's conclusions.


	Better known by his social media handle @DC_Draino, O'Handley is another influencer who was embarrassed in “Bindergate.” Now he is consistently posting that more Epstein documents need to see the light of day. “Today is a great day to start releasing the Epstein Files,” he wrote on X on Wednesday. “Time to restore trust in the DOJ.” Previously, he had warned, “This isn't going away. It's only going to get worse. MAGA wants those Epstein files released.” 


	The conservative TV and radio host appears to believe that Trump, otherwise outperforming all expectations, could easily dispense with the Epstein drama if he wants to. “Epstein is not going away,” he posted on X  last weekend. “Best [six] months for any president in history. Everything he's doing is fantastic. Why risk it all on this stupid file? Just release it.” He also could not conceal his dismay over the controversial memo. “I must admit this Epstein file announcement is biggest [and] most ludicrous mistake ever by Trump,” he posted. “It's a disaster. Everyone knows it's pure fraud. So the question is WHY do something so foolish?”


	Known as a superspreader of medical misinformation, the podcaster was another recipient of the Bondi binder and has lately taken aim at the attorney general's “lies” around the Epstein case. She has also heavily indulged in the unproven conspiracy theory that Epstein worked for the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. On Wednesday, Wheeler touted one (accurate) statistic, noting a poll that showed almost 70 percent of Americans believe the Trump administration is withholding information on Epstein.    


	The Canadian streamer, who goes by the handle Viva Frei, said the ultimate responsibility for the Epstein fallout lay with Trump himself. “I think Trump's handling of the Epstein situation is wrong,” he wrote on X. “To his own detriment. And unnecessarily so.” Amid a torrent of posts and videos on the Epstein files in recent days, he again expressed his view that the president's comments on Epstein represented a huge strategic blunder, writing, “I say this with sincere love and respect: Does Trump not understand the damage he's doing right now?”


	The comedian and former sitcom actress, an early and vocal Hollywood supporter of Trump, was none too pleased when he wanted to drop the Epstein issue as soon as the DOJ and FBI memo came out. “Mr. President — Yes, we still care about Epstein,” she wrote on X. “Is there a time to not care about child sex trafficking? Read the damn room.” In the past months, she has replied to posts from Bondi to ask when the Epstein files will be released.


	The right-wing conspiracy theorist was aghast at Trump's decision to try to pin blame for the Epstein fiasco on Democrats. “Why he's doing this is anyone's guess,” he wrote on X. “I truly am speechless.” Cernovich fretted that Trump was not listening to his base, was now stuck playing defense, and lashed out at unnamed Trump “allies” he said had jeopardized the administration. “Whoever told Trump to shut up about Epstein fucked him over big time,” he posted.


	Last but certainly not least, the former Fox News host has used his considerable platform to go after Bondi and the Justice Department for “covering up Jeffrey Epstein's crimes and murder” and amplified the conspiracy theory that Epstein was a Mossad asset. He continues to devote hours of streaming content to speculative interviews about the case.

I remember the first time I met Zarna Garg.

It was at a picnic for New York City comics in 2021, back when she carried around her signature rolling pin. Garg's star was already on the rise — I recognized her from social media but didn't know her personally, let alone expect to see her out and about with rising local talent. She spoke to me with the kind of respect and attentiveness that comes from years of media training (and, in her case, decades of motherhood); she followed everyone she met that day on social media, and had tagged me in a photo before I even made it home.

 










I've told that story a lot as Garg's career exploded over the past few years — not to name-drop (though my mother is impressed), but to demonstrate that social media's favorite aunty is exactly who she seems, and also a genuine advocate for other creatives. She's also one of the hardest-working people in entertainment if not the world at large; in 2025 alone she has published a book, filmed a sitcom pilot, premiered a movie, and now debuts her second taped special on Hulu.

“My brain doesn't stop,” Garg told me over Zoom. “I see anybody and I'm like, ‘Let's make a video, let's capture this.' I have to remind myself not to attack people with it. I have to slow myself down because I overwhelm people easily.”

In the book, “This American Woman,” Garg tells of an astrologer who once told her mother: “This girl will talk and talk and talk.” Part of that is performing, being what she describes as the face of a family business, but part of it is the hustle and grind behind the scenes.

“I am in a privileged position today, but I have no apology for it, and I'll tell you why: because I built it all with my bare hands,” she said. “Nobody was there. I know how to write the entire script. I know how to shoot it. I know how to edit it. I know how to distribute it on nine platforms. I know how to make it go viral. Every single step of this is a step that I have lived and perfected on my way before I hired other people to do it. So yeah, I'm very privileged right now, but take it all away and I'll start over, and I'll win again.”

The following interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.

IndieWire: I told my editors that you're not so much in Hollywood yet, but also one of the most famous people on the planet. What has it been like experiencing that kind of recognition through stand up and social media, which for a lot of people doesn't happen before they step onto a screen, or at least it didn't used to?
 










The thing that I like best about being recognized is like you said, they don't know me from a big screen, so it's not like seeing Priyanka Chopra. If I see Priyanka Chopra, I'm like, wow, because she's this big Bollywood and Hollywood star now, right? People see me and they just start smiling. They don't even know why they're smiling, because they see me mixed up with their families in their phones, their uncles, their aunties, their neighbors, their whatever. It's a lot of like, “Oh, I know her! I know her. How do I know her?” 

But the thing that makes me most proud is that when people see me, it's an involuntary reaction that they haven't even thought about, and they start smiling. My association with humor and good feelings is so strong that it's never any other reaction — even the people who don't like my work actually just start smiling because they can't help it. They immediately think of whatever last video of mine made them smile, or that they send in their family chats.

That's part of it; you have such a family appeal, and you've been so good about involving your family since the beginning. Was there ever any question of how much or how little to include them, especially with the kids?

No. I always say that we run a family business — I'm the face of it. It's not like I'm involving them. They've been involved since day one. I wouldn't be doing any of this without them. It was my daughter's vision that I should try stand up comedy. My son put me on social media. Even now, just this past weekend I was at a Belly Laughs Comedy Festival where [Zoya] was with me capturing footage everywhere we went. So I do things like moms do things. My kids go with me a lot of places, and we are building this whole world of family comedy together.

 










Was there a point where it was moving too fast? When you've blown up exponentially, there had to be early on, or even still, like there's just so much going on to balance.

I feel like I should be humble and say yes, but it's actually not true. I think my brain has this broken OCD component where if I want something, I chase it like a mad person, and I can't stop. Even if I want to make it stop, I can't. When I had a book coming out, I asked my publisher, “What is it that you want?” And she said, “It would be great if we could make New York Times bestseller.” And then that became my singular vision, and I was like, until we get it, we're not gonna stop. Once I decided that I'm doing the stand up comedy, it was “How are we gonna do this? What are the top players doing? How do they get it done?” It kind of just went like a machine was built to make it happen, and now we're doing the same thing with TV projects, with movies. 

My movie, when it came out — I'm just an actor on it, I didn't have to do anything, but I would not have rested until the movie was a big success. Because my producer's success is my success. I don't sit there and think, “Is this my job? Am I getting paid?” It's not how my brain works at all. So once I started doing this, I also built a world where I'm collaborating with a lot of people who are giving me their goodwill; the clubs that hire me, the streaming services that give me their platform. Right now, I'm fully obsessed with how I'm going to make Hulu succeed like a wild, crazy person, not because they're asking me for anything. They're actually extremely gentle and generous, like “Do what makes you happy.” It's also a lot of American people, white people, so they are very gentle in their chit chat. If it was an Indian place, they would have been like, “What are you doing?!”

 










If you end up working in Indian film, we'll have that conversation then, a real spicy one.

You know what I'm talking about. But just because they are not beating me down for it doesn't mean it's not top of my mind, is what I'm saying. Coming back to your question, the speed and velocity is orchestrated. It's not just happening. None of these things just happen. We are out there grinding, five Gargs and our whole team of another ten people, is out there grinding and hustling constantly, everywhere we go, saying, “Watch this. Watch this. Watch this.” It's not just a victory for me if I win, it's a victory for all the people who chose to support me, who chose to look at this complicated and quirky situation, and said, “Yes, let's give her a platform.”

Let's start with the film, because you did film that earlier. It was your first time acting. What was that experience like?

It was A+. My director could not be better, my producers could not be nicer. My costars were all amazing, and that's why I think I'm probably never going to do it again, because you can't top that. The experience was so good that I'm nervous to sign anything else where the experience is not going to be that good. They were so nice to me. We made that movie with so much love, there's really a lot of love behind the scenes, which is why the movie kind of popped and glowed the way it did. It's so real. So it was really, really amazing. Especially my director and my co star, Karan [Soni], outstanding. They knew I didn't know anything, I was coming from shows, going to shows, so they were very understanding of the fact that I was new at this, and really helped me take every baby step that I needed to to get there.

 










That's kind of a refreshing answer, because the path that is usually made for comics is, you start doing stand up, you go on shows, you produce shows, and then you audition and you do more acting. That's just the career path forward, but in your case it doesn't have to be.

The good thing about not being anybody's top choice for anything is that you don't even worry about auditioning and all that. Not one door would have opened for me if I would have sat around auditioning, like no way. Who's casting an Indian middle-aged woman in a kurta and a bindi and an accent? I knew from day one I'm gonna do my own thing, and I say it even now. My comedy shows — not a single club was open to me as a comic. No one was booking me. I just started doing shows for free, outside, in the subway, under a tree. I was like, “I will build my own following. This is not going to work for me. The process is not set up for me.” I started working on an exceptional second hour before I had a deal with anybody. I knew that if I create an exceptional second hour, I will find the audience for it if no one wants to collaborate with me. Hulu stepped in and stepped in in a big way, and I'm honored about that, but I didn't think I would make their cut. I honestly didn't think — in fact, I told my agents, “Forget it. They're not going to want me. They all want young girls.” We know what's what. They all want the young women who look pretty and all that, and that's fine, it's their business. And my agents were like, “No, I really think there's something here, and they are watching you. Give it a minute.” But I don't slow down. The saying in this in the Garg world is the Z train stops for nothing and nobody. If I want to do a TV show, I will just create my own little, very makeshift version and start releasing. Basically, what my channel is is like a sitcom. People watch hours and hours of our videos as if they're watching a TV show.

 










Also, you did do a TV show in the middle of all this other stuff!

Yeah. Even the movie, I told Karan and Roshan [Sethi], my director and our lead star, I said, “We cannot wait. We cannot wait for people to be like, ‘Oh, watch this movie,' we gotta go out there.” Roshan is a cancer doctor. So I told him, “Roshan, you gotta treat the sales and the noise around this movie like you're saving you're a baby who's about to die. You gotta fight that hard.” Ask him, he'll tell you. Every day I was texting, “Get in there and respond to comments. What are you doing sitting at home and just saving lives? Save lives on the side.”

Tell me about the writing this book and what that process was. You had that bestseller goal set and you signed so many copies.

Oh my god, my hands are gonna fall off. I don't really know why they want signed copies, because I don't get it, but that is a thing that people want. The book is my life story. It's a very informal tone. I didn't think I could write the way — I wanted to write an entertaining book. First and foremost, the book has to entertain. It is not a chronological dump of all my trauma. That's not fun nor interesting for anybody, and not even for me. So we wrote the whole thing like an arc with a beginning, middle, and end. Twenty-one chapters have been written the same way because we want people to feel strong emotions. The number one thing I'm getting back feedback from the book, which has thousands of near-perfect reviews, is that people didn't want it to end. They were feeling so sad when it ended, because it's a fun journey. Even though it's a real story, with the ups and downs and all of it, I wrote it to entertain people. That's what I'm here to do.

 










It does get very personal, very vulnerable, and that's not something that South Asians and Desi moms in particular are known for.

But again, it was like the decision was made to do all that when I decided to write the book. I said to my family, either I'm writing the book or I'm not writing the book. But I don't want to write a book where I'm constantly afraid, what will my husband think? What will my brother think? Because then you're not honest and connecting with the audience. The audience today is very smart. If you're hiding things, if you're lying about things, they know. And my audience is literally, if you could do an IQ test, I'm telling you, my audience is the smartest audience in the world. They're all doctors, they're all neurosurgeons. They're like tech entrepreneurs, billionaires — you cannot fool them. So either you're writing the book or you're not writing. Not a single person in my family saw any copies of any pages before the book was finished, accepted, legally, accepted by the publisher. And then I said, here you can read it. You either trust me or you don't.

Was there anything you were particularly hesitant or excited to include?

The New York City private school chapter — we had to go back and forth on that chapter a lot because we talk about a lot of decisions, but in the end my publisher, legal, we all decided that it's a very good chapter, and it's a doing a huge service to mothers in America who are feeling extremely burdened by this whole system, who are feeling alone, who are feeling crushed by it, and then we made the decision to go forward with it. But almost everything else was was very smooth sailing. In publishing world, they call my book the opposite of “The Spare,” of [Prince] Harry's book, because his book is all about every grievance he ever had with his family, and my book is all about the love. It's all about every family member that did right things by me. My brain doesn't even remember what wrong things people do to me. I don't have the brain space to hold all that.

 










You are open about living a privileged life at this moment, even not working while you went into stand up and hiring a writer. Once you discuss your past and where you've come from, of course it makes sense. It reminded me of “Angry Young Men,” when Javed Akhtar talks about coming from not much money. He says to this day, sometimes they'll lay out a meal and I think this must not be for me.

You never fully come to terms with it, but I share it openly because so many comics behave like they're writing every word and they're not. We all know that. Why not give credit where it's due? It's not the end of the world to say we collaborated in an excellent way. All the late night shows, you think those guys are writing every joke that they say? Of course not, and it's OK. I think it's better to be honest and upfront with your audience and let them make the decision if it's good or bad. I know that interview you're talking about. It was very refreshing, because he was being honest.

We have to own what we're good at, especially South Asian women. We've been told to minimize ourselves. Culturally, we've been told take the least amount of space, don't brag. If you say anything good about yourself, God forbid you're bragging. No! We have to talk about what we can do and not do. We are all running businesses here, so I offer no apologies. I get flamed for it all the time in the media. They all think my husband's funding my life. It's actually the opposite. He lost his job during COVID, has not fully recovered, and I'm running this whole house, and I'm proud of it.

 










The bragging was always framed as vanity for me growing up. 

Anytime I've learned this, anytime they say it's not our culture, what it is code for is that our men don't like it. If you look at our culture, essentially everything they like is us sitting and suffering in silence and the men being glorified, and that needs to come to an end, like ASAP, right now.

Being too big or too loud, because it means you don't need them for support.

Exactly, and guess what? We don't. Look at this, Hulu coming in in such a big way, supporting us, putting an Indian Aunty in a pink kurta, all over billboards all over America. This is real support. Everything else is nonsense. But this is the real deal, what we're getting over here.

You built this whole thing yourself, and then suddenly you were at a level of fame where probably a lot of people came calling. Are there people who didn't or weren't interested, or who did not buy stock in Zarna at the right time?

So many, so many. Where to begin? All the clubs in New York. The first club that passed me was Comedy Cellar. If I'm not on a late night show, it's because [those clubs] rejected me. I'm not going to name them, but it's because they rejected me. We are trying to be everywhere. We are trying to hit every audience. There are comics, brown comics, who don't follow me. I follow them. I'm very generous in my praise of everybody. I offer my platform to everybody. When they do good work, I shout out everybody. But there's so many of them who choose not to follow me. This is very easy to look up. Anybody can look it up. And they have their own ego and hassle. They act wounded that I exist on the scene.

 










Why do you think that is?

I don't know. I've actually had an Indian comic tell me, “Aunty, shouldn't you be in the kitchen?” This is an Indian male comic living in New York City, an educated guy. So then how can we hold Indian uncles accountable? If this dude who's educated here can't even think straight?

Do think he was trying to make a joke, but is just bad at comedy?

I mean, look, if this is the best you can come up with, you probably should go to med school and hope and pray there, my friend. This one didn't work.

You've written and toured a book, you filmed and promoted a movie, you have multiple specials, you have your podcast — what's your favorite?

This hour that I just filmed for Hulu really has my heart. I found my voice. I wasn't nervous the way I was the first time, I had enough audience feedback to know exactly what they wanted from me. So we really packed — it's 60 minutes of literally, joke, joke, joke — the density of the jokes is like distilled, pure gold comedy that I created for Hulu, because there was just so much love around this partnership that I wanted to give them the very best. And I wanted to give my audience the very best.

I can't wait to see it! Lastly, do you have any advice for our readers from Aunty Z?

Yes: Do all your artistic things on Friday and Saturday night and stay in the STEM fields. Do not read this interview and think I should be a full-time comic. No, you should not. Even if you're funny, you should not. I'm telling you right now, if I find doing that somewhere, I'm gonna beat you with my bare hands, and I'm not gonna worry about — I don't really care that people don't do that in America. If you've been to my show, you know it gets real in there.

 










You know, that's about what I expected, but I'm happy to get it in writing. And I'm entering my Aunty era, I kind of endorse.

Yeah, do it on the weekends! I'm not saying kill your dreams. I'm saying limit them.

Neon is picking up the tab for an all-expenses-paid Las Vegas wedding for one lucky couple that gets engaged at a movie theater (inside or out) between now and Aug. 4.


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	Are you ready to be together forever?


Neon and the married stars of its new body horror film Together, Dave Franco and Alison Brie, have concocted a contest for movie lovers ready to tie the knot that could land them a free trip to the chapel in Las Vegas. Dare we say, it's a pretty genius promotional tie-in.  




	The Oscar-winning studio will pick up the tab for an all-expenses-paid Sin City wedding for one lucky couple. All the couples have to do to enter is propose at a movie theater (inside or out) any time between now and by midnight on Aug. 3, all on video of course. “Film it, post it by Aug. 3 with the hashtag #TogetherContest,” Brie explained in a new Instagram video while seated alongside her husband. “How crazy romantic is this?”

	“Speaking of crazy, the crazier the better,” Franco added. Neon has the rest of the details on its website.

	Written and directed by Michael Shanks, Together casts Franco and Brie as Tim and Millie, a couple that finds themselves at a crossroads as they move to the countryside, abandoning all that is familiar in their lives except one another. With tensions already flaring in their relationship, a nightmarish encounter with a mysterious, unnatural force threatens to corrupt their lives, their love and their flesh by bringing them closer than they've ever been. 

	











Together hits theaters everywhere July 30.


	Thursday proved to be a big day for the Together marketing and social team. Not only did they introduce this proposal challenge, Neon's Instagram page also made use of the biggest pop culture story of the day by posting a photo of the couple caught on a kiss cam at the Coldplay concert (Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and his chief people officer, Kristin Cabot) with the caption, “The perfect date night movie.” Actress Eiza Gonzalez caught it and posted, “Lol great marketing,” while Ilana Glazer added, “Good job u guys.”

	“There's no El Tráfico without the supporters,” says Gloria Jiménez, leader of the Angel City Brigade and a decades-long LA Galaxy fan. On Saturday, when the Galaxy face LAFC in Major League Soccer's fiercest rivalry (or El Tráfico, to the teams' perpetually gridlocked fans), the stands will be quieter than usual. Two of the Galaxy's most passionate and visible supporter groups — the drum-pounding, flag-waving Angel City Brigade and L.A. Outlawz — won't be in the stands. The groups will be staging a protest in response to how the team has handled in-game demonstrations against ICE‘s attacks on Latino communities across the country, as well as the team's failure to release a statement amid the raids and the stadium's recent ban of a member of one of the fan groups.


	Saturday's game, and the Galaxy protest around it, comes weeks into President Donald Trump's latest wave of immigration crackdowns, targeting predominantly Latino communities. In late May and early June, ICE swept through cities like Los Angeles, Nashville, and Chicago, leaving Latino soccer fans rattled, with some fearful that attending a major sporting event might put them at risk of detention and deportation.

	











	In May, a Latino-led supporter group of Nashville SC was the first to announce they wouldn't be attending a game following a wave of raids in the city. “Our community is being terrorized right now,” La Brigada de Oro founder Abel Acosta told The New York Times. “We're being hunted. That's how we feel.” And since then, fan groups of Austin FC, LA Galaxy, LAFC, Chicago Fire, and several other teams have voiced their support for their large Latino fanbase and their anger toward ICE.

	











	“To us, it's obvious. Soccer culture in America is inseparable from Latino culture. When the government is coming for our neighbors, it's insane not to speak up,” Zach Lyons, a leader of Austin FC's Los Verdes, says of the “Abolish ICE” banners they waved last month. “This is an attack on people who are part of our community. There was no hesitation. We knew we had to do something.”

	Out of the entire league, only one team — LAFC, the Galaxy's crosstown rival — spoke out in support of its immigrant fanbase. While it avoided mentioning ICE directly, the club said it stands “shoulder to shoulder with all members of our community.” Beyond the Black and Gold of the LAFC, however, the league and its franchises have remained silent. Multiple sources within Major League Soccer tell Rolling Stone that both the league and teams fear retaliation from the Trump administration, including treatment similar to that faced by the Los Angeles Dodgers, who were sued over alleged DEI practices by a conservative legal group founded by Trump immigration hawk Stephen Miller shortly after pledging $1 million to support L.A.'s immigrant community.


	Instead, teams have cracked down on fans who have pushed back at games, banning at least three in Chicago and one in L.A. for what the league labeled unauthorized political speech at games.

	“The MLS Fan Code of Conduct prohibits fans from displaying signs, symbols, or images used for commercial purposes or to advocate for or against any political candidate, party, legislative issue, or government action,” reads a statement sent to Rolling Stone by an MLS spokesperson. ”These policies are intended to keep the focus on the match and help avoid disruptions that could impact the fan experience.”


	For the Angel City Brigade and other fans of the Galaxy, the frustration stems from the team's silence around the ICE raids that rocked Southern California in early June. Throughout that month, fans expressed their frustration online and collectively decided not to attend their rivalry game against the San Jose Earthquakes in the Bay Area, in solidarity with fans who were fearful of traveling across the state.

	“That's our biggest trip of the season,” says Jiménez of the ACB. “The team hadn't offered any support: If something happens at the stadium, what's the next step?”

	











	The group then used the Galaxy's first home game since the raids, held on the Fourth of July, to stage a protest against the team for their continued silence. For the first 12 minutes of the match, the ACB skipped their typical chants and stood silently in the stands behind a tifo, a large banner display that covered much of the section, that read “Fight Ignorance, Not Immigrants.” Then, they walked out of the stadium.


	“We wanted to match their silence,” says Jiménez. “They didn't announce any proactive plans to protect our immigrant fans or tell us which charities they were supporting. So we left the game. Just like they left us.”


	Someone snuck a “Smash ICE” into that game, as well, while some fans wore shirts featuring a crossed-out ice cube. Tucked above the pro-immigrant tifo was a banner that read “AEG loves immigrant dollars but not immigrants,” specifically calling out the conglomerate owner of the team, who donated nearly $2 million to Republicans running for re-election last year, according to Billboard. The banner targeting AEG led to the indefinite ban of Bruce Martin, a photographer for the Angel City Brigade, over the alleged misuse of a credential to bring in the unapproved banner.


	The Galaxy spokesperson emphasized that the team had worked with ACB during their walkout “to ensure they felt heard and seen,” but said they had to ban Martin over for disobeying the rules. 


	“While we know fans may bring in unapproved banners, this is the first time that to our knowledge, a non-employee with credential access has used their credential to deliberately circumvent stadium protocols,” the Galaxy spokesperson tells Rolling Stone. “The abuse of that access is a serious breach of trust. As part of our regular process, an indefinite ban was issued while we reviewed the situation and his case.”


	Jiménez thinks that Martin was a scapegoat for the group's protests overall, and the AEG-directed messaging was part of it. Martin, for his part, thinks he was targeted for speaking to the Los Angeles Times about the team's silence in an interview leading up to that game.


	“The main frustration for us is that they've used the Hispanic culture in advertisements to make money, but when something is affecting the culture, they're quiet,” he tells Rolling Stone. “At the Fourth of July game, I came to the realization that this might be the last time I set foot into that stadium. … This feels like a breakup or a death. It would take a lot for me to come back.”

	











	Jiménez says that at least 100 of the nearly 800 season ticket holders in the section where the ACB stands have canceled their tickets for the season over the Galaxy's inaction. (The team didn't confirm the number, but stated that they've made exceptions to allow fans to cancel their season tickets.)


	“I don't see myself going to games anytime soon,” says Rebecah Jacobs, one fan who requested a refund for the remaining games of the season. “I know that the Galaxy is very online and seeing all the chatter going on so it's not about not knowing what's going on. … I'd need them to speak out. Being silent is not something I can support.”

	The Angel City Brigade skipped this past Wednesday night's game altogether and instead staged a protest outside of the stadium, slamming Martin's ban and the continued silence from the Galaxy. One fan held up a printout of the description for one of the team's jerseys, which to the fans now seems ironic: “Coated in our city colors, the kit represents all different Angelino cultures, no matter what border or bridge you crossed to get here. This will forever be your home.”


	But the Galaxy tells Rolling Stone, in the first statement of its kind, that it will stick to league policy, and not address the political nature of the ICE raids directly, despite fan clamors.


	“We have not issued a statement. We recognize the impact that recent events and actions have had on our community. For decades, we have honored the rich backgrounds, cultures, and experiences of our fans and staff. Our purpose as a professional sports organization is to unite and support our community around a shared love of this sport,” Jamie Alvarez, the Vice President for PR and Communications of the Galaxy, says in a statement the team asked to be published in full. “We are focusing on prioritizing the safety, well-being, and sense of belonging for our staff and for our fans.”

	Separately, a Galaxy source says that working alongside AEG, the team will continue to support its longtime community partners, including Latino-focused orgs CARECEN, Heart of Los Angeles (HOLA), and All Peoples Community Center. 


	Latino fans of the Chicago Fire faced an eerily similar situation with their team. Three fans — Nate Cubeta and Edith and Julio Lopez — were banned for a year from Soldier Field and all MLS-sanctioned events over an unauthorized anti-ICE banner they refused to take down.

	











	“When the ICE raids started to become more brutal in L.A., we thought we couldn't go to the next Fire home game and not recognize what is going on. It didn't feel right,” says Cubeta. “We came up with this design that was Spanglish and tied into the Fire.”


	For three games in June, including on the day of the “No Kings” protests in mid-June, Cubeta and the Lopez siblings say they displayed a banner reading “Fire Contra ICE” — featuring an illustration of soccer legend Cuauhtémoc Blanco celebrating a goal by mimicking a dog urinating over the government agency's logo — from within the Sector Latino section of the stadium. The first two games, they say, the Fire said nothing about the banner. (A Chicago Fire source says the fans were reminded of the policy.)

	It wasn't until a match on June 28 that Cubeta and the Lopez siblings were asked by the Fire to take down the banner. They refused, leading the team to ban them from Soldier Field for a year. In a statement to Rolling Stone, a Fire spokesperson says the banner had “violated” the league's code of conduct, pointing to the terms of the rulebook displayed online. (“The Chicago Fire remain committed to providing a safe and enjoyable environment for all fans,” the statement reads.)


	“The Fire will say we broke the political signage rules. We know we did. We felt compelled to disobey it at a moment like this,” says Edith Lopez. “We know that they're going to find whatever way to sanitize things, because they want to be marketable and safe. But that's not our responsibility as supporters.”


	Cubeta and the Lopez siblings, who've been season ticket holders since 2009, have no regrets about their decision to stand their ground and keep the poster up. “We want immigrants to know we are behind them and there is always a space with us,” says Edith. “We aren't intimidated.”

	After news of the ban spread, Sector Latino and other Chicago Fire supporter groups protested the Fire at a game last Saturday, which ironically happened to be Mexican Heritage Night at the stadium. They turned their backs to the field and remained silent for the first 15 minutes of the match as they held up a new banner that read in Spanish:  “We are always with you guys, but you are never with us.”


	In Austin, fans have decided to compromise with the Austin FC front office to share pro-immigrant messaging and step away from the “abolish ICE” direct messaging they displayed earlier in the summer. They've gotten banners that read “Austin Is an Immigrant City” approved and have distributed “Know Your Rights” cards during games. And they've used their platform to display important messaging including a “Don't Mess With Trans Texans” tifo that went viral earlier this year.

	











	“We are unabashedly willing to speak politics when important, even if the league doesn't allow us to be explicit on that,” says Ernie Luna of Austin FC's Los Verdes. “Our community is what we focus on first, and in our negotiations with them, it's always, ‘We want to be there for our community, so give us the space to do that.'”

A post shared by Los Verdes (@losverdesatx)


	Several sources with direct knowledge of league policy tell Rolling Stone that the nature of the protests makes it difficult for teams and MLS to speak out in support of its immigrant fans, even if they'd want to — and the league has suggested they not do so. 


	With an administration as volatile as Trump's, it's unclear what sort of punishment or retaliation he could take on teams for speaking in favor of its immigrant fanbases. Stephen Miller's American First Legal already sued the Dodgers for “engaging in unlawful discrimination under the guise of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion,'” and it isn't hard to imagine the other conservative groups, or the government itself, taking action against teams they perceive to be condoning anti-ICE messaging.


	“A lot of the teams are scared and being put in a difficult position where they want to say something, but there's a worry of retaliation,” one source says. “It's not how government should work but unfortunately it's the climate we're in and people are concerned about it.”


	As the season drags on, fans are left dealing with silence from the teams — and waiting for a political storm that targets their communities to somehow pass. Wednesday's Galaxy game had the worst turnout of the year so far, and no one in the supporter sections expects that to turn around anytime soon. The trust, for many, seems to already be broken.

The actress' first book was acquired by Little, Brown and Company and will be released in March.

Christina Applegate has lived nearly her entire life in the spotlight. She first gained fame playing the onscreen daughter of Ed O'Neill and Katey Sagal on the beloved 1980s sitcom Married…With Children; she was 16 when the show premiered. Though she's been in countless television shows and films since (Friends, Anchorman, the Broadway revival of Sweet Charity), the actress has kept many of her life's moments to herself — until now. Applegate will publish her first memoir in March 2026, The Hollywood Reporter can exclusively announce.

	











You With the Sad Eyes will cover Applegate's life and legacy, starting with her tumultuous childhood in Laurel Canyon in the '70s, her earliest years on set and the struggles (abuse, body dysmorphia and more) that plagued her meteoric rise.

	“I decided to write this book when I was forced to slow down,” says Applegate. “I've had a career in TV and film since I was 3 years old, and I loved it. But with MS, all the things I thought were important shifted. For a long time, it felt impossible to find the meaning in everything I've been through, but for the first time in my life I've been able to stop and reflect. I've packed a lot into these 50-something years. It's scary — not gonna lie — to finally decide to tell it all. But no matter how dark it gets, I wrote this because I truly believe that books can make people feel less alone. I promise, You With the Sad Eyes won't be some big violin scratching for my life. But it will be real. It will be filled with the ups and downs, the humor and grief of life. So here I am. Real me. Lots to say.”

	











	The memoir was acquired from CAA by Little, Brown and Company in a preempt for World Rights and will be edited by Executive Editor Bryn Clark. “As an editor, I'm always chasing the elusive feeling of ‘I have to have this.' You only know it when you see it, and I knew Christina's book was it the second I read her opening words,” says Clark. “Christina speaks to the power of embracing the messiness and temporality of life instead of hiding behind the plastic veneer of our modern world. We have no time to waste on falsehoods and perfection.”


	Applegate follows the story of her earlier years with her health journey, and coming to terms with the repercussions of her 2021 multiple sclerosis diagnosis; searching for her identity and her joy in the face of the loss of her ability to act. Little, Brown and Company, a division of Hachette Book Group, will publish the memoir. Applegate is repped by CAA and Entertainment 360.

The First Family: Live at the Winchester Cathedral 1967 shows Sly and the Family Stone as a killer soul band on the cusp of developing the pungently progressive style that would make them one of the most vital acts of the hippie era. This is the band that debuted with 1967's A Whole New Thing—stylistically tricky enough that it's clear why Epic Records got dollar signs in their eyes during the Bay Area's psychedelic '60s, but not quite the laboratory of genius the group would become on the following year's Dance to the Music. Taped seven months before the release of A Whole New Thing, the live recording features just one original, opener “I Ain't Got Nobody (For Real),” which would show up on Dance to the Music. The rest are contemporary soul covers the audience might've recognized, some of them very fresh to the charts at the time.

The stakes are high for this release: This is the first archival Sly release following his death in June at the age of 82. These recordings have been cherished by fans ever since the tapes began floating around in 2002, and snippets showed up in Questlove's Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius) documentary from earlier this year, but anyone hoping for a revelatory postmortem opening of the floodgates should adjust their expectations.

Better to understand The First Family in the context of what High Moon Recordings has been doing for quite some time—unearthing high-quality rarities from the hippie era, most auspiciously Love's lost '70s album Black Beauty. The First Family comes with a lovely booklet that reveals much about the Family Stone's pre-Dance to the Music early days, opening with the disclaimer that “the story of the Winchester Tapes does not concern the creative spurt that came once Sly & the Family Stone ascended the charts and crossed over into the consciousness of music fans the world over.”

But the audience can't see into the future, and at a show like this—and at a time when popular music was only just starting to be taken seriously as high art—the audience is ultimately what matters. “In church, this goes on,” Sly says in one of the interviews included with the booklet. “If you're talking about something and people will feel it, then boom, everybody claps right on time, it's unbelievable.”

The Stone (né Stewart) family belonged to the Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal denomination whose influence on Christian music has been incalculable. Artists with COGIC roots include Sister Rosetta Tharpe, CCM legend Andraé Crouch, and the Winans gospel dynasty. Sly and his siblings Freddie, Rose, and Vet grew up singing in church, and so strong was the link between the church and Black pop that even secular performers at the time were said to be “holding church” during performances.

These literal and metaphorical definitions of communion blend together on The First Family in a performance lusty enough to make room for a cartoon-wolf version of Junior Walker's “Pucker Up Buttercup” but otherwise fitting Sly's definition of “church” to a T. Given the level of energy on display, it seems incredible that this was a seated show, let alone that people weren't ripping their chairs out of their seats during a dazzling stop-and-start rendition of Ben E. King's “What Is Soul?” that's the heart and centerpiece of this disc. It seems even more incredible that the song was only two weeks old at the time, but as Sly's beloved Beatles taught us, there's nothing like a grueling residency to coax the flowering of genius.

One of the most crucial differences between this Family and the one most people know is that Sly's sister Rose hadn't joined yet. Her exuberant vocals are crucial to the communal feeling that made the Family feel so much like a family on record, even deep in Sly's despondent solo-auteur period during the '70s. If you want to present yourself as a utopian community, it's best to have as many voices joining in as possible, and Rose and Sly's interplay was essential to the all-hands-on-deck spirit that made Dance to the Music and its deliriously goofy follow-up Life so exciting.

On The First Family, the communal aspect comes instead from the audience, which can be heard clapping and voicing approval, and which seems especially jazzed about their eight-minute rendition of “Baby I Need Your Loving,” a 1964 Four Tops single whose cover by white rocker Johnny Rivers had entered the charts less than two months before. Funnily enough, Rivers claims to have auditioned Sly on bass for his band, but Sly didn't show up until the gig was already over—an early instance of a pattern of belated arrivals and no-shows from the singer that frustrated collaborators and crowds throughout his career.

The sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. The drums are way up in the mix, which is great when you're trying to hear what drummer and inexhaustible sample source Greg Errico is doing, but not so great when you're trying to hear Sly sing. To be fair, though, it doesn't sound that much worse than the shambolic Fillmore tapes recorded 18 months later, which include a version of “St. James Infirmary Blues” that's almost identical to the one here. Unlike Bay Area contemporaries Quicksilver Messenger Service and the Grateful Dead, this is not a band whose live recordings you need to seek out to get the full picture.

What The First Family does do well is situate the listener in a time and place that seems galaxies away from the one the Beatles would birth two months later when they put out Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. This was a world that prioritized skill over inspiration, where bands had to learn the latest hits to keep the crowd happy and got paid handsomely enough to master them on short notice. It might seem like a quaint world today, but tell that to the crowd at the Winchester Cathedral, itching to burst out of their seats.

On Friday nights, IndieWire After Dark honors fringe cinema in the streaming age with midnight movies from any moment in film history.

First, the BAIT: a weird genre pick and why we're exploring its specific niche right now. Then, the BITE: a spoiler-filled answer to the all-important question, “Is this old cult classic actually worth recommending?”

Warning: The following contains spoilers for “I Know What You Did Last Summer” (2025)
 










I genuinely want to know if anyone warned Jack Black about the post-credits scene in the new “I Know What You Did Last Summer.” He's not in it, but it's sure to draw attention to a mostly forgotten misfire from much earlier in the “Minecraft Movie” actor's career.

Black was 29 years old when he played Titus Telesco, a white Bahamian pool boy with a weed habit and dreads. Director Danny Cannon's 1998 sequel “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” was critically panned, and even diehard horror fans forget about the slasher series' zany second chapter. It's an expansion on the original story, set at a resort on a stormy island, that reunites final girl Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) with her love interest Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.) on screen one year after killer fisherman Ben Willis unleashed the Southport massacre. 

 










Their undergrad happiness ends when school breaks for summer. Julie and her best friend Karla Wilson (Brandy) win tickets to the Bahamas on the radio, but Ray won't come along because he has a job back home. The audience knows Freddie Prinze Charming will end up following Julie on vacation to propose marriage, but she'll complicate matters by finding a second suitor in her handsome classmate, Will Benson (Matthew Settle). 

Trapped inside a creepy resort by the weather, the twenty-somethings brew enough drama between them to fuel a dramatic feature. But when a new masked villain — once again donning a fisherman's hook, harpoon, and raincoat — starts terrorizing guests and locals, a note arrives for Julie with the hilarious message, “I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.” Translation? Someone still wants revenge for the hit-and-run accident in the first film. 

The original director Jim Gillespie stepped aside for Cannon on the sequel, and “Scream” genius Kevin Williamson handed his characters over to screenwriter Trey Callaway with mixed results. Still, the mediocre sequel has fresh wind in its sails thanks to director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson's sequel/reboot, which once again brings together Hewitt, Prinze, and several other familiar cast members in theaters. 

 










“I was watching you on the news, and you can't catch a damn break,” says Karla, after answering a surprise knock on her door near the requel's end. Better known in the movie world as Cinderella, Brandy made her genre debut in Cannon's slasher and she carries the hope of more “I Know What You Did Last Summer” sequels with her cameo in 2025. (The R&B pop sensation has only been in one other genre film, last year's profoundly hate-able “The Front Room” for A24.) 

“It isn't over,” says Julie, holding up a picture of the girls from college. 

Karla wastes no time fishing. She asks, “Who are we fucking up this time?” 

Nothing in “I Know What You Did Last Summer” (2025) technically qualifies as revisionist history, but the events of the earlier sequel are kept out of focus until this reunion. The spirit of that post-credits scene doesn't exactly line up with the movie it references (Brandy gets sidelined in the 1998 sequel more than I want to admit), but you should watch it for yourself. 

Sometimes painfully awkward but also wonderfully delusional, “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” opens with a scary dream in a Catholic confessional and goes sideways from there. Julie is wracked with guilt, but not even the ill-advised character Black plays should feel bad about this mostly harmless stinker of a movie — an artifact that shouldn't inspire nostalgia but… does?

 










Hinging on your knowledge of Brazilian geography (I swear to God), this violent maritime puzzle combines a silly whodunit with a shallow story that isn't as satisfying as the first film. That said, what it lacks in function it makes up for with a string of baffling creative decisions that are truly something to behold. Black's drug dealer character is the setting sun on that whacko horizon, doomed to die based on… well, everything about him… but he's on screen just long enough to ruin a jacuzzi makeout for Karla and her boyfriend, Ty (Mekhi Phifer). You'll be as annoyed as they are when Titus overstays his welcome, and his death is almost too dorky to take. But there's just something about him — floating in a pool, joint in his mouth, mysterious new fisherman lurking nearby — that people tend to like. 

Sure, Black is playing on dated archetypes in a movie that regrettably also includes a messy subplot about voodoo. (It's fine. You can ignore it. I give you permission.) But whether Black got that warning about the post-credits in the new requel or not, this particular performance coming back to haunt him really screams, “I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.” 

“I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” is now available to rent or buy on most platforms.
 










My critical opinion on the wildly divisive “Halloween Kills” from 2021 has waxed and waned over the years. But I maintain that too many of us fail to catch the intricate little details that make the best reboots that are specific to legacy sequels. 

No one remembers “Halloween II” like they remember the original “Halloween,” and even less can be said for fans of “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” compared to Gillespie's 1997 film. It makes sense that Easter eggs referencing follow-up movies many people haven't seen would fly over the casual viewer's head. But rewatching the “I Know What You Did Last Summer” sequel from 27 years ago, after having just seen the requel out this weekend, you gain a stronger appreciation for the homage as your commitment to the franchise deepens. 

In other words, you and Ray should've gotten your asses to the Bahamas long ago. (Yes, I am aware that the film was largely shot off the coast of Mexico. No one asked you.) 

From slapstick mannequin fake-outs to a Sarah Michelle Gellar cameo that could control tides, “I Know What You Did Last Summer” (2025) sets up the potential for a modern franchise that hasn't been confirmed but is fun to imagine. The requel ignores the events of the far lesser second sequel — the direct-to-video “I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer” from 2006  — and treats the history of Southport as a duology. 

 










There's no way you would know that going in, but if I have one regret looking back on my “B+” review of the new release, it's that I didn't recommend “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” strongly enough. There's plenty to be said about the emotional insight it offers fans into the dark romance of eventual divorcees, Julie and Ray. But it also draws out the vibrant goofiness that makes these movies' most devoted fans accept the arrival of a ghost on a beauty pageant float with a smile.

When Titus finally meets his demise, he's hitting a bong and the Fisherman pins his hand to the coffee table with a hook. As the murderer searches for another weapon, his victim squawks, “No! Seriously! Don't do that!” Caught somewhere between a stoner from the “School of Rock” and Kung Fu Panda on a tropical bender, Black is hilarious and decidedly camp. 

“I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” isn't very good, but the original isn't either. Gillespie directed Williamson's script (which was an intentional step away from horror comedy after “Scream”) as a melodrama. The property became beloved precisely because it lacked self-awareness in a way that audiences could laugh about. “I Know What You Did Last Summer” (2025) shares that sense of humor too, and if the series does continue, I hope they find a way to resurrect the spirit of Titus… even if Black shies away from a ghost cameo laced with THC.

Is Superman a pussy? Enlightened minds may disagree!

This, per an interview that Superman writer/director/producer/all-purpose PR man James Gunn gave to Josh Horowitz's Happy Sad Confused podcast this week, marking something like the end of his press tour odyssey promoting the film. Gunn, never the most taciturn guy, spoke openly about the battles waged while making the film—including what was apparently a pretty epic back-and-forth over whether Nathan Fillion's Guy Gardner would end up telling David Corenswet's Man Of Steel “Don't be such a pussy” at a key moment in the script. (In the finished film, Fillion says “wuss,” instead.)

Gunn describes the arguments that broke out over the word—which would have had Corenswet's Big Blue Boyscout chastise Gardner for the harsh language, apparently provoking a massive laugh from test audiences—as the biggest of the fights that came up during the movie's extensive edits. (The second-biggest: The decision of how to resolve one of the movie's weirder plotlines, Jimmy Olsen's reluctant rekindling of a relationship with selfie-shooting whistleblower Eve; Skyler Gisondo was reportedly asked to deploy a whole range of facial expressions when reacting to Sara Simpaio hugging him at the end of the movie, from happy acceptance to “staring into the void.”) Gunn mostly seems amused by the debates, but also makes it clear that they were real, genuine arguments. (See also a fight about whether to showcase Superman saving a squirrel in the midst of a massive kaiju fight; some people in test audiences really did not like the squirrel rescue.)

﻿

But while he mostly restrained himself to comments about the movie itself—including jokingly referring to Corenswet as his personal Krypto and “prodigal son,” after he and the actor went back and forth frequently over how to handle certain pivotal scenes—Gunn did venture into a bit of wider DC drama. Most interestingly, that includes addressing the moment when he and fellow DC Studios head Peter Safran had to bring Henry Cavill in to tell him he wasn't Superman anymore. Which was a conversation made a lot more awkward by the fact that Cavill had, literally on the day that Gunn and Safran had closed their deals to take over the studio (with a plan for a fresh, younger Superman in their pockets) stated on social media that he'd been given the green light by Warner Bros. to say he was coming back to the character after a multi-year absence. (Gunn, a diplomat, never mentions Black Adam star Dwayne Johnson by name here, but does note, with a wry expression, that there was a “vacuum” at Warner Bros. that meant certain people were trying to “force their way.”) Gunn calls the whole thing a “bummer” for Cavill, and reiterates what was said back in 2022, i.e., that he'd love to cast the actor somewhere else in the wider DCU.

As we've noted before, one of the genuinely enjoyable things about Gunn being in such a position of power at the moment is that he's even freer to speak his mind than usual, and the HSC interview is a great example of how candid the man can get. (He claims to have genuinely not noticed any parallels between Superman's travails at the hands of internet trolls and his own well-documented ones, for instance, and details a scene so darkly funny, between Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor and Zlatko Burić's Vasil Ghurkos, that he knew it had to be cut basically as soon as he saw it in the edits—but still can't help but break down laughing as he describes it.)

The film is currently in production, and the actress' role will be recast.

Michael B. Jordan‘s The Thomas Crown Affair is moving forward despite losing one of its stars, Taylor Russell. 


	Russell will reportedly no longer star in The Thomas Crown Affair due to creative differences, and the Bones and All actress' role will be recast, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. The film is currently in production in London.




The Thomas Crown Affair, which Jordan directs and stars in, is a remake of the 1968 film of the same name, starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. Drew Pearce (The Fall Guy, Hotel Artemis) wrote the script following a previous draft written by Wes Tooke and Justin Britt-Gibson.

	Russell was originally set to star opposite Jordan. The Thomas Crown Affair cast also includes Kenneth Branagh, Lily Gladstone, Danai Gurira, Pilou Asbæk and Aiysha Hart. Jordan, Elizabeth Raposo, Patrick McCormick and Marc Toberoff will produce. Alan Trustman, who wrote the original film, serves as an executive producer.

	Up next for Russell, she is set to star in the Korean thriller Hope by Na Hong-jin, alongside Michael Fassbender, Alicia Vikander and Jung Ho-yeon. She will also co-star with David Jonsson in the upcoming Frank Ocean film. Additionally, Russell is in talks to star in a remake of Single White Female opposite Jenna Ortega for 3000 Pictures.


The Thomas Crown Affair from Amazon MGM Studios will release in theaters on March 5, 2027. 

	











Deadline was first to report the news of Russell leaving the film.

	As David Corenswet takes on the red cape for James Gunn‘s Superman, DCU fans could still see Henry Cavill return in another role.


	The DC Studios boss recently said he “would love” to cast Cavill in his DCU as he recounted how he and co-chair Peter Safran broke the news to the “absolute gentleman” of an actor that he would no longer be playing Clark Kent in the franchise.


	“It's terrible. Believe it or not, the day we were dealing with trying to figure out if we could take the job at DC Studios,” recalled Gunn on the Happy Sad Confused podcast. “The day the deal closed, all of a sudden, they were announcing that Henry was back. And I was like, ‘What is going on? We know what the plan is. The plan was to come in and do Superman.' It was really unfair to him and a total bummer.”

	When he and Safran were tapped to co-head DC Studios in 2022, Gunn said, “There was a vacuum at the time and a lot of people were… They had a take on what they wanted to do at DC and they were trying to force their way and it was just never part of the equation for [WBD CEO] David Zaslav. We came in, and that was really unfortunate. I'm like, ‘This poor guy.'”


	Gunn and Safran then “sat down” with Cavill to break the news. “He was an absolute gentleman and a great guy about it,” recalled Gunn. “He said, ‘The only thing I ask is that I'm able to reveal it myself as opposed to coming from you guys.' And I'm like, ‘That's a class act.'”


	And although Corenswet has taken over as the Man of Steel, Cavill could still pop up in the new DCU. “I talked to him about it on that day. I would love to put Henry in something,” said Gunn.


	Since taking over DC Studios with Safran, Superman marks the first entry in his new DCU franchise, which begins with the ‘Gods and Monsters' phase.

Cavil is by far tne best superman since Reeve…..Gunn knows how to ruin good things

It's going to be a crap film anyways, so it's fine, Henrys reputation will stay intact.

They should have had him play Ultraman.  What a missed opportunity.

Summer 2026… Henry Cavill is super Batman!

Gunn will know what it feels like soon enough. Superman has cratered overseas and will likely only do around 35% or less of its worldwide tally from foreign box office. It is DOA.

The seven-member global group made their Coachella debut this April, showcasing their dynamic performance skills to a new audience: “We poured our hearts into it.” 


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	Girl group XG has been leading the charge in the global pop space since their debut three years ago.


	The seven-piece hip-hop and R&B-inspired group — made up of members Jurin, Chisa, Hinata, Harvey, Juria, Maya and Cocona — debuted in 2022 with the single “Tippy Toes.” In the time since the undeniably catchy song, XG has ventured into an array of different genres with songs like the rap-heavy “Woke Up” to the Y2K-feeling “Left Right” and “Shooting Star.”




	Formed by Japanese entertainment company XGLAX, a global fanbase has always been XG's target. The seven-piece outfit took yet another step forward on the global stage this past April, making their Coachella debut to much fanfare.

	The women of XG stopped by The Hollywood Reporter's L.A. office to discuss Coachella, their recent single “Million Places,” their world tour and what they hope for the future.


Can you tell me about your experience at Coachella?


MAYA We're still not over how amazing Coachella was. The energy was just so crazy, and it was our first time ever going to Coachella. It was one of our dream stages and it's one of the biggest music festivals in the world, so we were so grateful and honored to be able to perform [at the festival]. There were so many Alphaz who came to watch our performance, so we're grateful for them.

	











What were preparations for Coachella like? How long were you were preparing — there were obviously things you couldn't prepare for, like a windy stage.


MAYA Super windy.


CHISA Coachella is a stage we've been dreaming about for so long. We worked on the setlist together, focusing on the transitions between the songs too. Since it was a band adaptation, we basically built the stage from scratch. We also worked on a new choreography; a dance routine called “Shinobi.” We practiced all this after arriving in L.A. We rearranged the MC for Coachella too. We are doing a world now [that has] a different setlist. This Coachella-exclusive setlist shows everything great about us. We practiced over and over again — we even changed the setlist at the very last moment. We poured our hearts into it. It was fun, but very windy, much more than we expected. We had a blast. The vibe was awesome and very festive. But we need to solve the wind problem, so you may see some changes during week two. (This interview was conducted between week one and week two.)


You all looked like you were having so much fun. Were there any surprise moments on stage for any of you?


COCONA During “Is This Love,” although it was just for a moment, there's this scene where we wave flowers. The audience also waved with their lightsticks. They danced to “Left Right” like this [motions hands from left to right]. In the last part, some were dancing along with us. I saw many Alphaz in the front row — they were shouting “XG,” which made us really happy. We were more focused at Coachella compared to [our recent] world tour, so we weren't able to interact with our fans as we usually do. But even with the in-ears [in], I could hear them cheering and singing. I was excited to see new people dancing along with us. During “IYKYK,” they were like “Wooo!” It was a happy surprise.

	











Is there anything you learned from the experience? Even if just from week one to week two?


JURIA We've got tons. It went beyond our expectations. Since Coachella is held outdoors, the wind felt strong, as we mentioned earlier. I wore my hair down because I like it that way. But my face got covered with the wind. There were many other incidents partly because it was outdoors. I'll take this as a lesson and wear my hair up next time. It was a valuable learning experience. Performing in a different environment from the world tour taught us so many things. Performing at an outdoor festival like Coachella was such a huge honor.


Can you tell me about “Million Places?”


JURIN We've [been] touring around the world for about a year. This song is filled with the precious moments we shared with Alphaz. The song and lyrics, for example, reflect our visit to the U.S. and what we experienced in Paris. This song is filled with memories of what we've actually been through. This song will take Alphaz back to the world tour. It's going to be a special song. I'm very sure about this.


CHISA It's a moving track. 


What was your experience touring the world like? Can you share how you were able to go through this experience together and about some of your favorite moments?


HINATA During the world tour, we worked together to build the stage. That experience gave us a deeper sense of responsibility and it made our bond even stronger.


CHISA We held space meetings, right?

	











HINATA We simply talked, nothing formal. We had plenty of communication [with one another].


JURIN On top of that, the World Tour and, of course, Coachella have been our dreams since our debut. It's like we've hit a major milestone. It reminds us of our trainee days when we got through difficult moments together. Everything we've been through is precious. Each time, we celebrate together by sharing meals, for instance. Those small moments make us happy. We've begun to realize how valuable these experiences have been. It's a great motivation for us.


You've already hit a lot of milestones as a group. What are your aspirations going forward? Do you have a big dream you're working towards?


HARVEY There are so many goals we want to achieve, both as a team and as individuals. The most important thing, I believe, is that we enjoy what we do every day. We can already do that, so I'd love to keep that going from now on. Since 2025, I've been feeling that. Since we've always valued the idea of enjoying the moment. I think that makes the “just do it” mindset [we have] feel even more important. We feel nervous and anxious when trying something new, but the seven of us can pull it off if we just do it. Each of us has unique senses and talents. It gives us the confidence to keep chasing our goals and dreams. My biggest goal for the seven of us is to perform at the Super Bowl.


As XG, you've been able to explore different genres and try new things. How would you describe the group's true musical identity? 












CHISA Space is a core part of our identity. It's reflected in many of our songs. Of course, the wolf-motif, too. We always say, “Let's head to outer space.” Space is infinite [and] nothing is impossible. Our music embodies infinite possibilities. I would say [what defines our music] is outer space, infinity and the idea that nothing is impossible.


What was it like to be able to see so many of your fans, Alphaz, at Coachella and around the world on the tour? Many of them have been supporting you from afar, but you were finally able to meet them up close.


MAYA It was such an amazing feeling. I think seeing so many of our Alphaz show up to our concert just to have fun, have the time of their lives [and] enjoy our music together means so much to us. I feel like our Alphaz are so cute and they have the best energy. I feel like every time we see each other, it's something new. Throughout this world tour, I feel like we built this relationship where we can't be separated, we're always together. “Million Places” is a song about that, about all the precious and special moments we had with our Alphaz. I'm hoping our Alphaz get teary [or] get emotional by hearing this song. It's a beautiful song and I'm really excited to sing song together.

"The witches are back,” the ‘Babygirl' star wrote in a heartfelt Instagram post. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	The witches are officially back! 


	To celebrate their first day on the set of the Practical Magic sequel, Nicole Kidman shared a heartfelt video on Instagram of herself and Sandra Bullock shooting for the film. 




	“The witches are back. Owens sisters' first day on set! #PracticalMagic,” the Babygirl star wrote in the caption of the post, while The Lost City actress can be heard saying, “Turns out, we have a lot of work to do.”

	Kidman and Bullock first starred as Sally and Gillian Owens, two sister witches who are plagued with a family curse that kills the men they fall in love with, in the 1998 film helmed by Griffin Dunne. Practical Magic 2 will be directed by Susanne Bier, whom Bullock has worked with on Bird Box and Kidman on The Perfect Couple.

A post shared by Nicole Kidman (@nicolekidman)


	Of working with Bier on Practical Magic 2, Kidman said it was like “the perfect triangle” for the trio to work together on the film, due to the director's past work with both actresses. She explained, “Sandy's worked with her, too, so the two of us were like, well, this is the perfect triangle because we all know each other so well and so to be able to work together on something that is fun and witchy.”


Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing are set to reprise their roles as the Owens aunts (who raise the sisters after their parents pass) in the follow-up. New additions to the cast include Joey King, Lee Pace, Maisie Williams, Xolo Maridueña and Solly McLeod.

	











	Evan Rachel Wood, who played Bullock's character's daughter in the first film, revealed that she was not asked to come back for Practical Magic 2. “l offered my services, even if it was one scene or one line. I was told they are recasting. I am sorry to disappoint the fans. It was not in my control or my choice. I would have happily rejoined my sisters,” she wrote on her Instagram Stories in July.


	Akiva Goldman, a co-writer of the 1998 movie, co-wrote the sequel script alongside Georgia Pritchett. Bullock and Kidman, too, serve as producers with Denise Di Novi (who also worked on the original Practical Magic). 


Practical Magic 2 will hit theaters on Sept. 18, 2026.

Winning isn't everything, and in the case of one “Dancing With the Stars” runner-up, he's actually glad he didn't take home the Mirrorball Trophy. Find out why “DWTS” season 27 contestant Milo Manheim is fine with second place.

Manheim and his “DWTS” season 27 dance pro partner Witney Carson came in second, but he wasn't too torn up about losing.

During a July 2025 appearance on “The Zach Sang Show,” Manheim was asked if he's “haunted” by the loss. “To be honest, I feel like getting second place worked out in my favor because I'm reminded to this day that I was robbed,” he shared.

The “Zombie” star continued, “People come up all the time now and they're just like, ‘You killed ‘Dancing with the Stars.' And I don't think I would be getting that validation had I won.”

Manheim added, “So it's really nice.”

He also addressed how the “DWTS” voting system changed after his loss to Bobby Bones, who scored lower than Manheim.

“I will say that I was grateful that they changed the voting system after that year,” the actor noted. “So the fact that I was able to make them look at the system a little bit, that's the best thing I could have possibly hoped for.”

A post shared by Milo (@milomanheim)

Manheim has discussed his “Zombies” co-star Chandler Kinney coming in third place during “DWTS” season 33.

“I wasn't even worried for Chandler. I was like, ‘All right, she's going to avenge me.' And then, same thing happened to her. I mean, I don't want to say rigged 'cause it's not rigged. I'm not saying that.”

He added, “But I will say, I don't know, maybe it's just bias, but Chandler killed that thing and we just know how amazing she is at dancing.”

In a July 2025 interview with Us Weekly, Manheim gave his take on a possible curse. “You know the ‘Zombies' curse on ‘Dancing With the Stars' is we're always going to be runner-up,” he said.

As for the “Zombies” co-stars he would love to see take a spin on “DWTS,” the actor shared, “I would either send Meg [Donnelly] if she wanted to do it because [she] would redeem it for all of us and go win, or I would love to see Trevor [Tordjman]. Not even because he's a good dancer — because he is a fantastic dancer — but because of who he is. I think he would just kill.”

50 Cent‘s publishing company is suing the rapper's ex-girlfriend Shaniqua Tompkins over Instagram videos that it says violate a life rights agreement she signed over nearly 20 years ago.


	The lawsuit alleges Tompkins' videos violated a life rights agreement made in 2007 for $80,000 that gave G-Unit Books the exclusive rights to publicize her life story and a percentage of royalties from related projects. The complaint states that Tompkins, dated the rapper, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, between the 1990s and mid-2000s. They also share a son, Marquise.


	“Jackson purchased these rights to preserve them for use in future biographical or autobiographical projects, but also in part because he was concerned that Tompkins would attempt to monetize their history and his name,” reads the complaint, per Billboard. “His concerns were ultimately proven correct.”


	The lawsuit claims she was “contractually prohibited” from using said information for financial gain, alleging that the videos had “diminish[ed] the value of the exclusive rights it acquired and undermin[ed] its ability to develop and market future works based on those rights.”

	The lawsuit seeks $1 million in damages and an injunction to force her to quit posting the videos and remove content related to Jackson that has already been posted.

	Tompkins and a rep for Jackson did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment. However, the artist addressed the lawsuit by posting a screengrab from TMZ and attacked his ex's appearance: “I didn't realize how much she looks like me, girl you handsome with them baby hairs,” he wrote.

	











	This marks 50's second lawsuit in the past few months. In April, he sued the producers of an upcoming horror film Skillhouse, claiming he was never paid for his role. The lawsuit alleges that Jackson agreed to film his scenes in Skillhouse before finalizing and signing off on his contract, as he assumed he and producers would eventually work out a deal. However, a deal was allegedly never reached, and the rapper said he hasn't been compensated.

Led by Netease Cloud Music and Tencent Music Entertainment, the 20-company Billboard Global Music Index rose 3.0% for the week ended July 18.  


													By
												

	Glenn Peoples



Chinese music streaming stocks continued their upward trajectory this week as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing showed signs of easing. Netease Cloud Music rose 12.1% to 302.40 HKD ($38.55), bringing the Chinese music streamer's July gain to an impressive 25.5% and its year-to-date improvement to 164.8%. Tencent Music Entertainment (TME), China's leading music streaming company, rose 8.3% to $21.43, valuing the company at $36.8 billion and bringing its year-to-date increase to 71.9%. 


	Cloud Music and TME shares have both benefited from solid first-quarter results and growing consumer interest in music subscriptions. Chinese stocks in general received a boost this week after the U.S. government eased export bans and allowed the sale of Nvidia's AI chips to China. In addition, Chinese data showed that China's gross domestic product grew 5.2% in the second quarter despite continued trade tensions. 


	The 20-company Billboard Global Music Index (BGMI) rose 3.0% to 2,982.90, breaking a two-week losing streak and improving its year-to-date gain to 40.4%. The BGMI nearly doubled the Nasdaq composite index's 1.7% increase and was well ahead of the S&P 500's 0.6% gain. In the U.K., the FTSE 100 rose 0.6%. South Korea's KOSPI composite index advanced 0.4%. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Warner Music Group (WMG) continued its winning streak, jumping 4.9% to $31.22 and getting a boost from Rothschild & Co Redburn's upgrade of WMG to “neutral” from “sell” on Tuesday (July 15). After reaching the mid-year mark down 12.1%, WMG shares have gained 14.6% since the company's July 1 announcement that it will save $300 million annually from layoffs and other cost-cutting measures. The company will announce earnings on Aug. 7. 


	Most live music stocks were in positive territory. Sphere Entertainment Co. spiked 7.6% to $46.15, the stock's highest closing price since Feb. 21 and more than $22 higher than its low point after President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners on April 3. Live Nation climbed 4.6% to $150.52, bringing the stock to within approximately 5% of its all-time high of $157.75. MSG Entertainment was up 2.0% to $40.25. CTS Eventim fell 1.3% to 103.90 euros ($120.82), but the German concert promoter's 27.3% year-to-date gain was the best of the peer group. 


	Shares of Abu Dhabi-based music streamer Anghami rose 2.1% to $0.49 after the company announced on Wednesday that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders to vote on a reverse stock split that will allow the stock to remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market exchange. The company has until Aug. 18 to achieve a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share for at least 10 consecutive business days. 


	SiriusXM shares fell 2.7% to $23.56 after Wednesday's announcement of an affordable, ad-supported satellite radio tier, SiriusXM Play, that will cost under $7 per month. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on SiriusXM on Wednesday (July 16) to $22 from $21 and kept its “underweight” rating.


	With HYBE in the news over a federal probe into Chairman Bang Si-hyuk, the K-pop giant's stock fell 1.1% to 268,000 KRW ($192.98), marking it third consecutive weekly decline. At least one analyst was optimistic this week: On Thursday (July 17), Nomura increased its price target for HYBE shares to 370,000 KRW ($266.42) from 270,000 KRW ($194.42) and maintained its “buy” rating. HYBE will announce its second quarter results on Aug. 6. 


	Spotify shares dipped 2.0% to $695.18, the fourth consecutive weekly decline after closing at $772.60 on June 27. After reaching the mid-year mark with a 71.4% gain, Spotify has dropped 9.4% in July. The company will report earnings on July 29.

	After he was accused of rape in April, Shannon Sharpe has reportedly settled the Jane Doe's civil lawsuit on undisclosed terms.


	The accuser's attorney Tony Buzbee announced Friday that the lawsuit will be dismissed now that they have “reached a mutually agreed upon resolution” with the 3x Super Bowl champion and sportscaster.


	“On April 20, 2025, The Buzbee Law Firm filed a complaint in Nevada making several allegations against Shannon Sharpe on behalf of our client,” wrote Buzbee on X. “Both sides acknowledge a long-term consensual and tumultuous relationship. After protracted and respectful negotiations, I'm pleased to announce that we have reached a mutually agreed upon resolution. All matters have now been addressed satisfactorily, and the matter is closed. The lawsuit will thus be dismissed with prejudice.”

	











	Following the April lawsuit, Sharpe denied the allegations and asserted that incidents of rape, choking and more in the 13-page civil suit are being taken out of context and were consensual. His attorney called the complaint a “blatant and cynical attempt to shake down Mr. Sharpe for millions of dollars.

	Attorneys for both sides confirmed that Sharpe had previously offered $10 million in attempt to convince the accuser not to file the lawsuit.

Narrator: It wasn't a lie.

10 millions settlement offer is outrageous for something that's supposed to be a lie.

Did you feel this way when Trump paid Stormy Daniels $130,000 but still denied having sex with her?

There's no way Disney takes him back. Paying his accuser to drop the suit is a terrible look.

Oh please, there's a convicted felon, who was also found liable for sexual abuse and defamation, in the White House. Sharpe isn't going anywhere

So all standards of decency are abandoned now? Does everyone get a pass for sexual assault?

Fact check: true.

 Fox News correspondent Kevin Corke has the latest on the investigation on 'Fox News Live.'

In an article published Friday, The Washington Post editorial board linked misinformation from President Joe Biden's administration to a growing acceptance of conspiracy theories among the American public.

The editorial argued that the Biden administration's efforts to pressure social media companies into suppressing the information contained on Hunter Biden's laptop, as well as covering up for the former president's apparent cognitive decline, has led to the public losing trust in government institutions.

"In 2020, a group of 51 former intelligence officials shredded their credibility by signing a public letter insisting the release of Hunter Biden's emails ‘has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.' The laptop that contained them was authentic. Joe Biden's campaign knew that when it pressured social media companies to suppress stories about its damaging contents. These same operatives also covered up Biden's decline in hopes of winning in 2024," the editorial board insisted.

Fox News Digital reached out to representatives of the former president for comment. 

The editorial was titled, "Conspiracy theories take root when government misleads." 

According to the Post, this mistrust of the government among the public started a long time ago and has only gotten worse as time went on.

They noted that at the time Lee Harvey Oswald killed former President John F. Kennedy, three-quarters of Americans trusted the federal government to do the right thing, at least most of the time. From 2007 on, that number has never eclipsed 30%.

The Post tied this drop-off in trust to the United States' preemptive invasion of Iraq, "based on cherry-picked intelligence about weapons of mass destruction."

"Trump's 2016 victory was partly a response to these and other failures," they argued.

The editorial board speculated that previous fumbles of the public's trust, such as the Pentagon Papers and the federal government's stonewalling surrounding the CIA's connection to Oswald, have exacerbated the public's suspicions of President Donald Trump's handling of the Epstein files.

Citing a Reuters-Ipsos poll released this week, 69% of Americans believe that the federal government is hiding details about the Epstein files. Another poll, by CNN, showed that only 3% of Americans are satisfied with the information the government has released about the case.

While the Post editorial board is critical of the government's propensity to erode its trust with the public by misleading them with misinformation, it doesn't believe that the government should start releasing information "willy-nilly" to satisfy conspiracy theorists. 

"Even if the full Epstein file were opened and revealed nothing of interest to the public, it probably would not deter fabulists from spinning new theories," they asserted. "But Americans would not be so receptive to such theorizing had elite institutions avoided some of their spectacular stumbles — or if U.S. leaders refrained from amplifying them. The government's long-term challenge is to rebuild trust with the public. At the moment, too many officials are eroding it further."

Stranger Things star Winona Ryder has revealed she has seen a UFO in real life. The actress, Joyce Byers in the hit supernatural drama series, also had a paranormal episode that made her believe she is psychic.

Winona, 53, said: “I've had two ‘experiences'... once, when I was about seven or eight, me, my brothers and my sister were sleeping on the roof and we think we saw a UFO.

“There was a boomerang going back and forth, but it could have really been anything. It could have been a light, but we were convinced it was a UFO.”

Netflix show Stranger Things has been a worldwide smash and returns for its fifth and final season at the end of this year. In it Winona's character Joyce hunts for her 12-year-old son Will after he vanishes mysteriously.

It is discovered he has gone to an alternate dimension they refer to as the Upside Down. A portal to this other world was created after secret experiments with the paranormal and supernatural by boffins.

The search is aided by a young psychokinetic girl named Eleven, played by Brit actress Millie Bobby Brown, who escaped a nearby lab.

In an interview with SFX magazine, Winona said another eerie incident happened when she had a vision just like Eleven.

She said: “Do you remember Samantha Smith? When Reagan was president, she was 12 years old and she wrote a letter to Reagan and Gorbachev. She asked for peace and it got a lot of attention.

“She was a beautiful young girl and I had her picture on my wall, but she very tragically died in a plane crash.

“The night before she died, I had a dream that I was on a plane sitting next to her – and something was wrong.

“I woke up and I went into the kitchen and told my parents, but I guess it had just come on the news because my mom dropped her coffee cup.

“After that, I was convinced I was psychic and that every dream meant something, but it never happened again. But that was very unexplained and strange.”

Rivera's cause of death is pending and autopsy results are expected in about 8-10 weeks

New England Society for Psychic Research

 No, the allegedly “possessed” Annabelle doll was not in the hotel room where paranormal investigator Dan Rivera died earlier this week, according to a Pennsylvania coroner.


 In a Friday, July 18, message to PEOPLE, Francis Dutrow, the Adams County coroner confirmed that the doll was not present when he arrived at the scene on Sunday, July 13, when authorities were notified about Rivera's death. Dutrow went on to note that the doll had not been in the hotel room at all. 


 Rivera, a lead investigator for the Connecticut-based New England Society for Psychic Research, was in Gettysburg. Pa., last weekend with Annabelle as part of the Devils on the Run tour when he died at the age of 54. 


 The Pennsylvania State Police shared a report on Wednesday, July 16, detailing what happened.


 “Members from PSP Gettysburg responded to a hotel in Straban Township, Adams County for a report of a deceased [man]," officials said. "The decedent was discovered in his hotel room by workers.”


 “Nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene,” the agency added. His cause of death is pending.


 Dutrow earlier told PEOPLE that Rivera had been with colleagues on Sunday morning but said he was feeling sick and was going back to his room. 


 It's unclear what Rivera may have been ill with and further information is pending his autopsy results, which are expected in about 8-10 weeks.

 According to the New England Society for Psychic Research's website, Anabelle's origin goes back to 1968, when a student nurse was gifted the doll and brought it to the home where she lived with her roommate. 


 “Almost immediately, the roommates noticed strange occurrences with the doll and they were introduced to a medium who told them the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle,” the organization wrote. “The two roommates tried to accept the doll's spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent.”


 The society added that its founders, paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, were called in and determined that Annabelle was “demonically possessed.” They took the doll from the home and stored it in a glass box “to contain the evil spirited entity.”


 The story of Annabelle and the Warrens led to the development of the horror film franchise The Conjuring.


 In a statement later shared with PEOPLE on Tuesday, July 15, the New England Society for Psychic Research, which first confirmed the death on social media, paid tribute to Rivera. 


 “Dan was not only a vital part of our team for over a decade, but also a deeply compassionate, loyal, and dedicated friend,” they wrote.


 “His integrity, creativity, and generosity defined him. Dan's passion for the paranormal was rooted in a genuine desire to educate, help, and connect with others — whether through social media, conventions, or investigations with local families seeking understanding and peace,” the society continued.

 “We understand that Dan's work inspired fascination and curiosity for many, but above all, he was a father, devoted husband, and loyal friend, someone who meant the world to those closest to him,” the statement added.


 According to a Facebook post by Ryan Buell, the host of A&E's Paranormal State, Rivera, who was an Army veteran, is survived by his wife and children.

UFO sightings have plummeted across Britain - because people are too glued to their mobile phones. Having previously been bombarded with hundreds of 999 calls over flying saucers, a police probe suggests UFO reports have dried up in the past year.

Some forces - like Cheshire and Gwent - revealed they had no record of any close encounters so far in 2025. It is a far cry from the galactic goggling in the 80s and 90s, when the likes of The X Files had Brits scouring the stars for little green men.

However, Britain's leading UFO investigator thinks we are still being visited by extraterrestrials - just that we've stopped noticing.

Russ Kellett, from Yorkshire, who has been abducted dozens of times, said: “There are plenty of aliens and UFOs out there, but people are too distracted to notice.

“People are too busy looking down to see what is above us. There have always been highs and lows with UFO reports - I'm currently looking at a strange report of a flying saucer landing in Scarborough a few years back - so the truth is out there.

“But the only way we will ever find it is by watching the skies - not social media.”

The Daily Star Sunday's exclusive findings follow Freedom of Information requests to forces across the UK, which previously unearthed hundreds of reports - ranging from mysterious flashing lights to one person in Belfast beamed aboard a UFO while taking a ciggie break.

Yet reports have dried up; Even in Wiltshire - the UK's crop circle capital - cops confirmed they had no record of any spooky sightings so far this year.

However, some forces did disclose details, including one caller in Northampton who had been beamed aboard a UFO - then kidnapped by bigfoot.

Even five years after its conclusion, Supernatural remains incredibly popular on streaming, proving that we need a revival now more than ever. Following monster-hunting brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester, Supernatural ran for an impressive fifteen seasons on the CW, delivering 327 episodes.

Supernatural finally came to an end in 2020, with a finale that was divisive among fans. Still, the short-lived semi-prequel series, The Winchesters, proved that there were more stories to tell in the Supernatural universe. While The Winchesters may have chosen to focus on the wrong characters, a Supernatural revival with Sam and Dean would undoubtedly be a success, as evidenced by the show's continued popularity on streaming.

Nielsen recently released their list of the top twenty streaming programs for the first half of 2025, and Supernatural made an appearance as number fifteen on the list. Most of the other shows with streaming success had either recently aired new episodes or are still ongoing series, making Supernatural's ranking even more impressive.

 While Supernatural developed a passionate fan base throughout its fifteen-season run on the CW, it continues to find new fans on streaming services like Netflix. The show may have ended five years ago, but its fanbase has only continued to grow. Ackles and Padalecki have both found success in other projects, but for many, they will always be Dean and Sam Winchester.

 Soon after Supernatural came to an end, fans began speculating about whether the series was truly over for good. Padalecki, Ackles, and Misha Collins all seem open to return for a potential revival, and Supernatural's continued popularity proves that fans would undoubtedly tune in.

Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, and Misha Collins are set to reunite on screen in the upcoming final season of Prime Videos The Boys.

Although Dean Winchester was tragically killed in Supernatural's finale, he has returned from the dead numerous times before. The Winchesters even checked in with Dean after his death, as he continued saving the multiverse from Heaven. The death of one of the main characters may have stopped other shows from returning for a revival, but not Supernatural.

Supernatural fans have long hoped to see the show renewed for season 16, but there's one significant obstacle currently preventing a revival.

With Supernatural's extensive mythology and unique combination of genres, the possibilities for a revival are truly endless. Fan interest in the series has clearly not waned, and the Supernatural multiverse has plenty of stories that have yet to be fully explored.

Supernatural's continued success proves that you can't keep the Winchesters down for long, and it seems almost inevitable that Sam and Dean Winchester will return to our screens at some point, hopefully in the not-too-distant future.

In a gripping account that blurs the line between the natural and the supernatural, animation director Larry Whitaker—whose credits include “Tiny Tunes” and “Space Jam”—recalled a chilling experience that left him shaken and transformed. Speaking with L.A. Marzulli, Whitaker described a spiritual encounter while staying in Thiruvananthapuram, India. What began as an ordinary business trip quickly turned into a vivid confrontation with evil beyond the physical realm.

Whitaker awoke in the middle of the night to find the lights in his room dimming unnaturally. What followed was a sight he says defies scientific explanation: a dense black mass, thicker than any natural shadow, began sweeping through the room. It moved with intelligence and purpose, not like fog or smoke, but as something alive. He described it as “blacker than black,” a volumetric darkness that carried an unmistakable malevolent presence.

As the entity advanced, tendrils of it reached out toward him—one touching his tongue. The sensation, Whitaker said, was like a powerful electric shock that left him paralyzed. In that terrifying moment, unable to move or speak clearly, something inside him rose up. He managed to say, “The Lord is holy.” At that declaration, the darkness reacted violently. It instantly flattened out and exited the room in a flash, as if repelled by the holiness of God's name.

Still shaken the next day, Whitaker shared the event with Christian friends, who believed it may have been a form of spiritual retaliation. Earlier during his trip, he had boldly refused to participate in a local Shiva festival and had instead told a young Indian boy, “Remember Jesus.” It was a seemingly innocent comment, but one that could have stirred spiritual opposition in a region steeped in strong religious traditions.

The spiritual tension didn't end there. The following day, while washing his hands at a seaside restaurant, Whitaker heard an unnatural growling sound emanating from a dead palm tree behind him. With no one else around and no animals in sight, he spoke against it, and the noise stopped.

In another moment of supernatural intervention, Whitaker shared how he once heard a voice while driving tell him to slow down. Seconds later, a herd of deer darted across the road—an accident narrowly avoided. These experiences, he believes, underscore the reality of spiritual warfare and divine protection for believers.

Whitaker's experience serves as a sobering reminder of the unseen battle that rages around us and the authority believers have through our faith in Christ. As Whitaker put it, “I didn't fight it. I just declared who God was—and that was enough.”
