                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But new University of Colorado Boulder research shows the popular sugar substitute and specialty food additive comes with serious downsides, impacting brain cells in numerous ways that can boost risk of stroke. "Our study adds to the evidence suggesting that non-nutritive sweeteners that have generally been purported to be safe, may not come without negative health consequences," said senior author Christopher DeSouza, professor of integrative physiology and director of the Integrative Vascular Biology Lab. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001, erythritol is a sugar alcohol, often produced by fermenting corn and found in hundreds of products. It has almost no calories, is about 80% as sweet as table sugar, and has negligible impact on insulin levels, making it a favorite for people trying to lose weight, keep their blood sugar in check or avoid carbohydrates. But recent research has begun to shed light on its risks. One recent study involving 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe found that men and women with higher circulating levels of erythritol were significantly more likely to have a heart attack or stroke within the next three years. DeSouza and first author Auburn Berry, a graduate student in his lab, set out to understand what might be driving that increased risk. The erythritol-treated cells also produced more reactive oxygen species (ROS), a.k.a. "Our research demonstrates not only that, but how erythritol has the potential to increase stroke risk." DeSouza notes that their study used only a serving-size worth of the sugar substitute. For those who consume multiple servings per day, the impact, presumably, could be worse. That said, De Souza encourages consumers to read labels, looking for erythritol or "sugar alcohol" on the label. "Given the epidemiological study that inspired our work, and now our cellular findings, we believe it would be prudent for people to monitor their consumption of non-nutrient-sweeteners such as this one," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>E. coli outbreaks in romaine lettuce have long been a public health concern. and now a new Cornell University paper suggests that a combination of efforts in the field, and even postharvest techniques, can minimize risk to human health. "This study supports that interventions should focus on reducing produce contamination via contaminated irrigation water, on assuring that produce washes applied during processing consistently deliver reasonably high reductions of bacterial numbers, and on improving temperature control during distribution," Wiedmann said. "We tried to describe the system as holistically as possible to account for different risk factors and how they could have interactions," Ivanek said. "There's not just one intervention that will save us all. We spent a lot of time trying to understand the preharvest component, especially the irrigation water piece and how much risk can be explained by that." "While not the most common system, spray irrigation is used in a number of fields for its benefits during germination, its cooling effect on plants and other reasons. But drip or furrow irrigation reduces the probability that water directly touches the leaves," Ivanek said, acknowledging that switching to these other irrigation systems introduces significant potential additional costs to grower. The comprehensive practices and interventions explored in this study intend to aid decision-makers in establishing and enhancing food safety best management practices, Ivanek said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We may earn commission if you buy from a link. And over the years, scientists have tried to get a clearer picture of that prehistoric story by excavating ancient human sites around the world. H. juluensis—the name for which means “big head”—thrived in eastern Asia from 300,000 years ago to around 50,000 years ago, when the species died out. According to the researchers, this group likely hunted wild horses, fashioned stoned tools, and even processed animal hides to survive frigid winters. University of Hawai'i's Christopher J. Bae said the breakthrough for discovering this possibly new species came when he and his team were devising a new system for organizing fossil evidence. “Although we started this project several years ago, we did not expect being able to propose a new hominin (human ancestor) species and then to be able to organize the hominin fossils from Asia into different groups,” Bae said in a press statement. One possible member of the new species H. juluensis isn't a newcomer to science by any stretch. Denisovans—first identified in 2010 via DNA extracted from a young girl's fingerbone found in Siberia—have never been given a species classification, but Bae believes that they could belong to this new species. H. juluensis also potentially solves another mystery of the Xujiayao hominin fossils, which have long perplexed researchers, as the remains display a mix of H. erectus and H. sapiens  features. According to a study by the scientists in the journal PaleoAnthropology, these remains have been confused for a variety of taxonomic representations, but note that differences in the cranium (spoiler: it's big), the teeth and jaws, and a few other features denote a new species represented in fossil remains including Penghu 1 (jawbone), Xiahe (mandible), Xuchang (partial crania), and a variety of Denisova fossils. Although this is a convincing argument that these particular specimens belong to a previously unknown human species, more research will be needed before anthropologists bust out the “Welcome to the Family” banners. But because these fossils still defy species classification, it's likely only a matter of time before the hominin tribe increases by one (or more).
