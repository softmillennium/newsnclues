I wasn't born a cynic, let alone a skeptic. Believing what I was told ‚Äî especially as delivered through our black-and-white, wait-to-warm-up Zenith ‚Äî I was fully sold on Mr. Green Jeans' overalls being green, like the Red Sox's new uniforms. 

Covering sports has made me cynical. I even eye the celebrations of Wimbledon victors with a conditioned suspicion. 

Last Saturday, after Iga Swiatek crushed Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in 57 minutes to win her sixth major and first Wimbledon, Swiatek's response after the last point seemed, well, excessive ‚Äî as if she were putting on a show for photographers, sponsors and all gathered media.

It seemed, as they say over there, that the pudding was overly egged, as if the match's foregone conclusion ended an epic, hard-fought marathon. She threw herself on the ground, face up, fists clenched in dramatic flamboyance ‚Äî as if she didn't know this match was something of a walkover farce.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The revamped US Open mixed doubles event has certainly divided opinion since its announcement. This was clear when the initial lineup was announced, featuring teams including Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, as well as Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro. The Czech, who has been ranked as high as world number 27, has just won her first Grand Slam mixed doubles title at Wimbledon alongside Sem Verbeek. Following her latest major title victory, Siniakova spoke to Tennis Channel where she was asked about the US Open mixed doubles event. Despite being unclear of her participation status, Siniakova suggested she could have a partner lined up, but did not want to reveal who that would be. ‚ÄúOh I'm going to keep it a secret,‚Äù added Siniakova. A STAR-STUDDED ü§© lineup of teams have officially entered the reimagined US Open Mixed Doubles Championship!More info: https://t.co/bIMJGbf3qI pic.twitter.com/Hw1yA87pgj Some players including Alcaraz and Raducanu will be making their Grand Slam doubles debut, while defending champions Andrea Vavassori and Sara Errani are the only doubles specialist pair appearing in this lineup. It remains unclear how much this lineup will change before the US Open mixed doubles event comes around. The US Open mixed doubles tournament is scheduled to take place on August 19-20.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 hasn't really gone according to Novak Djokovic's plan, but tennis legend Jimmy Connors feels that the veteran has a ace up his sleeve for the upcoming US Open. Connors had a warning for the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, claiming that Djokovic wasn't yet done. Djokovic has reached three Grand Slam semi-finals this year. He had to retire vs Alexander Zverev in Melbourne, and then lost in the French Open and Wimbledon semi-finals. Speaking on a podcast, Connors said, ‚ÄúI am not counting him out yet. And sometimes those guts are going to come out.‚Äù ‚ÄúI got a feeling that as much as he would have liked to have won Wimbledon, that result in the semi, he didn't like that. So believe me, the guy can come up with something up his sleeve for the US Open, which might just surprise a lot of people and you know what, I would love to see it,‚Äù he added. 2025 is also expected to be Djokovic's swansong year, but after the Wimbledon semi-final, he hinted that he would be back next year. Meanwhile, Aussie ace Nick Kyrgios, who has a good relationship with Djokovic, feels that he will be retiring soon. We were in the locker room and I said ‚Äòwhy are you here? He just goes ‚ÄòI don't know. Kyrgios also feels that Djokovic will be more inclined to spend time with his family. ‚ÄúI go ‚Äòwhat about your kids, I know you want to spend time with your family'. He said ‚Äòyeah, I don't know'. ‚ÄúI can't see him playing for more than another year. I am just speaking from my experience if I had a family like his and kid,‚Äù he added.</p>

According to our information, the American is not yet officially part of the Danish player's team. The two will work together for three days in the United States before deciding what comes next. Andre Agassi is there to bring a fresh perspective to the Rune project, whose main coach remains Lars Christensen, also present in Washington. A video published by the YouTube channel Open Court shows Holger Rune and Andre Agassi training together. Holger Rune is currently working on strengthening his team after a first half of the season marked by ups and downs. However, he has not gone beyond the round of 16 in any Grand Slam and was knocked out in the first round at Wimbledon. He won't have many ATP points to defend during the North American hard-court swing this season. Your email address will not be published.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ahead of the semifinals, most were expecting a final showdown between Andrey Rublev and Denis Shapovalov, but Aleksandar Kovacevic has thrown a spanner in the works by beating Rublev in an ATP 250 semfinal for the second time this year (Montpellier) to reach a second career final and have another opportunity for a maiden title. Shapovalov, meanwhile, will be determined to win another title after an up-and-season so far for the Canadian. While this final won't have the same star quality as Rublev vs Shapovalov, Kovacevic has been playing some great tennis this week and produced a great final in Montpellier (where he came very close to beating Shapovalov's countryman Felix Auger-Aliassime) and will back himself to put in another good performance against Shapovalov. On paper, this is perhaps the first final in Shapovalov's career where he starts as a very clear favourite, given his much higher ranking and also how well he has been playing so far this week, dropping no sets and only 12 games en route to the final. If he maintains the kind of level he has shown so far this week, there might be little that Kovacevic can do to stop him. That said, the Canadian is known for his inconsistency and Kovacevic has been playing some very good tennis, not least in getting a second career top 10 win in the semifinals here, both against Rublev this year in the semifinals of ATP 250 events. Just like in Montpelier, he will have to follow up his win over Rublev against a Canadian opponent; he was very close to beating Felix in France and will be hoping to go one better against Shapovalov.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Twenty-nine different men have reached world No 1 on the ATP Rankings since the system was first launched in 1973. At 191cm/6'3, Sinner is the joint-third-tallest world No 1 in ATP Rankings history. Moya first broke through with a surprise run to the Australian Open final in 1997, before winning his sole Grand Slam singles title at the 1998 French Open. Kafelnikov, the winner of 26 ATP Tour titles, is another world No 1 who measures 6'3/191cm in height. Becker won three Wimbledon titles, two Australian Open titles, and a US Open title across his career, and spent two small spells as the world No 1 in 1991. After years of being held off the top spot by his ‚ÄòBig 3' rivals, Murray finally surged to world No 1 in November 2016, and held the top ranking for 41 straight weeks. The Brit was famously a two-time Wimbledon champion, triumphing in 2013 and 2016, though he also prevailed at the US Open in 2012. So far the only Briton, male or female, to be ranked world No 1 in the Open Era, Murray is another player who is 6'3/191cm tall. Kuerten is, of course, best remembered for his Roland Garros success, lifting the title in 1997, 2000, and 2001. The Brazilian is part of a group of six world No 1's listed as 6'3/191cm tall on the ATP Tour website.

Just two centimetres shy of two metres tall, will the ATP Tour ever see another world No 1 as tall as Medvedev?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roger Federer's former coach Ivan Ljubicic has slammed John McEnroe for his "nonsense" claims about Rafael Nadal during the French Open last month. The American tennis icon sparked controversy when he said after Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz's legendary clash that either player could have defeated 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal at his peak on the Paris clay. As the two new standard bearers for men's tennis, Sinner and Alcaraz did not disappoint, producing an instant classic in the Roland-Garros final. The Spaniard, 22, came from two sets behind and saved three Championship points to claim his second French Open title and fifth major overall in astonishing fashion. The pair faced off again at Wimbledon earlier this month, where Sinner, 23, avenged his gruelling defeat to Alcaraz to claim his fourth Grand Slam title. After witnessing what many considered to be one of the all-time great Grand Slam finals, McEnroe said on TNT Sports: ‚ÄúYou took a look at them bringing their A-game right now ‚Äì I'm saying Sinner and Alcaraz against Nadal on clay ‚Äì you would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favoured to beat Nadal, at his best. "Do I think they're going to reach 20, 24 titles either one of them? Because I think that plateau is so hard it's almost impossible; there's more depth in the game, bigger hitters, and more things happen. ‚ÄúBut these two guys right now, it's like when you watch the NBA and you say nobody could be better than Michael Jordan. The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen.‚Äù Those comments were interpreted by some as disrespectful towards Nadal, who retired last year after clinching an incredible 14 French Open titles. ‚ÄúJohn McEnroe said Nadal wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys. We haven't seen the best of Alcaraz and Sinner yet. "But I don't think they're ahead just yet. I sometimes watch matches from 2005, 2008, 2012, 2015 [between] Roger and Rafa. McEnroe has already taken the step to clarify his earlier comments, saying during Alcaraz's Wimbledon quarter-final victory over Cameron Norrie: ‚ÄúI made a comment during the French [Open] where I said these guys [Alcaraz and Sinner] would have a shot‚Ä¶ I didn't say they would beat Nadal every time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking on his podcast with Andrea Petkovic, he began by stating: ‚ÄúThat's the big question now, because to win a Grand Slam, he probably has to beat both [Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner]. ‚ÄúThat's how it was with Wimbledon, and he said Wimbledon was the tournament where he had his best chance of winning a Grand Slam. ‚ÄúAs a reminder, he has already won the tournament seven times. He's now reached the semifinals of Wimbledon 14 times, just imagine. However, the German then turned from adulation into advice, continuing: ‚ÄúHe also has to realise, yes, he did injure himself a bit on match point against [Flavio] Cobolli, but at 38, you get injured more easily. ‚ÄúAgainst [Jannik] Sinner, in the first two sets, I think he was relatively fit. Sinner, of course, was the better player, because for me, Sinner is Djokovic 2.0; he's another version of Djokovic, 15 years younger. ‚ÄúHe's still playing tennis because he wants to win 25 Grand Slams, to become the sole record holder. ‚ÄúBut it must be said that on their good days, Sinner and Alcaraz are better than Djokovic is on his good days. ‚ÄúThe question is, how realistic are the chances he'll win another Grand Slam now, because time is running out for him?‚Äù It seems strange that people are questioning the decision for Djokovic to keep playing tennis, when this year he has reached the semi-finals of all three Grand Slams. For most on tour, that would represent their best-ever season. For the 24-time Grand Slam winner, it is not enough. But, if he remains ever-present and continues to reach these latter stages, he at least puts himself in contention. Eventually, one of Alcaraz or Sinner will have to fall early, giving him the opportunity to claim that elusive 25th title whilst only having to play one of them. He had lost the last two finals to him, and so to overcome both of them in one event would've been near-impossible. He'll likely continue doing this either until he gets that slice of luck or his body no longer lets him.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LOS CABOS - Canada's Denis Shapovalov has a chance to win his second ATP title this year. Shapovalov reached the Mifel Tennis Open final with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Australia's Adam Walton at the ATP 250 event Friday. "It definitely helps my confidence, it helps my belief a little bit," Shapovalov told reporters after the match. "I came into the tournament not trying to focus on results too much, just trying to focus on getting back to my game offensively, trying to go for it. The third-seeded Shapovalov hit seven aces and saved four break points while converting all four of his break-point opportunities. He needed one hour six minutes to win the match over Walton, the tournament's eighth seed. The 26-year-old from Richmond Hill, Ont., won the Dallas Open in February. 10 has won three career ATP titles. Shapovalov will face the winner of a semifinal matchup between top seed Andrey Rublev of Russia and seventh seed Aleksandar Kovacevic of the United States in the final.
