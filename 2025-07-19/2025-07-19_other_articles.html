In an article published Friday, The Washington Post editorial board linked misinformation from President Joe Biden's administration to a growing acceptance of conspiracy theories among the American public. "In 2020, a group of 51 former intelligence officials shredded their credibility by signing a public letter insisting the release of Hunter Biden's emails ‘has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.' The laptop that contained them was authentic. Joe Biden's campaign knew that when it pressured social media companies to suppress stories about its damaging contents. These same operatives also covered up Biden's decline in hopes of winning in 2024," the editorial board insisted. Fox News Digital reached out to representatives of the former president for comment. The editorial was titled, "Conspiracy theories take root when government misleads." According to the Post, this mistrust of the government among the public started a long time ago and has only gotten worse as time went on. From 2007 on, that number has never eclipsed 30%. The Post tied this drop-off in trust to the United States' preemptive invasion of Iraq, "based on cherry-picked intelligence about weapons of mass destruction." "Trump's 2016 victory was partly a response to these and other failures," they argued. A recent Reuters-Ipsos poll revealed that 69% of Americans believe the federal government is hiding information about the Jeffery Epstein files. Citing a Reuters-Ipsos poll released this week, 69% of Americans believe that the federal government is hiding details about the Epstein files. While the Post editorial board is critical of the government's propensity to erode its trust with the public by misleading them with misinformation, it doesn't believe that the government should start releasing information "willy-nilly" to satisfy conspiracy theorists. "Even if the full Epstein file were opened and revealed nothing of interest to the public, it probably would not deter fabulists from spinning new theories," they asserted. "But Americans would not be so receptive to such theorizing had elite institutions avoided some of their spectacular stumbles — or if U.S. leaders refrained from amplifying them. At the moment, too many officials are eroding it further." Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The actress, Joyce Byers in the hit supernatural drama series, also had a paranormal episode that made her believe she is psychic. Winona, 53, said: “I've had two ‘experiences'... once, when I was about seven or eight, me, my brothers and my sister were sleeping on the roof and we think we saw a UFO. “There was a boomerang going back and forth, but it could have really been anything. Netflix show Stranger Things has been a worldwide smash and returns for its fifth and final season at the end of this year. In it Winona's character Joyce hunts for her 12-year-old son Will after he vanishes mysteriously. A portal to this other world was created after secret experiments with the paranormal and supernatural by boffins. The search is aided by a young psychokinetic girl named Eleven, played by Brit actress Millie Bobby Brown, who escaped a nearby lab. In an interview with SFX magazine, Winona said another eerie incident happened when she had a vision just like Eleven. She asked for peace and it got a lot of attention. “She was a beautiful young girl and I had her picture on my wall, but she very tragically died in a plane crash. “The night before she died, I had a dream that I was on a plane sitting next to her – and something was wrong. “After that, I was convinced I was psychic and that every dream meant something, but it never happened again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rivera's cause of death is pending and autopsy results are expected in about 8-10 weeks No, the allegedly “possessed” Annabelle doll was not in the hotel room where paranormal investigator Dan Rivera died earlier this week, according to a Pennsylvania coroner. In a Friday, July 18, message to PEOPLE, Francis Dutrow, the Adams County coroner confirmed that the doll was not present when he arrived at the scene on Sunday, July 13, when authorities were notified about Rivera's death. The Pennsylvania State Police shared a report on Wednesday, July 16, detailing what happened. "The decedent was discovered in his hotel room by workers.” Dutrow earlier told PEOPLE that Rivera had been with colleagues on Sunday morning but said he was feeling sick and was going back to his room. It's unclear what Rivera may have been ill with and further information is pending his autopsy results, which are expected in about 8-10 weeks. According to the New England Society for Psychic Research's website, Anabelle's origin goes back to 1968, when a student nurse was gifted the doll and brought it to the home where she lived with her roommate. “The two roommates tried to accept the doll's spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent.” In a statement later shared with PEOPLE on Tuesday, July 15, the New England Society for Psychic Research, which first confirmed the death on social media, paid tribute to Rivera. Dan's passion for the paranormal was rooted in a genuine desire to educate, help, and connect with others — whether through social media, conventions, or investigations with local families seeking understanding and peace,” the society continued. “We understand that Dan's work inspired fascination and curiosity for many, but above all, he was a father, devoted husband, and loyal friend, someone who meant the world to those closest to him,” the statement added. According to a Facebook post by Ryan Buell, the host of A&E's Paranormal State, Rivera, who was an Army veteran, is survived by his wife and children.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UFO sightings have plummeted across Britain - because people are too glued to their mobile phones. Having previously been bombarded with hundreds of 999 calls over flying saucers, a police probe suggests UFO reports have dried up in the past year. Some forces - like Cheshire and Gwent - revealed they had no record of any close encounters so far in 2025. Russ Kellett, from Yorkshire, who has been abducted dozens of times, said: “There are plenty of aliens and UFOs out there, but people are too distracted to notice. “People are too busy looking down to see what is above us. There have always been highs and lows with UFO reports - I'm currently looking at a strange report of a flying saucer landing in Scarborough a few years back - so the truth is out there. The Daily Star Sunday's exclusive findings follow Freedom of Information requests to forces across the UK, which previously unearthed hundreds of reports - ranging from mysterious flashing lights to one person in Belfast beamed aboard a UFO while taking a ciggie break. Yet reports have dried up; Even in Wiltshire - the UK's crop circle capital - cops confirmed they had no record of any spooky sightings so far this year. However, some forces did disclose details, including one caller in Northampton who had been beamed aboard a UFO - then kidnapped by bigfoot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even five years after its conclusion, Supernatural remains incredibly popular on streaming, proving that we need a revival now more than ever. Following monster-hunting brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester, Supernatural ran for an impressive fifteen seasons on the CW, delivering 327 episodes. Supernatural finally came to an end in 2020, with a finale that was divisive among fans. Most of the other shows with streaming success had either recently aired new episodes or are still ongoing series, making Supernatural's ranking even more impressive. While Supernatural developed a passionate fan base throughout its fifteen-season run on the CW, it continues to find new fans on streaming services like Netflix. The show may have ended five years ago, but its fanbase has only continued to grow. Soon after Supernatural came to an end, fans began speculating about whether the series was truly over for good. Padalecki, Ackles, and Misha Collins all seem open to return for a potential revival, and Supernatural's continued popularity proves that fans would undoubtedly tune in. Although Dean Winchester was tragically killed in Supernatural's finale, he has returned from the dead numerous times before. Supernatural fans have long hoped to see the show renewed for season 16, but there's one significant obstacle currently preventing a revival. With Supernatural's extensive mythology and unique combination of genres, the possibilities for a revival are truly endless. Supernatural's continued success proves that you can't keep the Winchesters down for long, and it seems almost inevitable that Sam and Dean Winchester will return to our screens at some point, hopefully in the not-too-distant future. Supernatural is a television series that follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who were raised by their father to hunt and combat supernatural entities after losing their mother to a demonic force. Traversing the American landscape in their '67 Chevy Impala, they face numerous paranormal threats. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Mastering such a wide and varied genre like sci-fi isn't easy, and keeping that quality up is even harder - which makes masterpieces stand even more. Marvel may be teasing the next Silver Surfer with hints at Norrin Radd's death and one of his enemies' connection to a version of the Power Cosmic. The 2025 legacy sequel I Know What You Did Last Summer breaks an unfortunate box office record that has been held for nearly three decades. Netflix's cult classic horror comedy Santa Clarita Diet was just starting to get good when the streamer canceled it in its third season. After its season premiere was recently delayed, South Park's streaming future takes a major step forward, thanks to an exciting new settlement update.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a gripping account that blurs the line between the natural and the supernatural, animation director Larry Whitaker—whose credits include “Tiny Tunes” and “Space Jam”—recalled a chilling experience that left him shaken and transformed. Speaking with L.A. Marzulli, Whitaker described a spiritual encounter while staying in Thiruvananthapuram, India. What began as an ordinary business trip quickly turned into a vivid confrontation with evil beyond the physical realm. What followed was a sight he says defies scientific explanation: a dense black mass, thicker than any natural shadow, began sweeping through the room. It moved with intelligence and purpose, not like fog or smoke, but as something alive. He described it as “blacker than black,” a volumetric darkness that carried an unmistakable malevolent presence. As the entity advanced, tendrils of it reached out toward him—one touching his tongue. The sensation, Whitaker said, was like a powerful electric shock that left him paralyzed. In that terrifying moment, unable to move or speak clearly, something inside him rose up. It instantly flattened out and exited the room in a flash, as if repelled by the holiness of God's name. Still shaken the next day, Whitaker shared the event with Christian friends, who believed it may have been a form of spiritual retaliation. Earlier during his trip, he had boldly refused to participate in a local Shiva festival and had instead told a young Indian boy, “Remember Jesus.” It was a seemingly innocent comment, but one that could have stirred spiritual opposition in a region steeped in strong religious traditions. Stay up-to-date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more! The following day, while washing his hands at a seaside restaurant, Whitaker heard an unnatural growling sound emanating from a dead palm tree behind him. In another moment of supernatural intervention, Whitaker shared how he once heard a voice while driving tell him to slow down. Seconds later, a herd of deer darted across the road—an accident narrowly avoided. These experiences, he believes, underscore the reality of spiritual warfare and divine protection for believers. Whitaker's experience serves as a sobering reminder of the unseen battle that rages around us and the authority believers have through our faith in Christ.
