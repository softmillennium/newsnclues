                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new meta-study — a study of other studies — found that for people seeking better sleep, yoga, tai chi, walking, and jogging rivaled cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) in effectiveness. In the U.S., according to a survey study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 14.5% of adults had trouble falling or staying asleep within a 30-day period. Seven to nine hours is the recommended amount of sleep each night for adults. However, exercise may be more readily accessible to some, can be easily integrated into one's life on a long-term basis, and can serve as a complement to CBT-i. As such, the meta-study's findings will be of interest to many: Conclusions that can be drawn are often tempered with questions regarding certainty. Among those concerns is an inevitable lack of detail that can cloud conclusions somewhat. Jonathan Cedernaes, PhD, a sleep researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden, who was also not involved in the study, acknowledged that the study was “quite a comprehensive analysis which seems to be robustly done.” However, he cautioned: “While the authors' findings suggest that different exercise modalities may benefit different aspects of sleep, I think we need more evidence to draw those types of conclusions.” Instead, insomnia typically arises from an interplay of biological, psychological, and environmental contributors.” “We saw that rates [of insomnia] increased during the COVID-19 pandemic,” recalled Cedernaes, “which may have to do with further increases in stress. “There is also evidence that the increased use of artificial light can contribute, as well as increased (especially evening or nighttime) use of social media,” he said. An increasing awareness of sleep issues may also be aggravating the problem, pointed out Kaylor. In addition, Kaylor said, “Mental health conditions like anxiety and depression further intensify these cognitive loops. Chronic pain, gastrointestinal disorders, PTSD, depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's) are all strongly associated with insomnia.” “Practices like yoga and Tai Chi have been shown to decrease sympathetic tone and increase parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) activity, supporting the down-regulation of arousal prior to sleep onset.”— Leah Kaylor, PhD On a brain-chemistry level, Cedernaes said these activities may “activate the parasympathetic nervous system, and relatedly, may also reduce cortisol levels by lowering activity in the HPA axis that regulates cortisol.” “For walking,” noted Weiss, “scientific evidence suggests [as factors] reduced stress, improved circadian rhythms (when keeping consistent timing and exposure to light), and increased BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which is critical for sleep regulation.” In this Special Feature, we investigate five myths associated with sleep. Among other questions, we ask whether sleep deprivation truly can be fatal. In this Special Feature, we question some common misconceptions about sleep, including the role of alcohol, remembering dreams, and late-night cheese. Sleeping disorders, working night shifts, and jet lag can all influence how much melatonin the body makes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) - like chronic or gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia - are among the leading causes of maternal and infant death in the United States. Between 2017 to 2019, 16% of all U.S. pregnancies were complicated by an HDP diagnosis, with much higher rates seen among non-Hispanic Black/African American and American Indian/Alaskan Native women. But HDPs don't just affect women in the short term; these disorders can increase their long-term risk for heart disease, kidney disease, and stroke. But there could be an opportunity to mitigate these longer-term health risks through breastfeeding, Yale researchers have found. In a new study, they discovered that an HDP diagnosis before or during pregnancy related to higher odds of never breastfeeding, or for those who initiated breastfeeding, higher probability of stopping. The findings suggest women with HDPs may benefit from targeted interventions that promote their exposure to the cardioprotective benefits of breastfeeding. There can be many barriers to starting, and sustaining, breastfeeding after childbirth, from facing lactation challenges and inadequate parental leave policies to lack of breastfeeding education among patients and healthcare providers alike. "As a practicing pediatrician in the New Haven community, it is not often I see parents who truly do not want to breastfeed. Rather, I frequently see parents try to breastfeed, shortly thereafter encountering common - and often addressable - challenges, such as pain, latch difficulties, and milk supply concerns. "Unfortunately, many families do not get the timely care they need to address such challenges, resulting in breastfeeding cessation. I believe that the attrition we see in U.S. breastfeeding rates, particularly within the early weeks to months postpartum, in large part reflect systems level issues." Other maternal comorbidities, including chronic and gestational diabetes, have been shown to negatively influence breastfeeding outcomes, but little is known about the breastfeeding outcomes for those with HDP despite its high prevalence among pregnant people in the United States. For Nardella, understanding this relationship is critical to promoting health equity. "We know that Black and Native women in the U.S. have higher rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy," she said. "These communities also have the lowest breastfeeding rates. Though we cannot say that HDPs directly cause these observed inequities, understanding the mechanisms of the relationship between HDP and breastfeeding initiation and duration could promote more equitable long term cardiometabolic outcomes for pregnant individuals and infants from these communities." For the new study, researchers sought to better understand this relationship by analyzing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). PRAMS surveys women across the U.S., usually around four months postpartum, on their attitudes, beliefs, and experiences during their pregnancy, prenatal, and postpartum periods. Their sample included women who had delivered a live infant between January 2016 and November 2021 and who had provided complete data for HDP and non-initiation or cessation of breastfeeding. Among those who reported breastfeeding, researchers defined time to cessation as 0.5 weeks if they reported breastfeeding less than one week, their exact breastfeeding duration (in weeks) if provided, or infant age at the time of survey completion (in weeks) if they reported they were still breastfeeding. They found that women with an HDP had 11% higher odds of never breastfeeding and, among those who did start breastfeeding, a 17% higher probability of stopping at some point during the postpartum period. The median time for breastfeeding cessation was 17 weeks shorter for women with HDP than those without HDP. These findings suggest a negative association between HDP and breastfeeding outcomes. "However, most do not reach the goal, set by the American Academy of Pediatrics, to exclusively do breastfeeding for six months. Research, such as this study showing an association between HDPs and shorter breastfeeding duration, guides the development of strategies to help all families reach their breastfeeding goal." Future studies to identify the mechanisms that underlie this relationship between HDP and breastfeeding are required to develop targeted, innovative strategies to improve breastfeeding outcomes for people with HDP, researchers said. "Such strategies could include having a standard, dedicated prenatal lactation consultation for those individuals who wish to try breastfeeding and have risk factors for experiencing worse breastfeeding outcomes, such as HDP," Nardella said. She added: "This paper provides foundational knowledge on which to build future studies to understand how our health systems can best support those individuals with hypertension in reaching their personal infant feeding goals. As a system, we must do better about supporting women with HDP in reaching whatever their infant feeding goal may be, particularly if it involves any amount of breastfeeding. Such support could promise long term improvements in health outcomes for many pregnant individuals and their infants, especially among communities with high risk of cardiometabolic disease and breastfeeding cessation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inhaling agricultural dust may pose significant risks to gut health for workers in animal agriculture, a University of California, Riverside, study has found. Led by Declan McCole, a professor of biomedical sciences in the UCR School of Medicine, the study expands on prior findings that hog farm dust causes airway inflammation. The researchers now report in the Journal of Applied Toxicology that inhaling this dust also alters the gut microbiome and impairs intestinal function, including increased "leaky gut" or intestinal permeability. Leaky gut is associated with a range of chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and type 1 diabetes. "Exposure to swine farm dust, which contains high levels of bacteria and endotoxins, caused both airway inflammation and increased passage of gut bacterial products into the bloodstream in our mouse models," said Meli'sa Crawford, a former postdoctoral researcher in McCole's lab and the paper's first author. The researchers exposed mice intranasally to hog dust extract for three weeks. The mice showed a significant drop in beneficial bacterial species, including Akkermansia muciniphila, Clostridium sp. The research team also found decreased levels of critical compounds in the gut of the mice, such as riboflavin, nicotinic acid, inosine, and leucine - key players in energy metabolism, immune regulation, and gut barrier maintenance. While most research has focused on the respiratory effects of farm dust, our findings clearly show that inhaled pollutants can have systemic consequences. The study builds on growing evidence that pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations can impact multiple organ systems. "Agricultural dust is rich in fine particulate matter and resistant bacteria, presenting a complex threat to farmworkers' health," McCole said. "Our earlier work showed that inhaled hog dust extract leads to neutrophilic lung inflammation. We now show the link to intestinal barrier dysfunction and microbial imbalance, highlighting the need for improved workplace protections for agricultural workers to mitigate long-term health consequences." The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health; University of California, Davis-Western Center for Agricultural Health and Safety; and University of California Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship Program. Crawford is now an assistant professor in the Department of Animal Sciences at Rutgers University in New Jersey. The title of the research paper is "Respiratory Exposure to Agriculture Dust Extract Alters Gut Commensal Species and Key Metabolites in Mice."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from Emory University reveals that maintaining optimal cardiovascular health can significantly improve overall physical and psychological well-being. It confirms that the benefits of heart-healthy behaviors extend far beyond the heart, positively impacting brain function, vision, hearing, muscle strength, and even reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and dementia. "While we recently learned that heart-health and brain health are closely tied, in this review we found that almost every organ system and bodily function from head to toe benefit from a heart-healthy lifestyle," says Liliana Aguayo, PhD, MPH, research assistant professor at the Emory University Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing and core faculty member at Emory's Global Diabetes Research Center, who led the study. The review is the first of its kind to systematically examine how the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7™ metrics - which include not smoking, healthy eating, regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar - influence health outcomes across multiple organ systems. The updated Life's Essential 8™ also includes sleep as a key factor. Among the key findings were that those with heart-healthy habits: It calls for further research in underrepresented populations, including children and pregnant women, and emphasizes the need to understand how even minor lifestyle improvements yield significant health benefits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As youth engagement in high-energy sports surges, so does the prevalence of sport-related injuries. Among them, tibial tubercle avulsion fractures (TTAFs) represent a small but serious subset, accounting for less than 3% of pediatric fractures. These injuries commonly affect adolescent boys and are associated with risk factors such as delayed skeletal maturity, Osgood-Schlatter disease, and abnormal body mass index. Diagnosis can be complex, as symptoms mimic other knee conditions, and imaging beyond basic X-rays is often required. Despite several classification systems, no consensus exists on standardized treatment protocols. Due to these challenges, there is a growing need for in-depth studies to better understand and manage TTAFs. In a recent review (DOI: 10.1002/pdi3.2521) published in Pediatric Discovery (2025), researchers from the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and Sichuan University examined the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of TTAFs in children and adolescents. These injuries, though rare, are becoming more frequent due to rising sports participation among youth. The article reviews decades of literature and new clinical findings to offer guidance for orthopedic surgeons facing this unique challenge in pediatric care. While boys face higher risk due to later growth plate closure and greater quadriceps strength, the presence of Osgood-Schlatter disease or extreme BMI—whether high or low—also heightens susceptibility. Diagnostic tools such as CT and MRI are recommended to detect hidden soft tissue damage and guide surgical planning. Treatment options range from conservative casting for stable fractures to surgical methods like open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for displaced or complex cases. Many of these young patients are active in sports and unaware of their risk until an injury sidelines them. What this review emphasizes is the need for vigilance—not just in diagnosis, but in understanding the subtle risk factors like growth plate maturity and muscle force imbalances. Dr. Xing Liu, senior orthopedic surgeon at Chongqing Medical University This study provides clinicians with a critical update on recognizing and treating TTAFs in pediatric patients. Its insights help bridge the gap between injury mechanism, clinical presentation, and long-term recovery strategies. As sports-related injuries in children grow more common, this knowledge equips orthopedic specialists with the tools to make timely interventions and reduce complications. With appropriate care, young patients can return to full function—sometimes even stronger than before. Tibial tubercle avulsion fractures in children and adolescents.

Our results suggest that there are multiple barriers to mental health screening in schools, including a lack of resources and knowledge of screening mechanics, as well as concerns about increased workload of identifying students." Jonathan Cantor, study's lead author and a policy researcher at RAND Surgeon General declared a youth mental health emergency. Researchers wanted to understand screening for mental health at U.S. public schools, given increased concerns about youth mental health following the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2024, the RAND study surveyed 1,019 principals who participate in the RAND American School Leader panel, a nationally representative sample of K-12 public school principals. They were asked whether their school mandated screening for mental health issues, what steps are taken if a student is identified as having depression or anxiety, and how easy or difficult it is to ensure that such students received adequate services. Researchers found that 30.5% of responding principals said their school required screening of students with mental health problems, with nearly 80% reporting that parents typically are notified if students screen positive for depression or anxiety. More than 70% of principals reported that their school offers in-person treatment for students who screen positive, while 53% of principals said they may refer a student to a community mental health care professional. The study found higher rates of mental health screenings in schools with 450 or more students and in districts with mostly racial and ethnic minority groups as the student populations. "Policies that promote federal and state funding for school mental health, reimbursement for school-based mental health screening, and adequate school mental health staff ratios may increase screening rates and increase the likelihood of successfully connecting the student to treatment," Cantor said.
