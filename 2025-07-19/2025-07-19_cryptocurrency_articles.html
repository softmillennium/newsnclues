                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's price action has turned somewhat sluggish after its unprecedented climb to a new all-time high of $122,838 on July 14. The rapid push to that level was preceded by a week of frenzied trading and heavy inflows, with BTC breaking through multiple resistance zones in quick succession. However, once that peak was hit, a series of volatile intraday movements followed to give a pullback to $116,000 and Bitcoin is now back to trading between the $117,000 and $118,500 price zone. A notable bearish call came from crypto analyst Melikatrader94, who posted a technical breakdown on the TradingView platform that might send Bitcoin down to $113,000. QML Zone Rejection Points To Downtrend Toward $113,600 According to the hourly candlestick chart shared by Melikatrader94, Bitcoin is currently exhibiting a Quasimodo Level (QML) structure. This area could serve as a potential point for either a bounce or short-term consolidation if the price continues downward. Altcoins Under Threat As BTC Price Weakens The potential Bitcoin crash to the $113,000 region could have serious implications for many altcoins that are already starting to post massive gains. However, these altcoins, which often follow Bitcoin's lead, are already showing signs of nervousness as BTC struggles to maintain upward momentum. Among the notable movers, XRP finally broke its eight-year-old resistance to hit a new all-time high of $3.65. Ethereum, which also surged on the back of Bitcoin's push to $122,000, climbed above $3,600 for the first time in months but has since settled into a consolidation phase just below $3,500. However, we could see these major altcoins finally detach from Bitcoin's movement. This would lead to an altcoin season where major altcoins outperform Bitcoin for some time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum Treasury SharpLink Shares Plunge 20% Amid $6 Billion Plan to Buy More ETH SharpLink Gaming shares closed down 20% on Friday, a day after the gambling marketing company said it was looking to boost a stock sale from $1 billion to $6 billion in a regulatory filing—its latest move in an ongoing effort to build its Ethereum treasury. SBET has spiked more than 330% since late May when it took initial steps to pivot its focus from affiliate marketing with a $425 million private placement largely earmarked for Ethereum buying. In a Thursday supplement to a prospectus filed May 30 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it would increase its stock sale goal by $5 billion. Ethereum was recently trading at about $3,550, a 2% dip over the past 24 hours, according to crypto markets data provider CoinGecko. BTBT's share price sank more than 4% on Friday, although it is up about 60% this year. On Thursday, the Peter Thiel-backed BitMine Immersion, which also moved from mining to Ethereum holding, surpassed $1 billion in Ethereum after adding $500 million in ETH to its holdings. The firm, which hopes to control 5% of all Ethereum held or staked, debuted its strategy earlier this month. Those firms have followed a model pioneered by Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which shifted from software development to Bitcoin purchasing in 2020 after years of struggling and low share prices. Strategy now holds more than 601,500 Bitcoin worth over $71 billion based on BTC's current price, according to bitcointreasuries.net.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Traders are keeping a close watch to see how this might reshape the altcoin landscape. But what does it really mean for crypto payroll and the broader market? Cardano's price has recently crossed above $0.80, which is quite a turnaround after weeks of hovering below key resistance levels. The increase in ETF approval odds came alongside more buying activity, so whether ADA continues to rise depends on whether it can maintain its position above these crucial levels. Regulatory clarity is a big deal for crypto payroll solutions. This could lead to greater acceptance of crypto payments, particularly stablecoins, which are less volatile than traditional cryptocurrencies. The implications of regulatory clarity go beyond compliance; they also encourage innovation and investment in crypto. As institutional interest increases, startups can utilize this momentum to create crypto-friendly payroll platforms that meet the needs of both businesses and employees. The rise of crypto payroll for startups and the trend of "Pay Me in Bitcoin" among tech workers show how salary payments are changing. Aside from the ETF chatter, Cardano's network has also seen a spike in activity, with over $100 million locked in Cardano-based decentralized applications since late June. This increase suggests that more people are adopting the blockchain's offerings, like lending, trading, and liquidity pools. The uptick in on-chain activity supports Cardano's price rise, as users engage more with ADA-based applications. For startups, this growth offers a chance to incorporate crypto solutions into their financial operations. As Cardano's ecosystem expands, businesses can take advantage of its technology to access decentralized financial services and innovative payment solutions more easily. Looking ahead, analysts think that if ADA gets an ETF approval, it could draw more institutional interest and push prices up across the altcoin market. This could enhance market credibility and encourage broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance. But, let's not forget that short-term pullbacks often follow previous rallies linked to ETF approvals in crypto. Cardano's recent price surge and rising ETF approval odds have sparked new interest in the project. With substantial trading volumes and increased activity on the blockchain, ADA may be positioned for more gains. The combination of regulatory clarity and network growth presents an opportunity for crypto payroll solutions to thrive, signaling a shift in how businesses are incorporating cryptocurrency into their financial operations.

Wall Street's most prominent crypto bull just made his biggest bet yet—and it's not on Bitcoin. Tom Lee, the Fundstrat strategist known for his prescient bitcoin price forecasts, has been appointed chair of BitMine Immersion Technologies, a little-known company positioning itself as the “MicroStrategy of Ethereum.” In a recent CNBC interview, Lee laid out his case for why Ethereum could be the next trillion-dollar opportunity, while also defending the market's concentration in AI leaders like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). His insights offer a roadmap for investors navigating today's tech-heavy, AI-driven market. Lee described stablecoin development by companies like Circle (NYSE:CRCL) as the “ChatGPT moment for crypto,” driving unprecedented Wall Street interest in building on Ethereum's blockchain. More than 60% of all tokenized real-world assets now live on Ethereum, establishing it as Wall Street's “preferred choice” for blockchain infrastructure. Lee referenced former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen‘s prediction that stablecoins could grow to over $2 trillion, which he sees as “exponential usage of Ethereum and the Ethereum token.” This institutional adoption story mirrors Bitcoin's corporate treasury adoption narrative that drove its meteoric rise. Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and making your first qualifying trade on Coinbase. Through BitMine Immersion Technologies, Lee is executing a bold capital markets strategy. With the PIPE shares bringing total outstanding shares to at least 61 million—significantly higher than the 6 million often reported—the company's market capitalization runs into billions, even at lower stock prices. This means investors are paying “many multiples of the value of the ether you're buying,” betting on Ethereum's future appreciation rather than getting exposure at net asset value. Lee's market perspective extends beyond crypto to the broader AI revolution. Trading at around 30 times earnings, Nvidia's multiple “is not that extended given how important they are to the AI ecosystem.

Companies producing “durable, sustained earnings growth” like Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), Nvidia, and Tesla deserve higher multiples, Lee told CNBC. Lee's dual thesis—defending AI leaders while betting big on Ethereum—reflects a broader shift in how institutional investors view technology infrastructure. His argument that financial innovation, including Circle and other cryptocurrencies, contributes significant earnings growth to the S&P suggests crypto adoption has moved beyond speculative trading to become a legitimate earnings driver. However, his BitMine play also illustrates the premium investors pay for exposure to these themes through public markets. It's whether the current valuations, from Nvidia's 30x multiple to BitMine's significant premium to its Ethereum holdings, already reflect these opportunities or still offer room for growth.

Welcome to Gotham 2.0.

Mayor Eric Adams said he plans to rely much more on artificial intelligence to assist New Yorkers if he's re-elected to a second term.

“We're gonna run a smarter city,” he told The Post Thursday during an interview at Gracie Mansion.

“I'm talking about having an opportunity now to use everything from artificial intelligence to blockchain, new technology that's out there that could make our city smarter, so that our working class people can get the proper delivery of services.”

One example being explored is using blockchain technology to speed up the process for providing copies of birth and death certificates to the public, the Mayor's Office said.

Another is using AI to quickly translate English to other languages when needed, such as helping authorities better assist victims when they use voice-controlled drones during search-and-rescue missions and other emergencies.

Adams has embraced the tech industry and digital currency since becoming mayor in 2022, as he's pledged to help make NYC the crypto capital of the world.

He put his money where his mouth early on by agreeing to take his first three paychecks in bitcoin. Adams, who earns $258,750 a year as mayor, reported the value of the bitcoin ranging from $5,000 to nearly $55,000 in his financial disclosure statement for 2024 filed with the NYC Conflicts of Interest Board.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins The US Congress has concluded its Crypto Week with significant developments in cryptocurrency legislation. This bill is now headed to the president's desk for signature. Once in effect, stablecoin issuers will be subject to strict reserve requirements and the Bank Secrecy Act. These two bills will now proceed to the Senate, where they may face further deliberation and amendments due to the slimmer pro-crypto Republican majority. The GENIUS Act, once signed into law, will compel many American stablecoin issuers to become banks, as they will be limited solely to stablecoin issuance. Most US stablecoin issuers currently offer more services, and pursuing a bank charter would allow them to issue stablecoins along with a wider range of activities without needing state-to-state licenses. However, the final version of the bill does not include a provision for stablecoin issuers to offer interest on customer stablecoin reserves, a point of contention for some industry leaders. Despite criticism from some House Democrats, the act enjoyed significant bipartisan support. Senate Democrats who supported the GENIUS Act may also vote in favor of the CLARITY Act, despite vocal criticism from crypto-skeptic Democrats. Industry leaders believe that pro-crypto laws in the US could influence laws abroad and help the US reclaim digital asset leadership. With more politicians swinging pro-crypto, the passage of these bills seems more a matter of "when" than "if."</p>

Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. And with two other crypto-related bills on lawmakers' radar, it's worth sizing up the legislative landscape. If you're wondering what bitcoin investors need to know about the crypto bills in Congress right now, here's a quick rundown. The GENIUS Act, short for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, was passed by legislators in late July and signed into law by President Trump. This legislation will establish a framework to accelerate the development of stablecoins, which are a type of digital currency designed to minimize volatility by having their value pegged to a more stable secondary asset such as the U.S. dollar. One challenge stablecoins face is the built-in privacy of cryptocurrencies, which offers a serious stumbling block for regulators and law enforcement professionals. Take tether, the leading stablecoin that is estimated to have a $160 billion market value. It continues to face regulatory scrutiny regarding loose "Know Your Customer" requirements, which are standard at traditional banks to ensure these institutions are not supporting war criminals or terrorist states. But the GENIUS Act looks to find a middle ground, proposing "permitted stablecoin issuers" who are subject to state and federal licensing and oversight. Why it matters for bitcoin investors: Adoption and support for stablecoins will make more mainstream consumers and businesses increasingly comfortable with crypto as they look beyond the legacy financial system. In a recent earnings call, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon admitted his firm has to focus on internal stablecoin development if it wants to fend off competition on payments processing, deposits and even credit card rewards. The billions of dollars currently held in tether stablecoins seem to indicate these digital assets can and will coexist with minimal impact on the value proposition of bitcoin. In truth, many investors see bitcoin's volatility as a feature – so long as that volatility continues to generally provide upside, of course. But continued confidence in digital currencies used for normal consumer and business transactions would be undeniably good for bitcoin, providing yet another proof point that this digital asset is far more than just a fad. The CLARITY Act, also known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, aims to clarify registration requirements and regulatory structures for bitcoin market participants, including digital commodity exchanges, brokers and dealers. The hard reality is that a multi-year turf war between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over jurisdictional issues has created headaches for companies that want to get involved with bitcoin or crypto, but don't know who is in charge of enforcement or oversight. When a regulator is so disengaged or confused that they ignore market participants rather than answering "yes" or "no" on new products or approaches, it is not a good signal for companies that are looking to innovate or challenge the old way of doing business. And considering the CFTC has just two commissioners at present, one of whom announced in May she would be leaving the agency, there is an urgent need to figure out who's the boss. Why it matters for bitcoin investors: Some bitcoin-related entities operate offshore, and sometimes in unscrupulous ways. In many ways, it's pretty amazing that bitcoin has grown as much as it has in the face of this confusing situation between the SEC and CFTC. Disruptive technologies often force public policy stakeholders to rethink the ruleset. And if not, at minimum, the CLARITY Act would provide the long-term path to a regulated and safe environment – but also one that becomes more competitive as startups gain confidence that their next big idea is worth pursuing as it falls within congressionally approved parameters. Part of the reason movement on crypto regulation has been hard is that some of these bills get tied together. For some hardline conservatives, this idea of government-sponsored blockchains of citizen transactions veers too close to Big Brother financial surveillance. Many experts have speculated that increased movement or even discussions around CBDCs will drive more folks to bitcoin because of its proven record of privacy, and its global nature that is separate from national politics and central banking. Time will tell if this provision advances in the Senate, or more importantly, whether the U.S. Federal Reserve or any other Western bank launches a CBDC that catches on. Even the European Central Bank, which is far more advanced in its quest for a digital currency, hasn't moved beyond initial preparation and stakeholder discussions. That means there's little risk of bitcoin losing its appeal anytime soon to a CBDC. Enter your email in the box and click Sign Me Up.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charles Schwab is preparing to expand its crypto offerings by launching spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to CEO Rick Wurster. In an interview with CNBC on Friday, Wurster said Schwab clients already hold significant exposure to crypto via exchange-traded products (ETPs), owning more than 20% of the industry's crypto ETP market. “We think that will be an acceleration of our growth.” The CEO claimed that many clients currently keep 98% of their wealth with Schwab but hold just 1% to 2% of their crypto assets with digital-native firms. They want us to sit alongside their other assets,” he added.

Earlier this year, Wurster said the company expects an April 2026 launch window to provide spot Bitcoin trading services to Schwab clients. At the time, he cited a 400% increase in traffic to Schwab's crypto website as evidence of investor interest in digital assets. Schwab has increased its involvement in the crypto sector amid growing regulatory clarity. The change allows banks to participate in crypto activities such as custody and trading. The company also provides other crypto-related products, including mixed ETFs, mutual funds, and Bitcoin options, according to its website.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>

The House of Representatives yesterday passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act alongside legislation for stablecoins (GENIUS Act) and crypto market infrastructure (Clarity Act). While the GENIUS Act has already passed the Senate, the Anti-CBDC bill still requires a Senate vote.

The current version of the Anti-CBDC bill has refined its language to block only retail central bank digital currencies. Earlier drafts could potentially have prevented the Federal Reserve from using distributed ledger technology (DLT) for a wholesale CBDC only usable by institutional users.

The legislation defines a central bank digital currency as “a form of digital money or monetary value that is—    (i) denominated in the national unit of account;    (ii) a direct liability of the Federal Reserve System; and    (iii) widely available to the general public.”

This distinction matters because wholesale CBDCs are not “widely available to the general public.” A Financial Times opinion piece published today suggested the legislation could isolate “the dollar from the rapid expansion of wholesale CBDCs, which allow faster and cheaper settlements among commercial banks and between central banks themselves.” However, this interpretation appears to misunderstand the current bill's scope.

The Federal Reserve began exploring the classification of wholesale CBDCs a couple of years ago in response to Republican opposition to government digital currencies. The central bank distinguishes between tokenized reserves, which represent existing central bank balances using different technology, and wholesale CBDCs, which create separate legal liabilities. Even if the Anti-CBDC legislation had failed to exclude wholesale CBDC, the Federal Reserve could have argued that a tokenized reserve is no different to current reserves. This is one of the reasons why central banks now prefer to use the term tokenized reserves instead of wholesale CBDCs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bit Origin's $500 million treasury move and mounting DOGE ETF chatter helped restore confidence as volume surged above key thresholds throughout the recovery. Bit Origin announced a $500 million institutional allocation plan to build DOGE-denominated treasury reserves, marking the largest known corporate move into the meme coin to date. Meanwhile, traders are pricing in an 80% chance of a DOGE ETF approval by September, according to prediction platform Polymarket. These developments come as DOGE breaks out from a 10-month consolidation phase. The 24-hour session opened at $0.2437, before sellers dragged DOGE to $0.2267 around 20:00. Volume surged to 1.102 billion—well above the 873.9 million average—as whales defended key support levels. In the final hour, DOGE traded within a tight 1.85% band between $0.2514 and $0.2561. Price hit session highs at 04:34 before retreating slightly on profit-taking. DOGE's ability to hold above $0.25 will be key for any continuation higher. Traders are monitoring ETF headlines and broader memecoin sentiment, while breakout targets of $0.36 to $1.00 are now in play if institutional flows continue. The current volume profile supports short-term consolidation before a possible next leg up.

A wave of renewed optimism, regulatory clarity in key markets and rising institutional flows have catapulted the crypto sector to a new valuation peak. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to create a regulatory framework for U.S.-dollar-pegged cryptocurrency tokens, known as stablecoins, sending the bill to U.S. President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it into law. House lawmakers also passed two other crypto bills, sending them next to the Senate for consideration. One lays out a regulatory framework for crypto, while the other seeks to ban the U.S. from issuing a central bank digital currency. With growing interest from asset managers, new exchange-traded products and broader adoption among retail and corporate users, digital assets are increasingly shaping conversations in global finance. Their use has grown rapidly in recent years, and proponents say they could be used to send payments instantly. Corporate treasury allocations to bitcoin are also gaining pace, with a growing number of public companies adding the token to their balance sheets as a long-term store of value. Bitcoin crossed the $120,000 mark earlier this week, setting a record. Brokerage Bernstein forecast it could climb to $200,000 by end-2025. Ether, the second-biggest crypto token, was last up 4.5%. It has more than doubled over the past three months. The crypto rally also powered gains in linked equities, with Coinbase and Robinhood climbing to all-time highs on Friday. Shares of the crypto exchange were last up 1%, while the retail trading platform, which also supports crypto trades, gained 3%. Please abide by our community guidelines   for posting your comments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Updated on:  July 18, 2025 / 8:34 PM EDT / CBS News Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. This is a hell of an act." The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill. "The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president "stepped in and saved this bill." Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through. The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins. With the GENIUS Act signed into law, banks, nonbanks and credit unions can dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins. Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor, said stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments "nearly instantaneously," rather than taking weeks. "Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins," Mr. Trump said. A lot of people are saying that." The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed "one-for-one" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, "strengthening the dollar" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a "21st-century upgrade." Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed "Crypto Week" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. "Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out," the president said. But this signing is a massive validation." The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year. The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015. The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week. Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon. "REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED….BUT NO MORE," Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence. "Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval," the president wrote on Truth Social. "This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.</p>
