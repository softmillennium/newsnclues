                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WESTBURY, N.Y. (AP) — A man who was pulled into an MRI machine in New York after he walked into the room wearing a large weight-training chain around his neck has died, according to police and his wife, who told a local television outlet that he waved goodbye before his body went limp. The man, 61, had entered an MRI room while a scan was underway Wednesday afternoon at Nassau Open MRI. Adrienne Jones-McAllister told News 12 Long Island in a recorded interview that she was undergoing an MRI on her knee when she asked the technician to get her husband, Keith McAllister, to help her get off the table. She told News 12 that the technician summoned into the room her husband, who was wearing a 20-pound chain that he uses for weight training, an object they'd had a casual conversation about during a previous visit with comments like: “Ooooooh, that's a big chain!” When he got close to her, she said, “at that instant, the machine switched him around, pulled him in and he hit the MRI.” '” she recalled, as tears ran down her face. She said the technician helped her try to pull her husband off the machine but it was impossible. “He waved goodbye to me and then his whole body went limp,” Jones-McAllister told the TV outlet. Jones-McAllister told News 12 that McAllister suffered heart attacks after he was freed from the MRI machine. A person who answered the phone at Nassau Open MRI on Long Island declined to comment Friday. The phone number went unanswered on Saturday. It wasn't the first New York death to result from an MRI machine. MRI machines “employ a strong magnetic field” that “exerts very powerful forces on objects of iron, some steels, and other magnetizable objects,” according to the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, which says the units are “strong enough to fling a wheelchair across the room.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When she announced the album's release, she said it was “born out of an experience” where she had felt unwelcome — a likely reference to racist comments generated by her 2016 appearance at the Country Music Awards, where some country fans claimed she had no place at the event. If the establishment will try to deny them a seat at the table, Beyoncé has made it her mission to bring a chair anyway — just see the thousands of Black fans donning their cowboy boots and matching wide-brimmed hats at each tour stop. It can be powerful for an artist of Beyoncé's caliber to highlight such narratives, but the fan response is more nuanced. “It's very true that Beyoncé has faced really unfair critique from a lot of different sectors. She hasn't been recognized in the way that she should for her artistry,” said Stacy Lee Kong, culture critic and founder of newsletter Friday Things. “And at the same time, we also see a superficiality to her politics.” Beyoncé's shows underline those messages further, while referencing additional Black history and traditional patriotic imagery. She performs “The Star-Spangled Banner,” set to Jimi Hendrix's distorted Woodstock rendition; a video screen flashes the message, “Never ask permission for something that already belongs to you.” She embraces red, white and blue — just see her blue leotard embellished with silver stars and the accompanying floor-length American flag fur coat from her Fourth of July show in Washington, DC. Even among some of her self-proclaimed fans, the ideas presented can be sticky: “I think people's issues lie where she is silent on current injustices and issues that are happening under that flag now whilst simultaneously constantly draping herself in it,” noted one fan on X. Especially for an artist whose work is often so deeply researched and layered with meaning, Lee Kong said, the fact that Beyoncé doesn't actually say anything specifically about American politics feels fraught. Celebrating being an American, and celebrating Black people's role in America, without actually verbalizing the harm that the United States can cause feels simplistic in today's political landscape, Lee Kong said. Despite her larger artistic message, many fans simply want more from Beyoncé. “You can't sell an idea and be wishy-washy about it,” she said. “This is a really difficult line to walk, no matter what, and it has become more difficult as audiences have become more sophisticated and more aware of the complicated politics that are informing our lives.” The complexity of this line is perhaps best exhibited by Beyoncé's Buffalo Soldiers T-shirt, worn during her Juneteenth performance in Paris. On the back of her shirt was a block of text, which read in part: “their antagonists were the enemies of peace, order and settlement: warring Indians, bandits, cattle thieves, murderous gunmen, bootleggers, trespassers, and Mexican revolutionaries.” Beyoncé is not new to this type of critique — and she hasn't been completely silent about political topics over the years. During her performance at the Super Bowl in 2016, Beyoncé and her dancers appeared in all-black costumes with fists raised, a clear nod to the Black Panthers. In 2023, as her “Renaissance” tour film played in Israel amid the war in Gaza, with videos surfacing of pro-IDF Israelis singing the single, “Break My Soul,” critics argued that the artist who could incorporate explicit political messaging into her 2016 performance should also speak up about the war. Parker, co-host of NPR's “Code Switch,” at the time. At this year's Super Bowl, Kendrick Lamar seemingly rejected these notions altogether, proclaiming: “The revolution's about to be televised. “She is one of the most powerful women in the entertainment industry,” said Melvin Williams, a professor at Pace University who studies race, gender and sexuality in celebrity culture. “That she now has to be an expert of everything, stand up for all causes, while performing and showing up flawlessly — that is an impossible standard for any human being.” Beyoncé did endorse Kamala Harris's presidential bid last year, and she has also made more subtle political references during the tour. In one image from the Cowboy Carter tour book, Beyoncé is pictured sitting at a sewing machine while stitching the American flag, in tribute to Grace Wisher, a Black girl who helped sew the original Star-Spangled Banner. Her veiled, white dress — potentially a callback to the “veil” analyzed by W.E.B. DuBois, a metaphor used to explain the color line between White and Black Americans — is splattered with blood. As a celebrity, Beyoncé is adept at initiating social commentary, yet she rarely gives interviews. To some, her message is clear, and demands for more are taken as examples of the undue expectations society places on Black women. Despite pushes to do so, it's unlikely that she will ever “explicitly grapple with, for example, America's history of empire building or the persistence of capitalism in America,” Williams said. But Beyoncé's work presents an entry point into thinking more deeply about the world around us, Lee Kong said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump holds a gavel after he signed his signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts at the White House, Friday, July 4, 2025, in Washington, surrounded by members of Congress. President Donald Trump pounds a gavel presented to him by House Speaker Mike Johnson after he signed his signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts at the White House, Friday, July 4, 2025, in Washington. House Speaker Mike Johnson, r-La., hands President Donald Trump a gavel after Trump signed his signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts at the White House in Washington, Friday, July 4, 2025. House Speaker Mike Johnson of La., hands President Donald Trump a gavel after he signed his signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts at the White House, Friday, July 4, 2025, in Washington, surrounded by members of Congress. President Donald Trump bangs a gavel after signing his signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts at the White House in Washington, Friday, July 4, 2025. “I want you to have it,” he said. Handing over the gavel delighted President Donald Trump who, seated behind a desk outdoors, immediately tested it out with a few quick thumps. The gesture reflected a traditional nod of honor, from one leader to another, a milestone of the Republican Party's priority legislation becoming law. But the imagery also underscored a symbolic transfer of political power, from Capitol Hill to the White House as a compliant Congress is ceding more and more of its prerogative to the presidency. Since Trump's return to the White House in January, and particularly in the past few weeks, Republicans in control of the House and Senate have shown an unusual willingness to give the president of their party what he wants, regardless of the potential risk to themselves, their constituents and Congress itself. Republicans raced to put the big package of tax breaks and spending cuts on Trump's desk by his Independence Day deadline. Senators had quickly confirmed almost all of Trump's outsider Cabinet nominees despite grave reservations over Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary, Pete Hegseth as the Pentagon chief and others. House Republicans pursued Trump's interest in investigating his perceived foes, including investigating Democratic President Joe Biden'suse of the autopen. But at the same time, Congress hit the brakes on one of its own priorities, legislation imposing steep sanctions on Russia over its war on Ukraine, after Trump announced he was allowing President Vladimir Putin an additional 50 days to negotiate a peace deal, dashing hopes for a swifter end to the conflict. This past week, Congress was tested anew, delivering on Trump's request to rescind some $9 billion that lawmakers had approved but that the administration wanted to eliminate, including money for public broadcasting and overseas aid. It was a rare presidential request, a challenge to the legislative branch's power of the purse, that has not been used in decades. We should be legislating,” said a defiant Sen. Lisa Murkowksi, R-Alaska, as she refused to support the White House's demand to rescind money for National Public Radio and others. Those who did speak up — Liz Cheney of Wyoming in the House and Mitt Romney of Utah in the Senate, among others — are gone from Capitol Hill. One former GOP senator, Jeff Flake of Arizona, who announced in 2017 during Trump's first term that he would not seek reelection the next year, is imploring Republicans to find a better way. “In today's Republican Party, voting your conscience is essentially disqualifying.” But this time, the halls of Congress are filled with many Republicans who came of political age with Trump's “Make America Great Again” movement and owe their ascent to the president himself. Many are emulating his brand and style as they shape their own. A new generation of GOP leaders, Johnson in the House and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, have pulled closer to Trump. Johnson, R-La., has openly pined for what he calls a “normal Congress.” But short of that, the speaker relies on Trump to help stay on track. When Republicans hit an impasse on cryptocurrency legislation, a Trump priority, it was the president who met with holdouts in the Oval Office late Tuesday night as Johnson called in by phone. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., endured Trump's criticism over his opposition to the tax and spending cuts bill. Tillis announced he would not seek reelection in 2026. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, voted against that bill and the rescissions package despite Trump's threat to campaign against any dissenters. One Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, appears to be pressing on, unphased. “Nowhere in the Constitution does it say that if the president wants something, you must do it,” said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, in a Senate speech. We don't have to operate under the assumption that this man is uniquely so powerful.”</p>

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons joins Americas Newsroom to discuss the Democrats resistance to the Trump administrations crackdown on illegal immigration. Military bases in both New Jersey and Indiana will soon be used by Homeland Security to house illegal immigrants, drawing a furious response from Democratic lawmakers. Parts of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey and Camp Atterbury in Indiana will be repurposed and used as "temporary soft-sided holding facilities," the Defense Department told Fox News Digital, citing a decision by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. New Jersey Democrats blasted the decision, warning it would harm military readiness and urging Republicans to join them in helping reverse it. Both bases were previously used to house thousands of Afghan refugees following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Afghan refugees walk outside a temporary housing facility in Liberty Village on Joint Base McGuire-Dix- Lakehurst in New Jersey, U.S., December 2, 2021. "This is an inappropriate use of our national defense system and militarizes a radical immigration policy that has resulted in the inhumane treatment of undocumented immigrants and unlawful deportation of U.S. citizens, including children, across the country," the group of Democrats said in a joint statement. "Using our country's military to detain and hold undocumented immigrants jeopardizes military preparedness and paves the way for ICE immigration raids in every New Jersey community. We have the greatest military in the world and using it as a domestic political tool is unacceptable and shameful." Afghan refugee women register to be seen by a doctor inside the medical tent in Liberty Village on December 2, 2021 in Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey. The statement was made by Reps. Herb Conaway, LaMonica McIver, Donald Norcross, Rob Menendez, Frank Pallone, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Josh Gottheimer and Nellie Pou as well as Sens. It is unclear when either site will open and a decision will depend on operational requirements and coordination with Homeland Security, the Defense Department said. Spanning 42,00 acres, it's home to 45,000 military and civilian personnel, making it one of the largest and most strategically important on the East Coast. Secretary of Defense approved the plan to transform parts of the bases into facilities for illegal migrants. Under the Trump administration, Homeland Security has been using detention facilities to house migrants while they await asylum hearings or deportation. Hegseth wrote in the letter that the move would not negatively affect military training, operations, readiness, or any other military requirements, per NJ Spotlight News. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., was among a group of Democrats to slam the move. New Jersey is already home to Delaney Hall and the Elizabeth Detention Center which are being used as immigration detention facilities, although they are privately operated. Delaney Hall was the scene where Democrat Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested and charged with trespassing in a clash with federal immigration officials in May. Rep. LaMonica McIver, D‑N.J., was later federally charged for allegedly interfering with federal officers during the same incident. The news comes two weeks after President Donald Trump signed the Big Beautiful Bill into law, which allocated between $150 billion and $170 billion towards immigration enforcement over the next several years, $45 billion of which was carved out to expand immigration detention facilities. Earlier this month, the Trump administration opened an immigration detention camp in Florida's Everglades that is surrounded by alligators dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Medical devices in the brain are already making a difference for countless patients. When you hear the word “neurotechnology,” you may picture Black Mirror headsets prying open the last private place we have — our own skulls — or the cyber-samurai of William Gibson's Neuromancer. That dread is natural, but it can blind us to the real potential being realized in neurotech to address the long intractable medical challenges found in our brains. In just the past 18 months, brain tech has cleared three hurdles at once: smarter algorithms, shrunken hardware, and — most important — proof that people can feel the difference in their bodies and their moods. A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world. Keith Krehbiel has battled Parkinson's disease for nearly a quarter-century. By 2020, as Nature recently reported, the tremors were winning — until neurosurgeons slipped Medtronic's Percept device into his head. Unlike older deep-brain stimulators that carpet-bomb movement control regions in the brain with steady current, the Percept listens first. It hunts the beta-wave “bursts” in the brain that mark a Parkinson's flare and then fires back millisecond by millisecond, an adaptive approach that mimics the way a cardiac pacemaker paces an arrhythmic heart. Because the electrodes spark only when symptoms do, total energy use is reduced, increasing battery life and delaying the next skull-opening surgery. Better yet, because every Percept shipped since 2020 already has the sensing chip, the adaptive mode can be activated with a simple firmware push, the way you'd update your iPhone. Gentle pulses “reawakened” half-dormant motor neurons: Every participant walked farther, tired less, and — astonishingly — one person strode from home to the lab without resting. The brain isn't only wires and muscles; mood lives there, too. In March, the Food and Drug Administration tagged a visor-like headset from Pulvinar Neuro as a Breakthrough Device for major-depressive disorder. The technology offers a ray of hope for patients whose depression has resisted conventional treatments like drugs. Cochlear implants for people with hearing loss once sounded like sci-fi; today more than 1 million people hear through them. That proof-of-scale has emboldened a new wave of brain-computer interfaces, including from Elon Musk's startup Neuralink. The company's first user, 30-year-old quadriplegic Noland Arbaugh, told Wired last year he now “multitasks constantly” with a thought-controlled cursor, clawing back some of the independence lost to a 2016 spinal-cord injury. Neuralink isn't as far along as Musk often claims — Arbaugh's device experienced some problems, with some threads detaching from the brain — but the promise is there. On the speech front, new systems are decoding neural signals into text on a computer screen, or even synthesized voice. In 2023 researchers from Stanford and the University of California San Francisco installed brain implants in two women who had lost the ability to speak, and managing to hit decoding times of 62 and 78 words per minute, far faster than previous brain tech interfaces. That's still much slower than the 160 words per minute of natural English speech, but more recent advances are getting closer to that rate. Europe's new AI Act now treats “neuro-biometric categorization” — technologies that can classify individuals by biometric information, including brain data — as high-risk, demanding transparency and opt-outs, while the US BRAIN Initiative 2.0 is paying for open-source toolkits so anyone can pop the hood on the algorithms. When it works, neurotech acts less like a hammer than a tuning fork — nudging each section back on pitch, then stepping aside so the music can play. Real patients are walking farther, talking faster, and, in some cases, simply feeling like themselves again. A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most people don't expect Mimi Hymel to remember Hurricane Katrina. After all, she was only 3 when the Category 5 storm slammed into her Louisiana home in 2005. But nearly 20 years later, as Hymel watched news of the floodwaters inundating Texas Hill Country and saw the harrowing images of destruction from Camp Mystic, she said those memories came back with sharp clarity. She can still recall the moment her family decided they couldn't ride out Katrina and the sinking feeling she felt as her mom placed Hymel and her sister in their car and drove away, leaving their dad behind to work at a nearby hospital. “I just had no idea if my dad was OK or even coming home at all,” she recalled. In a scary time like that, I really wanted it for comfort.” But all these years later, she's found a way of channeling her experience during Katrina into helping today's youngest survivors. In the immediate aftermath of Katrina, Hymel said there was no shortage of local organizations and kind neighbors who tried to meet her family's immediate needs for food, clothes and shelter. “When we finally did get back to our house, everything was destroyed,” she recalled. Studies have long shown blankets or stuffed animals can help children adapt to unfamiliar or distressing situations and they become even more important when a child is processing grief. Although the family ultimately resettled in Texas, as she grew older, Hymel said she noticed how some first responders or families would share photos of stuffed animals they recovered after a disaster. “I was once that child so it's always just emotional seeing those photos,” she said. After the success of her early donation efforts, Hymel founded Comfort Bears in a Catastrophe. Each stuffed animal is tagged with a card offering free crisis counseling through the national Disaster Distress Helpline, which offers children and their families help navigating traumatic events. As interest in her work grew, so did the need. And so far, the nonprofit has donated more than 50,000 stuffed animals to children in need, Hymel said. She has also written a series of children's books called “Miss Prepared and Captain Ready.” From her home in Houston earlier this month, Annie Gully and her daughter watched as reports of flooding in the Texas Hill Country grew more dire by the hour. A close friend, she later learned, lost her niece, 8-year-old Blakely McCrory, in the floodwaters at Camp Mystic. “It's just unfathomable to even wrap your head around something like this happening,” she said. So, when her daughter suggested a donation drive for kids, she leaped at the idea. She reached out to Comfort Bears on social media and within hours they had a game plan. Gully's donation drive was covered on the local news and “that day alone, I think we collected 600” stuffed animals, she said. After three days they received more than 1,100 donations to be distributed throughout the state. “Children don't really have an outlet to help” after a crisis, Gully said. “You could tell their parents had explained to them that other kids have lost their lovies and how sad would it be if you lost your(s).” Gully is also selling “Mystic Strong” artwork, and the proceeds will be donated to charity in honor of McCrory and the other lives lost at Camp Mystic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats will be put to the test next week when Senate Republicans bring to a vote the first of several bipartisan government funding bills for next fiscal year. But fresh off a Republican-controlled Congress clawing back $9 billion in DOGE-inspired cuts from money that both parties previously approved, Democrats are at a crossroads regarding whether to provide critical votes to fund the government without GOP assurances portions won't be rescinded. “They stabbed us in the back, and if they commit to us that they won't do that again, then we might be able to write bills,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), a member of leadership and the Appropriations Committee. “The vibe today is, ‘we're going to trade baseball cards with you, and then we're going to sneak into your house later today and take our cards back. The consternation over how to move forward has become a point of contention both internally among Democrats and in conversations with their GOP colleagues. Appropriators Murphy and Sen. Katie Britt (R-AL) engaged Thursday in what appeared to be a tense floor conversation shortly before the Democrat teed off on Republicans. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) conceded that less bipartisanship would undercut efforts to overcome the 60-vote filibuster, a threshold that the White House rescission request was able to avoid. “That runs contrary to what the math tells us around here,” Thune said of Vought's remarks. And my expectation is, at least I hope, we plan to move [appropriations] bills that will have cooperation.” But Democrats say the onus is on Republicans to extend offers that convince them back to the negotiating table, such as public assurances or potential stipulations inked into funding bills. “Republicans are presiding over the evisceration of their own power, and they've been politically lobotomized. The $9 billion rescission package took back foreign aid money for global health programs and public broadcast funding that Republicans assailed as government waste, some of which they said was allocated by federal bureaucrats for inappropriate programs. “If 10 Democrats don't want to work with us on cutting out all this NPR funding when they're actively, overtly partisan, then we have a responsibility to act on our own,” Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO), who was tapped by the White House to lead the rescission vote-wrangling effort, told the Washington Examiner. But a recent schism between a group of Senate Republicans, including several close allies to President Donald Trump, tested the bounds in which GOP lawmakers were willing to let the administration alter how Congress intended appropriated funds to be used. The Department of Education, which Trump is seeking to dismantle, has since released money for state education programs after alarms were raised by senators that it was improperly being withheld, according to Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV). Let us know what's going on,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) told the Washington Examiner.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japan's Prime Minister and Liberal Democratic Party President Shigeru Ishiba speaks during a debate with leaders of other political parties at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo, July 2, 2025. TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces an increasingly uphill battle in Sunday's upper house election, and a loss could worsen political instability at a time of daunting challenges, such as rising prices and high U.S. tariffs. A poor performance would not immediately trigger a change of government but it would deepen uncertainty over his fate and Japan's future path. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a humiliating loss in a lower house election in October as its usual supporters registered their unhappiness over past corruption scandals and high prices. His minority government has since been forced into making concessions to the opposition to get legislation through the Diet, or parliament. On top of shortages and soaring prices for rice, a traditional staple, Ishiba has been stymied by President Donald Trump's tariff demands. Leaders of eight political parties, from left to right, Komeito Chief Representative Tetsuo Saito, Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan leader Yoshihiko Noda, Japan's Prime Minister and Liberal Democratic Party leader Shigeru Ishiba, Japan Innovation Party Co-Representative Hirofumi Yoshimura and Democratic Party For the People Representative Yuichiro Tamaki pose before a debate at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo, July 2, 2025. Frustrated voters are rapidly turning to emerging populist parties, including one that is promoting anti-foreign policies and backpedaling on gender equality and diversity. “It makes a leadership very unstable.” Under any successor, the ruling coalition would be a minority in both houses, he said. If Ishiba's coalition secures a majority and he stays on, his leadership will remain weak, with little hope of improved support ratings, Uchiyama said. President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, on April 2, 2025, in Washington. Measures to mitigate soaring prices, lagging incomes and burdensome social security payments are the top focus of frustrated, cash-strapped voters. Rice prices have doubled since last year due to supply shortages, overly complex distribution systems and other reasons related to Japan's farming, causing panic buying as Ishiba has struggled to resolve the crisis. A 25% tariff due to take effect Aug. 1 has been another blow for Ishiba. The rice issue has cost Ishiba one farm minister. Sohei Kamiya, leader of the Sanseito party, speaks during an election campaign in Tosu, Saga prefecture, southwestern Japan, on July 12, 2025. Stricter measures targeting foreign residents and visitors have suddenly emerged as a key issue. The Sanseito party stands out with the toughest anti-foreigner stance with its “Japanese First” platform that proposes a new agency to centralize policies related to foreigners. It wants stricter screening for allowing Japanese citizenship and to exclude non-Japanese from welfare benefits. The party's populist platform is also anti-vaccine, anti-globalism and favors traditional gender roles. A typical claim is that a rapid increase in foreign workers has hurt Japanese workers' wages and that foreigners use a large share of welfare benefits and have made Japanese society unsafe. “Foreigners are used as targets to vent their discontent and unease,” Uchiyama said, comparing the scapegoating to that in Europe and the United States under Trump. Experts say most of the rhetoric is disinformation aimed at frustrations among Japanese struggling to get by. The Liberal Democrats, under a slogan “zero illegal immigrants,” have pledged to crack down on growing illegal employment of foreigners and against allowing them to default on social insurance payments or medical bills. The party also set up a task force to promote an orderly society, a move aimed at enforcing stricter measures on foreigners to address growing public unease. The move triggered protests by human rights activists and alarmed foreign residents. Given that its population is rapidly aging and shrinking, Japan needs foreign workers. It should discuss immigration policy more strategically, Takahide Kiuchi, an executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a recent analysis. A pedestrian passes an election board displaying posters of candidates for the upcoming July 20 upper house election in Tokyo, Friday, July 18, 2025. Headed by charismatic Sohei Kamiya, a former local assembly member and a member of the defense reserve, Sanseito ranked as second favorite in the opposition after the CDPJ in some recent surveys. They are believed to be raking in conservative supporters of the ruling party who are disappointed by Ishiba's leadership and flip-flops on policies. Ishiba is caught between his party's ultraconservatives and mainstream opposition leaders. If the ruling coalition loses its upper house majority, that could spark a regrouping among coalitions. Yoshihiko Noda, a former prime minister and head of the opposition CDPJ, said the loss of ruling coalition majorities in both houses of parliament would enable opposition parties to push policies blocked by the LDP. Those include cuts in the consumption tax, recognition of same-sex marriages, and a law allowing married couples the option of each keeping their own names.</p>

A Russian lawmaker who regulates the country's IT said Friday that WhatsApp should prepare to leave the Russian market, warning that the messaging app would likely be put on a list of restricted software. Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the lower house of parliament's information technology committee, said in a statement that MAX, a state-backed messaging app integrated with government services, could gain market share if WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, left the country. "It's time for WhatsApp to prepare to leave the Russian market," Gorelkin said, adding that Meta is designated as an extremist organization in Russia. Facebook and Instagram, both also owned by Meta, have been banned in Russia since 2022, when Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in a war that continues. A Russian lawmaker who regulates the country's IT said WhatsApp should prepare to leave the Russian market. Gorelkin made his comments after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law last month authorizing the development of MAX as Russia seeks to reduce its dependence on platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. Russian lawmakers approved sweeping legal amendments this week, proposing fines of up to 5,000 rubles, or $63, for anyone searching for material online the government considers to be extremist, including Instagram and Facebook, and opposition politicians and activists. The proposal sparked criticism, including from some Kremlin backers like Margarita Simonyan, a state media executive who said journalists would be unable to investigate the activities of opposition groups such as the Anti-Corruption Fund founded by deceased opposition figure Alexei Navalny. Anton Nemkin, a member of the parliament's IT committee, said it was determined that WhatsApp would leave Russia. "The presence of such a service in Russia's digital space is, in fact, a legal breach of national security," Nemkin said, according to TASS, a state-owned news agency. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said all services must follow Russian law when asked if WhatsApp may leave the country. Russia has long attempted to establish what it describes as digital sovereignty by promoting home-grown services. But critics have expressed concerns that Russia's new state-backed messaging app may track its users' activities and have suggested Russia could slow WhatsApp's speeds to encourage downloads of the new app. YouTube has had its audience in Russia decline significantly in the last year to fewer than 10 million daily users from more than 40 million in mid-2024 because slower download speeds have made it more difficult for people to access the video platform. Shares in state-controlled technology company VK, which is developing homegrown digital services like VK Video, a rival to YouTube, grew 1.9% Friday. President Vladimir Putin signed a law authorizing the development of a state-backed messaging app integrated with government services. The Kremlin released a list of instructions this week from Putin, including a directive to introduce additional restrictions on the use in Russia of software, including communication services produced in "unfriendly countries" that have imposed sanctions against Russia. Referring to Putin's order, Gorelkin said WhatsApp would likely be among the communication services to face new restrictions.

New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, appeared on the ‘Far Left Show' podcast in August 2020, where he espoused several radical far-left views. New York City's leading mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani, a self-proclaimed socialist, is raising eyebrows once again for appearing to suggest prisons are not important in a recently resurfaced video. Mamdani, a New York state assemblyman and the Democratic nominee for mayor, made the comments in a 2020 interview while running for state office. Asked whether he thought prisons were obsolete, Mamdani responded, "I think that frankly – I mean – what purpose do they serve? Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani appeared to dismiss the need for prisons in a resurfaced interview. They're not defending the reality of it and the practices that are part and parcel of it. "Because if you actually break it down and ask people how many people come out of the prison system better than they went into the prison system, how much harm is actually being prevented versus created, I think when you ask these kinds of questions, people don't always have clear answers." What are you going to do about rapists?' "We need a system of justice that will repair the harm that has been caused and address it in a serious way because right now we don't have it, and it makes everyone more unsafe." Mamdani also claimed "the power of the executive is almost limitless here in New York State" and criticized then-New York Democratic Gov. Mamdani, who has promised to overhaul New York City and launch massive new government programs, has been endorsed by progressive politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. New York City mayoral candidates Zohran Mamdani, Eric Adams, Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa. As the Democratic nominee in heavily blue New York City, Mamdani is the likely frontrunner to unseat the current mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, who is running for re-election as an independent. Mamdani is seen by many as a controversial candidate, partially due to his socialist policy proposals and heavy criticism of the state of Israel. He has declined to say whether Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state and initially refused to condemn the phrase "globalize the intifada." However, he recently began distancing himself from the phrase. Fox News Digital reached out to the Mamdani campaign but did not receive a response.
