                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea have been world champions for almost an entire week now, and since this new Club World Cup tournament is only held every four years (like the actual World Cup), we will get to call ourselves world champions for the next four years. (The annual format lives on as the brand new “FIFA Intercontinental Cup”, first held last December.) However, our participation in the next Club World Cup, to potentially defend our title, is not guaranteed. This runs contrary to most club competitions at UEFA level, where the winners automatically qualify for next year's tournament (or qualify for the higher level competition, such as the Europa League winner going into next year's Champions League). It is however in line with the way FIFA do things. The winners of the World Cup used to get an automatic spot, but that was changed in 2000, and now every national team except the host nation's (or nations') has to qualify. The Athletic do point out that FIFA have not actually adopted a “definitive” position on this issue, and have plenty of leeway built into their regulations to easily decide to change their policies either officially or unofficially (like when they granted Inter Miami a place in this year's tournament as the “host country representative team”, a provision they invented on the spot). But as things stand, we will have to earn our way back in — by either winning the Champions League in the next three years, or by performing at a high level consistently enough to get an at-large bid. Ironically, runners-up PSG are already qualified as the 2025 Champions League-winners. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Please enter a valid email and try again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For those who own homes or businesses in South Florida, it's a great opportunity. Local FIFA fans aren't just getting ready to cheer on their favorite teams but potentially reap the benefits of the thousands of visitors who will come to the United States to watch any of the 78 matches that will be played across 11 cities. “We as hosts we really specialize and really pride ourselves on providing an experience, more than just a stay,” shares Andres Aguirre, a host with AirBnB. He says his summer 2026 bookings are ready to welcome soccer fans to one of his properties located just 10 minutes from Hard Rock Stadium, the host of 7 World Cup Games. “We have four bedrooms and two bathrooms, with a pool, a heated pool,” Aguirre shares as he showcases the property. “We also have a hot tub, fire pit and an outdoor area where you can just relax and enjoy your time here.” A house like Andres' in September could rent for $550 a night, but during the World Cup, which runs from June 11th to July 19th of next year the price practically doubles. “At the end of the day we expect an average host to make more than $3,000 dollars during the event in 2026, so it's important to think of this as a great economic opportunity, while still remaining a casual host, and don't make this a full time activity for you,” said Jordi Torres Mallol, the America Regional Director of AirBnB. Mallol added that the influx of tourists will yield in a major economic boost. This adds up to economic opportunity and economic impact of $3.6 billion dollars, and in the case of Miami, $380 million dollars,” explained Mallol. And if that wasn't enough, the accommodation platform will offer exclusive experiences for fans. And closer to home, tour guides like Diana Contreras are just one of the many business owners that are hoping to give fans a unique experience to learn about the city in which the games are being played. “I love this neighborhood so much, I have been here 13 years, so this is very natural for me, to give tours of my favorite neighborhood and the artists that I know as my friends and my own art as well,” Contreras said. According to a Deloitte and Touche study, AirBnB hosts in the 11 World Cup host cities could generate up to $210 million dollars in profits -- a financial goal!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cole Palmer and his influencer girlfriend Connie Grace have unfollowed each other on social media just days after the Chelsea star won the Club World cup. The Chelsea star and his partner have also removed all pictures of one another from their respective accounts. It comes after the 23-year-old starred in the Club World Cup final, scoring two goals and claiming an assist for Joao Pedro, as Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain to become world champions. Now the pair have both unfollowed one another on Instagram. Palmer this week said he was looking forward to being reunited with his girlfriend, but that he first wanted to visit St Kitts and Nevis. Mail Sport exclusively accompanied Palmer as he returned to his ancestral Caribbean homeland for the first time, where his paternal grandfather was born. Meanwhile, Grace is continuing to enjoy a holiday in Miami, posting a picture of herself in the city on her Instagram on Friday. Palmer and Grace went public together in November last year at the GQ Men of the Year Awards and are around eleven months into their relationship. Grace, a nail technician and Instagram influencer with 38,000 followers, is also from Manchester. The duo met when they were 17 through mutual friends. Palmer is currently enjoying his summer break after another impressive season, where he guided Chelsea to the Europa Conference League title. He scored 18 goals and provided 14 assists in all competitions, scoring 15 and assisting nine in the Premier League, as Chelsea qualified for the Champions League for the first time in three years. The Blues take on Erik Ten Hag's Bayer Leverkusen in less than three weeks in their opening pre-season game, before hosting AC Milan two days later. They then begin their Premier League campaign by welcoming Crystal Palace to Stamford Bridge on August 17.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino's stoic grin and pondering eyes may not capture much emotion on the sidelines with the U.S. men's national team, but don't take that for a lack of care. While many hung their heads, Pochettino's eyes watered as he addressed the group, likely before moving to speak with the assembled media. The way that you worked, the staff, everyone, I think today we deserved more to lift the trophy because I think the performance was there,” Pochettino told the dejected players and staff in a speech now unveiled in a recent U.S. Soccer video. “I think you fought with too many adversities and too many factors against you...that's not going to kill us, it's going to make us stronger, and I want you never to give up. “I think we still have time to be better, [so] keep improving, but please don't change. Even without key star players such as Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun, among others, the opportunity to navigate a group stage and knockout phase, while keeping the group together for over a month, was invaluable. We were so close and the people started to understand, because Mexico now was saying ‘well done, how you've played and how the team is so strong, and how difficult it is to play against you,” Pochettino added in his speech. “It's so painful, but I think we need to have our heads up because you did everything. I am so proud, and I think all of the people outside will feel the same...I hope we can keep this feeling, that we want to work together and work for the team.” In front of reporters, Pochettino blamed the match officials, particularly for the handball instance involving Jorge Sánchez, whose hand fell on top of the ball and went uncalled, despite strong appeals from the USMNT players and staff. Additionally, he expressed his frustrations that Mexico's 77th-minute winning goal from Edson Álvarez was allowed to stand, after initially being ruled offside. “I'm not going to cry,” Pochettino said in the press availability. “OK, well, the excuses now, but you know that was [a] penalty and maybe 2-1 for us, and maybe we now [would be] celebrating the trophy. For Pochettino, though, all eyes are on September and October and friendlies against South Korea, Japan, Colombia and Ecuador, as he continues to build the USMNT to next summer's World Cup. “That is this sport, it's so cruel, because we were so close and you nearly touched it and it disappeared,” he told the players. It's because, here inside, we always need more. If we push it, it's because the goal for you is to be the best.” Ben Steiner is an American-Canadian journalist who brings in-depth experience, having covered the North American national teams, MLS, CPL, NWSL, NSL and Liga MX for prominent outlets, including MLSsoccer.com, CBC Sports, and OneSoccer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Premier League trio Manchester United, Liverpool, and Manchester City have been ‘stripped' of one of their most prestigious titles following a controversial FIFA decision this week. It appears the world football governing body is attempting to rewrite Club World Cup history as part of its ongoing efforts to raise the tournament's profile. But perhaps the most controversial change of all is FIFA's decision to disregard all past winners of the tournament and start from scratch. They have now officially declared Chelsea as the ‘first ever' Club World Cup champions following their emphatic 3-0 win over Champions League holders PSG last Sunday at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, according to the Daily Mail. After winning club football's most lucrative competition, Chelsea aren't guaranteed to be present to defend their title in 2029. Previous winners of the Club World Cup are now labelled by FIFA as "FIFA Intercontinental Champions." As such, though, the likes of Liverpool, Man City, Man United, Real Madrid and Barcelona are no longer considered world champions. The competition was first played in 2000 as the Club World Championship, before returning in 2005, and was played annually until 2023, before adopting its current form. Chelsea had also won it previously in 2021. Real Madrid won it the most times with five - most recently in 2022 - while Barcelona won it four times, and Chelsea, Corinthians, and Bayern Munich twice. A change in trophy appears to have brought with it an official change in who can claim to have won the Club World Cup. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Only Current Champions and Current European and Continental champions should have been allowed to enter this competition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All three teams watched on as Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 to win the Club World Cup final last weekend. Cole Palmer scored a brace in New Jersey, with Joao Pedro's strike making it 3-0 before half-time and proving to be the final goal of the game. This year's Club World Cup was played under an entirely new format, with a group and knockout phase consisting of 32 teams from six confederations. FIFA have now made a decision over how they recognise the new tournament - and it is bad news for United, Liverpool and City. They have decided to recognise Chelsea as the 'first-ever' Club World Cup winners, meaning they are now the only club side who can be considered as 'world champions'. There is a similarly-named tournament known as the FIFA Intercontinental Cup, which sees each of the six teams that won their confederation's continental cup compete in a mini-tournament in December. After all that, we're left with something of a roll of honour that recognises just one world champion - and many more now-former world champions. The Club World Cup is set to return in 2029, with PSG, Pyramids, Al Hilal and Cruz Azul already qualified after winning their continental championships last season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (May 30, 2025) – The U.S. Under-20 Men's National Team will continue its preparation for the FIFA U-20 World Cup with an international camp from June 2-10 in Cairo, Egypt. Originally called up for the U-19 MNT's camp in Marbella, Spain next week, defender Luca Bombino and forward Zavier Gozo will now join the U-20 MNT for the matches against Colombia and Egypt. A total of 14 Major League Soccer clubs are represented on the roster, led by two players from Atlanta United. Six players are based abroad, with two plying the trade in Spain and one each coming Denmark, England, Germany and Portugal. Goalkeepers (2): Gavin Beavers (Brondby/DEN; Henderson, Nev.), Diego Kochen (FC Barcelona/ESP; Miramar, Fla.) ), Reed Baker-Whiting (Seattle Sounders; Seattle, Wash.), Luca Bombino (San Diego FC; Saugus, Calif.), Noah Cobb (Atlanta United; Chattanooga, Tenn.), Tate Johnson (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; Tampa, Fla.), Ethan Kohler (Werder Bremen/GER; Campbell, Calif.), Nolan Norris (FC Dallas; Fort Worth, Texas), Francis Westfield (Philadelphia Union; Philadelphia, Pa.) Midfielders (6): Matthew Corcoran (Nashville SC; Dallas, Texas), Benjamin Cremaschi (Inter Miami; Key Biscayne, Fla.), Taha Habroune (Columbus Crew; Columbus, Ohio), Sergio Oregel Jr. (Chicago Fire; Chicago, Ill.), Brooklyn Raines (Houston Dynamo; Chicago, Ill.), Pedro Soma (FC Barcelona/ESP; Coconut Creek, Fla.) ), Zavier Gozo (Real Salt Lake; Eagle Mountain, Utah), Peyton Miller (New England Revolution; Unionville, Conn.), Serge Ngoma Jr. (New York Red Bulls; North Plainfield, N.J.), Marcos Zambrano (Vitoria Guimaraes/POR; Gladwyne, Pa.) Fourteen players return from the U-20 MNT's March training camp in L'Albir, Spain where they defeated Mexico 3-0 and drew with 1-1 with Japan. Ten players on the June camp roster helped the USA secure its U-20 World Cup berth with a runner-up showing at the 2024 Concacaf U-20 Championship in Mexico: Luca Bombino, Noah Cobb, Zavier Gozo, Taha Habroune, Ethan Kohler, Nolan Norris, Sergio Oregel Jr., Brooklyn Raines, Pedro Soma and Marco Zombrano. A number of players already have represented the United States on some of the game's biggest stages.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Extreme heat is becoming soccer's most pressing challenge, as dramatically demonstrated during this summer's FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. As global temperatures continue to rise, traditional summer tournaments are evolving into health hazards for both players and spectators. Climate scientists are sounding alarm bells, warning that June and July competitions could soon become breeding grounds for life-threatening heat-related illnesses. Despite FIFA's introduction of cooling measures — including additional water breaks and shaded bench areas — players have voiced serious concerns about tournament conditions. Many experts now advocate for a fundamental shift toward cooler months, though such changes would upend soccer's deeply entrenched seasonal calendar. With the 2026 World Cup set for North America and 2030 set for North Africa, both notoriously hot regions, FIFA faces mounting pressure to confront this climate reality before it's too late. At the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the U.S., players struggled with a “brutal heat wave,” leading to complaints even from high-level professionals like Chelsea's Enzo Fernández, who urged organizers to avoid afternoon kickoffs [2]. Critics oppose moving the World Cup to winter months for several major reasons: Fans are also at increased risk of heatstroke, dehydration and other heat-related illnesses[7]. While most major games still draw large crowds, extreme heat has deterred some fans from attending matches, particularly those played in open stadiums during afternoon hours[2].</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cole Palmer and his girlfriend Connie Grace have unfollowed each other on Instagram, sparking fresh rumours of a split. Fans were quick to pick up on the lack of mutual follows, but equally telling was Connie's conspicuous absence from Chelsea's title celebrations at the MetLife Stadium. It is also claimed that Palmer's likes are no longer visible on Connie's Instagram posts. Her absence has led many to wonder if tensions began during the tournament itself. Meanwhile, Palmer touched down in St Kitts and Nevis for a warm summer holiday, where he received a hero's welcome in his paternal grandfather's Caribbean homeland. Since then, many fans have been drawn by Connie's stylish presence and high–profile appearances next to Palmer. The pair frequently engaged with each other online — liking posts, and making mutual appearances at football matches. Speaking in the Amazon Prime documentary titled ‘England's Lions: A New Generation', the Manchester-based manicurist and influencer spoke candidly about their relationship, describing Palmer as “warm and cuddly” and admitting, “you've got to love him.” Rashee Rice has been slammed with jail time over a 2024 high-speed car crash.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Professional Bull Riders organization (PBR) is moving its 2026 World Finals championship back to Fort Worth due to the upcoming FIFA World Cup. Next year's World Finals championship rounds will take place from May 14-17 at Dickies Arena, the Fort Worth-based PBR announced on Friday. Now, it will all be in one city next year. “With the 2026 FIFA World Cup coming to AT&T Stadium, PBR World Finals – Championship will shift to a new home for the season – Dickies Arena,” PBR CEO and commissioner Sean Gleason said in a press release. “We're proud to keep the toughest championship in sports right here in Texas, starting the journey at historic Cowtown Coliseum and culminating with crowning our new World Champion at Dickies Arena — also home to the Fort Worth Rattlers of PBR Teams.” →Can you get fired for being late to work? The following two years, World Finals events were split between Fort Worth and Arlington. The PBR's shift back to Fort Worth comes as Arlington gears up to host nine matches in the 2026 FIFA World Cup next summer. Hosting duties for next year's global soccer event is split between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Matches will be played at over a dozen venues across the three counties starting in June 2026. Fans can register for first access to tickets on the PBR World Final's website.</p>
