                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold 75,000 shares on Friday, valued at about $12.94 million, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Friday's sale is part of a plan adopted in March for Huang to sell up to 6 million shares of the leading artificial intelligence company. Earlier this week, Huang sold 225,000 shares of the chipmaker, totaling about $37 million, according to a separate SEC filing. Surging demand for AI and the graphics processing units that power large language models has significantly boosted Huang's net worth and pushed Nvidia's market capitalization beyond $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company. Nvidia announced this week that it expects to resume sales of its H20 chips to China soon, following signals from the Trump administration that it would approve export licenses. Earlier this year, U.S. officials had stated that Nvidia would require special permission to ship the chips, which are specifically designed for the Chinese market. "The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon," the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Huang said during a news conference on Wednesday in Beijing that he wants to sell chips more advanced than the H20 to China at some point. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration said on Saturday it is taking a series of actions against Mexico over the Mexican government's decisions to rescind some flight slots for U.S. carriers and force U.S. cargo carriers to relocate operations in Mexico City. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement the department could disapprove flight requests from Mexico if the government fails to address U.S. concerns over decisions made in 2022 and 2023. Mexico is the most popular international destination among U.S. airline travelers. Delta said if the U.S. Department of Transportation withdraws approval, it "would cause significant harm to consumers traveling between the U.S. and Mexico, as well as U.S. jobs, communities, and transborder competition." The Transportation Department said Mexico has not been in compliance with a bilateral air agreement since 2022 when it abruptly rescinded slots and then forced U.S. all-cargo carriers to relocate operations in 2023. Mexico's Transport Ministry and major Mexican airlines, including Aeromexico, could not be immediately reached for comment. "By restricting slots and mandating that all-cargo operations move out of MEX, Mexico has broken its promise, disrupted the market, and left American businesses holding the bag for millions in increased costs," the department said. The USDOT also said it could take action against European countries over limitations at airports. "We are monitoring European States to ensure that they apply the Balanced Approach process for noise abatement at their airports and do not implement unjustified operational restrictions," the department said. The Transportation Department issued a pair of orders requiring Mexican airlines to file schedules with the department for all their U.S. operations by July 29 and requiring prior U.S. approval before operating any large passenger or cargo aircraft charter flights to or from the United States. "Mexico has altered the playing field significantly for airlines in ways that reduce competition and allow predominant competitors to gain an unfair advantage in the U.S.-Mexico market," the department said. "Mexico's actions harm airlines seeking to enter the market, existing competitor airlines, consumers of air travel and products relying on time-sensitive air cargo shipments traded between the two countries, and other stakeholders in the American economy." If the U.S. rescinds antitrust approval for Delta and Aeromexico, they would be required to discontinue cooperation on common pricing, capacity management, and revenue sharing, but Delta would also be able to retain its equity stake in Aeromexico, maintain all of its existing flying in the U.S.-Mexico market unimpeded and continue a partnership.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Saturday that even if the courts release the grand jury transcripts in the criminal cases of notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his convicted procurer of young girls, Ghislaine Maxwell, "nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics." Trump's post comes one day after the Department of Justice asked federal judges to unseal the grand jury testimonies in the criminal cases, following a request by Trump. Trump on Thursday said that he had asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to "produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval." The request to the DOJ comes amid growing pressure on Trump, including from some of his most loyal supporters, to release files in connection with Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges. Trump's Saturday Truth Social post suggests that the pressure campaign, which has lasted for weeks, is not abating. "I have asked the Justice Department to release all Grand Jury testimony with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, subject only to Court Approval," Trump wrote on his social media. "With that being said, and even if the Court gave its full and unwavering approval, nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics making the request," he continued. Trump's Truth Social post also reflects a subtle change in his language about the request. On Saturday, he stated that he had requested the Justice Department release "all" grand jury testimony in connection with the criminal cases, in contrast to Thursday, when he said he had requested the release of "pertinent" testimony. Trump's post also comes one day after he sued media mogul Rupert Murdoch after The Wall Street Journal â€” which Murdoch owns â€” published an article describing a "bawdy" letter that Trump sent for Epstein's 50th birthday. Trump has denied that the letter is his. He is seeking damages of at least $10 billion in the defamation lawsuit. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What would it take for you to feel financially comfortable? "It's always a little bit more than what they have," she says. "Regardless of how much money they have, it's just a little bit more." On average, Americans say they'd need a net worth of $839,000 to feel financially comfortable, according to a recent survey from Charles Schwab. Members of Gen Z say they'd be comfortable with less â€” just $329,000, on average. You may be wondering what net worth could afford you a comfortable life â€” and what your current net worth actually is. If you're not sure the answer to either, don't worry. While financial experts say tracking net worth can be a useful tool in your money management arsenal, it presents an incomplete picture of your financial life. "Tracking net worth without tracking values or lifestyle intentions is like watching your pulse without knowing if your heart is healthy." Your net worth is the total value of everything you own, after accounting for money that you owe, and is a useful shorthand for overall wealth. To find yours, add up your assets, such as bank accounts, stock holdings, physical valuables and home equity, before subtracting your liabilities, which include credit card debt, student loans and mortgage balances. Theoretically, this number gives you a pretty decent overview of your actual wealth. Someone may appear to be wealthy if they have a $1 million house, for instance. Not so much if they also have $2 million in debt. For one thing, two people with the same net worth could have wildly different financial situations. Rather than focusing on one number, you're better off examining how money flows in and out of your life, and whether or not you're making progress toward your goals, experts say. "In contrast, their cash flow statement acts more like the 'video,' capturing the ongoing movement of money in and out that ultimately shapes their net worth." When it comes to feeling financially comfortable, it's smart to make sure you have a few critical bases covered, says Slabaugh. These include not only making ends meet, but having enough breathing room to pay down debt, build emergency savings and invest for the future. For many of Slabaugh's clients, building wealth means having security. For others, money is a means to flexibility and freedom. "In nearly every case, the comfort isn't just financial â€” it's emotional," Slabaugh says. Someone who values freedom, for instance, could aim to beef up their travel savings while looking for misaligned areas in their budget to slash. Instead of striving for a particular number in your bank account, ask yourself what about having that amount of money would do for you and what about your life would change if you already had it, Slabaugh says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If President Donald Trump tries to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, it would almost certainly set off a courtroom battle that legal and policy experts say is bound to get messy, with uncertain impacts on the central bank, financial markets and the economy. The tempestuous situation poses a myriad of thorny questions for which there are no easy answers considering no president ever has tried to unseat a Fed chair. "What is extraordinary here is the president going back and forth and discussing loudly whether he might fire or try to fire the Fed chair," said Bill English, the Fed's former director of monetary affairs and now a Yale professor. So, I think it's all things that we haven't seen before, and raises real uncertainties." Even by Trump's standards, the events surrounding Powell of late have been stunning. After an extended campaign of ad hominem attacks on Powell and demands for lower interest rates, Trump met with Republican congressional members Tuesday evening and asked them if he should fire the Fed chair, according to a senior administration official. However, no sooner did news break of the meeting then Trump told reporters that he's not considering a move, saying it's "highly unlikely" while simultaneously wondering out loud whether alleged mismanagement of the $2.5 billion expansion might qualify as cause. The Supreme Court's ruling in Trump v. Wilcox this year called the Fed a "uniquely structured, quasi-private entity" whose governors enjoy insulation from removal for political or policy reasons. That, of course, does not mean Trump won't try. "It's a very high bar legally, but there also haven't been really any historical precedents for it," Jonathan Kanter, former assistant attorney general during the Biden administration, said on CNBC. "So it would get litigated in court, probably be quite a bit of a circus, but, yeah, the standard is very high. Powell's options would entail suing and asking for a stay on any Trump removal action, Kanter said. "It views the Fed as historically different than other independent agencies. Despite seemingly low chances of success, going after Powell still could serve a political purpose for Trump. "I think Trump is setting it up so that there's a sword of Damocles hanging over Powell's head throughout the rest of his tenure," Kanter said. "If there is a sustained period of inflation or stagflation, Trump has the ability to say, well, it's this guy's fault because he didn't lower interest rates." In a Truth Social post, Trump charged Powell and the FOMC officials are "choking out the housing market with their high rate, making it difficult for people, especially the young, to buy a house. Up until recently, Trump has reserved most of his criticism for Powell individually. But on Friday, he also said, "the Fed Board has done nothing to stop this 'numbskull' from hurting so many people. In many ways the Board is equally to blame!" Finally, using his nickname for Powell, he said, "I can't tell you how dumb Too Late is - So bad for our Country!" Besides Powell, Trump has two appointees on the board dating back to his first term: governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both of whom have said they are leaning toward a rate cut when the FOMC meets at the end of July. Beyond those two, though, other members have not expressed any appetite for easing before the September meeting. Fed watchers including English, who served as the FOMC secretary, see policymakers pushed into a corner where cutting in July would seem like acquiescing to Trump's demands. That's part of a larger concern on Wall Street over the reputational fallout the Fed faces as the Trump White House ramps up its efforts to use politics to influence monetary policy. "The experience of other countries in which governments have suppressed central bank independence has generally been a combination of a slippery slope and the occasional sudden drop," Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economists at Capital Economics, said in a recent note. "Unlike raising tariffs, which can be withdrawn before the real damage is done, the reputational costs from firing Powell would be harder to undo." Firing Powell would be unlikely to change the committee's approach to monetary policy, and in fact could harden its position on rates. Even if the FOMC did cut, it could do more harm than good to Trump's goal of lowering finance costs on the national debt. "The historical record suggests that political interference contributed to poor monetary policy in the late '60s and early '70s, with unfavorable consequences for inflation developments," JPMorgan Chase chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli wrote. "Any reduction in the independence of the Fed would likely add upside risks to an inflation outlook that is already subject to upward pressures from tariffs and somewhat elevated inflation expectations." While Trump wants the Fed to slash its key borrowing rate by 3 percentage points, such a move could raise inflation expectations, causing fixed income investors to demand higher yields, "thereby increasing longer-term interest rates, weighing on the outlook for economic activity, and worsening the fiscal position," Feroli added. For the time being, Powell and Co. is expected to continue to conduct business and make decisions based on data, with the constant drumbeat of Trump serving as a distraction that doesn't seem like it will go away, even if the president ultimately never tries to fire the Fed chief. It's not unprecedented that a president has views on monetary policy. But I think what's different about this time is that it's been pretty persistent and unrelenting," former Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Friday on CNBC. "That will not change how the Fed goes about making its decisions on monetary policy." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Through its Issuer Solutions segment, it provides financial institutions and retailers technologies to manage their card portfolios. It provides flexible commercial payments, accounts payable and electronic payment alternative solutions that support B2B payment processes for businesses and governments. The firm's team includes analysts from leading tech private equity firms, engineers, operating partners â€“ former technology CEOs and COOs. When evaluating an investment, the firm also hires specialty and general management consultants, expert cost analysts and industry specialists. Elliott often watches companies for many years before investing and has an extensive stable of impressive board candidates. The firm has historically focused on strategic activism in the technology sector and has been very successful with that strategy. However, over the past several years its activism group has grown, and Elliott has been doing a lot more governance-oriented activism and creating value from a board level at a much larger breadth of companies. Elliott has taken a position in Global Payments. Merchant Solutions, contributing about three-fourths of total sales, provides payment solutions to enable customers to accept card, check, and digital payments, offering authorization, settlement, funding and other services. Simply put, Global Payments, as a merchant acquirer, acts as a middleman between the merchant and card network to authorize and facilitate transactions. Through its Issuer Solutions segment, Global Payments provides comprehensive commerce solutions supporting the payment ecosystem for issuers through offerings like core processing, enterprise tokenization and more. This segment was formed in 2019 following the combination of Global Payments and Total System Services ("TSYS") in an all-stock merger of equals to create a leading payments company with a presence in both merchant acquiring and issuer services. Peaking in 2021 at roughly $220 per share and an enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EV/EBITDA) multiple of about 25-times, the company today trades around $80 per share and at a high single-digit multiple. However, sales growth has slowed significantly since 2020, now below the core acquiring market's high-single growth rate, implying market share loss to disruptors like Stripe, Fiserv's Clover, Shopify and others. This is about a company that made a poorly received "bet the farm" acquisition and is now at an inflection point that will determine its future. On April 17, Global Payments announced that it had agreed to acquire Worldpay from Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) and private equity firm GTCR. The three-way cash-and-share acquisition also involved Global Payments divesting its Issuer Solutions (previously known as TSYS) business to FIS in a deal which valued Worldpay at $24.25 billion and Issuer Solutions at $13.5 billion. Global Payments' shares fell 17% following the announcement for many good reasons: (i) this acquisition was announced after management's commitments at their 2024 Investor Day to pursue increased shareholder returns, divestments, and, at most, small bolt-on acquisitions, (ii) management has a poor track record of integrating (or failing to integrate) acquisitions such as TSYS and AdvancedMD, and (iii) the company paid too much for Worldpay â€“ acquiring it at 10.5-times EBITDA versus the 6.5-times multiple Global Payments trades at. Management thinks the Worldpay transaction makes strategic sense for Global Payments, simplifying its business model into a pure-play commerce solutions provider, and that it will provide $600 million in annual cost synergies and $200 million in revenue synergies. The market is not believing this or has little faith that management can achieve these synergies. From where the stock trades today, if management can come anywhere close to achieving these synergies and executing on this transaction, it will be a nice return for stockholders. Global Payments is much closer to the latter. A reconstituted board that holds management accountable, commits to an M&A moratorium and adds members with experience integrating large acquisitions will almost immediately restore investor confidence in the company. Thereafter, the board can start to de-lever and possibly buy back shares at the appropriate time if Global Payments' stock is still significantly undervalued. We would also expect the board to do the most important thing boards do â€“ oversee and evaluate senior management, but we do not think there would be any material management changes ahead of such a large acquisition like this. Given the almost universal opposition to the Worldpay acquisition and the low investor confidence in management, we would expect that Elliott will be able to walk onto this board with any reasonable slate. In a contested situation for the 10-person unitary board using a universal proxy card, Global Payments would almost certainly face significant defeat. Elliott recently won two of four seats at Phillips 66 in a proxy fight with a much higher degree of difficulty. The fund made its reputation as an activist almost two decades ago as primarily a strategic activist in technology companies, making great returns getting companies sold or participating in the acquisition. We believe that a reconstituted board that includes an Elliott representative will restore investor confidence and increase the probability of a successful integration of Worldpay.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These digital assets are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to fiat money like the US dollar. Right now, they're mostly used by crypto traders to easily buy other tokens. However, stablecoins used for payments would be a monumental shift in the foundations of commerce. In June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Walmart and Amazon were considering launching their own stablecoins. It isn't hard to see the incentive for big companies like Walmart or Amazon. Businesses could save significant amounts in credit card processing fees, cutting out an expensive intermediary by having people use their proprietary crypto as payment. "For companies with billions in sales, eliminating even a portion of that margin drag could unlock 10s of millions in savings. Stablecoins offer a potential alternative that reduces frictional costs, accelerates settlement times, and gives merchants more control over payment rails." Eliminating that type of cost would be a boon for Walmart and Amazon, but would be a blow to credit card issuers like Visa and Mastercard. "If a fraction of their customer base starts using a store-issued stablecoin instead of a Visa-backed card, that's billions in interchange fees gone overnight," Will Reeves, CEO of bitcoin rewards app Fold, told Business Insider. It stated that it is "laying the groundwork by building and supporting blockchain-based solutions that help our partners and clients integrate stablecoins into the future of mainstream payments." For people shopping with a retailer like Amazon or Walmart, a stablecoin payment system might not feel all that different from what they're doing now. "On the surface, not much changes - you tap your phone, check out, maybe earn extra rewards or save on fees. The benefit for shoppers could ultimately be lower prices if companies pass what they save in transaction fees to their customers. "Competition at this scale drives down transaction costs, and that means consumers will likely see lower prices, better rewards, or both," Reeves added. Dan Silverman, CEO of Balcony Technology Group, noted that the rise of corporate stablecoins could also prove beneficial to unbanked people, as it would allow them to access digital currency through their phones. "The big thing I could also imagine is for loyalty points or rewards to be baked into the token itself," he stated. A potential downside for consumers is that stablecoins could add another layer to a process that's become pretty simple over the years. For many people, it could be simpler to just keep using credit or debit cards already on file. Another risk for consumers is the management of stablecoin reserves. To hold their value, the tokens must be backed by an equivalent amount of liquid reserves, such as cash or short-term Treasurys. If these reserves are mismanaged or the issuing entity runs into financial trouble, the stablecoins could untether from their fiat peg and lose their value.</p>

Dimitar Radev, who'll help set euro-zone interest rates from next year, has seen more than his fair share of political upheaval.

The 69-year-old head of Bulgaria's central bank was a Finance Ministry official in the 1980s when the Communist government abruptly closed it. After witnessing the regime's eventual collapse and the ministry's reinstatement, he helped his country emerge from a bout of hyperinflation before joining the push to make it the euro area's 21st member.</p>
