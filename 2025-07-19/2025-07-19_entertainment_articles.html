                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Jack McBrayer returns for season two of HGTV's runaway hit “Zillow Gone Wild” on July 18, 2025, the comedic actor and zany host has revealed that when the network asked him to star on the show, he had one adorable condition: he didn't want to make fun of anybody's wild and crazy house. “I was like, ‘Hey, I'm not the comedian who's like, you know, snarky or going to tear you down or or embarrass you or anything,'” he recalled telling HGTV during an interview with Too Fab. But they also had one rule for him: no peeking ahead of time. The first season of “Zillow Gone Wild” premiered in May 2024, hosted by McBrayer, who rose to fame on the hit NBC sitcom “30 Rock.” The show is inspired by the hugely popular “Zillow Gone Wild” Instagram account, which features some of the weirdest and wildest homes on the market for its nearly two million followers. McBrayer goes into each house sight unseen and is often blown away, giddy as a schoolkid, about what he finds — and is genuinely interested in what made the homeowner buy or transform their house to be so unique. “I'm not going to lie, I know people, like, roll their eyes and think I'm just like saccharine sweet,” McBrayer told TooFab, “but my whole thing is like, it doesn't feel good to me to wake up angry. And one thing I loved about stepping into improvisation as, you know, like my career, inherently it is all about teamwork and collaboration — an ensemble. Just like the houses and people he showcases on “Zillow Gone Wild,” he loves to highlight and celebrate his friends who are doing cool things. “I'm just at an age and a stage in my career (where) I don't need attention,” McBrayer told Too Fab. “I don't need that stuff. It's fun for me to celebrate anyone with a passion, anyone with direction and motivation. “I kind of like just having the curiosity of a kid going into these houses,” he told Too Fab. “And I mean, sometimes you can't help it. Or you know, like, ‘Whoa, everything is pink! Before the show aired in 2024, he told the New York Post, “My only assignment was to not look at the Instagram page, because they wanted me to see (each house) and catch that reaction on camera. The comedian told Too Fab that the same rule was in place for season two, explaining, “The producers are pretty insistent that I do not do any homework because they want to capture those reactions live on camera, which is super great. I really do just like being surprised, too. “Zillow Gone Wild” season two premieres on July 18 at 9:30 p.m. Eastern time, and will air each Friday night at the same time.</p>

In 2022, as the Pamela Anderson renaissance was in its infancy, the former “Baywatch” star dipped her toe into live performance. She jumped right into the water, starring as Roxie Hart in the Broadway production of “Chicago.” As that song-and-dance performance earned raves, it comes as no surprise that Anderson is now showing off her vocal chops once again — this time with what is sure to be a memorable jazz scat number in “The Naked Gun,” out August 1 in theaters. It's an absolutely nutty scat solo,” Anderson told Entertainment Weekly. I can't get it out of my head.” Related Stories What Made Ari Aster Laugh Hard? The song has an appropriately “Naked Gun” title, “Sassafras Chicken in D,” and it was written by Elizabeth Gillies and Joel McNeely. The film‘s director Akiva Schaffer explained that the tune is “all Pam,” and that she performed it live to a pre-recorded track every take (the final cut blends live and pre-recorded performance). “She performed it like a musical number,” Schaffer said. While Anderson admits that it took “courage” to do the scat, she said her “happy place” is when she is “terrified.” “All the words to that song, I'm thinking of personal experiences in my life, and so I'm able to get it out even in a crazy scene like that. Co-star Danny Huston — who owns the club Anderson's character sings in… and all of this is part of a plot to distract him as Liam Neeson's Frank Drebin Jr. does some super secret detective work — said he was “spellbound” by Anderson. “The Naked Gun” arrives just months after Anderson scored her first Golden Globe and SAG nominations  for her performance in “The Last Showgirl.” Last year, Anderson spoke with IndieWire about her resurgence as a full fledged movie star. “I took a quite the unorthodox route to get here,” Anderson said. “The Naked Gun” is in theaters everywhere August 1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As summer at the box office heats up, MCU fans are sharing their first reactions to The Fantastic Four: First Steps. Following first screenings for the debut entry in Marvel Studios‘ Phase 6, which hits theaters July 24, audiences have praised the visual artistry, impeccable writing and performances from Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Julia Garner. On X, one fan called it “Quite possibly the best Marvel Studios film ever released. If you thought the MCU died with Endgame, think again. Thoughtfully crafted and easily a genre-defining classic.” “#FantasticFour First Steps is visually one of the best things Marvel has ever made. Parts feel like Interstellar & demand IMAX,” wrote another fan. Cosmically and on Earth, Matt Shakman dropped a visual feast.” Others also noted their appreciation for the film's social and political commentary. A pitch-perfect script backed by great performances — particularly from Pedro Pascal — turns what could be a simple superhero movie into a sharp commentary on our society that makes its nuance palatable for those that may not take it at face value,” one person posted. #FantasticFour Quite possibly the best Marvel Studios film ever released.

As People notes, Perry endured a previous stage malfunction during the tour's Australian leg when a flying sphere she rides in began tilting mid-performance, forcing her to cling to the cables connected to the sphere.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SPOILERS: This post contains details about I Know What You Did Last Summer (2025) As I Know What You Did Last Summer slashes its way into a new generation, Jennifer Kaytin Robinson‘s requel has plenty of surprises in store for fans of the OG. With Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprising their roles from the previous two films as survivors and high school sweethearts Julie James and Ray Bronson, nostalgia was inevitably going to be a major factor in this new installment, which also boasts a young cast of new potential victims (and suspects), including Chase Sui Wonders, Madelyn Cline, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers and Sarah Pidgeon. Read on for some major SPOILERS about I Know What You Did Last Summer (2025). “I am dead,” Sarah Michelle Gellar previously offered as a response to whether she'd reprise her role from the OG as Helen Shivers, following her family's set visit in Australia with husband and former co-star Prinze. A close friend of the director, it turns out Gellar was just playing coy about the fact that she makes a digitally de-aged cameo as Helen's snarky ghost in a dream sequence of the guilt-laden Danica Richards (Cline), a fellow former Croaker Queen. Her cameo follows some heavy references to the doomed beauty queen, including a visit to what was once Shivers Department Store. Reacting to the news of another vengeful massacre in Southport, North Carolina, Karla receives a menacing knock at the door. No, it's Julie warning her with another letter she received, along with a throwback photo of them, featuring a red X over Karla's face. With a couple of new ‘final girls' joining the franchise, Julie and Karla seem poised to team up against the remaining killer for another potential installment. Following a pretty similar plot and format as writer Kevin Williamson and director Jim Gillespie's feature adaptation of Lois Duncan's 1973 novel, Robinson and co-writer Sam Lansky took a big swing with the reveal of their requel's killer, one that no other horror franchise has taken, at least in recent memory. Avenging the death of her spiritual peer and sober buddy, Pidgeon's Stevie Ward reveals in her big menacing monologue that she decided to take revenge on the group of former friends who covered up his death, after previously deserting her during her darkest days. What first seems heartbreaking for Ray, who is established as Stevie's employer and father figure, soon turns out to be an even more shocking reveal. Coming face to face with Julie, he confesses to guiding Stevie's murderous impulses to take revenge on the gentrified town that erased the trauma he endured (and for which he has apparently never sought help) nearly 30 years before. With Julie and Wonders' Ava Brooks defeating Ray, his homicidal protege is still out there and ready to take revenge in another installment. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal) is hosting a barbecue for his supporters at his New Mexico home when his nemesis and re-election opponent, Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix), arrives to disrupt the event. Katy Perry's 2010 hit “Firework” is blasting as Cross struts toward Garcia to demand he turn it down, leading to a stand-off. On this week's episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, writer/director Ari Aster broke down the scene that is sure to become one of his most memorable. “We tried to get ‘Empire State of Mind,' the Jay-Z, Alicia Keys [track].” With Mayor Ted, Aster created a charming, but hypocritical progressive politician who campaigns on bringing the small western town into the economic and tech future, but is ultimately just selling it out to an Amazon-Google-like tech giant (the fictional solidgoldmagikarp corporation) that wants to build an enormous, energy-sucking data center in the Eddington desert. “Empire State of Mind” played perfectly for Aster's dark humor. It just felt like what Pedro Pascal‘s character would absolutely have been playing at that party,” said Aster. “I think [Jay-Z] was distracted at the moment, and didn't have a chance to actually watch the film,” said Aster. “ Then it became, ‘Okay, so what do we use?' Prior to the scene, Cross had publicly accused Garcia of sexually assaulting his wife Louise (Emma Stone), and comes to the party ready to throw his weight around, but on his walk toward the confrontation, he sees an interview clip of Louise declaring him a liar. Aster discussed how sound and score were used to capture Cross's world unraveling in the second half of the film. While “Firework” could replace the cultural and humor aspects brought by “Empire State of Mind,” Aster discovered he could mix it into his film in a way that marked another sonic beat in his protagonist's descent. “I wanted a song that kind of represented the culture, and have the culture like pounding in your ear. It was very exciting to land on that,” said Aster. To hear Ari Aster‘s full interview, subscribe to the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast on Apple, Spotify, or your favorite podcast platform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Remember when Queen Bey had that terrifying moment on her Cowboy Carter tour in Houston? During her “16 Carriages” performance, she was riding a red aerial car that tilted a bit too far to the left. Basically, the machine froze mid-air, and Beyoncé, ever the pro as she always is, reassured fans by joking, “If ever I fall, I know y'all call me.” This after the whole ordeal had occurred, and she was probably hyperventilating inside, of course. Well, now it's Perry's turn, who tore a page right out of her book. The “Roar” singer gave fans quite a scare on July 18 during her performance at the Chase Center in San Francisco. While singing her hit “Eye of the Tiger,” Perry took flight over the crowd on a massive butterfly prop. Mid-performance, the butterfly suddenly dropped several inches, throwing Perry off balance. Fans could see the panic on her face as she clung on, yelling to the crowd, “Sing it now. Sing it!” Her voice broke off as the prop malfunctioned in real-time, which quickly caused a wave of gasps throughout the arena. For a second, it looked like the entire setup might collapse, which even gave US a fright, despite it already having happened and it only being a video. But thankfully, the safety wires caught just in time. Still visibly shaken, Katy glanced at the crowd as if she was yelling, “Did you just see that?” The stunned audience responded with a mix of shocked silence and loud cheering as she regained her composure and continued singing. She posted a candid screenshot of herself mid-scream with the caption, “Goodnight San Fran,” on her Instagram Stories. “She paused slightly but then kept singing, almost never missing a beat,” the insider shared. The show marked one of the biggest stops on her Lifetime's North America Run, a tour that's already been making headlines for its chaotic and unpredictable stage elements. We're talking astronauts, sharks, lightsabers, yes, basically a fever dream in concert form. Perry has been having a few hard days after her longtime partner Orlando Bloom recently announced their separation.</p>

Those solutions came courtesy of Metallica, whose stage from their M72 World Tour was being kept in storage in Austria and was quickly airlifted to Belgium overnight, HLN reports. “I can not believe I'm actually typing this… but my set at Tomorrowland is still happening!”, Garrix wrote on Instagram alongside of photo of him and Lars Ulrich. “Massive love and a big shoutout to the incredible Tomorrowland team for pulling off miracles — and to Metallica for coming through with the new stage parts…” Belgium's Tomorrowland Saved by Metallica After Fire Destroys Main Stage CEO Caught at Coldplay Concert Placed on Leave Awaiting 'Formal Investigation' Katy Perry Endures Midair Malfunction as Butterfly Prop Plunges During Concert Wilmsen told DJ Mag, “It is a miracle and we are beyond happy to be opening.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neon is picking up the tab for an all-expenses-paid Las Vegas wedding for one lucky couple that gets engaged at a movie theater (inside or out) between now and Aug. 4. Neon and the married stars of its new body horror film Together, Dave Franco and Alison Brie, have concocted a contest for movie lovers ready to tie the knot that could land them a free trip to the chapel in Las Vegas. Dare we say, it's a pretty genius promotional tie-in. All the couples have to do to enter is propose at a movie theater (inside or out) any time between now and by midnight on Aug. 3, all on video of course. “Film it, post it by Aug. 3 with the hashtag #TogetherContest,” Brie explained in a new Instagram video while seated alongside her husband. Mubi Takes Park Chan-Wook's 'No Other Choice' For Multiple Territories, Including U.K., Australia Written and directed by Michael Shanks, Together casts Franco and Brie as Tim and Millie, a couple that finds themselves at a crossroads as they move to the countryside, abandoning all that is familiar in their lives except one another. Thursday proved to be a big day for the Together marketing and social team. Not only did they introduce this proposal challenge, Neon's Instagram page also made use of the biggest pop culture story of the day by posting a photo of the couple caught on a kiss cam at the Coldplay concert (Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and his chief people officer, Kristin Cabot) with the caption, “The perfect date night movie.” Actress Eiza Gonzalez caught it and posted, “Lol great marketing,” while Ilana Glazer added, “Good job u guys.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taped seven months before the release of A Whole New Thing, the live recording features just one original, opener “I Ain't Got Nobody (For Real),” which would show up on Dance to the Music. These recordings have been cherished by fans ever since the tapes began floating around in 2002, and snippets showed up in Questlove's Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius) documentary from earlier this year, but anyone hoping for a revelatory postmortem opening of the floodgates should adjust their expectations. But the audience can't see into the future, and at a show like this—and at a time when popular music was only just starting to be taken seriously as high art—the audience is ultimately what matters. The Stone (né Stewart) family belonged to the Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal denomination whose influence on Christian music has been incalculable. Artists with COGIC roots include Sister Rosetta Tharpe, CCM legend Andraé Crouch, and the Winans gospel dynasty. These literal and metaphorical definitions of communion blend together on The First Family in a performance lusty enough to make room for a cartoon-wolf version of Junior Walker's “Pucker Up Buttercup” but otherwise fitting Sly's definition of “church” to a T. Given the level of energy on display, it seems incredible that this was a seated show, let alone that people weren't ripping their chairs out of their seats during a dazzling stop-and-start rendition of Ben E. King's “What Is Soul?” that's the heart and centerpiece of this disc. It seems even more incredible that the song was only two weeks old at the time, but as Sly's beloved Beatles taught us, there's nothing like a grueling residency to coax the flowering of genius. One of the most crucial differences between this Family and the one most people know is that Sly's sister Rose hadn't joined yet. If you want to present yourself as a utopian community, it's best to have as many voices joining in as possible, and Rose and Sly's interplay was essential to the all-hands-on-deck spirit that made Dance to the Music and its deliriously goofy follow-up Life so exciting. On The First Family, the communal aspect comes instead from the audience, which can be heard clapping and voicing approval, and which seems especially jazzed about their eight-minute rendition of “Baby I Need Your Loving,” a 1964 Four Tops single whose cover by white rocker Johnny Rivers had entered the charts less than two months before. Funnily enough, Rivers claims to have auditioned Sly on bass for his band, but Sly didn't show up until the gig was already over—an early instance of a pattern of belated arrivals and no-shows from the singer that frustrated collaborators and crowds throughout his career. The sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. The drums are way up in the mix, which is great when you're trying to hear what drummer and inexhaustible sample source Greg Errico is doing, but not so great when you're trying to hear Sly sing. To be fair, though, it doesn't sound that much worse than the shambolic Fillmore tapes recorded 18 months later, which include a version of “St. James Infirmary Blues” that's almost identical to the one here. Unlike Bay Area contemporaries Quicksilver Messenger Service and the Grateful Dead, this is not a band whose live recordings you need to seek out to get the full picture. It might seem like a quaint world today, but tell that to the crowd at the Winchester Cathedral, itching to burst out of their seats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This, per an interview that Superman writer/director/producer/all-purpose PR man James Gunn gave to Josh Horowitz's Happy Sad Confused podcast this week, marking something like the end of his press tour odyssey promoting the film. Gunn, never the most taciturn guy, spoke openly about the battles waged while making the film—including what was apparently a pretty epic back-and-forth over whether Nathan Fillion's Guy Gardner would end up telling David Corenswet's Man Of Steel “Don't be such a pussy” at a key moment in the script. But while he mostly restrained himself to comments about the movie itself—including jokingly referring to Corenswet as his personal Krypto and “prodigal son,” after he and the actor went back and forth frequently over how to handle certain pivotal scenes—Gunn did venture into a bit of wider DC drama. Most interestingly, that includes addressing the moment when he and fellow DC Studios head Peter Safran had to bring Henry Cavill in to tell him he wasn't Superman anymore. Which was a conversation made a lot more awkward by the fact that Cavill had, literally on the day that Gunn and Safran had closed their deals to take over the studio (with a plan for a fresh, younger Superman in their pockets) stated on social media that he'd been given the green light by Warner Bros. to say he was coming back to the character after a multi-year absence. (Gunn, a diplomat, never mentions Black Adam star Dwayne Johnson by name here, but does note, with a wry expression, that there was a “vacuum” at Warner Bros. that meant certain people were trying to “force their way.”) Gunn calls the whole thing a “bummer” for Cavill, and reiterates what was said back in 2022, i.e., that he'd love to cast the actor somewhere else in the wider DCU. (He claims to have genuinely not noticed any parallels between Superman's travails at the hands of internet trolls and his own well-documented ones, for instance, and details a scene so darkly funny, between Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor and Zlatko Burić's Vasil Ghurkos, that he knew it had to be cut basically as soon as he saw it in the edits—but still can't help but break down laughing as he describes it.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese music streaming stocks continued their upward trajectory this week as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing showed signs of easing. Tencent Music Entertainment (TME), China's leading music streaming company, rose 8.3% to $21.43, valuing the company at $36.8 billion and bringing its year-to-date increase to 71.9%. Cloud Music and TME shares have both benefited from solid first-quarter results and growing consumer interest in music subscriptions. Chinese stocks in general received a boost this week after the U.S. government eased export bans and allowed the sale of Nvidia's AI chips to China. Warner Music Group (WMG) continued its winning streak, jumping 4.9% to $31.22 and getting a boost from Rothschild & Co Redburn's upgrade of WMG to “neutral” from “sell” on Tuesday (July 15). After reaching the mid-year mark down 12.1%, WMG shares have gained 14.6% since the company's July 1 announcement that it will save $300 million annually from layoffs and other cost-cutting measures. Most live music stocks were in positive territory. Sphere Entertainment Co. spiked 7.6% to $46.15, the stock's highest closing price since Feb. 21 and more than $22 higher than its low point after President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners on April 3. Shares of Abu Dhabi-based music streamer Anghami rose 2.1% to $0.49 after the company announced on Wednesday that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders to vote on a reverse stock split that will allow the stock to remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market exchange. The company has until Aug. 18 to achieve a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share for at least 10 consecutive business days. SiriusXM shares fell 2.7% to $23.56 after Wednesday's announcement of an affordable, ad-supported satellite radio tier, SiriusXM Play, that will cost under $7 per month. With HYBE in the news over a federal probe into Chairman Bang Si-hyuk, the K-pop giant's stock fell 1.1% to 268,000 KRW ($192.98), marking it third consecutive weekly decline. At least one analyst was optimistic this week: On Thursday (July 17), Nomura increased its price target for HYBE shares to 370,000 KRW ($266.42) from 270,000 KRW ($194.42) and maintained its “buy” rating. HYBE will announce its second quarter results on Aug. 6. Spotify shares dipped 2.0% to $695.18, the fourth consecutive weekly decline after closing at $772.60 on June 27. After reaching the mid-year mark with a 71.4% gain, Spotify has dropped 9.4% in July. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
