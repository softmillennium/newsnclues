                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Days after AI coding startup Windsurf announced that it's being acquired by Cognition, Windsurf startup Jeff Wang took to X to offer more details about the drama and uncertainty around the deal. Windsurf was previously reported to be in acquisition talks with OpenAI, but that deal fell apart, with Google DeepMind instead hiring the startup's CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and some of its top researchers. This looked like the latest in the trend of ‚Äúreverse acquihires,‚Äù in which large tech companies seek to avoid antitrust scrutiny by hiring key startup team members and licensing their technology, rather than acquiring startups outright. As we discussed on the latest episode of Equity, one startup founder compared the departing Windsurf executives to a captain abandoning his crew aboard a sinking ship. Wang, who had been Windsurf's head of business, became the company's interim CEO after Mohan's departure. In his post on X, he offered some sympathy to Mohan and Chen, who he described as ‚Äú great founders‚Äù in a situation that ‚Äúmust have been difficult for them as well.‚Äù Still, Wang recounted an all-hands meeting on Friday, June 11, where most team members were expecting to hear about the OpenAI acquisition. In Wang's view, although the company ‚Äúhad lost some great people and taken a serious blow to morale,‚Äù it still had ‚Äúall of our IP, product, and strong talent including an excellent [go-to-market] machine.‚Äù So Windsurf could still try to raise more money, sell, or just keep going. That evening, however, Wang heard from Cognition executives Scott Wu and Russell Kaplan, and he said Windsurf leadership ‚Äútook the Cognition approach very seriously from the start and launched right into negotiations.‚Äù In his telling, what followed was a frantic weekend of discussions with Cognition, while considering inbound interest from other potential acquirers and meeting with Windsurf's remaining engineers to convince them not to leave. The two companies were a good fit, Wang argued, in part because of complementary teams. Plus, Wang said he and Wu (pictured together above) were aligned on the need to ‚Äútake care of all Windsurf employees.‚Äù Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

Microsoft has just signed a deal with Vaulted Deep, paying it to remove 4.9 million metric tons of waste over 12 years sourced from manure, sewage, and agricultural byproducts for injection deep underground. This isn't the first time Redmond has paid another company to help offset its greenhouse gas emissions; Microsoft signed a deal with AtmosClear in April of this year to sequester 6.75 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. However, Vaulted's technique is unique ‚Äî instead of extracting carbon dioxide from the air or electricity production, it collects organic waste. This prevents them from being dumped at a waste disposal site, where they would eventually decompose and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. And then oftentimes, especially when it's spread on land, all those pathogens are going directly into people's groundwater.‚Äù Projects such as these enable Microsoft and other tech giants to offset the massive amounts of carbon emissions produced by data centers, particularly as they consume a significant amount of electrical power, often generated from fossil fuels. For example, Musk is facing legal action in Memphis, Tennessee, after his company, xAI, is accused of polluting the air by using under-reported power generators at the Colossus Supercomputer. Aside from that, many companies, including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, and others, are investing in small modular reactor research to establish their clean energy sources for their expanding data center businesses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most founders eventually have to pitch venture firms in hopes of raising capital. Tiffany Luck, a partner at NEA, took the stage at TechCrunch's All Stage event in Boston to answer how to craft the perfect one. ‚ÄúI like to think of a VC pitch as your initial way for assessing founder-investor fit,‚Äù she told the crowd before diving into her presentation. How will you get there over time?‚Äù she said. Then, of course, ‚Äúsome sense of numbers,‚Äù she added, saying that part depends on what state a company is trying to fundraise for ‚Äî pre-seed, seed, Series A, and so forth. ‚ÄúThese are just meant to be the fundamental basics.‚Äù Luck said there are two different ‚ÄúWhys‚Äù every founder should address. First, there is the deeper Why, where a founder goes into their origin story and explains their unique perspective on a solution. Obsession is key here, she said, adding that investors want to see and understand that a founder is completely consumed by a problem and solution. ‚ÄúThe shared conviction piece is really important,‚Äù Luck said. Here, she said, investors want to know what the minimum viable product (MVP) is? And what feedback the product is getting from them so far? What have you learned?‚Äù she asked, listing off the questions. Talking about pivoting, if necessary, is also good here. Luck noted that she often talks to founders who pivoted early or at some point in their journey. Finally, she weighed in on the importance of numbers. ‚ÄúI think a lot of the important numbers also involve storytelling.‚Äù Here, investors want to know about the market size and any traction a product might have. She likes to see a company talk about how much cash it's burning through, and what the runway looks like. All together, the Who, What, How, and (two) Whys serve as a starting point, helping founders as they go forth on the entrepreneurship journey. ‚ÄúFounding a company is like extreme sports,‚Äù she said, likening it to climbing Everest in particular.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Less than two years after its hyped-up debut, Tesla is making an aggressive, almost desperate, move to salvage the Cybertruck, a vehicle widely seen as one of the biggest busts in recent automotive history. Faced with production woes, quality control nightmares, and underwhelming sales, the company has added its polarizing truck to a massive sales event, offering a powerful incentive it has historically reserved for its most loyal customers: a free transfer of its $12,000 Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. It's a stunning concession and a clear signal that the company is willing to sacrifice a significant revenue stream to get the angular, stainless-steel behemoths off of lots and onto the road. The offer, quietly added to Tesla's ‚ÄúCurrent Offers‚Äù page, allows existing Tesla owners who have already purchased FSD to transfer that capability to a new Cybertruck, free of charge. Making it transferable has been the single most requested feature from Tesla's loyal fanbase, and until now, the company had only offered it for its high-volume Model 3, Y, S, and X vehicles during brief promotional periods. Adding the Cybertruck to that list is a strategic gamble. On the other, it's an admission that the Cybertruck cannot sell on its own merits. The company is offering deep inventory discounts and 10,000 free Supercharging miles across its lineup. Since its launch, the Cybertruck has been plagued by problems. Early models were criticized for inconsistent panel gaps, susceptibility to rust spots, and a host of software glitches. More importantly, its radical design and high price point have failed to attract mainstream truck buyers, who continue to flock to established models like the Chevrolet's Silverado EV, which leans into a more conventional design. While Tesla does not release specific sales figures for the Cybertruck, industry analysts and registration data suggest that deliveries have fallen far short of initial projections. In the second quarter of 2025, Tesla sold just 4,306 Cybertrucks, down a staggering 50.8% from the 8,755 units it delivered during the same period last year, according to new data from Kelley Blue Book.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the auto industry races toward autonomy, most companies are rolling out driver-assist features with one hand while handing out waivers, disclaimers, and legal fine print with the other. The Chinese EV giant just made an unprecedented move: it's offering a public, financial guarantee for its autonomous parking system. If the system malfunctions, even due to an algorithmic failure, BYD will cover all resulting damages, including repair costs, third-party property damage, and compensation for personal injury. ‚ÄúWe are first in the world to propose a guarantee for autonomous parking,‚Äù the company said in a statement posted on social media Weibo. ‚ÄúOur move reflects absolute confidence in God's Eye ADAS.‚Äù The announcement draws a sharp contrast with Tesla, whose Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is still marketed as a beta feature. Despite its name, FSD requires full driver supervision, and Tesla repeatedly reminds users that they, not the company, are legally responsible for anything that happens on the road. It's not just promising a smarter system; it's promising corporate accountability, a component that has been largely missing from the discussion around consumer-grade autonomy. This guarantee is being delivered via a simple over-the-air (OTA) software update, not as part of a flashy concept car. With the upcoming God's Eye B update, BYD will enhance scene recognition, active safety, and precision parking in all conditions, including new functions like three-speed parking, U-turn assistance, and bypass maneuvers. For years, regulators and safety advocates have warned that carmakers were deploying autonomous features too quickly without clearly defining who is to blame when something goes wrong. If one company is willing to put its money on the line for Level 4-style autonomous parking, will competitors be pressured to match that promise or risk being seen as reckless? For now, BYD's guarantee is limited to China. But the company's growing international presence, including its aggressive push into Europe and Latin America, raises a critical question: will BYD bring this liability pledge to Western markets? It would also put immense pressure on companies like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, and GM to offer similar guarantees or risk appearing evasive to consumers. After all, if a Chinese automaker can afford to own the risk of its AI, what's stopping Silicon Valley's richest car company? In a world where most automakers treat autonomy as a ‚Äúuse at your own risk‚Äù feature, BYD's move is both rare and radical. And unlike Tesla, they aren't asking you to sign a waiver. They're asking you to believe them, with their wallet. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A console hacker named WinCurious obtained some discarded SD cards from a Nintendo factory that the company used for the factory setup process of Wii and Wii U systems. They were able to recover data on some of the damaged SD cards, after which another member of their team discovered an exploit that could be used to restore software-bricked Wii U consoles. The first challenge they faced was that all the cards were damaged, with approximately 25% of them having a destroyed die and flash memory IC. However, the remaining 75% only had PCB damage ‚Äî some of them required resoldering work or PCB replacement, while others needed only straightening before they could be read. Unfortunately, it's not as simple as plugging the SD cards into a reader and then copying and pasting them to another drive on your Windows PC. One solution to this was to use an external programmer to read the NAND flash memory directly, but this wasn't viable because DeadlyFoez did not have one that was compatible with the TSOP 48 chips used on the Nintendo SD cards. The dumped data would not represent what was actually on the card because it didn't go through its controller chip. Thankfully, WinCurious had an idea ‚Äî they suggested using a donor SD card and replacing its NAND chip with a TSOP 48 clip. They would then remove the NAND chips from the SD cards that they wanted to read (but had damaged or defective PCBs) and place them on a working SD card. ‚ÄúI can not express how incredibly difficult it is to solder these TSOP 48 clips onto anything at all. The right way to do it would be with a reflow oven and using solder paste with a stencil, but I do not have those. I do have my infrared preheater, which works well enough for these things.‚Äù Nevertheless, the system was successful, enabling them to recover 14 SD cards. They then wrote an exploit to take advantage of this, called ‚Äúpaid the beak‚Äù, and uploaded it on GitHub. Since SDBoot1 runs even on consoles with empty flash memory, it can recover almost any Wii U that has suffered from a software brick. The only devices it cannot save are those that have experienced issues with Seeprom or have suffered actual hardware failure. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Once you have them all, you can now put the card on your Wii U, use the jig or its alternative, and turn on your Wii U console. Another mod chip, called de_Fuse, can also perform a similar function and even recover Seeprom failures, but it requires more advanced skills and knowledge. This technique makes playing with the Wii U's hardware a little more accessible, allowing more people to experiment with it without having to disassemble their consoles and use specialized soldering skills.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ken DiCross is building the infrastructure to connect blockchains, and he's doing it with AI. The founder of Wire Network, a blockchain interoperability company, DiCross says he uses AI for everything from pitching investors to stress-testing white papers. In this week's edition of How Do You Use AI?, he explains how it saves him hours every day, why he doesn't trust it blindly, and why decentralized AI could be the next big revolution. No TED Talk nonsense, just real life. Gizmodo: How do you use AI right now? DiCross: I use AI for everything I possibly can; from helping with my schedule to categorizing and helping with email responses. DiCross: I go to their website, grab their white paper, and download it into the LLM. Rather than solving it properly in a decentralized way, they just add a fix that creates some kind of risk‚Äîsecurity, cost, or time. I create my list and send it off to my team or investors to show we still have a moat. That would take an enormous amount of time if I did it manually. AI helps me get it done in five minutes. Gizmodo: What was the last thing AI helped you do? We're starting to bring on advisors, ambassadors, and consultants. I took all the requirements for what we want these people to do and asked the AI to categorize them‚Äîwhat belongs in each role‚Äîand generate a base contract. I still send it to legal, but it saves me an hour-long call or a lengthy email. Gizmodo: Are there tasks you've completely handed over to AI? I don't create slides from scratch anymore. The LLM already knows Wire; we feed it everything. The output is fast and on point. It's the same for my devs. My top-tier engineers use it so efficiently that they're basically two or three people in one. We don't need junior-level devs anymore. I had to walk it through the right answer. So when people do ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù with AI, it can be dangerous. If you don't understand the code, you won't know if the AI's output is secure. You still need experts in the loop. Gizmodo: Do you use it in your personal life? I use it for search all the time. I don't use Yelp or Google anymore. I pick up 5 or 10 minutes here and there and end up with a few extra hours in my day. DiCross: It's not the answers that surprise me. You hit a wall and don't always know why. That's why we need decentralized AI: so people can get the information they need without worrying that it's being filtered or censored. Gizmodo: What do you say to people who are scared AI knows too much? DiCross: That's exactly why it has to be decentralized. I know it's building a profile on me. You want your data encrypted and private. Right now, if you type in something like a medical concern, that data can be sold. Your insurance could go up in minutes. Gizmodo: Do you feel uneasy using it? DiCross: Yes, because I know my data is getting hoovered up. Just like Linux became the backbone of every server, we'll have open-source AI that anyone can use without fear. That's where the future is heading.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With Donkey Kong Bananza now making its case as the real launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2, I needed a controller that could keep up with Kong's crashing fists. When it came to a game that epitomized joy and catharsis in equal measure, Nintendo's own Pro device proved a leading contender as best all-around, but not for the reasons you may think. I spent my own money on an $85 Switch 2 Pro controller. Accounting for tax, it was closer to $95, which is nearly one-fifth of the total price I paid for my Switch 2. They excoriated it not just for how it's basically impossible to take apart, but for its lack of Hall effect joysticks. The Pro 2 still uses potentiometer joysticks, which can wear out over time and create issues where the controller imagines inputs you didn't intend. It feels good in-hand, but there are better options if you can deal with connectivity issues. These complaints are more than warranted, but the Pro controller does feel purpose-built for modern titles like Bananza. It's comfortable for most players, both big and small, thanks to its overly large face buttons and the smooth, rubbery feel of the sticks. I would prefer triggers with more depth to each pull, but Switch 2 games won't require any kind of pressure-sensitive trigger unless you play a GameCube title. In that case, Nintendo's recreated $65 GameCube controller is still your best bet for accurate gameplay. Is it the kind of device I would spend nearly $100 on? The problem is that third-party controllers on Switch 2 lack several features of the Pro 2 controller, which seems like a deliberate act on Nintendo's part. Players who bought Nintendo's $450 handheld have a range of choices for a case or cameras if they're truly jonesing to see their choppy face represented in GameChat, but gamepads are another story. From a controller perspective, Nintendo's system is designed first and foremost for first-party. Sure, you could say that about any console, but Nintendo's device makes connecting third-party controllers a chore. For review, both 8BitDo and Gulikit sent me their latest controllers to pair with Switch 2. That's not a heavy knock against either device since you can still access the voice chat function through the home menu. The issue for both was how hard it became to pair them with Nintendo's handheld. Both require new firmware updates through their respective websites. Even then, pairing them to the console could take two seconds or more than a minute. For one, Nintendo's Pro 2 controller is the only gamepad that lets you use Nintendo's software to program the GR and GL back buttons. The inconsistencies mount when trying to get gyro controls working. There were rare instances when the Ultimate 2 wouldn't recognize them. Otherwise, both 8BitDo's controller and Elves 2 Pro had gyros just as accurate, if not more so, than Nintendo's device. Bonanza uses gyros only when aiming a chunk in Bananza or when adding a second player to control Pauline as DK's vocal turret. I prefer gyro aiming for Nintendo's games and in third-party games like Cyberpunk 2077, so the lack of it on the PowerA Advantage controller doesn't help it stand out despite its lower price. While Donkey Kong Bananza wants you to feel like DK with every swing of your fist, Nintendo's Pro 2 controller lacks an evocative rumble. Every cracked stone hit my wrists with a satisfying shudder. The Elves 2 Pro and Power A lack rumble, but I would also suggest you look at Gulikit's KK3 Max. Nintendo also ensured that only its first-party controllers could wake the console from sleep. It's just another annoying fact that gives Nintendo's Pro controller an edge. The Ultimate 2 or KK3 Max are both great first options if you can stomach those connectivity issues, but after several multiplayer sessions where controllers inexplicably disconnect, the problems aren't something you can ignore. Put together, it's enough to make me wish I were Donkey Kong‚Äîonly thinking of his next banana fix‚Äîand with no care for walled gardens or expensive controllers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI is being forced on us in pretty much every facet of life, from phones and apps to search engines and even drive-throughs, for some reason. But AI tools are more and more asking for gross levels of access to your personal data under the guise of needing it to work. This kind of access is not normal, nor should it be normalized. Perplexity says much of this data is stored locally on your device, but you're still granting the company rights to access and use your personal information, including to improve its AI models for everyone else. Perplexity isn't alone in asking for access to your data. Meta, too, has been testing the limits of what its AI apps can ask for access to, including tapping into the photos stored in a user's camera roll that haven't been uploaded yet. There are serious security and privacy risks associated with using AI assistants that rely on your data. All of this for the sake of performing a task that ostensibly saves you time ‚Äî or, to Whittaker's point, saves you from having to actively think about it. When things go wrong (and they do, a lot), it's common practice for humans at AI companies to look over your private prompts to figure out why things didn't work. From a security and privacy point of view, a simple cost-benefit analysis of connecting AI to your most personal data just isn't worth giving up access to your most private information. Any AI app asking for these levels of permissions should send your alarm bells ringing, just like the flashlight app wanting to know your location at any moment in time. Given the reams of data that you hand over to AI companies, ask yourself if what you get out of it is really worth it. Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But for some of global automakers' most ambitious electric vehicle projects, the In Memoriam segment is already shaping up to be a sad one. Major manufacturers including Honda, Stellantis, and Nissan publicly backed off plans to build and sell battery-electric vehicles, joining others who have made similar admissions in the past two years. Vehicle program cancellations aren't the sign of a thriving industry. Traditional automakers work on five- to seven-year product cycles, which means they've already started spending money to design, plan, and produce vehicles that won't roll onto dealers' lots for years. Nixing those vehicles means losing money and leaving holes in their portfolios‚Äîsomething automakers won't do without good reason. Mercedes-Benz and Volvo said they would go all-electric by 2030; General Motors targeted 2035. Then governments, including the US government, used a mix of subsidies and regulations to ratchet up pressure for automakers to produce zero-emission cars. Now many of those automakers' big electric promises have quietly gone away. Which is to say, the cancellations make some sense. ‚ÄúThere's a speed bump every year.‚Äù This year, the firm dropped its 2030 sales predictions for battery-electric and hybrid cars by a whopping 46 percent compared to last year's projections. Cancellations might also be signs that automakers are learning from their mistakes and even beginning to adapt more quickly. Which is to say, more changes are likely on the way. RIP to them‚Äîand expect a few more losses along the way. Ford said last summer that it had rethought its electric vehicle strategy, cutting its annual EV program spend and devoting more resources to hybrids. "What we've learned is that customers want choice, and so we're providing that choice, with a full lineup of EVs, hybrid, electric, gas, and diesel products," Ford CFO John Lawler said at the time. This month, Honda reportedly nixed a new EV series meant to hit the roads starting in 2026. The company reconsidered its plans in light of falling demand for EVs in the US and will reportedly refocus on increasing hybrid production. Honda is moving forward with its ‚Äú0 Series‚Äù sedan and midsize SUV EVs, which are set to debut next year. Mercedes-Benz was supposed to build a new electric vehicle platform to support the next versions of its EQS and EQE sedans and SUVs, plus other future luxury EV models, starting in 2028. Nissan North America Chair Christian Meunier told Automotive News this spring that the automaker was ‚Äúlistening to market data‚Äù and its US customers, who were demanding fewer EVs and more SUVs. ‚ÄúWe need to face reality.‚Äù Two EV sedans, by Nissan and its luxury division Infiniti, are out, and Nissan will build at least two electric SUVs instead. Volvo said in 2021 that it planned to become a fully electric car company by 2030. The company wrote in a press release that it ‚Äúdecided to adjust its electrification ambitions due to changing market conditions and customer demands.‚Äù Stellantis' luxury Maserati brand killed off its planned MC20 sports car earlier this year. Some on the car team were reportedly moved into alternative AI efforts. The Fisker Pear, announced in 2022, was supposed to be a compact electric produced by the scrappy startup helmed by serial car company founder and designer Henrik Fisker. But the program was paused amid "financial difficulty‚Äù in March 2024. At one point, General Motors' Buick brand was positioned as the automaker's greenest. Now, a spokesperson for Buick says its first electrified car is postponed. Meanwhile, GM's 2018 promise to sell only electric vehicles by 2035 has been quietly scrapped. Just last month, GM said it would spend $4 billion in the next two years to increase production of electric and gasoline vehicles. Ferrari's second EV model was meant to debut at the end of 2026; now it reportedly won't make an entrance until at least 2028. Lamborghini's first all-electric vehicle was announced in 2023 for a 2028 production date; now, it won't make an appearance until 2029 at least. CEO Stephan Winkelmann cited slower-than-predicted electric vehicle adoption and changing regulations. ‚ÄúLife cycles are becoming shorter due to a lot of new regulations coming in each and every year. Also delayed, for an even longer while, is Lamborghini's ‚ÄúSuper SUV‚Äù EV. The Urus will reportedly remain a plug-in hybrid until 2035. Now the vehicle is reportedly delayed not just due to lower-than-expected EV demand but because of supply chain troubles: Battery supplier Northvolt went suddenly bankrupt this year. But as the electric-car company emphasizes its small, supervised self-driving taxi service launch in Austin, Texas, it has made no noise about this newer car. Expect an update from CEO Elon Musk this coming week, when the company holds its quarterly earnings call.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. And according to an interview with TechRadar, it's happening. There has been plenty of crossover over the years‚Äîthe biggest being the introduction of Android apps to Chromebooks back in 2016‚Äîbut they have always coexisted. With Samat's new statement, though, change is afoot. In the interview, Samat also followed up on a comment made to WIRED's Julian Chokkattu at Google I/O this year, hinting at a future Google laptop, stating that ‚Äúhe's interested in how people are using their laptops these days.‚Äù The last Google laptop was the Pixelbook Go in 2019, which followed the ill-fated Pixel Slate 2-in-1 in 2017. In other Google news, the company has set a date for its Made by Google event, where it's expected to debut the Pixel 10 series smartphones, a new Pixel Watch, and new wireless earbuds. The keynote takes place on August 20 in Brooklyn, New York, and it kicks off at 1 pm ET (10 am Pacific). Google used to hold its big hardware event in October, but changed things up last year, putting the Pixel release date ahead of the iPhone, with more breathing room ahead of the holiday shopping season. The RX1R series was last updated nine years ago. If I had to guess, I'd say it has a lot to do with the success of compact fixed-lens cameras, like the Leica Q series, Fujifilm X100 series, and the Fujifilm GFX100RF. Sorry you had to wait almost 10 years, RX1 fans, but better late than never. Here's more you may have missed this week: What do you get out of a 10-year development cycle? The RX1R III is pretty much a repackaged a7R V in terms of image capabilities. That's a significant upgrade for this camera relative to the last model in the series, but there's no brand-new tech here. One thing that hasn't changed at all since this series was launched in 2012 is the built-in Zeiss Sonnar T* 35-mm f/2 lens. Omega this week dropped a bright, summery version of its excellent Seamaster Diver 300M, following on February's bronze gold and burgundy watch. While, yes, it's not exactly a groundbreaking departure from last year's original, it hits all the right notes, mainly thanks to how strong November's first iteration was. However, this model has an edge over its siblings. The aluminum bezel and stylish mesh bracelet remain, but look closely and you'll see subtle changes, most pleasing of which is that the wave-pattern on the dial has been replaced with a flat, matte-textured black. For the orange enthusiasts, note the lollipop seconds hand, and indices at 12, 3, 6, and 9 have all been given a pop of color. A final flourish is the matching orange ‚ÄúSeamaster‚Äù dial signature. As with last year's 42-mm original, we'd still opt for the mesh bracelet ($6,800), but if you want to go totally tangerine, then spec the integrated orange rubber strap at $6,500. Regardless of strap selection, with the Caliber 8806 inside (certified as a Master Chronometer by METAS) and water resistance to 300 meters, this piece‚Äîeither in orange or the original black‚Äîis currently WIRED's pick of Omega's lineup. Whether you're worried about power outages or unpredictable weather events, or looking to better manage rising energy costs, EcoFlow's new Ocean Pro system is targeting you. This whole-home energy backup system pairs modular 10-kWh batteries (expandable up to 80 kWh) with an inverter that can handle up to 40-kW solar panel arrays. Ocean Pro can output up to 24 kW continuously, enough to fully power most households, including HVAC systems, EV chargers, and other appliances. The brain of the Ocean Pro system is its Smart Home Panel, allowing for real-time energy monitoring and AI forecasting on weather, pricing, and usage to automate your smart home systems. Ocean Pro can also export power to the grid, and there's support for the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) network to export excess energy based on need and electricity prices. The kit can handle extreme temperatures (from ‚Äì4 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) and has built-in fire prevention. Most folks install them on the side of their house, so the batteries come in a choice of aluminum, carbon fiber, or walnut finishes. These systems are a big jump up from the EcoFlow portable power stations and power banks we've tested, but the company has been selling its PowerOcean home batteries in Europe for a while, and they have a decent reputation. The Ocean Pro beats Tesla's Powerwall 3 on two key fronts: It can handle more solar (double) and it can store more energy (Tesla maxes out at 54 kWh). Ocean Pro is available directly from EcoFlow now. Purveyor of gaming-focused virtual display glasses, Viture just announced a whole new lineup. Aside from a sharper display across the board, Viture's main addition in the top three models is a front-facing camera to allow for spatial capture and 6 degrees of freedom (dof) using its Spacewalker app, though this is not available yet. The Luma Pro I have been testing gives you a 152-inch virtual display with a 52-degree field of view at up to 1200p resolution and 1,000 nits of brightness. Viture describes them as 4K-like, despite the resolution, but what it means is that this is its sharpest display yet. There's also electrochromic film to darken the shades, and full customization with nose pieces, diopter dials, and adjustable temples with lighting effects. The key advantage Xreal's glasses have is a hardware chip that allows 3 dof, so you can pin screens in place. But the Luma Pro and up will support 6 dof, allowing you to move in 3D space, though it will still be handled through software on your connected device. Viture also offers AI-powered 2D to 3D conversion across its glasses. Sony is jumping into business with the National Football League. The two megabrands announced a partnership this week that includes a custom-developed Sony headset as the primary communications device for NFL head coaches. Sony says the headset has undergone extensive testing in rain, snow, cold, and extreme heat to take on the notoriously bad-weather games NFL coaches endure, as well as drop testing for mishaps (and presumably flaring tempers). Sony not only brought its years of noise-canceling experience to the system, but also optimized it for real-game environments using crowd noise at over 100 decibels, according to Sony Audio product manager Gator Nakahashi. Sideline communication will be handled by a custom mic transmitted over Verizon Business' Private Wireless Solution.
