As a new round of negotiations between Hamas and Israel begins in Doha, Israeli forces have intensified their military operations across the Gaza Strip. Each day, Palestinians live under relentless bombardment and witness horrific massacres. UNRWA, the UN agency that provides relief for Palestinian refugees, says 1 in 10 children may be malnourished due to the Israeli blockade. Yet, while grappling with unimaginable hardship and daily horrors, people in Gaza have begun clinging to the headlines, following every update on the negotiations with cautious hope. Everywhere you go, people ask one another with worry, their hearts heavy with anticipation: Will it happen this time? For many in Gaza, the word “ceasefire” alone is enough to revive a sense of hope. It recharges the spirit of Gazans worn down by months of relentless war, as children and adults alike begin to voice dreams of the simple joys they've been denied for so long. Even though the recent discussions are only addressing the possibility of a temporary truce, followed by further negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire, it is seen as a refuge for many — a fleeting chance to breathe freely from the suffocating burdens of war. Still, nothing is guaranteed, given our experience with the last ceasefire in January, which lasted only two months before being violated by the Israelis. During the last ceasefire, people were given only a short break from daily killing, displacement, and starvation. While grappling with unimaginable hardship and daily horrors, people in Gaza have begun clinging to the headlines, following every update on the negotiations with cautious hope. However, the Israeli government apparently saw this life as a luxury Gazans cannot be allowed. Determined to continue destroying what was already broken, they resumed the war, which shattered what Palestinians had begun to rebuild and plunged people in Gaza back into the same endless cycle of suffering. Ihsan Alkateeb, 48, told me that once Israel resumed the war in Gaza, it became even crueler than before. He explained that Israeli forces took control of large areas of the Strip, including his neighborhood in Al-Qarara, a town in the Khan Younis governorate that is now under Israeli control and completely inaccessible to its residents. He also added that Israel's starvation campaign is even more terrifying than the military assault itself. “It has drained our energy and left us in despair,” he told me, recalling how helpless he felt watching his children cry for food while he had nothing to offer. “I was forced to risk my life multiple times by following the humanitarian aid trucks and going to American aid distribution sites, which I consider death traps, just to get a bag of flour for my family.” Alkateeb mentioned that, like all the people of Gaza, he is closely following the recent discussions about a 60-day ceasefire and is optimistic — hoping he can finally feed his children the food they long for and return to his neighborhood. However, he added that he is deeply concerned about the lack of guarantees from Israel regarding the resumption of war. “Israel will return to the war with even greater bloodshed and destruction, seeking to implement its plan to occupy the Strip, empty it of its residents, and push them toward Rafah in an effort to drive us out of our land.” Although the house was partially destroyed, she said they “spared no effort to make it livable again.” For a moment, she believed the war was truly over, and she allowed herself to dream of a better future — one filled with peace and stability. Nassar said the resumption of the Israeli military operation in March came as a shock — something she never imagined. Once again, she was forced to flee her beloved neighborhood after Israeli forces launched a large-scale ground invasion, seeking refuge in a tent in the Al-Rimal neighborhood of Gaza. “I now live in a small tent in an overcrowded camp, deprived of the basic necessities of life,” she told me. “When I hear about obstacles or major gaps between the two parties, I feel deeply depressed,” she told me. As international calls for an immediate ceasefire grow louder, the question remains: Will these negotiations succeed in achieving lasting peace, or will we continue to endure recurring cycles of pain and devastation? Hope still lives, but it requires genuine support and sustained action from the international community to guarantee Gaza's right to life, freedom, and peace.

Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), led by Mehmet Oz, announced the move on Thursday, saying that it has informed states of a “clear shift away from policies that extend beyond statutory limits,” specifically restricting Section 1115 waivers that have been sought and approved in dozens of states across the U.S. “CMS will allow currently approved initiatives to run out their course but does not anticipate extending them nor approving new waivers,” the agency said in a statement, which came less than two weeks after President Donald Trump signed into law the largest Medicaid cuts in U.S. history. The policy was described as a “ground-breaking initiative” that would “help infants and young children get off to a healthy start in life without parents having to worry about renewing their Medicaid coverage annually,” regardless of temporary changes to family income or other factors. Wyden said Thursday that “the Trump administration will stop at nothing to rip coverage away from American families, even kids they claim they want to protect.” Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families, wrote that “in the name of ‘protecting vulnerable Americans,' the Trump administration will rip away Medicaid coverage from babies and toddlers.” 👀In the name of “protecting vulnerable Americans” the Trump Administration will rip away Medicaid coverage from babies and toddlers👀CMS announces Medicaid demos that 8 states are implementing to cover babies and young children continuously w/o gaps will no longer be allowed pic.twitter.com/aXF0mKXL9S But Amaya Diana, a policy analyst at the health research organization KFF, wrote Thursday that “not everyone who loses coverage at renewal is no longer eligible.” “While some were no longer eligible, others lost coverage due to barriers such as communication issues.” Yet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has reportedly stripped eight of Brazil's 11 supreme court judges of their US visas as the White House escalates its campaign to help the country's former president Jair Bolsonaro avoid justice over his alleged attempt to seize power with a military coup. Bolsonaro is expected to be convicted by the supreme court in the coming weeks and faces a jail sentence of up to 43 years. On Friday, after federal police raided Bolsonaro's house and fitted him with an electronic tag to stop him absconding, Rubio announced further moves in support of the defendant, who he claimed was the victim of a “political witch hunt”. Rubio did not name his other targets but the Brazilian newspaper O Globo identified them as Luís Roberto Barroso, José Antonio Dias Toffoli, Cristiano Zanin, Flávio Dino, Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha, Luiz Edson Fachin and Gilmar Ferreira Mendes. Two other judges who were nominated to the court during Bolsonaro's 2019-23 presidency, André Mendonça and Kassio Nunes Marques, reportedly avoided the sanction, as did a third judge, Luiz Fux. Lula denounced what he called “another arbitrary and completely groundless measure from the US government”. “Interference in another country's justice system is unacceptable and offends the basic principles of national sovereignty and respect between nations,” the president said on Saturday, adding: “I'm certain that no kind of intimidation or threat – from whoever it may be – will compromise the most important mission of our nation's powers and institutions, which is to act permanently to defend and safeguard the democratic rule of law.” The Trump strategist Alex Bruesewitz welcomed Rubio's announcement, calling Bolsonaro's treatment “sick and wrong”. Bolsonaro's congressman son, Eduardo, thanked Rubio for his decision. “Thank you very much for this fight in favor of free speech, we do believe in the same values,” tweeted Eduardo, who has been living in the US since February and has reportedly been lobbying officials there over his father's plight. Trump's interventions have appalled millions of Brazilians who hope to see their former leader held responsible for the alleged coup attempt, which culminated in the 8 January riots in Brasília. Even influential rightwing voices have criticised the US's attempt to meddle in one of the world's most populous democracies by imposing 50% tariffs. On Saturday, the conservative Estado de São Paulo newspaper described Trump's behaviour as “unacceptable external interference in Brazil's domestic matters”. While the Bolsonaros have hailed Trump's actions, they also appear to have grasped how the announcement of tariffs has backfired, allowing Lula to pose as a nationalist defender of Brazilian interests and paint the Bolsonaro clan as self-serving “traitors”. Lula, who had been facing growing public disillusionment and an uphill battle to win re-election next year, has enjoyed a bounce in the polls since Trump launched his trade war, the brunt of which will be borne by coffee producers and cattle ranchers in Bolsonaro-voting regions, such as São Paulo. “I think [Bolsonaro] wanted some kind of penalty - something he could use to say: ‘Look, Brazil's being punished because of Bolsonaro's persecution.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts warn that the dangerous ideologically driven cuts at HHS will have long-term consequences for healthcare The Trump administration's “war on science” appears to have entered a new phase in the aftermath of a recent supreme court decision that empowered health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a prominent vaccine sceptic, and other agency leaders, to implement mass firings – effectively greenlighting the politicization of science. The decision comes as Kennedy abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting of a key health care advisory panel, the US Preventive Services Task Force, earlier this month. “The current administration is waging a war on science,” warned Celine Gounder, a professor of medicine and an infectious disease expert at New York University in a keynote talk in May to graduates of Harvard's School of Public Health. Gounder added: “Over the past few months, we have seen the Trump administration engage not only in medical misinformation, but in active censorship of scientific discourse.” Medical experts say Kennedy's policies are helping “sow distrust in vaccines” as measles cases soar to a more than three decade high, hurt vital healthcare research with draconian cuts, and helped foment a Trump administration “war on science” mentality. He then named a new eight person vaccine panel – half of whom share Kennedy's distrust of vaccines – who quickly retracted recommendations for flu vaccines containing an ingredient which many anti-vaxxers have falsely connected to autism. That move sparked sharp criticism from veteran doctors with a national pediatric group, which opted to boycott its first meeting. “Among the reasons we decided not to participate was because it clearly appeared to be an orchestrated effort to sow distrust in vaccines,” Sean O'Leary who chairs a committee on infectious diseases with the American Academy of Pediatrics, told the Guardian. Even before these moves, prominent healthcare scholars were sounding loud alarms about some HHS policies and the administration's anti-science mentality – including its draconian budget cuts for research and staff cuts totaling over 10,000. Gounder said there has been a “flood of Orwellian doublespeak from public health agencies”, contributing to declining vaccination rates and making Americans more susceptible to diseases like measles, which recently hit a level not seen since 2000 when measles was declared eliminated in the US. Kennedy, they alleged, has “systematically deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job”. For his part, Kennedy in March issued a statement defending the early HHS move to cut 10,000 full-time jobs: “We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. Those jobs have since been cut, as of Monday 14 July, after an 8 July order from the supreme court that allowed the restructuring plans to proceed. Many employees who were supposed to be laid off during the agency's first round of 10,000 layoffs in April have been in limbo as the order made its way through the court system and later paused by federal judges. They're trying to cut off funds that have been lawfully appropriated by Congress”. O'Leary and many other medical experts warn that the dangerous ideologically driven cuts at HHS will have long-term consequences. “What we're seeing across HHS is deeply concerning,” said O'Leary “NIH funding has never been politically or ideologically driven, but clearly that's what we're seeing now. Those cuts are going to have serious consequences for our country and healthcare.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's Note: This story has been updated with new details about the attack. Cyber specialists from Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) carried out a large-scale cyberattack against the network infrastructure of Russian energy giant Gazprom, causing significant disruptions, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent on July 18. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Gazprom and Russian authorities have not publicly commented on the reported incident. The alleged operation took place on July 17 and targeted systems used by Gazprom and its subsidiaries, which Ukraine's intelligence claims are directly involved in supporting Russia's war effort. Gazprom is Russia's state-owned energy company, one of the world's largest gas producers and exporters. The cyberattack allegedly destroyed large volumes of data and installed custom software designed to further damage the company's information systems. According to the source, access to Gazprom's internal systems was disabled for nearly 20,000 system administrators, and backup copies of key databases were wiped. "As a result of the cyber operation, the corporation's records of contracts, schedules, and tariffs were destroyed, including data on who and how much gas/oil should be supplied, data on payments, taxes, Gazprom's financial balances, information on the corporation's licenses and legal agreements." The sources said the attackers managed to destroy clusters of "extremely powerful" servers running 1C, a software widely used for managing documents and contracts, analytics data for pipelines, valves, pumps, and SCADA systems — key elements in operating Gazprom's technical infrastructure. Multiple servers reportedly had operating systems removed or disabled, and the BIOS (basic firmware) of many devices was damaged, making them inoperable without physical repairs. President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 19 announced the updated composition of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, following the country's latest government reshuffle. A new initiative will examine how the Ukrainian language describes foreign locations while at home, with the aim of standardizing and promoting a Ukrainian spelling, said Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. Pavlohrad, a city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast that has become a key humanitarian aid hub for those evacuating the front lines, suffered one of its most severe attacks of the war, Governor Serhii Lysak said on July 19. Russian strikes killed at least seven people and injured 31 others in multiple regions over the past 24 hours, Ukrainian regional authorities said on July 19. Russia has lost 1,040,950 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on July 19. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on July 18 signed an order withdrawing Moscow from a military technical cooperation agreement with Germany amid strained relations between the two countries. The "Darts" twin-engine strike drone is capable of traveling over 40 kilometers (25 miles) and carries a payload of 12-14 kilograms as opposed to the company's pre-existing single engine drone which can handle a maximum of 8 kilograms. Russian air defense units intercepted 13 drones flying towards Moscow in under two hours, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reported at around 1:46 a.m. local time on July 19. "I will be looking for a person to lead this area," First Deputy Prime Minister and Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The right-winger and ally of US President Donald Trump was also barred from speaking to foreign officials or approaching embassies, and banned from social media, under orders of Brazil's Supreme Court. Bolsonaro added that police seized “about 14,000 US dollars” and claimed the money was for personal use, adding he had the receipts to prove it. Hours after the ruling, the US State Department announced visa restrictions against Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes and an unspecified number of other court officials, accusing them of carrying out a “political witch hunt” against Bolsonaro. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement said he had “ordered visa revocations for Moraes and his allies on the court, as well as their immediate family members effective immediately.” Moraes made headlines last year when he banned social media platform X, during a feud with its billionaire owner – and former Trump ally – Elon Musk, over hate speech moderation and the company's failure to name a legal representative in the country, as required by law. Friday's raid came after Trump tried to force Lula to end the criminal trial against Bolsonaro, by threatening crippling tariffs on the country. Trump linked the tariff threat to what he described as a “witch hunt” trial against Bolsonaro. About a week later, the US launched an investigation into “unfair” trading practices by Brazil, according to a statement by the United States Trade Representative. CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment on this allegation. The court documents highlighted a confidential meeting Bolsonaro had with a US State Department official, and highlighted Trump's letter as an “offensive” and “clear threat” to Brazilian sovereignty. “There isn't any lobby to sanction an authority,” Bolsonaro said. Speaking exclusively to CNN Thursday, Lula said that Trump's threats had broken from protocol, and argued that his predecessor's fate cannot be part of trade negotiations. Related article Brazil's President Lula says Trump was ‘not elected to be emperor of the world,' as US-Brazil spat escalates On Friday, Trump posted a letter to Bolsonaro on Truth Social, in which he suggested the former Brazilian leader was the victim of an “unjust system,” and said that he would be “watching closely.” Bolsonaro could face more than four decades behind bars if found guilty of masterminding the coup. He is among 34 people charged with five crimes, including attempting the coup. Part of the coup plot, prosecutors allege, involved a plan to potentially assassinate Lula, his vice president and a minister of the Supreme Court. Brian Winter, executive vice president of Americas Society and Council of the Americas, told CNN that Trump's mooted use of trade levers may not be so painful to Brazil – for which the US is not as significant a trading partner as, say, China. “Brazil only sends about 11% of its exports to the United States,” Winter said. “That's half what Brazil sends to China, and for some of Brazil's exports – not all, but for some of them – they can find other markets besides the United States.” “The question is, if this keeps escalating, could President Trump use measures that are even more painful, such as financial sanctions against large groups of people?” Winter asked, noting that Trump previously threatened, among other things, a travel ban on Colombian citizens during a disagreement with the Colombian government over migrant flights. “It's possible that President Trump could continue to escalate this in a way that could eventually produce considerably more pain for the Brazilian government and for the Brazilian people,” Winter said.</p>

BRUSSELS, July 19. /TASS/. The European Union imposed sanctions on People's Artist of Russia Karen Shakhnazarov and nine other Russian individuals, according to the Official Journal of the European Union.

The EU's 18th sanctions package also targets one citizen each from Azerbaijan, China, India, and Iran who the bloc says are affiliated with the so-called Russian shadow tanker fleet.

The affected individuals will be banned entry into the European Union and their assets in European jurisdictions will be frozen.

Also, the EU extended its sanctions onto Belarus by putting eight Belarusian legal entities on its black list.</p>
