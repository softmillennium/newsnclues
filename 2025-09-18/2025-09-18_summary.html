Critics say ‘authoritarianism isn't coming – it's already here' amid widespread condemnation of talkshow's suspension

The indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show has prompted impassioned calls for a boycott against Disney, ABC's parent company, and other major media conglomerates that have refused to air Kimmel's show.

Boycott calls grew after ABC announced it would indefinitely suspend the popular show following complaints from Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr. Carr's complaints stem from Kimmel's recent monologue in which he addressed the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk by saying: “Many in Maga land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.”

Carr, who was appointed by Donald Trump earlier this year, said Kimmel's comments were “truly sick” and that ABC had violated its “public interest” broadcast obligations. ABC's suspension of the show also came after Nexstar Media, one of the US's largest owners of TV stations, said it “strongly object[ed]” to Kimmel's comments and would pre-empt, or halt, any of the show's episodes set to air on its stations “for the foreseeable future”.

Meanwhile, conservative TV conglomerate Sinclair announced it would run a tribute to Kirk during Kimmel's time slot on Friday. It also called on Kimmel to issue a formal apology and make a personal donation to Kirk's family and his rightwing political advocacy group, Turning Point USA.

Overnight, calls to boycott ABC and Disney emerged, with grassroots political advocacy group 50501 leading the charge. In a statement, the group said: “Jimmy Kimmel wasn't suspended because of what he said. He was suspended because the FCC threatened his employer. That's state-sanctioned censorship and it is a giant red flag … Authoritarianism isn't coming, it's already here. Today it's Jimmy. Tomorrow it's the rest of us.”

The group went on to add: “Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group own the largest number of local ABC affiliates. These two companies are currently seeking approval from the FCC for business deals. In other words these media giants have every incentive to bend the knee to authoritarian pressure coming from the FCC and the administration to get their deals across the finish line. We're done watching this unfold in silence … It's time we speak in the only language they seem to respect – their money.”

As part of its boycott calls, 50501 urged the public to write to ABC, Nexstar and Sinclair with the following script: “I object to the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel Live after pressure from the administration. This is censorship plain and simple and it's not what American values stand for. We need leaders to protect freedom of speech, not punish it.”

Boycott calls have also emerged on numerous Reddit threads as well as on X via the hashtag #BoycottDisney.

One user wrote on BlueSky: “Heard from a friend at Disney+ that there are multiple levels of freakout internally, both from internal dissatisfaction, concerns about subscription cancelations, and of course the big one: concern about a boycott spilling over into parks and cruises.”

On Wednesday, CNN correspondent Brian Stelter wrote on X that he asked Carr if he had any new comments following Kimmel's show suspension. “He sent me this gif,” Stelter said, alongside a gif from The Office, where two characters, Michael Scott and Dwight Schrute, are shown celebrating with their hands in the air.

The Guardian has contacted ABC, Disney, Nexstar, Sinclair and the FCC for comment.

Reacting to the news of Kimmel's show suspension, Trump responded gleefully, saying: “Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.” He added that Kimmel had “worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible”.

In July, Trump celebrated Paramount's decision to cancel The Late Show With Stephen Colbert – the US's highest rated late-night show – after Colbert also mocked Trump. Writing on TruthSocial, Trump said: “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert!”

The suspension of Kimmel's show has also prompted condemnation from the public and lawmakers, with House Democratic leaders demanding the resignation of Carr.

Free speech advocacy group Pen America, decried ABC's decision, saying: “This marks a dark new level of capitulation and censorship of speech more redolent of autocracies than democracies.”

            Hundreds of nonprofit groups, most of them left-leaning, are joining together to urge President Donald Trump to end what they call the “unjustified” targeting of liberal organizations following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
    


            In an open letter issued Thursday and shared first with CNN, more than 500 groups condemned what they described as the use of government power to threaten their First Amendment rights. Organizations signing the letter ranged from the American Civil Liberties Union and Indivisible to Greenpeace USA and the Service Employees International Union.
    


            Trump and others in his administration have invoked Kirk's killing at a Utah university campus last week to say they will crack down on groups that they view as part of a coordinated left-wing effort to incite violence.
    


            “Political violence has targeted those of every political persuasion and of no political persuasion,” the groups said. “It is un-American and wrong to use this act of violence as a pretext for weaponizing the government to threaten nonprofit and charitable organizations, other perceived adversaries, or any class of people.”
    


            “They did not commit this murder,” the letter added, “and the vast powers of the government should not be abused to threaten their constitutionally-protected free speech and other rights.”
    


            The actions publicly floated by the president and some conservatives include revoking the tax-exempt status of left-leaning non-profits and launching racketeering investigations of organizations that have helped coordinate or fund protests against Trump's policies.
    


            So far, Trump has announced that he is designating the far-left movement Antifa as a terrorist organization, although it was not immediately clear how administration intends to carry out the designation.
    


            “The assassination of Kirk was a tragedy for his family and a danger for the nation,” said Lisa Gilbert, the co-president of Public Citizen, which helped organize Thursday's public statement from the liberal groups. “It is unconscionable to exploit this dangerous political moment to further divisions and violate rights, when what we desperately need right now is to lower the temperature of our discourse and bring the country together.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for a response.
    


            The letter from the nonprofits follows a similar action Wednesday from more than 100 philanthropies who banded together to defend free speech. In that letter, the foundations defended their work and denounced what they said were efforts to “exploit political violence to mischaracterize our good work of restrict our fundamental freedoms.”
    


            Signatories included the Open Society Foundations, the philanthropic group founded by billionaire financier and Democratic donor George Soros, who has been a repeated target of scorn from Trump and the right.

The resolution was introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace, who has repeatedly attacked Omar for her faith and Somalian origin.

An extremist House Republican's attempt to censure Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) failed by just one vote on Wednesday, after Democrats maneuvered against it.

A vote to table the censure resolution succeeded 214 to 213, with all Democrats and four Republicans voting to kill the measure. The resolution, introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina), would have removed Omar from her assignments on the Education and Workforce Committee and the Budget Committee.

Mace claimed her censure effort was about Omar's criticism of Charlie Kirk. In an interview last week, Omar had offered sympathy to Kirk's family, while criticizing many of Kirk's far right beliefs and condemning Republicans for their attacks on the left following the shooting.

However, Republicans have attempted to censure the progressive lawmaker numerous times over the years. Mace posted about Omar over 75 times on her X account in recent days, reporters noted, spreading false accusations about her beliefs and waging outright racist, Islamophobic attacks on her faith and Somalian origin.

Democrats said that Mace was just trying to boost her profile after entering the South Carolina gubernatorial race last month. Omar noted that Mace is sending out fundraising messages based on her attacks.

“This is what Nancy Mace is sending out to fundraise. It is unbefitting of a Member of Congress to spread blatant lies and misinformation. Utterly shameful,” Omar wrote on X, posting a screenshot of a Mace fundraiser calling Omar a “sick, racist, USA-hating RADICAL.” 

Omar also pointed out that the resolution itself doesn't include a single quote from Omar on Kirk.

“Nancy Mace is trying to censure me over comments I never said,” Omar said. “Unlike her, I have routinely condemned political violence, no matter the political ideology. This is all an attempt to push a false story so she can fundraise and boost her run for Governor.”

The progressive lawmaker thanked Republican lawmakers for joining Democrats in opposing the censure and “defend[ing] the first amendment.” 

Republican Representatives Mike Flood (Nebraska), Jeff Hurd (Colorado), Tom McClintock (California) and Cory Mills (Florida) voted with Democrats to table the resolution. Mace had fast tracked the resolution, bypassing the normal committee process to bring it to a floor vote.

Mills had voted against the censure after Democrats threatened a retaliatory censure against him, as Axios reported, introduced by Congressional Progressive Caucus leader Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas). Casar said he plans to withdraw his resolution now that the censure attempt against Omar failed.

The vote comes as Republicans have increasingly taken steps after Kirk's death last week to silence the voices of those they claim are disrespecting him — though many on the left say the right is actually seeking to use the event as a bludgeon to punish anyone they disagree with. President Donald Trump has launched a sweeping campaign to crack down on his opponents in the wake of the killing.

            Astronomers might be close to confirming the presence of an Earth-like atmosphere on an exoplanet for the first time, if more detailed analyses verify preliminary observations from the James Webb Space Telescope.
    


            The planet is part of a planetary system about 40 light-years away from Earth called TRAPPIST-1, which five Belgian astronomers discovered in 2016 and named after their favorite beer. The system has been heavily studied ever since.
    


            “As a planetary system, it's as alien as it gets,” said Néstor Espinoza, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. “The star is very, very small — the size of Jupiter — and it has at least seven rocky planets orbiting around it. Three of those are in what we call the habitable zone, which means they are close enough to the star that if they had an atmosphere, they could sustain liquid water.”
    


            Espinoza and his colleagues focused on TRAPPIST-1 e, the fourth planet from the star in the system, in a study published last week in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Four observations performed in 2023 with the Webb telescope were unable to rule out the presence of an atmosphere, prompting  optimism.
    


            “Based on the first four observations, we cannot tell that (this planet) doesn't have an atmosphere, so the dream is still alive — it could still have an atmosphere,” Espinoza said, “and that's super exciting, because we do have a follow-up program of 15 more observations.”
    


            The Webb telescope has only been able to rule out any atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 b, the innermost planet, but the jury is still out on the other six, Espinoza said, with TRAPPIST-1 e seen as one of the best candidates for liquid surface water.
    


            “Three years ago, before the launch of James Webb, these kinds of studies were science fiction,” Espinoza said about the possibility of detecting atmospheres on faraway planets. “Now I'm pretty confident we'll be able to see what kind of atmosphere TRAPPIST-1 e could have — and if it has an Earth-like atmosphere, we'll be able to tell.”
    


TRAPPIST-1 e is similar to Earth in size and orbits its star every six days — a much faster rate than Earth orbits the sun. That's because the star is much smaller than our sun, and all the planets are close to it. “If you could magically bring the TRAPPIST-1 star to our solar system,” Espinoza said, “all the planets and their orbits would fit within the orbit of Mercury.”
    


            When looking for an atmosphere, astronomers wait for a planet to transit in front of its star and notice any minor changes in the starlight that filters through. They search for telltale signs of an atmosphere while learning about its chemical composition.
    


            With the four transits observed by the Webb telescope in 2023, astronomers were able to rule out the presence of a primary, hydrogen-based atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 e, which was likely blown away by significant amounts of radiation emitted by its star. (Earth similarly lost its primordial, primary atmosphere early on but then built a secondary one; astronomers hope that TRAPPIST-1 e could have done the same.)
    


            This scenario is detailed in a second study, also published last week in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. It notes that the planet is unlikely to have an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide like those of Venus and Mars, and points toward a nitrogen-heavy one, more similar to Earth and Saturn's icy moon Titan.
    


            “TRAPPIST-1e remains one of our most compelling habitable-zone planets, and these new results take us a step closer to knowing what kind of world it is,” Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and coauthor of both studies, said in a statement. “The evidence pointing away from Venus- and Mars-like atmospheres sharpens our focus on the scenarios still in play.”
    


            Espinoza said that his team plans to finish the new round of 15 observations by the end of the year, with two-thirds already completed. If the team finds irrefutable signs of an atmosphere, even more Webb telescope observations could be warranted in the hopes of detecting specific chemical signatures of gases such as methane, which is associated with life on Earth.
    


            Confirmation of an atmosphere would be groundbreaking, Espinoza said. “It would settle a huge debate going on right now on whether these red dwarf systems can sustain an atmosphere or not,” he said. “Red dwarfs are actually the majority of the stars in the universe. So, if it can happen there, it can happen anywhere. The possibilities for life just kind of multiply.”
    


            However, even if an atmosphere was ruled out, the result would still be exciting, he said, because it would make life on Earth even more special. It would also set the stage for future research to look at exoplanets orbiting around yellow dwarf stars such as the sun, using telescopes even more powerful than Webb that are still in the planning stages.
    


            These first James Webb results for TRAPPIST-1e are immensely exciting, said Michaël Gillon, research director of the Astrobiology Research Unit at Belgium's University of Liège. Gillon, who led the original discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system, was not part of the recent study.
    


            “The data are not yet conclusive,” he added in an email, “but they prove that JWST has the power to detect an Earth-like atmosphere if it exists. For the first time in history, we are truly within reach of discovering an atmosphere around a potentially habitable rocky exoplanet.”
    


            The planets in TRAPPIST-1 have a range of conditions similar to the terrestrial planets in our solar system. These conditions make them potential hosts for surface liquid water, but they require an atmosphere to prevent the water from freezing on the surface or sublimating to space, said Eric Agol, a professor in the department of astronomy at the University of Washington. Agol was not involved with the study but is working on the new set of observations with Espinoza and his colleagues.
    


            TRAPPIST-1 e is the most promising of the seven planets for hosting an Earth-like atmosphere, according to Agol.
    


            “The results are interesting, but also incomplete,” he added in an email. “I am agnostic about whether TRAPPIST-1 e may have an Earth-like atmosphere or not, and the current study hasn't affected my opinion.”
    


            According to Howard Chen, an assistant professor of space sciences at the Florida Institute of Technology, TRAPPIST-1e sits right at a “tipping point” between opposite states, based on computer simulations that he detailed in a new study that published Wednesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Based on its history, the planet can emerge as either extremely dry or water-rich: “That means both ‘bare rock' and ‘atmosphere-bearing' scenarios remain physically plausible,” he added in an email. Chen was not involved with the new research.
    


            TRAPPIST-1e could have formed as a desert world, like its inner neighbors, or as a wet, ocean-covered planet, he concluded. “JWST's current data can't distinguish between those scenarios yet, but that ambiguity is exactly what our simulations predict,” Chen said. “The fact that TRAPPIST-1e can plausibly be either very dry or very wet means the next few JWST (observations) could deliver a dramatic reveal.”

            When Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr suggested Jimmy Kimmel should be suspended and said, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” ABC and its local affiliates were listening. Within a matter of hours, ABC suspended Kimmel's show “indefinitely,” a stunning move that has raised serious First Amendment concerns.
    


            “Trump officials are repeatedly abusing their power to stop ideas they don't like, deciding who can speak, write, and even joke,” the ACLU said in a statement. “The Trump administration's actions, paired with ABC's capitulation, represent a grave threat to our First Amendment freedoms.”
    


            While many free speech groups are saying that Carr's conduct ran afoul of the spirit of the First Amendment, Carr did not violate the letter of the law. That's because the First Amendment bars government action limiting free speech. And Carr didn't take any action — he merely, and perhaps ironically, spoke.
    


            The takeaway: President Trump and his lieutenants have a clear grasp on how to pressure companies to change their entertainment content and news coverage without taking action that would provoke a legal battle.
    


            Carr is a long-serving member of the FCC who has become an increasingly visible attack dog for the Trump administration this year. He is an attorney who joined the FCC as a staffer in 2012 and became a commissioner, appointed by Trump, in 2017. Upon Trump's reelection, the president-elect chose him to chair the regulatory agency. Carr has been a regular at Mar-a-Lago as well as Fox News, and earlier this year he showed his loyalty to Trump by wearing a gold lapel pin of the president's face.
    


            He rose to prominence in 2024 after he wrote the chapter on the FCC in the conservative blueprint known as Project 2025. In it, he railed against technology and media companies' “censorship” of right-wing content and values — and promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion programs. He wrote that among the agency's top priorities should be “reining in Big Tech.”
    


            He has promised to hold broadcast TV and radio stations accountable, and just one hour after thanking the president for his appointment, Carr wrote on X, “We must dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.”
    


            Since Trump's election, Carr has gone on the attack, threatening broadcasters with enforcement actions and investigations for perceived slights against Trump and the MAGA movement. He also has an active presence on social media, and is unafraid to make his rooting interests known: Carr initially reacted to the news of ABC's Kimmel show suspension with a celebratory dancing GIF from “The Office.” On Thursday morning, he wrote on X that he was “glad to see that many broadcasters are responding to their viewers as intended.”
    


            On Wednesday afternoon, Carr tapped into preexisting MAGA media anger about a Monday night Kimmel monologue and used a right-wing podcaster's platform to blast Kimmel and pressure ABC's parent company Disney.
    


            “This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney,” Carr said.
    


            He also pointed out that local station owners have a lot of power over ABC, since those owners choose whether to carry ABC's national programming. “It's time for them to step up,” Carr said.
    


            Two big station group owners, Nexstar and Sinclair, came out publicly and criticized Kimmel after Carr's interview garnered attention on social media sites. Both station groups told ABC they would preempt Kimmel's show, which likely led the network to pull the show nationwide.
    


            Crucially, both station groups also need the Trump administration's blessing as they remake their businesses in the streaming age.
    


            Local stations broadcast over the public airwaves, so the FCC is tasked with licensing TV and radio stations and ensuring that they're operating in the “public interest.”
    


            While license renewals can be a time-consuming process for stations every eight years, they're typically not an uphill battle; the FCC hasn't denied any license renewal in decades. “Decades of regulatory capture has made case law that strongly favors incumbent licensees,” public interest lawyer Andrew Jay Schwartzman told CNN last year.
    


            But Trump repeatedly threatened TV license holders while campaigning for reelection, and he has continued to do so from his Oval Office desk. Carr has followed the president's lead and opened multiple investigations into media companies that Trump dislikes.
    


            Some of Carr's predecessors, and the one remaining Democratic FCC commissioner, Anna Gomez, have spoken out against what they view as the weaponization of the FCC.
    


            Pro-Trump influencers, meantime, have egged Carr on. Podcaster Benny Johnson reshared his interview with Carr after ABC yanked “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” and Johnson wrote, “This is what got Kimmel fired. Right here.”
    


            Johnson continued, “It's called soft power. The Left uses it all the time. Thanks to President Trump, the Right has learned how to wield power as well.”
    


            In this case, the power was rhetorical.
    


            “This is what's known as jawboning — when state actors use threats to inappropriately compel private action,” The Free Press wrote in an editorial on Thursday.
    


            “When a network drops high-profile talent hours after the FCC chairman makes a barely veiled threat, then it's no longer just a business decision. It's government coercion,” the editors wrote.

“As with other illegal efforts by the government, this too will be challenged and overcome,” said one of his lawyers.

Mahmoud Khalil and his lawyers on Wednesday affirmed their plan to fight an immigration court ruling that paves the way for his deportation, months after plainclothes agents accosted the lawful permanent resident and his US citizen wife outside their home in New York City.

“It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” Khalil said in a statement.

“When their first effort to deport me was set to fail, they resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide,” he continued. “Such fascist tactics will never deter me from continuing to advocate for my people's liberation.”

While President Donald Trump has a broad goal of mass deportations, his administration has targeted Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student with a valid green card, and other foreign scholars in the United States for criticizing Israel's US-backed genocide in the Gaza Strip.

Federal agents arrested Khalil, an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent, in March. He wasn't released from a federal immigration facility until June. During his 104-day detention, his wife, Noor Abdalla, gave birth to their son. Over the past six months, he has been a part of multiple legal battles: his challenge to being deported in a Louisiana immigration court; a civil rights case before US District Judge Michael Farbiarz in New Jersey; and a fight for $20 million in damages.

In a Wednesday letter to Farbiarz — an appointee of former President Joe Biden who has already blocked his deportation while the civil rights case proceeds — Khalil's legal team explained that on September 12, Jamee Comans, an immigration judge (IJ), “issued three separate orders denying petitioner's (1) motion for an extension of time, (2) motion to change venue, and (3) application for a waiver, without conducting an evidentiary hearing.”

“In denying petitioner's request for a waiver absent a hearing, as well as his motions for extension of time and for change of venue, the IJ ordered petitioner removed to Algeria or Syria… while reaffirming her decisions denying petitioner any form of relief from removal,” the letter says. Khalil now has 30 days from September 12 to start an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).

Noting “statements targeting petitioner by name for retaliation and deportation made by the president and several senior US government officials,” Khalil's lawyers “have ample reason to expect that the BIA process — and an affirmance of the IJ's determination — will be swift,” the letter continued. “Upon affirmance by the BIA, petitioner will lose his lawful permanent resident status, including his right to reside and work in the United States, and have a final order of removal against him.”

“Compared to other courts of appeals, including those in the 3rd and 2nd Circuits, the 5th Circuit almost never grants stays of removal to noncitizens pursuing petitions for review of BIA decisions. As a result, the only meaningful impediment to petitioner's physical removal from the United States would be this court's important order prohibiting removal during the pendency of his federal habeas case,” the letter points out, referring to Farbiarz's previous intervention.

The courts are being weaponized to persecute Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., for exercising his 1st Amendment rights.Our taxpayers' dollars are paying for the erosion of our civil and Constitutional rights.Tell us again how the Trump Administration is… https://t.co/3FwGhpxv5S

Khalil is represented by Dratel & Lewis, the Center for Constitutional Rights, Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR), Van Der Hout LLP, Washington Square Legal Services, and the national, New Jersey, New York, and Louisiana arms of the ACLU.

“When the immigration prosecutor, judge, and jailer all answer to Donald Trump, and that one man is eager to weaponize the system in a desperate bid to silence Mahmoud Khalil, a US permanent resident whose only supposed sin is that he stands against an ongoing genocide in Palestine, this is the result,” CLEAR co-director Ramzi Kassem said Wednesday. “A plain-as-day First Amendment violation that also puts on sharp display the rapidly free-falling credibility of the entire US immigration system.”

In addition to calling out the Trump administration for its unconstitutional conduct, Khalil's lawyers expressed some optimism.

“We have witnessed a constant lack of humanity and allegiance to the law throughout proceedings in this farcical Louisiana immigration court, and the immigration judge's September 12 decision is just the most recent example of what occurs when the system requires an arbiter that is anything but neutral to do the administration's bidding,” said Johnny Sinodis, a partner at Van Der Hout LLP. “As with other illegal efforts by the government, this too will be challenged and overcome.”

            President Donald Trump took his effort to remove a governor from the Federal Reserve to the Supreme Court on Thursday, asking the justices to remove Lisa Cook from the powerful board a day after it cut interest rates for the first time in months.
    


            Trump's emergency appeal put the issue of Fed independence – a question of monumental significance for the US economy – onto the court's docket months after the justices appeared to carve out special protections for the agency. On the other hand, Trump's effort to remove Cook involves new legal theories that may find purchase on the 6-3 conservative court.
    


            If Trump is successful in dismissing Cook, it would mark the first time a Fed governor was fired by a president in the central bank's 111-year history.
    


            The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for the first time since December and signaled more cuts are likely this year. Trump has sharply criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for keeping rates high, and critics have suggested the administration's real goal in targeting Cook has been to pressure the agency to act.
    


            “That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,” the administration said in its emergency appeal.

            “Put simply, the president may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself – and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.”
    


            Trump fired Cook on August 25 after a member of his administration alleged that she had committed mortgage fraud by reporting two different homes as her primary residence – a practice that can yield better loan terms. Other documents have subsequently revealed that Cook sometimes declared the second property as a “vacation home.”
    


            A federal court on September 10 blocked Cook's dismissal, asserting that Trump had not “identified anything related to Cook's conduct or job performance as a board member that would indicate that she is harming the board or the public interest.” That ruling was handed down by US District Judge Jia Cobb, nominated to the bench by former President Joe Biden.
    


            The Trump administration quickly appealed to the DC Circuit, which on Monday declined to put Cobb's ruling on hold.
    


            “Given that Cook has a property interest in her position, she is entitled to ‘some kind' of process before removal,” two of the appeals court judges reviewing that case wrote in a concurring opinion Monday. “Before this court, the government does not dispute that it provided Cook no meaningful notice or opportunity to respond to the allegations against her.”
    


            US Circuit Judges Bradley Garcia and J. Michelle Childs, both Biden nominees, sided with Cook.
    


            But US Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas, a Trump nominee, dissented.
    


            “The president plainly invoked a cause relating to Cook's conduct, ability, fitness, or competence,” Katsas wrote. “The allegations against Cook could constitute mortgage fraud if she acted knowingly, and that is a felony offense.”
    


            In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court on Thursday, the Trump administration described that decision as “yet another case of improper judicial interference with the president's removal authority. The administration also asked Chief Justice John Roberts for an immediate, short-term “administrative” order that would take Cook off the board while the case is pending at the high court.
    


            And the administration brushed aside arguments that Cook was entitled to some sort of process to refute the allegations before she was dismissed.
    


            “The lower courts' primary theory is that principal officers are akin to teachers or lower-level civil servants and can thus claim a property interest and an entitlement to notice and a hearing before removal,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court. “This theory is untenable and would wreak havoc on sensitive presidential decision-making.”
    


            On the one hand, Trump has on his side a string of emergency victories at the Supreme Court, in which the justices have allowed the president to remove the leaders of independent federal agencies at will. But on the other, the court took pains to carve out the Fed from those cases, asserting it had a unique history that underscored the importance of its independence.
    


            But the Cook appeal involves a separate legal question: Who gets to define “cause.” Trump has claimed that Cook's dismissal was based on the allegations, which he says count as “cause” to justify the firing. The administration has pointed to a 1901 precedent from the Supreme Court to argue that courts should give the executive wide deference to define cause for removal purposes.
    


            Just before the Fed's meeting this week, Trump appointee Stephen Miran, a White House economic adviser, was sworn in as a new governor. Asked about Miran's arrival – specifically whether his arrangement of serving as a Fed governor while remaining a White House employee – means anything for Fed independence, Powell said that the agency is “strongly committed to maintaining our independence.”
    


            “And beyond that,” he said, “I really don't have anything to share.”
    


            As in past years, the Supreme Court's work is increasingly becoming intertwined with Trump. The court separately agreed to hear arguments in a major case involving the president's use of sweeping global tariffs.
    


            The parties in that case sought an expedited review and, earlier Thursday, the Supreme Court set arguments for November 5 – setting up a significant showdown over the centerpiece of the administration's economic agenda.

Greg Abbott's latest move fuels clash between US red states and blue-state shield laws protecting abortion care

Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, on Wednesday signed into law a bill that lets people sue anyone suspected of manufacturing, distributing or mailing abortion pills to or from Texas. The first-of-its-kind law is almost certain to dramatically escalate the state-by-state showdown over abortion laws in the post Roe v Wade United States – especially as some out-of-state abortion providers have already vowed that they will continue shipping pills to Texans.

“Our mantra as a practice is: ‘No anticipatory obedience',” said Dr Angel Foster, co-founder of the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project (Map), a Boston-area based group that uses telemedicine to ship abortion pills to patients across the United States. “We will continue to provide care until we are legally unable to do so in Massachusetts.”

Under the new law, which will take effect 4 December, abortion providers could face penalties of at least $100,000 if they mail pills into the state, which bans virtually all abortions. Pharmaceutical manufacturers who make drugs that Texans use for abortions could also be found liable, but they may be able to defend themselves by proving in court that they adopted and implemented “a policy to not distribute, mail, transport, deliver, provide, or possess abortion-inducing drugs” – though the language of the law is somewhat ambiguous on whether that provision applies to Texas or more broadly. Women who take abortion pills are not eligible to be sued.

“We want to create liability for manufacturers that Aid Access is using,” said John Seago, president of Texas Right to Life and a chief backer of the new legislation, in an interview before the bill's passage. Aid Access is one of the biggest telemedicine abortion services in the US. It shipped almost 120,000 packs of abortion pills to US residents between 2023 and 2024.

Seago continued: “The best we can do at this point is create a higher liability and start trying to deter some of those individuals.”

The law represents the cutting edge of the anti-abortion movement's campaign against abortion pills and telehealth, which have become increasingly popular in the years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. By the end of 2024, one in four US abortions were being facilitated through telemedicine, according to #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning. #WeCount found that, in December 2024, nearly 4,000 Texans used telehealth to end their pregnancies.

Providers like the Map mail pills under legal innovations known as “shield laws”, which have been enacted by a handful of blue states and aim to protect abortion providers from out-of-state prosecutions when they send pills into states with bans. However, shield laws have yet to be seriously tested in court.

Rachel Rebouché, professor at the University of Texas, Austin School of Law who studies shield laws, said Texas's new law is the first legislative challenge to shield laws. But the state has already challenged them in other ways. The Texas attorney general, Republican Ken Paxton, has sent cease-and-desist letters to abortion pill providers and a website that provides information about abortion pills. He has also sued a New York doctor accused of mailing abortion pills to a Texan, as well as a New York court official who said New York's shield law prevented him from enforcing a Texas fine against the doctor. New York's attorney general, Letitia James, has declared that she will intervene in that lawsuit.

Many post-Roe abortion pill providers, Rebouché pointed out, have already accepted that their work involves a great deal of risk. “But it might chill, it might hamper or dissuade people who don't want to be implicated, who don't want to face the risk of liability.”

Her Safe Harbor, an organization that uses shield laws to mail abortion pills to people and received one of Paxton's cease-and-desist letters, has no plans to block Texans from its services, said Debra Lynch, a nurse practitioner who works with the group, in an interview before Abbott signed the law. In fact, as the Texas law neared passage in the state legislature, Her Safe Harbor started receiving so many requests for help from patients that it had to double its number of abortion providers, according to Lynch.

“Even if a law was passed that said they would come after us criminally and not civilly – that would not have any impact whatsoever on the services that we provide,” Lynch said. “It's important that women know that.”

Gold continues to be supported by both fundamental and technical factors. We've written previously on why we're so bullish on the commodity, and today it's time for even more reasons it deserves a prominent place in portfolios. 

Gold has a 60% positive correlation to the general level of economic uncertainty, which has definitely come off the boil, but is still twice the long-run average. Concerns over monetary policy and political influence have taken center stage after the Big Beautiful Bill in the U.S. got passed, and the tariff file became less onerous than feared in April. Fed policy uncertainty is close to 3 times higher than normal levels, and this is not going away any time soon.

Gold also has a huge historical 85% inverse correlation (although it may be lower now) to real interest rates and the U.S. dollar. Both are on downslopes. Real 10-year yields have come down 60 basis points from the nearby peak to 1.8%, but are still some 90 basis points above the long-run mean. While the ECB and BoE may be done cutting, the Fed is just starting to rekindle the rate-cutting cycle. Same for the Bank of Canada. 

As for the DXY dollar index, it is already down well over 10% from the earlier highs, and if it breaks below 95 (currently around 97), then we will see a cyclical bear market in the U.S. dollar index morph into something more secular in nature.

Commodities could be on the verge of a new super cycle

The supply-demand fundamentals for gold are very bullish to this day. Mined production growth is growing at 1.5% at an annual rate, but demand in aggregate is running north of 3.0% and from a variety of sources.

One of the critical sources of demand is the deep pockets of world central banks, which are no longer confined to the BRICS. We are seeing a classic mean-reversion trade here. In the 1980s and 1990s, when central banks were winding down their bullion reserves in favour of interest-bearing securities, sales of gold brought its price down by 50% and into a fundamental bear market that ended in 1999 with the Washington Agreement. And that coincided with the secular low of US$250 per ounce at that point.

But that is now reversing course. Back in 1980, the FX reserve share of gold in central bank vaults stood at 70%; by the late 1990s, down to 10%; and today, it is just over 20%. If this share mean-reverts to 30%, we are talking about gold going to US$4,500 per ounce on that sustained fund-flow support; and to over US$6,000 if we ever do go back to that 70% share that pre-dated the strategy to dump gold in the early 1980s. Keep in mind that global central banks still have a lot of work to do — a classic case in point is the U.K., which cut its gold reserves by half in the 1980s and 1990s, and Canada, where the central bank wound down its exposure to zero (talk about terrible timing).

Gold remains under-owned and underrepresented to this day, even amidst this raging bull market. From the research we have gleaned, just 1% of global assets are in bullion, and that is down from 26% in the early 1980s — the last time gold was where it is today adjusted for inflation.

The technical picture also looks very strong. Mapping out the 1971-1980 cycle and the current one since 1999, for the two legs to match on scale, we would need to see a peak of over US$6,000 this cycle. I don't know the timing of the peak, but I know what the path to the peak looks like. Treat any corrections along the way (and they have been brief affairs) as buying opportunities in a secular uptrend.

In fact, that is a story in its own right. All gold has done is go back to around where it was 45 years ago in real terms. The S&P 500 on this basis has shot up over 13x by way of comparison.

We get asked all the time about comparing gold to Bitcoin. The problem is that gold is a classic “risk-off” asset, and Bitcoin is a “risk-on” asset that is more correlated with the Nasdaq 100 than anything else. It has three ties to gold's volatility: the major point being that gold is a ballast and diversifier in the portfolio. Unlike Bitcoin, gold is a hedge against risk, while Bitcoin and crypto in general possess far riskier characteristics. There is something else to consider, which is that the first Bitcoin was mined 16 years ago, so it has barely made it through one full cycle. The earliest archaeological evidence of gold mining production goes back as far as 6,000 years. You be the judge as to which of these has withstood the test of time.

Meanwhile, the case for the gold miners is compelling. 

In Canada (the world's fourth largest producer), the sector has contributed 7.5 points to the TSX's +18.5% YTD gain

The all-in production cost for the lowest-cost producers is US$1,500 per ounce and US$1,900 per ounce for the highest cost companies. Margins are fat, and 2026 free cash-flow yields are running at 10.0%.

The forward P/E multiple is at 16x, which is a nice discount to the overall market. Expected EPS growth is so huge that the sector trades at a 0.3x PEG ratio — compared to a near-2.0x ratio for the overall S&P 500 and TSX composite.

Not just that, but the Canadian gold mining group, even at current record levels, is still trading at a 40% historical discount to the underlying price of the commodity. In the U.S., we are talking about more than a full standard deviation when it comes to the gap between valuations in the S&P 500 gold equity group and the spot gold price.

Closing these gaps would require a doubling in the North American gold miners, even assuming no more price appreciation for bullion.

I know that I haven't mentioned silver — “poor man's gold.” We love gold, but we like silver. For the miners, margins are 3x fatter for the gold sector. And while the gold/silver price ratio did hit an extreme last April, half of that gap has been resolved. That said, we own both in our Rosie Macro Fund, and between the metals and the equities, they comprise just over 20% of the total assets in the model portfolio.

The last thing that we would like to highlight is that gold has registered new highs in terms of every major currency. So while the depreciating U.S. dollar continues to act as a catalyst, you know that gold is in a bona fide secular bull market when it is breaking out to fresh records across all exchange rates.

Ukrainian forces have liberated 160 square kilometers (60 square miles) of territory during an ongoing "counteroffensive operation" in eastern Donetsk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 18.

Ukrainian forces have spent the past month pushing Russian troops back after they advanced 15-20 kilometers (6 miles) toward the strategic Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway, near the embattled city of Pokrovsk. Since late August, Ukrainian units have regained control of multiple villages in the area.

Seven settlements have been retaken in the Dobropillia and Pokrovsk sectors during the operation, Zelensky said, citing a report from Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi.

Ukrainian troops have also captured nearly 100 Russian soldiers, according to the president.

"Ukraine is rightfully defending its positions and its land," Zelensky said. "We are disrupting all of Russia's plans — plans to destroy our state."

Zelensky said an additional 170 kilometers (106 miles) of Ukrainian territory "have been cleared of Russian forces." However, the president did not provide further details about the condition or strategic status of the areas.

"Russian losses since the start of our counteroffensive just in the Pokrovsk direction, over the past few weeks, exceed 2,500. Of those, over 1,300 Russian soldiers have been killed, "Zelensky said, adding that Ukraine's counteroffensive operations in Donetsk Oblast are ongoing.

Zelensky also renewed his call for continued military aid from international partners and urged the tightening of sanctions to pressure Russia into peace negotiations.

The statement comes amid more frequent counterattacks by the Ukrainian side, which has been in a strategic defensive posture along the front line in eastern Ukraine for nearly two years.

Ukrainian forces liberated the village of Zarichne in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 8. The operation was carried out by soldiers of the 425th Assault Regiment, better known as Skelia.

Earlier this month, the same unit reported clearing Novoekonomichne and Udachne, two villages in the area of the embattled city Pokrovsk.

Russia, however, pursued offensive operations at a high intensity across the front line over summer. According to the Ukrainian mapping and monitoring group Deep State, Russian forces occupied 1,548 square kilometers over summer, significantly more than the 659 square kilometres taken in the equivalent period in 2024.

Zelensky warned on Sept. 16 that Russia is preparing two major offensive operations for the fall. Yet, sustained losses in personnel and equipment may hinder Moscow's ability to carry them out, the president added.

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - September 18, 2025) - World Copper Ltd. (TSXV: WCU) (OTCQB: WCUFF) (FSE: 7LY0) ("World Copper" or the "Company") is pleased to provide an update on the recently announced definitive arrangement agreement (the "Arrangement Agreement") entered into between Plata Latina Minerals Corporation ("Plata Latina") and World Copper on July 22, 2025 for the sale of the Zonia copper project (the "Zonia Project") to Plata Latina by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement (the "Arrangement") announced on July 23, 2025 (see news release).

Transaction Recap

Transaction Update & Next Steps

World Copper is pleased to announce that it has obtained an interim order (the "Interim Order") of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in connection with the Arrangement, which is to be completed by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The Interim Order provides for the holding of a special meeting (the "Meeting") of World Copper shareholders to consider and vote on a special resolution approving the Arrangement (the "Arrangement Resolution"). The Meeting is scheduled to be held at World Copper's offices located at 1570 - 200 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on October 16, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. (Vancouver time) and the record date for determining World Copper shareholders entitled to receive notice of and vote at the Meeting was fixed as at the close of business on August 26, 2025. All of World Copper's insiders and certain other World Copper shareholders representing approximately 29% of the issued and outstanding World Copper shares have entered into voting and support agreements to support the Arrangement.

Meeting Materials

In connection with the Meeting, World Copper will be mailing the joint management information circular of Plata Latina and World Copper (the "Circular"), letter of transmittal and related meeting materials (collectively, the "Meeting Materials") to World Copper shareholders. Shareholders are urged to carefully review all Meeting Materials as they contain important information concerning the Arrangement and the rights and entitlements of the shareholders in relation thereto. The Meeting Materials will also be available under World Copper's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca once they have been sent to shareholders in the coming days.

Investors are cautioned that, except as disclosed in the Circular prepared in connection with the Arrangement, any information released or received with respect to the Arrangement may not be accurate or complete and should not be relied upon.

Timing to Closing

Subject to obtaining the final order of the Court approving the Arrangement, the required approvals from World Copper's shareholders at the Meeting, the required approvals from Plata Latina shareholders at the special meeting of Plata Latina shareholders, required regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction of all other conditions to implementing the Arrangement as set out in the Arrangement Agreement, the Arrangement is anticipated to be completed in October 2025.

Gordon Neal, World Copper CEO, stated: "In a market where a copper deficit has been creating rising copper prices, the Zonia Project was a primary asset to be put back into production in the Unites States. We had many offers for strategic partnerships to develop the Zonia Project, but we believe that the Plata Latina team will bring the best value to World Copper shareholders. World Copper shareholders will benefit from holding both Plata Latina and World Copper shares upon completion of the Arrangement. I want to thank shareholders for their patience as we navigate through this process and work on the next steps to deliver value."

Termination of At-The-Market Equity Program

World Copper also announces the termination of its at-the-market equity program (the "ATM Program"), previously announced in the Company's news release dated July 18, 2024. The ATM Program previously allowed World Copper to issue and sell common shares from treasury having an aggregate gross sales amount of up to $25,000,000 through BMO Capital Markets, acting as sole agent. The ATM Program was originally implemented to raise funds for advancing the Zonia Project and for general working capital purposes. The decision to terminate the ATM Program was made in anticipation of the sale of the Zonia Project to Plata Latina pursuant to the Arrangement. As of the termination date, the ATM Program generated aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $3,501,949.

BRUSSELS, September 18. /TASS/. The Chinese port of Ningbo is preparing to launch a cargo ship that will test a new shipping route via the Northern Sea Route (NSR), Politico wrote.

The vessel's departure is scheduled for September 20. Although Chinese companies have previously conducted trial shipments via the NSR, the upcoming route will be more challenging. "They did point-to-point trips, like from one Chinese port to Hamburg or to St. Petersburg," Malte Humpert, senior fellow and founder of the Arctic Institute, a Washington-based think tank that studies Arctic security, told Politico. "This voyage is different. They're trying four ports in China, then through the Arctic, then the UK, Rotterdam, Hamburg and Gdansk. That actually resembles a normal shipping route," he said.

Ten years ago, everyone thought that before 2040 or 2050, container shipping in the Arctic would hardly be possible, the expert noted. "And here we are in 2025, and the Chinese are doing it. Do they make money? It doesn't really matter <...> it's about gaining the knowledge, understanding how to do it. That's what the Chinese are doing - they're gaining the experience and training the shipping crews," he said.

The development of the Northern Sea Route became possible due to climate change as changes occur more rapidly in the Arctic region than in other parts of the planet, Humpert said. However, he believes that most global trade will continue to flow through the traditional route via the Suez Canal.

"If you play this 30 or 40 years into the future, and the ice melts another 30, 40, 50%, suddenly you have six months of no ice [in the waters of the NSR], and the Arctic becomes a very interesting equation. <…> The Arctic is not going to replace the Suez Canal tomorrow. That's not what's happening. The Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, they will remain there. But the Arctic will become supplemental," the expert concluded.

Critics condemn reopening of ‘Camp J' unit at Angola in service of Trump's nationwide immigration crackdown, noting its history of brutality and violence

There were no hurricanes in the Gulf, as can be typical for Louisiana in late July – but Governor Jeff Landry quietly declared a state of emergency. The Louisiana state penitentiary at Angola – the largest maximum security prison in the country – was out of bed space for “violent offenders” who would be “transferred to its facilities”, he warned in an executive order.

The emergency declaration allowed for the rapid refurbishing of a notorious, shuttered housing unit at Angola formerly known as Camp J – commonly referred to by prisoners as “the dungeon” because it was once used to house men in extended solitary confinement, sometimes for years on end.

For over a month, the Landry administration was tight-lipped regarding the details of their plan for Camp J, and the emergency order wasn't picked up by the news media for several days.

But the general understanding among Louisiana's criminal justice observers was that the move was in response to a predictable overcrowding in state prisons due to Landry's own “tough-on-crime” policies. Though Louisiana already had the highest incarceration rate in the country before he got into office, Landry has pushed legislation to increase sentences, abolish parole, and put 17-year-olds in adult prisons.

Advocates swiftly objected to the reopening of Camp J, noting its history of brutality and violence. Ronald Marshall served 25 years in the Louisiana prison system, including a number of them in solitary confinement at Camp J, and called it the worst place he ever served time.

“It was horrible,” Marshall said.

It turns out, however, that Landry's emergency order and the renovation of Camp J was not done to accommodate the state's own growing prison population. It was in service of Donald Trump's nationwide immigration crackdown.

Earlier in September, Landry was joined by officials in the president's administration in front of the renovated facility to announce that it would be used to house the “worst of the worst” immigrant detainees picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents.

“The Democrats' open border policies have allowed for the illegal entry of violent criminals,” Landry said. “Rapists, child-predators, human traffickers, and drug dealers who have left a path of death and destruction throughout America.”

Numerous studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit serious crimes at lower rates than US citizens – and that increased undocumented immigration does not lead to higher crime rates in specific localities.

The rollout highlights the way the Trump administration and conservative officials are seeking to blur the legally clear distinction between civil immigration detainees and people serving sentences in prison for criminal convictions – this time by utilizing a prison with a long history of violence and brutality, along with a fundamentally racist past.

The Angola facility – which Trump's White House dubbed the “Louisiana lockup” – follows the opening of other high-profile facilities with alliterative names by states across the country, including in Florida, Nebraska and Indiana. It will have the capacity to house more than 400 detainees, officials said.

Recently, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a list of 51 detainees they said were already being held at the Angola facility and who allegedly have prior criminal convictions for serious charges. But while the Trump administration similarly claimed that the Florida lockup dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” would house only the worst criminal offenders, a report by the Miami Herald found that hundreds of people sent there had no criminal charges at all.

Ice has long utilized former jails and prisons as detention facilities. But there are few prisons in the country with the name recognition of Angola. And the decision to use Angola appears to be as much about trading on the prison's reputation as it does about security or practicality.

At a 3 September news conference, DHS secretary Kristi Noem called the prison “legendary” and “notorious”.

Once a plantation with enslaved people, the rural prison occupies nearly 30 sq miles of land on the banks of the Mississippi river about an hour drive north of Baton Rouge, Louisiana's capital. Throughout the 20th century, it gained a reputation as one of the country's worst prisons – due to the living and working conditions, abuse by guards and endemic violence.

In 1951, dozens of prisoners slashed their achilles tendons to protest brutality at the facility.

Medical and mental healthcare at the prison has likewise been abysmal. As recently as 2023, a federal judge found that the deficiencies in treatment at the facility amounted to “abhorrent” cruel and unusual punishment, resulting in untold numbers of avoidable complications and preventable deaths.

The prison has also maintained clear visual ties to its plantation past by continuing to operate as a working farm, where mostly Black prisoners pick crops under the watch of primarily white guards. Today, there is ongoing litigation attempting to end the practice of forced agricultural labor at the prison, which is known as the “farm line” and is required of most prisoners at some point during their sentences. Some prisoners can make as little as two cents an hour for their labor, and some are paid nothing at all.

Civil rights attorneys have argued that the farm line serves “no legitimate penological or institutional purpose” and instead is “designed to ‘break' incarcerated men and ensure their submission”.

Nora Ahmed, legal director at the ACLU of Louisiana, said that the Angola immigration detention facility seemed like a clear attempt by the Trump administration to use the prison's name recognition to further their goal of associating undocumented immigrants with criminals.

“Angola's history as a plantation and the abuse and allegations that have surrounded Angola as an institution is meant to strike fear in the American public,” Ahmed said. “It's the imagery that is deeply problematic.”

The Angola facility is also in some ways the natural result of aligning local, state and national trends and policies related to incarceration, immigrant detention and deportations.

Louisiana has become a nationwide hub for immigrant detention and deportations. Sheriffs across the state have signed contracts with Ice in recent years to let them use their local jails as detention facilities. And Louisiana now has the second largest population of immigrant detainees in the country – after Texas. A small airport in Alexandria, Louisiana, has been the takeoff location for more deportation flights during Trump's second presidency than anywhere else.

It's also not the first time the state has utilized Angola for something other than housing state prisoners.

In 2022, Louisiana's office of juvenile justice moved dozens of juvenile detainees to a renovated former death row facility on the grounds of Angola, a move that was met with litigation and outcry from youth advocates. While state officials made assurances that they would be kept separated from the adult population, youths at the facility reported being abused by guards, denied education and kept in their cells for long stretches of time.

Eventually, a judge ruled that they would need to be moved, calling the conditions “intolerable”.

Louisiana also briefly utilized Camp J in 2020 to house incarcerated pretrial detainees from local jails around the state who had contracted Covid-19.

Pictures and videos from the new immigration facility during a tour given to reporters show that while the facility may have been renovated, it still looks decidedly prison-like. Cells have single-beds cells with metal toilets and bars in the front. There are also a number of outdoor metal chain-link cages at the facility, resembling kennels. It is unclear what they will be used for.

A DHS spokesperson did not respond to specific questions from the Guardian but instead forwarded the press release with the criminal histories of some of the detainees currently being held at the facility. The Louisiana department of corrections did not respond to emailed questions.

The former Camp J is now emblazoned with “Camp 57” – after the fact that Landry is Louisiana's 57th governor. Photos captured by Louisiana news station WAFB showed the area had been painted with a sign reading “Camp 47” in a nod to Trump, who was sworn into office in January as the 47th US president. But officials evidently changed their minds about that name and then touted it as Camp 57 when it was unveiled.

Marshall, now the chief policy analyst for the advocacy organization Voice of the Experienced, said much of what made Camp J so bad were guards that staffed the facility, who promoted a culture of abuse, violence and desperation. But he said that he had little optimism that the conditions would improve under Ice leadership.

“Camp J has that reputation,” he said. “It has a spirit there – like it possesses those who are in control or have authority.”

Marshall also said that when he was in Camp J there was a sense that prisoners could at least attempt to appeal to the federal government to get relief from the brutal conditions. Now, that's no longer the case. “You can't cry out to the federal government for help, because the federal government is actually creating the circumstances,” Marshall said.

The problem with conflating civil immigration detention with prison is not only that it sends a message to the public that undocumented individuals are all criminals, Ahmed said – but also that they are entitled to all the legal rights that people being held in the criminal context are entitled to.

“By attaching criminality to people in immigration detention, the suggestion to the American public is also that those individuals have a [constitutional] right to counsel,” she said. “Which they do not. This is civil detention, and people are not entitled to have an attorney to vindicate their rights.”

There are still unanswered questions about the facility – including who paid for the renovations, whether or not it is being managed by a private prison contractor, or what the conditions are like for detainees. But in these early stages, the Trump administration is already touting the facility as a national model.

“Look behind us, Louisiana,” US attorney general Pam Bondi said at the press conference in front of the new facility. “You're going to be an example for the rest of this country.”

Israeli tanks were seen in two Gaza City areas that are gateways to the city centre, residents said on Thursday, while internet and phone lines were cut off across the Gaza Strip, a sign that ground operations were likely to escalate imminently. 

Israeli forces control Gaza City's eastern suburbs and in recent days have been pounding the Sheikh Radwan and Tel Al-Hawa areas, from where they would be positioned to advance on central and western areas where most of the population is sheltering.

“We are scared, but what can we do?” said Bassam Al-Qanou, a displaced man sheltering with around 30 family members in one of countless ragged improvised tent camps along the city's beach.

He said the family had no way to get out, and nowhere to go.

At least 85 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes or gunfire across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, most in Gaza City, according to the territory's Health Ministry.

The Israeli military said four of its personnel had been killed during combat in southern Gaza.

In separate developments, Israel attacked Hezbollah military targets in southern Lebanon, while two Israelis were killed at Allenby Crossing between the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Jordan, in what the Israeli military called a “terror attack.”

Israeli army spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said troops had been operating in the city's periphery for several weeks but since the night of Monday to Tuesday large numbers of troops had begun moving toward the inner city.

Israel's ground offensive in Gaza City has begun. Here are the latest updates on the war

He said a combination of infantry, tanks and artillery was advancing, backed up by the air force, and that it was a gradual process that would increase as time went on.

“The strategy right now is to defeat Hamas and apply pressure on Hamas, which can lead to a deal or can lead to rescue missions [to free hostages],” Shoshani told Reuters on the Israeli side of the border with Gaza.

A total of 48 hostages captured during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, remain in Gaza and Israeli officials believe around 20 are still alive.

Hostage families have been imploring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop the offensive on Gaza and instead negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas to free their loved ones, but Netanyahu says military victory will bring them home.

The armed wing of Hamas said on Thursday the hostages were distributed throughout the neighbourhoods of Gaza City.

“The start of this criminal operation and its expansion means you will not receive any captive, alive or dead,” it said in a written statement.

The Palestinian Telecommunications Company said in a statement that its services had been cut off “due to the ongoing aggression and the targeting of the main network routes.”

“The disconnection of internet and phone services is a bad omen. It has always been a bad signal something very brutal is going to happen,” said Ismail, who only gave one name. He was using an e-SIM to connect his phone, a dangerous method as it requires seeking higher ground to receive a signal.

As Israeli ground invasion begins, Palestinians in Gaza City say they're trapped or fleeing on unsafe roads

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled Gaza City since Israel announced on Aug. 10 it intended to take control, but a greater number are staying put, either in battered homes among the ruins or in makeshift tent encampments.

The military has been dropping leaflets urging residents to flee towards a designated “humanitarian zone” in the south of the territory, but aid agencies say conditions there are dire, with insufficient food, medicine, space and inadequate shelter.

Four more Palestinians, including a child, have died of malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours, the Health Ministry said, raising deaths from such causes to at least 435 people, including 147 children, since the war started.

The Abu Jarad family has been forced to uproot and move across Gaza 11 times since war broke out nearly two years ago.

The Associated Press

Israel says the extent of hunger in Gaza has been exaggerated and blames Hamas for the continuation of the war, saying it could end it now if it surrendered, freed the hostages, disarmed and disbanded. Hamas says it won't disarm until a Palestinian state is established.

Along the coastal road, an unbroken column of every type of vehicle from carts and beaten-up cars to vans designed to carry goods was moving south, heavily laden with mattresses, gas cylinders and entire families perching on their belongings.

“We are heading to go sleep on the streets towards the beach, like this barefoot, we don't know where to go,” said Yasser Saleh, speaking as he stood on the edge of a rickety trailer being pulled by a car.

The total Palestinian death toll from the two-year war surpassed 65,000 on Wednesday, according to the Gaza health authorities.

The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

Eighteen Russian staff officers of the 35th Combined Arms Army were killed in a sabotage attack in the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast in late August, the Ukrainian project "I Want to Live" reported on Sept. 18.

According to the statement, unknown individuals set fire to dry grass near the army's command post not far from the village of Voskresenka on Aug. 30. The fire reportedly quickly spread to buildings and dugouts at the site.

"Due to heavy smoke and the command post filling with carbon monoxide, the headquarters personnel were unable to escape," the statement read.

The Ukrainian state-run project published a list of Russian soldiers allegedly killed in the fire.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Russia rarely discloses its military losses publicly.

Ukrainian forces and pro-Ukrainian partisan groups have repeatedly targeted Russian soldiers and military infrastructure on occupied territories or inside Russia. 

Earlier this week, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) claimed it had carried out explosions in Russia's Vladivostok as a "revenge operation" targeting troops accused of war crimes.

In Tales from the Golden Age, retirees talk about their spending, savings and whether life after work is what they expected. For more articles in this series, click here.

Roger Jackson, 65, Sudbury, Ont.

I retired in April, 2024, at the age of 63, after working for 42 years as a geologist, first in the oil exploration industry and then in the mining industry. After leaving my job at a major mining company in April, 2022, I planned to do some part-time consulting work for five years, but then decided to retire after just two years for a few reasons. 

Over the past few years, I'd spoken to family and friends who had unfortunately become terminally ill and, in their final days, they all said roughly the same thing: In retrospect, it didn't matter how big their house was or how many horsepower their pickup truck had. They said, if they could go back in time, they would've spent more of their time travelling the world, more time with their kids, and they would have laughed more – even at work. I said to myself, ‘That's going to be me.'

Also, I'm divorced and have a son with Down Syndrome, now in his mid-30s, and I wanted us to spend even more time together travelling while we both can. I have the time, the money and no restrictions. Leading up to, and since retirement, my son has kissed the Blarney Stone in Ireland, ridden a camel in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco and climbed the Great Wall of China, to name just a few experiences. He also loves karaoke and has sung in 30 countries (so far). We're fulfilling my dreams and his interests, and he has experienced more world-class adventures than any other adult I know.

In early 2011, I had the opportunity to convert my defined-benefit pension from a previous employer into a defined-contribution pension. I allocated the majority of those assets to U.S. equities, specifically tracking the S&P 500, which has performed exceptionally well. I'm comfortable as a do-it-yourself investor; however, I do periodic reviews with the retirement specialist at my local bank, who provides a ‘sanity check' of my financial activities and planning. 

I've decided to delay receiving my Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security benefits until age 70, at which time the benefit payments will have grown significantly. I treat these as reserve funds that can be sourced sooner if something drastic were to happen.

When not travelling, I swim once or twice a day and go to the gym. Sudbury is a regional hub for geology and engineering associations and businesses, and there are numerous scientific and mining industry events to keep my gray matter spinning.

What I love most about retirement is that I'm in control of my life, which is headed in exactly the direction I had envisioned for decades. 

My advice for others approaching retirement is to explore the world. Don't just dream about what's out there, go and experience first-hand the prehistoric, historic and cultural sites. Also, stay physically and mentally fit and maintain and expand your social networks. Get off the couch and get out there!

King Charles III voiced support for Ukraine during a state dinner with U.S. President Donald Trump in Windsor on Sept. 17.

"Today, as tyranny once again threatens Europe, we and our allies stand together in support of Ukraine, to deter aggression and secure peace," the king said. 

Trump was seen nodding during King Charles's speech, without commenting on it afterward.

The king's remarks come amid Trump's efforts to bring an end to Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, even as Moscow continues to reject a ceasefire, regularly launches attacks on Ukraine, and recently said talks with Kyiv are on "pause."

Despite this, Trump has not imposed additional sanctions on Russia. Before his second state visit to the U.K., the U.S. president reiterated that President Volodymyr Zelensky "is going to have to make a deal" with Russia. 

After his meeting with the royal family, Trump is scheduled to meet with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is also involved in peace efforts.

Members of the royal family have consistently expressed their support for Ukraine throughout the Russian war, a stance some experts view as a form of soft power.

Zelensky met with King Charles several times, including following a White House clash with Trump earlier this year.

The House of Representatives on Sept. 17 rejected a bid to censure Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) for comments she made about conservative influencer Charlie Kirk following his assassination.

The censure motion, brought by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), would have also stripped Omar of her assignments on the Education and the Workforce Committee and the Budget Committee.

 The Group Is Rebuilding in Syria—Just as U.S. Forces Prepare to Leave

 Caroline Rose and Colin P. Clarke

Nine months after the longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad was toppled by a rebel offensive, Syria faces a litany of new challenges. The country, which is now being led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), is contending with recurring violent sectarian clashes, successive Israeli strikes into Syrian territory, and internal disputes within the new government. Adding to the tumult is a resurgence of one of Syria's most enduring challenges: the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.Since the Assad regime was toppled in 2024, ISIS has waged a terror campaign throughout Syria, targeting the new Syrian government, as well as Christian, Shiite, and Kurdish minorities. At its apogee, in 2014, ISIS held roughly a third of the country. Although the group no longer controls any territory in Syria, and its numbers have dwindled from roughly 100,000 fighters to 2,500 fighters today, the group is taking advantage of Syria's post-Assad chaos to rebuild and reconstitute, presenting fresh obstacles to the country's long-sought stability.The group's targeting capabilities are proving more frequent, precise, and sophisticated than ever, targeting sites well beyond ISIS's traditional spheres of operation. In June, for example, a suicide bomber linked to ISIS attacked a Greek Orthodox church in Damascus, killing 25 and injuring 63. Two months later, the group launched more than two dozen attacks across northeastern Syria, relying on a combination of guerrilla tactics, including small arms fire, ambushes, assassinations, and improvised explosive devices targeting military checkpoints and government vehicles. Last year, ISIS took responsibility for 294 attacks in Syria, up from 121 in 2023; estimates by the United Nations and human rights groups are even higher. Such attacks pose a blatant challenge to the new administration's attempts to stabilize the country. Syria's already fragile security situation is characterized by frequent clashes between Sunni, Alawite, and Druze communities. As the frequency of terrorist attacks increases, the new Syrian government risks squandering its political legitimacy by failing to protect the country's minorities. The Syrian population, meanwhile, faces a real possibility of a large-scale terrorist resurgence. This situation will grow more dangerous still if the Trump administration follows through on its plan, announced in April, to begin withdrawing the approximately 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country. Since 2014, the United States has been the linchpin of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, an international counterterrorism group that has worked with local security forces to degrade ISIS. Without Washington's active involvement, the coalition's remaining 88 members will struggle to keep ISIS at bay or to adequately support local actors such as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a mostly Kurdish militia that had recently reached an agreement to merge with the state.

As U.S. troop numbers dwindle and sectarian tensions mount, Syrian forces may find it increasingly difficult to maintain authority in the country. The combined manpower of the Syrian army and the SDF is likely insufficient to prevent an ISIS resurgence. To deter ISIS, therefore, the United States must retain a presence in Syria beyond 2026. A contingent of roughly several hundred U.S. troops will be necessary to support Syria's new security forces with intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and capacity building. If Washington discontinues counterterrorism support to Damascus, the Syrian government may fail to unify the country and prevent ISIS's return. If ISIS is able to regain momentum in Syria, it will inevitably turn to conducting attacks throughout the region and beyond. It behooves Washington to prevent ISIS's ability to rebuild and once again destabilize the entire Levant. 

ISIS sees an opportunity in a divided Syria. Its leaders seek to exploit the country's sectarian and ideological divisions to recruit new fighters and rebuild their caliphate. Through its attacks, ISIS hopes to demonstrate that the current Syrian government is unable or unwilling to protect the population, especially minorities. A recent report from the UN Monitoring Team concluded that ISIS “will continue to project an external threat . . . if divisions in the country allow a permissive space from where they can plan and execute attacks.”Indeed, ISIS was especially busy last spring. In March, in the aftermath of violence between Sunni and Alawite communities in the port city of Latakia, ISIS conducted a string of attacks against the SDF. Then in May, the group launched another barrage of attacks following clashes south of Damascus, between the new administration's security forces and Sunni and Druze communities. That same month, just a week after U.S. President Donald Trump met in Riyadh with Syria's new president, the former jihadist Ahmed al-Shara, ISIS launched a series of bombings and ambushes across Syria and Iraq. The group also took credit for planting an explosive device that struck a “vehicle of the apostate regime” in southern Syria, resulting in at least seven Syrian army casualties and marking the first recorded attack on Syrian government forces since Assad's fall. A week later, another bomb attack conducted by ISIS in southern Syria targeted fighters from the Free Syrian Army, a U.S.-backed militia. Notably, all these attacks transpired deep in government-held territory.This surge in violence has been accompanied by a surge in ISIS propaganda undermining Shara and HTS. In its weekly online newsletter, which reaches and inspires jihadists across the globe, the group routinely maligns Shara and the new government and calls for soldiers in the Syrian military to defect. ISIS propagandists call Shara “Jewlani,” in reference to a conspiracy that the Syrian president, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, is an Israeli Mossad agent installed to initiate regime change inside Syria in favor of Israel. The group has also labeled HTS as kuffar (Arabic for “nonbelievers”) and accused it of being a puppet of the United States and Israel. Since HTS and Shara came to power, Israel has repeatedly carried out strikes and ground incursions into Syria, sowing the very chaos on which ISIS strives.

Alarmingly, ISIS's growing confidence has coincided with an incremental withdrawal of U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq, placing the future of the Global Coalition into question. In September 2024, the United States and Iraq jointly announced that the Global Coalition would end its military mission in Iraq by the end of September 2025 and in Syria by September 2026. In April, U.S. Central Command announced cuts to its U.S. troop presence in Syria from 2,000 to 1,400 by the end of this year. The United States has already transferred control of three of its eight bases in the country to the SDF, with plans to consolidate to just one base. Although Pentagon commanders have urged the administration to maintain at least a contingent of 500 troops in Syria, the administration has signaled that further cuts may be made. In neighboring Iraq, a parallel process is underway. With a withdrawal goal set for the end of 2026, U.S. forces are reconsolidating from Baghdad to Erbil, in Iraqi Kurdistan, and plan to drastically reduce their presence to a small, as yet unspecified number of military advisers.

When Trump met with Shara in May, it was the first time a U.S. president had met with a Syrian president in a quarter century. Much of the impetus behind the Trump administration's reengagement with Syria is driven by a desire to complete a total withdrawal from Iraq and Syria—an objective that can be achieved only if the new Syrian government proves capable of countering ISIS. To that aim, Washington has prioritized counterterrorism, directly assisting in operations against ISIS and providing Damascus with intelligence that has thwarted at least eight ISIS attacks. The Trump administration has also pressured the new Syrian administration to accelerate reconstruction and national unification efforts, such as the SDF integration with the government.

How things develop in Syria will depend, at least in part, on how committed Washington remains to continuing its fight against ISIS. After a decade and a half of extreme violence perpetrated by myriad actors, both state and nonstate, Syria faces a long road toward stability under the best of circumstances. Any U.S. withdrawal would create space for ISIS and other terrorist organizations to step up their attacks, further destabilizing the country, sowing divisions among its rival factions, and even opening the door for Iran-backed Shiite extremists, including Hezbollah. If the government in Damascus falls, or if it is unable to unify the country's minority communities, Syria will plunge back into civil war.Rather than prematurely depart a fragmented Syria, the United States and its partners in the Global Coalition should make long-term investments in the country's security. The U.S.-led mission has significantly degraded ISIS over the preceding decade, and U.S. forces have effectively collaborated with the SDF and other local actors on counterterrorism measures. Although ISIS remains largely defeated, Syria's postregime transition has created an opening for the group's return. The United States should withdraw from Syria only when Syrian forces can defend the country against ISIS and other terrorist groups. That moment has not yet arrived.

A premature U.S. departure at such a fragile moment in Syria could empower ISIS, undermining the very mission that brought U.S. forces to Syria in the first place. Washington should not follow through on its planned drawdown. Instead, it must continue to share intelligence with Damascus to foil attacks by ISIS—and step up counterterrorism training with the Syrian army, the SDF, and other local partners. Beyond that, the Trump administration should prevent actions by U.S. allies—such as Israeli strikes on Syrian territory—that risk perpetuating the chaos that ISIS seeks to exploit.

Finally, instead of terminating U.S. participation in the Global Coalition, Washington should expand the grouping to include Syria itself—a move that would enable better joint training, intelligence exchange, and operations. To that end, the United States and its partners in the Global Coalition should stipulate the conditions that HTS must meet to join. To be sure, existing members will have reservations about welcoming former jihadists such as Shara. But if ISIS is to be defeated once and for all, the new Syrian government must be involved and empowered to succeed.

Allies of Donald Trump have dismissed claims Charlie Kirk was killed by a lone assassin.

Senior figures in the Maga movement believe Tyler Robinson, the student charged with Kirk's murder, is part of a wider conspiracy involving a Left-wing terrorist network, and that authorities need to widen the scope of their investigation.

The FBI has suggested Mr Robinson may have worked with others, although no one else has yet been charged in connection with the crime.

Kash Patel, the FBI director, told senators on Tuesday that the bureau was investigating “who, if anyone, was involved as an accomplice”.

Steve Bannon, Mr Trump's former chief strategist, claimed that Kirk's death was “not a simple murder” and that the truth was “far deeper and far more malignant”.

“There's a vast conspiracy at the back of this,” Mr Bannon said on his War Room podcast on Monday.

“I am absolutely not buying this [theory],” he added.

“Antifa needs to be designated as a domestic terrorist organisation,” he continued, referencing the radical Left-wing organisation that has been linked to recent attacks on immigration detention centres.

Mr Trump later announced on Truth Social on Wednesday evening that he would designate the Antifa movement as a “terrorist organisation”.

“I will also be strongly recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practices,” he said.

It was not clear what legal weight Mr Trump's proclamation carried.

Media reports emerged shortly after Kirk's death that the ammunition used by the assassin was engraved with expressions of transgender and Antifa “ideology”, but authorities later clarified this may have been a misunderstanding.

It later emerged one of the bullets was engraved with the phrase: “Hey fascist! Catch” and “Bella ciao,” a reference to a Second World War Italian antifascist song.

Mr Bannon went on to suggest that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) may have been involved in the incident by allegedly funding Antifa.

He doubled down on the comments on Wednesday, telling Politico: “The biggest thing is to broaden the assassination investigation from a single murder to the broader conspiracy. If we are going to go to war, let's go to war.”

Mr Bannon also told his podcast listeners he was highly sceptical about a text exchange prosecutors said took place between Mr Robinson and his transgender lover.

According to the messages, released by Utah authorities yesterday, Mr Robinson worried about his father's reaction if he failed to return with his grandfather's rifle, which he allegedly used to shoot Kirk last week.

“You shot a man in cold blood in front of the world... I think your parents may talk about that first before they say, ‘Oh, by the way, did you bring the rifle back?'” Mr Bannon said. “I am absolutely not buying this”.

Echoing sceptics on social media who claimed the messages setting out details of the alleged crime were too convenient, he added: “Why are you explaining everything?

“I'm particularly not buying those text messages, it just seems too stilted, too much like a script – actually, like a bad script.”

Matt Walsh, a Maga-aligned commentator with the Daily Wire, suggested the text exchange had been planned to protect Mr Robinson's lover from prosecution.

“The most plausible and sensible theory isn't that the FBI made up text messages and released them but that the killer and his boyfriend constructed this highly scripted text conversation as an alibi for the boyfriend,” he said.

Mr Bannon went on to urge investigators to probe connections to the assassination attempt on Mr Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year.

Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, shot at Mr Trump as he addressed a campaign rally in June 2024, grazing his ear with a bullet. Authorities have not commented on his motive and the shooting has spawned a number of conspiracy theories on the Right.

Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff and a long-time aide to Mr Trump, claimed a “vast domestic terror network” was responsible for Kirk's death.

Violence is being fomented by “organised doxing campaigns, the organised riots, the organised street violence… and the actual organised cells”, he claimed on an episode of Kirk's podcast on Monday, hosted by JD Vance, the vice-president.

“With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have… to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again,” he vowed.

Sean Davis, the founder of The Federalist, a conservative magazine, wrote on social media: “It's obvious now that Charlie Kirk's assassin was not working alone.

“He was clearly operating within a larger terrorist network focused on grooming, recruiting, and training terrorists for the purpose of planning and executing terrorist attacks.”

Mr Patel was repeatedly pressed by Republicans about whether Mr Robinson had allegedly acted alone when he testified in front of the Senate judiciary committee for several hours on Tuesday.

A number of people who communicated with the 22-year-old student on Discord, the gaming chat room, are being “investigated and interrogated” by the FBI, he told senators. Asked if others could have been involved in Kirk's death, he answered: “Yes.”

At one point, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley urged Mr Patel to investigate Kirk's murder as part of a wider wave of “anti-religion, anti-Christian violence”.

Dan Bongino, Mr Patel's deputy, has also said the bureau is looking into whether Mr Robinson acted as part of a “larger effort”.

“If there was any aiding and abetting, whether it be financial or someone who knew the specifics of it and failed to report that, we're looking into that,” Mr Bongino told Fox News on Monday, and declared: “There's not going to be a stone left unturned.”

Earlier this week, Mr Trump said he thought the 22-year-old had been radicalised on the internet and “went bad very quickly”.

Next month, the chief executives of Discord, Reddit, Twitch, and other forums popular with young men are invited to testify in front of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the radicalisation of users.

James Comer, the committee's chairman, said: “The politically motivated assassination of Charlie Kirk claimed the life of a husband, father, and American patriot. In the wake of this tragedy, and amid other acts of politically motivated violence, Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence.”

BEIRUT, September 18. /TASS/. Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Sheibani and Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer held US-brokered talks in London on Wednesday.

According to Syria TV, the two ministers discussed a new draft agreement on measures of security that would replace the Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Syria of 1974. The meeting lasted for five hours. US Special Envoy for the Middle East Tom Barrack, who acts as a go-between at the talks, took part.

President of Syria for the transitional period Ahmed al-Sharaa said earlier that contacts with Israel on potential agreements on security measures "may yield results with the coming days." However, he demanded that UN observers be redeployed to the Golan Heights. He insisted that Israel "respect Syria's territorial integrity and stop violating its airspace."

According to the Al Nahar newspaper, Israel's draft is based on the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of 1979. Israel insists on establishing three demilitarized zones southwest of Damascus, where various security regimes will be in place depending on the distance from the Israeli border. Syria will be allowed to deploy police forces to these zones but flights over them will be banned.

Israel will retain control of Mount Hermon (Jabal El Sheikh) it took in December 2024 after the change of power in Damascus.

CARACAS, September 18. /TASS/. Venezuela's armed forces have begun the Sovereign Caribbean 200 military maneuver near the island of La Orchila in Venezuela's territorial waters.

"At the instruction of Venezuela's constitutional President Nicolas Maduro, I order to begin the Sovereign Caribbean exercise, which will strengthen our defense capacity," Venezolana de Television quoted Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez as saying.

According to the minister, the three-day drills will involve all types of the Venezuelan armed forces: aerospace, special, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, naval, airborne, ground, and aerospace defense forces.

The drills are conducted amid the deployment of US naval forces in the Caribbean, when, according to President Maduro, Venezuela is faced with the biggest threat of a US aggression it has seen in the past 100 years.

Reuters reported on August 19, citing Pentagon sources, that three US missile destroyers (USS Gravely, USS Jason Dunham and USS Sampson) had been deployed near Venezuela as part of an effort to address threats from Latin American drug cartels. Other reports mentioned the deployment of the USS Newport News submarine, the USS Lake Erie missile cruiser, landing ships and 4,500 troops. According to the New York Times, US President Donald Trump has secretly signed a directive to the Pentagon to begin using military force against certain Latin American drug cartels.

Washington claims that Venezuela is not doing enough to combat drug trafficking. Moreover, is accuses Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of being part of the Cartel de los Soles (or the Cartel of the Suns), whose existence Caracas denies.

NEW YORK, September 18. /TASS/. Three police officers died after a shooting incident in York County, Pennsylvania, Commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police Christopher Paris said.

"I can confirm that there were five law enforcement officers who were shot today - three fatally," he said, adding that two were transported to a hospital "in critical but stable condition."

He also confirmed that "the shooter is dead" but refrained from sharing further details as the investigation is underway.

A Utah sheriff on Sept. 17 provided more details on the arrest of Charlie Kirk's suspected assassin Tyler Robinson and said the suspect was fearful of being shot by law enforcement.

Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby said he was called by a retired law enforcement officer who had worked for him and knew Robinson's family. He was told that the Robinson family wanted to get the suspect to voluntarily surrender, he added.

Texas-based barbecue pitmaster Erica Blaire Roby shares her step-by-step recipe for a game day burger stuffed with bold flavor, smoky beef bacon and a splash of beer.

The cheeseburger has been an American favorite for nearly a century, and it has its own special day.

Sept. 18 marks National Cheeseburger Day in the United States. Though the origins of the beloved dish are murky, many believe the cheeseburger was created in the 1920s before becoming an American staple in the 1940s.

The combination of grilled beef, creamy American cheese and juicy pickles on a soft bun makes it a staple from barbecues to fast-food drive-thrus.

            Irish novelist Sally Rooney skipped an awards ceremony in London, saying that she risked being arrested under terror laws due to her support for the banned activist group Palestine Action.
    


            Rooney's editor Alex Bowler read her statement at the Sky Arts Awards on Tuesday, where the author's fourth book “Intermezzo” won the award for literature.
    


            “I wish I could be here with you this evening to accept the honor in person,” her statement read, “but, because of my support for non-violent anti-war protest, I'm advised I can no longer safely enter the UK without potentially facing arrest.”
    


            Rooney reiterated her “belief in the dignity and beauty of all human life, and my solidarity with the people of Palestine,” in the statement.
    


            London's Metropolitan Police told CNN in a statement Thursday it “wouldn't comment on an individual at the point of arrest or prior to this.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Rooney and Bowler for comment through Faber, her publisher.
    


            Palestine Action is a UK-based organization that aims to disrupt the operations of weapons manufacturers connected to the Israeli government.
    


            British authorities have had their eyes   on the group since 2020, but its June 2025 action – when activists broke into Britain's largest airbase, RAF Brize Norton, vandalizing two Airbus Voyager refueling planes – led to its proscription.
    


            Palestine Action is believed to be the first direct-action group to be designated a terrorist organization in the UK. The ban means that showing support for the organization carries a maximum sentence of up to 14 years in prison.
    


            Civil liberties campaigners across the UK and beyond have condemned the designation, saying that applying terrorism laws to such a group risk chilling free speech and assembly and sets a dangerous precedent for protest rights.
    


What is Palestine Action, the group linked to hundreds of arrests in the UK?



            Since its terror designation, more than 1,500 individuals have been arrested at solidarity protests across the UK, many for holding signs that read: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”
    


            In August, Rooney also denounced the ban, writing an Irish Times column titled: “I too support Palestine Action. If this makes me a ‘supporter of terror' under UK law, so be it.”
    


            She wrote that “an increasing number of artists and writers can no longer safely travel to Britain to speak in public” and that she intended to take the residual fees from BBC adaptations of her first two novels to donate them toward “supporting Palestine Action and direct action against genocide in whatever way I can.”
    


            Israel has been facing growing international condemnation. A United Nations commission concluded this week that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. Israel denies any accusations of genocide.
    


            “If the British state considers this ‘terrorism,'” Rooney wrote, “then perhaps it should investigate the shady organizations that continue to promote my work and fund my activities, such as WH Smith and the BBC.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the retailer WH Smith. A spokesperson for the BBC told CNN in a statement that Rooney does not currently receive payment directly from the BBC, “and she is not contracted by us.”
    


            Rooney, best known for her novel “Normal People” and its subsequent adaptation for TV, has long criticized Israel's occupation of the West Bank and its pre-war blockade of Gaza.
    


            In 2021, she refused to sell the Hebrew-language rights for her third novel “Beautiful World, Where Are You” to an Israeli publisher out of her support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a Palestinian-led global campaign promoting boycotts, divestments, and economic sanctions against Israel.
    


            The writer's stance underlines Ireland's longstanding support of the Palestinian cause.
    


            Ireland is one of the most pro-Palestinian countries in Europe, a position born out of a shared experience of subjugation by an occupying state.
    


            In January, the Irish government joined South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) accusing Israel of genocide, and the country appears close to passing a bill that will ban trade with illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
    


            Nonetheless, Rooney has criticized Ireland's government for not speaking out more forcefully in favor of protesters recently arrested in the UK.
    


            “If the Government in Dublin truly believes that Israel is committing genocide,” Rooney said, “how can it look elsewhere while its nearest neighbor funds and supports that genocide and its own citizens are arrested simply for speaking out?”
    


            CNN has reached out to Ireland's Foreign Ministry for comment.

President Donald Trump argues that Jimmy Kimmel's talk show was pulled because of “bad ratings.” Speaking in Aylesbury, Trump also said Kimmel said a “horrible thing” about Charlie Kirk. PM Keir Starmer defends Britain's record on free speech.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has used threats, lawsuits and government pressure as he remakes the American media landscape, unleashing his long-standing grievances against an industry that has mocked, criticized and scorned him for years.

He's extracted multimillion-dollar settlements, forced companies into costly litigation and prompted changes to programming that he found objectionable. 

Now Trump is escalating his campaign of censure and retaliation, invigorated by successful efforts to push ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air for his commentary on conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One while returning from Great Britain on Thursday, Trump said federal regulators should consider revoking broadcast licenses for networks that “give me only bad publicity.”

“All they do is hit Trump,” he said. “They're licensed! They're not allowed to do that. They're an arm of the Democrat Party.”

Brendan Carr, Trump's handpicked head of the Federal Communications Commission, issued a similar warning the previous day while criticizing Kimmel's remarks about the political ideology of the suspected assassin.

“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said. “These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”




ABC suspended Kimmel hours later.

It was the kind of brute force response that Trump and his loyalists have routinely flexed since the Republican president returned to the White House with a vow to retaliate against critics and political opponents. Trump's reach has extended deep into the private sector, using the apparatus of the federal government to pressure companies to make changes that can reshape the public dialogue.

Trump has already reached settlements with ABC and CBS over their coverage. He has filed defamation lawsuits against The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Republicans in Congress stripped federal funding from NPR and PBS. At the FCC, Carr has used his influence to target diversity, equity and inclusion programs and to root out what he describes as liberal bias.

In the aftermath of Kirk's assassination, Trump has clamped down more firmly, with broader implications for the future of free speech protections that have been a bedrock of the American political system. 

Attorney General Pam Bondi recently said that “we will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.” Her words alarmed advocates who fear an elastic definition of the term could be used to criminalize dissent.

The First Amendment is widely viewed as protecting even the most disparaging remarks, and the Supreme Court said in an unanimous opinion last year that “government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors.”

Bondi later revised her comments to say she was focused on “hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence.”

Todd Blanche, Bondi's deputy, suggested that protesters could have violated the law by yelling at Trump while he visited a restaurant near the White House. 

“Is it sheer happenstance that individuals show up at a restaurant where the president is trying to enjoy dinner in Washington, D.C., and accost him with vile words and vile anger?” Blanche said. He said authorities could investigate whether it's “part of an organized effort to inflict harm and terror and damage to the United States.”

The latest saga with Kimmel began Monday night with the comedian's commentary about last week's shooting of Kirk, which took place on a college campus in Utah. 

“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said. He also compared Trump's grief to “how a 4-year-old mourns a goldfish.”

Trump allies said Kimmel was falsely suggesting that the shooter was right-wing. Authorities have not formally presented a motive for the killing, but evidence indicates that he held liberal beliefs. Gov. Spencer Cox, R-Utah, has said “there clearly was a leftist ideology,” 

On Wednesday, Carr appeared on a podcast hosted by Benny Johnson, a conservative commentator, and accused Kimmel of the “sickest conduct possible.” Carr said “you could make a strong argument that this is sort of an intentional effort to mislead the American people about a very core fundamental fact.”

Carr placed the move against Kimmel in the broader context of Trump's efforts to undermine the power of legacy media companies. 

“He smashed the facade that they get to control what we say, what we think, the narrative around events,” Carr said. “And we're seeing a lot of consequences from President Trump doing that.”

Reminding affiliates that their broadcast licenses come with an “obligation to operate in the public interest,” Carr said “it's time for them to step up” and say Kimmel's content “isn't something that we think serves the needs of our local communities.”

It didn't take long for Nexstar Media Group, the country's biggest operator of television stations, to echo some of Carr's language. 

“Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time,” Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said in statement.

The controversy landed at a sensitive time for Nexstar, which needs FCC approval for its $6.2 billion acquisition of Tegna. 

ABC soon announced that Kimmel would be taken off the air. It is unclear when or whether he will return. Kimmel has not commented publicly. 

Later in the evening, the television company Sinclair said its stations would carry “a special in remembrance of Charlie Kirk” on Friday during Kimmel's usual time slot. The company also asked Kimmel to apologize to Kirk's family and donate money to Turning Point USA, the conservative group that Kirk turned into a political powerhouse.

House Democratic leaders, in a statement, accused Carr of “bullying ABC” and “forcing the company to bend the knee to the Trump administration,” and said a “war” on the First Amendment by Trump and the GOP “is blatantly inconsistent with American values.”

The news of Kimmel's suspension broke after midnight in Britain, where Trump was traveling for a state visit. But the president soon posted on Truth Social, his social media platform, to celebrate what he called “Great News for America.”

CBS had already announced the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show over the summer, and Trump said more dominoes should fall, calling for the cancellation of shows by Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.

“Do it NBC!!!” he wrote.

President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hold a joint news conference from Aylesbury, England, during the president's second official state visit to the country.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused President Donald Trump of exploiting the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in order to go after critics.

Schumer's charge came as Senate Democrats teed up legislation called the "No Political Enemies Act," which would prohibit Trump and his administration from weaponizing government agencies. It comes in the wake of late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel's sidelining by ABC over comments he made related to Kirk.

The top Senate Democrat said freedom of speech is "one of the great hallmarks of our country" but that the Trump administration "is trying to snuff it out."

"Those who break the law, of course, resort to any source of violence ought to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," Schumer said. "But using the tragic death of Charlie Kirk as an excuse to supercharge the political witch hunt against critics is abhorrent, obnoxious and as un-American as it gets."

"To attack civil society, whether it's Jimmy Kimmel, civil society organizations or the Trump administration's perceived political enemies, its crusade is unending," he continued. "And this is one of the saddest parts of all, because of congressional Republicans' obeisance to Trump, it's unchecked because they are scared to stand up to Trump."

Democrats' legislation would prevent the administration from using agencies like the Justice Department, FBI and the IRS from going after people for criticizing the government, according to a one-page description of the bill.

It would also hold officials accountable for using their office to go after critics, ensure courts quickly dismiss "abusive actions," and provide due process for U.S. nonprofits that the government tries to "label as criminal or terrorist organizations."

Their legislative push also comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi said earlier this week that the administration would "go after you if you are targeting anyone with hate speech."

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., called her comments "bone chilling."

"The shooting of Charlie Kirk was a national tragedy," he said. "It should have been a line in the sand, an opportunity for President Trump to bring this country together to do whatever is necessary to stamp out political violence that's targeted both Republicans and Democrats, political violence that emanates from both right-wing and left-wing radicalization."

"But Trump and his lieutenants are choosing a different path," he continued. "They are choosing to exploit this tragedy, to weaponize the federal government to destroy Donald Trump's political opposition."

A DOJ spokesperson referred Fox News Digital to statements Bondi made on her X page, including where she told reporters that the First Amendment is "one of the most important amendments, of course, in our Constitution. We will always protect the First Amendment."

"But you cannot, you cannot create violence, and that's what's happening … and that's when you cross the line from First Amendment to a crime, and we will prosecute you," she said. 

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment but did not immediately hear back.

LONDON — President Donald Trump‘s Marine One presidential helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing while traveling from Chequers to London‘s Stansted Airport.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump were aboard the helicopter as the first leg of their journey back to the United States after a state visit when the pilots made an unexpected landing.

“Due to a minor hydraulic issue, and out of an abundance of caution, the pilots landed at a local airfield before reaching Stansted airport,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “The president and first lady safely boarded the support helicopter.”

Trump arrived roughly 20 minutes behind the traveling press pool, but the White House did not provide an explanation for the delay before Air Force One took off for Washington.

During a gaggle with reporters shortly after takeoff, Trump joked that he hoped they all made it home safely.

“Fly safely. You know why I say that? Because I'm on the flight,” he said with a laugh. “Otherwise, I wouldn't care.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested that he is working to reestablish a U.S. presence at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, four years after America's chaotic withdrawal from the country left the base in the Taliban's hands.

Trump floated the idea during a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer as he wrapped up a state visit to the U.K. and tied it to the need for the U.S. to counter its top rival, China.

“We're trying to get it back,” Trump said of the base in an aside to a question about ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

While Trump described his call for the U.S. military to reestablish a position in Afghanistan as “breaking news,” the Republican president has previously raised the idea. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about whether it or the Pentagon has done any planning around returning to the sprawling air base, which was central to America's longest war.




During his first presidency, Trump set the terms for the U.S. withdrawal by negotiating a deal with the Taliban. The 20-year conflict came to an end in disquieting fashion under President Joe Biden: The U.S.-backed Afghan government collapsed, a grisly bombing killed 13 U.S. troops and 170 others, and thousands of desperate Afghans descended on Kabul's airport in search of a way out before the final U.S. aircraft departed over the Hindu Kush.

The Afghanistan debacle was a major setback just eight months into Biden's Democratic presidency that he struggled to recover from.

Biden's Republican detractors, including Trump, seized on it as a signal moment in a failed presidency. Those criticisms have persisted into the present day, including as recently as last week, when Trump claimed the move emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine in February 2022.

“He would have never done what he did, except that he didn't respect the leadership of the United States,” Trump said, speaking of Putin. “They just went through the Afghanistan total disaster for no reason whatsoever. We were going to leave Afghanistan, but we were going to leave it with strength and dignity. We were going to keep Bagram Air Base — one of the biggest air bases in the world. We gave it to them for nothing.”

Asked again about the proposal hours later on Air Force One, Trump offered no details but again bashed Biden for “gross incompetence” and said the base should have “never been given back.”

“It's one of the most powerful bases in the world in terms of runway strength and length,” he said. “You can land anything on there. You can land a planet on top of it.”

It is unclear if the U.S. has any new direct or indirect conversations with the Taliban government about returning to the country. But Trump hinted that the Taliban, who have struggled with an economic crisis, international legitimacy, internal rifts and rival militant groups since their return to power in 2021, could be game to allow the U.S. military to return.

“We're trying to get it back because they need things from us,” Trump said of the Taliban.

The president repeated his view that a U.S. presence at Bagram is of value because of its proximity to China, the most significant economic and military competitor to the United States.

“But one of the reasons we want that base is, as you know, it's an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,” Trump said. “So a lot of things are happening.”

While the U.S. and the Taliban have no formal diplomatic ties, the sides have had hostage conversations. An American man who was abducted more than two years ago while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist was released by the Taliban in March.

Last week, the Taliban also said they reached an agreement with U.S. envoys on an exchange of prisoners as part of an effort to normalize relations between the United States and Afghanistan.

The Taliban gave no details of a detainee swap, and the White House did not comment on the meeting in Kabul or the results described in a Taliban statement. The Taliban released photographs from their talks, showing their foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, with Trump's special envoy for hostage response, Adam Boehler.

Officials at U.S. Central Command in the Middle East and the Pentagon, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office, referred questions about reestablishing a presence at Bagram to the White House.

Pennsylvania State Police and Gov. Josh Shapiro give an update on an officer-involved shooting.

Officials on Thursday identified the three police officers that were killed when they were ambushed while responding to a domestic call Wednesday in York County, Pennsylvania.

The fallen included Northern York County Regional Police Department's Sgt. Cody Becker, Detective Mark Baker and Detective Isaiah Emenheiser, according to York County District Attorney Tim Barker.

Another Northern York County Regional Police detective and a York County Sheriff's Office deputy were critically wounded, but remain stable at the hospital, Barker said.

The suspected gunman, identified as Matthew James Ruth, 24, was killed by police, officials said. He did not have any prior criminal convictions.

Barker said that the investigation began on Tuesday night, when Ruth's ex-girlfriend's mother reported seeing him on her property in camouflage, peering into the home with binoculars. Trail camera footage showed Ruth armed with an AR-15-style rifle, and his truck was left nearby. 

The ex-girlfriend also told police her pickup truck was set on fire in August, but she was not sure if Ruth was to blame, so she requested they not investigate.

Detectives returned to the empty home just after 2 p.m. Wednesday, and as they walked through the unlocked front door, the suspect launched an ambush, firing multiple suppressed rounds, according to Barker. Ruth was later killed in a final shootout near the road.

Inside the house, investigators later discovered shell casings from the initial ambush and, in the basement, the body of the ex-girlfriend's mother's black Labrador, which the suspect had shot and killed.

Authorities are continuing to investigate the motive, but Barker emphasized the root of the tragedy was domestic violence.

"All actions by law enforcement were justified. They weren't only justified, they were necessary," Barker said. "We are so thankful and appreciative to them, and especially our northern York County Regional detective who fired the last shot and who rendered aid. I can't imagine the strength and the fortitude that it takes to immediately, after having seen and been engaged in that … immediately thinking of rendering critical aid."

"He saved many lives that day," he added. "If the actor was not eliminated, and his threat and murderous rampage eliminated, who knows where this would have stopped."

Prior to the shooting, Ruth was charged with stalking, trespassing, loitering and prowling at night in relation to the investigation, court documents show. 

The FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the Pennsylvania State Police are assisting local authorities. Attorney General Pam Bondi offered the full support of the federal government.

The shooting, which took place about 115 miles west of Philadelphia in North Codorus Township, came just a few months after another York County officer was killed in the line of duty. 

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said during a news conference Wednesday he is continuing to pray for everyone involved. 

"This is an absolutely tragic and devastating day for your county and for the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania," Shapiro said. "[We] grieve for the loss of life of the three precious souls who served this county, served this commonwealth and served this country. We continue to pray for the full recovery of those who are dealing with their wounds."

            A spellbinding image of two tiny but vibrant “ladybugs of the sea” has won the Ocean Photographer of the Year 2025 award.
    


            Taken by Indonesia-based photographer Yury Ivanov at his local dive site in Bali, the winning photograph shows two amphipods, which stand at just three millimeters tall, resting on a piece of coral, according to a press release from competition organizers Oceanographic Magazine and Blancpain on Thursday.
    


            “It required a lot of patience and precision to compose and light the shot properly,” said Ivanov in a statement. “The result reveals an intimate glimpse of underwater life that is often overlooked.”
    


Otherworldly images show beauty of oceans in photo competition



            Winning the competition “is an incredible feeling,” added Ivanov. “This award is not just about one image, but about celebrating the ocean itself – its fragility, its diversity, and its extraordinary power to inspire us.”
    


            His picture was chosen as the overall winner from a field of more than 15,000 images submitted by photographers all over the world, with nine category winners also selected.
    


            Category winners include a stunning shot of a personal watercraft navigating huge waves at the famed Nazaré surf spot in Portugal; a haunting image of a long-finned pilot whale foetus lying under their dead mother's body during whale hunting season in the Faroe Islands; and a beautiful photo of a female yellow pygmy goby fish releasing newly-hatched larvae from her mouth.
    


            “The winners of this year's Ocean Photographer of the Year remind us that photography is more than art – it is a bridge. Their images connect people to the ocean in ways words cannot, reaching those who may never dive in it or paddle on it, but whose lives are deeply intertwined with it,” said Will Harrison, director of Ocean Photographer of the Year, in the release.
    


            “In a time of planetary urgency, this year's photographers invite the world to see, feel, and ultimately care. Their work is critical, because we protect what we understand,” he added.
    


            The winning photographs will form part of an Ocean Photographer of the Year exhibition, which will make its first stop at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney from November 6.

During a joint news conference Thursday with President Donald Trump, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the assassination of Charlie Kirk should "be condemned."

The sports world continues to be shaken up by the assassination of Charlie Kirk last week.

Kirk was shot while debating at Utah Valley University and died of his injuries soon after.

Many prominent figures in sports reacted to the news, and in a recent appearance on Logan Paul's podcast, UFC president Dana White shared his thoughts.

"I just woke up, and my phone was blowing up. I was f---ing blown away," White said.

As dumbfounded as White was, he said his children also took it hard.

"I was actually surprised by how impacted my kids were. My kids used to watch him on social media. My daughter, she's 19, she's in college, and she's been just destroyed over this thing for the last couple days. You have to feel horrible for his family. It's f---ing crazy," White said.

"The fact that it happened during what he was known for, which was just peaceful debate and conversation, which was a pillar of American virtue," added Paul. "This country was built on people having conversation and talking to people maybe you don't always agree with and hopefully reaching a resolution -- or even if not, saying we respectfully. But that's a lot of the times how progress is made."

"When you are unable to talk, shoot and go to violence is just so pathetic," Paul continued. "It's so weak, and I think it's totally against everything that is America."

White replied, "That's what happens with people who aren't intelligent enough to debate."

Paul also said he "really respected" Kirk for "his ability to step into a room and be the person who he said he was."

TERRA ALTA, W.V. (AP) — Every day, LaRanda Schoolcraft drives five minutes down the hill from her Terra Alta home to visit the family member she calls her “person.”

“My grandpa has dementia now and doesn't always make sense,” she said. “But I see the care he receives every day, and I ride the emotional rollercoaster beside him.”

Carl Schoolcraft, originally from Clendenin, has a white beard that nursing home workers keep well trimmed. He used to dress as Santa Claus each year.

His granddaughter says the nurses and aides at Hopemont Hospital see him as their adopted grandfather.

Last month, Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced the sale of this state-owned nursing home and the three others to a private company.

And while the company says it has no plans to cut staff, public records show it employs fewer nursing staff on average at its facilities in other states than are employed at the state's hospitals.

For people like Schoolcraft, living at home until the end of life isn't an option.

With few family members left, Schoolcraft lived alone, but his granddaughter checked on him every day. Earlier this year, she arrived to find the man who built her a treehouse beyond her ability to care for him, and she moved him to the state-owned nursing home.

He was diagnosed with a fatal brain disease that causes dementia and other problems like confusion and trouble with mobility.

▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel.

During a recent visit, she found him making his way down a well-traveled linoleum hall and told him she would wheel him to his room for their daily talk.




She told him about a trip she's planning and asked him how he likes the workers.

“I ask them about their lives,” he said. “I ask them about their loves. I ask them about their happies.”

Other nursing home options were more than an hour away from her, so she wouldn't have been able to visit as often.

And when he was first diagnosed about six months ago, he was combative, and a private nursing home in nearby Kingwood wouldn't accept him.

“Deciding to put him there was the hardest decision I've ever had to make,” she said. “And it was awful to come to that decision. But if there's anything that was of consolation or that did make it better, it is the staff that's there.”

She said she knows the facility could use upgrades and more workers. She sees single employees feeding two people at a time on a daily basis.

But she knows he would have wanted to be close to her.

“I'll be able to sleep at night,” she said. “I'll know that I was there, and I did everything he would have wanted.”

The nursing homes being sold are Hopemont Hospital, Jackie Withrow Hospital in Beckley, Lakin Hospital in West Columbia in Mason County and John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont.

West Virginia opened the historic buildings to meet the urgent health needs of their times.

State lawmakers passed an act in 1911 to build Hopemont Hospital for the isolation of tuberculosis patients.

Jackie Withrow Hospital in Beckley originally served people with that infectious disease as well.

In 1899, lawmakers passed a law requiring hospitals to be built for people who worked in dangerous industries. The Fairmont site where the John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center is located was once the location of Miners Hospital Three, where victims of mining accidents were treated.

And Black delegates in the West Virginia Legislature proposed the creation of Lakin Hospital during the era of segregation to serve as the state's Black mental hospital.

All four became state-run nursing homes, often serving people who couldn't pay for care or whom private companies wouldn't accept.

Morrisey announced the $60 million sale of the health care facilities on Aug. 12. He said they were operating at a $6 million yearly loss to the state.

The nursing home company Majestic Care will run the nursing homes.

Company officials have said they are in the early stages of evaluating the construction of three to five new facilities, although they haven't said where or when.

The CEO, Paul Pruitt, has said Jackie Withrow and Hopemont have outlived their lifespans.

They have said they won't trim staff to save money.

But residents in Majestic Care's nursing homes in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana receive around an hour less nursing care per day on average than residents at the state's four hospitals, Hopemont, Jackie Withrow, Lakin and John Manchin, according to federal health agency reports.

Lower staffing levels increase the risk of falls, bedsores, missed medications, infections, behavioral health crises and emergency room visits.

Majestic officials said the company meets all state and federal staffing requirements and that it offers competitive pay and benefits.

“Staffing levels are only one measure,” they added. “Equally important is how we invest in training, recruitment, and resources, so staff can deliver safe, compassionate care.”

Despite Majestic Care's staffing level track record, Morrisey said he expects to see patient care improve.

“I think you're going to get the benefit of having a company that does this for a living, as opposed to having a government that really shouldn't have been in the business in the first place,” he said.

Gailyn Markham, spokesperson for the Department of Health Facilities, said health officials also believe the company is well-equipped to provide patients with better care amid a nationwide nursing shortage.

Mary Stein-Johnson feels like she grew up at Lakin Hospital, where she works as a nurse. Her mother worked there before her, so she knew the employees and residents well.

Patients live their lives there too. She said that many patients have serious mental illnesses or disabilities, and some are deemed too difficult to care for by private companies.

She used to work in the private sector and remembers severe understaffing and companies picking and choosing patients with fewer needs.

“My mother's words to me when I was considering it were, ‘go back to Lakin, Mary, the state's always taken care of me,'” she said. “Well, the state's not taking care of us now.”

Many of Lakin's patients have been accused of crimes but were too ill to understand the charges, or they show aggressive behaviors associated with their illnesses.

She predicts a private provider will release patients, and they'll end up in jails or homeless shelters.

Pastor Leah Starkey said she shows up to minister and finds patients have drawn her pictures. One woman who used to never speak now gives her regular hugs and prays for her. One man is training to teach his own Bible study courses.

She's also called to minister when patients are on their deathbeds, and she'll ask if she can expect family to be there.

“A lot of times that's when they'll tell me there is no family,” she said. “That is their family. That is one of my concerns. Are they going to keep them all together?”

Stein-Johnson said the health and retirement benefits she has been offered are so inferior in comparison to state benefits, they're essentially equivalent to a pay cut.

Majestic officials said the company is offering jobs with no pay cuts to all employees, as well as health insurance, retirement, paid time off and other perks like a relief fund, leadership development, sign-on bonuses and tuition reimbursement.

“Our goal isn't just to keep staff,” the company said in a statement. “It's to help them grow and thrive with us.”

They've also said they will keep current patients.

In Rivesville in Marion County, flags line the streets with the names and faces of “Hometown Heroes.”

Across from City Hall, one waves for Andrew Dorsey, a coal miner and Purple Heart veteran who served in World War II and lived out the last of his 92 years of life at the John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center.

Like the miners who stayed there a century before him, he died in the care of the state after developing black lung through years of inhaling coal dust.

He also had hearing loss and was starting to fall often.

His son, Mark Dorsey, lives a few minutes away from City Hall, and about ten minutes away from the center.

Dorsey, a retired coal miner himself, said his dad liked to hunt, fish and bowl.

He didn't talk much about the war.

He wasn't a big talker at all really. But he wouldn't have kept quiet about any mistreatment.

And because the center was so close, Dorsey was there every day, so he was able to spend time with his father at the end of his life and also monitor staff.

“It wasn't just a job for them,” he said. “They actually care about the people there.”

He noted that private companies are different from state programs because they are motivated by profit.

“They're not buying it to lose money,” he said. “Is that what their game is? And if it is, you know, they're going to cut staff, and the health care is not going to be as good.”

Dorsey said the rest home has a strong reputation among families in the area.

Even so, residents have regularly had to come out and protest the potential sale of the center when state officials have considered it in years past.

He said, “It's always about the money.”

Turning Point USA elects Erika Kirk, Charlie's widow, to be the new CEO and chair of the board, the organization announced Thursday.

Turning Point USA announced Thursday it "unanimously elected" Charlie Kirk's widow Erika Kirk as the new CEO and chair of the board of the organization.

"In prior discussions, Charlie expressed to multiple executives that this is what he wanted in the event of his death," the organization said in a post on X.

Charlie Kirk was shot and killed on Sept. 10 while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University.

"It was the honor of our lives to serve as board members at Charlie's side," Turning Point USA's current board said in a statement released Thursday. "Charlie prepared all of us for a moment like this one. He worked tirelessly to ensure Turning Point USA was built to survive even the greatest tests. And now, it's our great pride to announce Erika Kirk as the new CEO and Chair of the Board for Turning Point USA."

"All of us at Turning Point USA have a special role in carrying Charlie Kirk's mantle and completing his vision of bringing us all closer to our Lord and fostering a prosperous country for generations to come. As Charlie always said, ‘We have a country to save,'" the statement continued. "We will not surrender or kneel before evil. We will carry on. The attempt to destroy Charlie's work will become our chance to make it more powerful and enduring than ever before."

"May God Bless Erika, the Kirk family, and the entire team at Turning Point USA," the organization added.

"Charlie Kirk's life was a testament to faith, courage, and conviction," a website for the event said. "From his earliest days, he believed America was worth fighting for, and he dedicated every moment of his 31 years to that cause. He lived with eyes fixed on eternity, grounded in the truth of God's Word, and driven by a calling bigger than himself."

The "Jeopardy!" stage turned into a pop culture battleground this week after contestants failed to identify one of Hollywood's most legendary actors.

In a recent episode of the beloved game show, viewers were left stunned when all three contestants couldn't come up with the name of James Earl Jones, whose voice was linked to some of the most memorable moments in film history.

During Monday night's show, "Jeopardy!" host Ken Jennings presented the category "Sesame Street."

One of the clues read, "Throughout the years, lots of people have stopped by ‘Sesame Street' like Alex Trebek and Ken Jennings," the Oscar the Grouch character began to say from his trash can. 

"Why can't they leave a grouch alone? But, the very first was this guy, who recited the alphabet for us."

As Jennings read the clue, a black-and-white photo of Jones popped up on the screen.

The buzzer went off as the "Jeopardy!" contestants drew a blank.

"That's James Earl Jones," Jennings revealed, referring to the voice icon, who died on Sept. 9, 2024, at the age of 93.

On the official "Jeopardy!" social media account, fans didn't hold back — quickly calling out the contestants for failing to recognize one of the most iconic voices in Hollywood history.

One fan fired off, "Literally how did not a single one of them not know THEE James Earl Jones!?"

"Nobody knew James Earl Jones, straight to jail," one viewer joked, while another admitted, "The way I screamed JAMES EARL JONES to my phone multiple times."

"So excuse me, you know Rocco The Rock but you don't know James Earl Jones? I weep," another comment read.

Jones was best known for his voice role as Darth Vader in the "Star Wars" franchise, in addition to "Coming to America," "Field of Dreams" and "The Hunt for Red October."

The award-winning actor passed away at his home in Dutchess County, New York, surrounded by family, his representative shared in a statement to Fox News Digital at the time. 

Jones is one of the few entertainers to have achieved EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony awards) status. 

Over his illustrious career, he claimed two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Grammy and three Tony Awards — solidifying his legacy in television, music and theater.

While Jones did not win a competitive Oscar, he was presented with the Honorary Academy Award by Sir Ben Kingsley.

Jones launched his career in theater in the early ‘50s. He earned acclaim as one of the premier Shakespearean actors of his time, commanding the stage with unforgettable performances as "Othello," "King Lear," Oberon in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and Claudius in "Hamlet." 

His most prolific role came in the form of voicing Darth Vader in George Lucas' 1977 space epic "Star Wars." He reprised his role for the sequels "The Empire Strikes Back" in 1980 and again in "Return of the Jedi" in 1983.

Jones' film credits additionally included, "Conan the Barbarian," "The Sandlot," "Patriot Games" and "Clear and Present Danger."

He was a Kennedy Center honoree in 2002 and received lifetime achievement awards from the Screen Actors Guild in 2009 and the National Board of Review in 1995.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Thursday asked the Supreme Court for an emergency order to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's board of governors. 

The Republican administration turned to the high court after an appeals court refused to go along with ousting Cook, part of President Donald Trump's effort to reshape the Fed's seven-member governing board and strike a blow at its independence.

The White House campaign to unseat Cook marks an unprecedented bid to reshape the Fed board, which was designed to be largely independent from day-to-day politics. No president has fired a sitting Fed governor in the agency's 112-year history.

Cook, who was appointed to the Fed's board by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has said she won't leave her post and won't be “bullied” by Trump. One of her lawyers, Abbe Lowell, has said she “will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.”

Separately, Senate Republicans on Monday confirmed Stephen Miran, Trump's nominee to an open spot on the Fed's board. Both Cook and Miran took part in Wednesday's vote in which the Fed cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point.

Trump sought to fire Cook on Aug. 25, but a federal judge ruled last week that the removal probably was illegal and reinstated her to the Fed's board. Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties, in Michigan and Georgia, as “primary residences” in June and July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home. 




“Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself — and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in his Supreme Court filing.

But Cook has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. According to documents obtained by The Associated Press, Cook did specify that her Atlanta condo would be a “vacation home,” according to a loan estimate she obtained in May 2021. And in a form seeking a security clearance, she described it as a “2nd home.” Both documents appear to undercut the Trump administration's claims of fraud. 

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration had not satisfied a legal requirement that Fed governors can only be fired “for cause,” which she said was limited to misconduct while in office. Cook did not join the Fed's board until 2022.

Cobb also held that Trump's firing would have deprived Cook of her due process, or legal right, to contest the firing.

By a 2-1 vote, a panel of the federal appeals court in Washington rejected the administration's request to let Cook's firing proceed.

Trump's lawyers have argued that even if the conduct occurred before her time as governor, her alleged action “indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy.” 

Trump has previously won orders from the court's conservative majority to fire the presidentially appointed leaders of other independent federal agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Trade Commission, even as legal fights continue.

Those firings have been at will, with no cause given. The Supreme Court has distinguished the Federal Reserve from those other agencies, strongly suggesting that Trump can't act against Fed governors without cause.

In its new filing to the Supreme Court, the administration is asking Chief Justice John Roberts for a temporary order that would effectively remove Cook from the board and a more lasting order from the whole court that would be in place while her legal case continues.

'Outnumbered' panel reacts to newly released audio of Charlotte, North Carolina, murder suspect Decarlos Brown Jr. speaking with his sister after allegedly killing Iryna Zarutska.

FIRST ON FOX: The House of Representatives is charging ahead with discussions on how to bolster trust in public transit after the deadly stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee in Charlotte, N.C.

A panel of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is holding a closed-door roundtable with federal transit officials, as well as law enforcement and union representatives on Thursday, Fox News Digital has learned.

It's being led by Highways and Transit subcommittee chair Rep. David Rouzer, R-N.C., who represents the state where the stabbing occurred. 

"The recent deadly stabbing of Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte's light rail is a stark reminder safety must be at the center of our national transit conversation," Rouzer told Fox News Digital.

Lawmakers said they are hoping to hear directly from officials on strategies to mitigate crime on public transit systems.

While public transportation has already been under the committee's purview, the tragic killing of Iryna Zarutska on a train in Charlotte last month is fueling new urgency for House lawmakers on the panel.

The Thursday roundtable is directly tied to that incident, Fox News Digital is told.

Among the participants expected are Federal Transit Administration leader Marc Molinaro, who is a former House lawmaker, as well as American Public Transportation Association President Paul Skoutelas, Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves, AFL-CIO Transportation Trades Department President Greg Regan and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) CEO Randy Clarke.

A spokesperson for the House Transportation Committee, led by Chair Sam Graves, R-Mo., told Fox News Digital that the roundtable would help inform legislation being crafted by the panel.

"The committee is in the process of developing a broad, comprehensive surface transportation reauthorization bill – sometimes referred to as the ‘highway bill,' but it also includes policy changes and funding authorizations for federal transit programs," the spokesperson said. "This roundtable will inform that bill development process."

Graves added, "Trust in transit overall will continue to erode if we don't take action to stop violent crime on public transit."

Zarutska, 23, was killed on a Charlotte light rail train on Aug. 22 while on her way home from work. 

Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., who allegedly stabbed Zarutska in an unprovoked attack, was charged with first-degree murder this week.

Zarutska had fled Ukraine in August 2022 after Russia launched its invasion of the sovereign country. She was working at a local pizza shop and studying at a community college at the time of her killing.

The case is now the latest example being held up by Republicans of big cities having too lax a justice system in dealing with crime, including on mass transit.

It comes amid broader partisan divisions over the merits of President Donald Trump deploying the National Guard to major cities in order to deal with violent crime.

And while Thursday's roundtable is bipartisan, Democrats have previously accused Republicans of politicizing the 23-year-old's death.

"I think it's outrageous that people are trying to politicize the death of this wonderful young lady. It's outrageous that anyone would politicize that death. What decency do people have at a moment like this, as opposed to trying to find commonsense solutions?" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said earlier this month.

George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley joins 'Fox & Friends' to weigh in on Attorney General Pam Bondi warning against inciting political violence.

Several public officials have faced expulsion calls over their reactions to Charlie Kirk's murder, including a West Virginia delegate who compared him to the Charlotte train stabbing suspect and framed the issue in terms of alleged "racist" language and domestic terrorism.

Their comments highlight how Kirk's death has become a flashpoint in the national debate over political rhetoric and violence.

Del. Anitra Hamilton, D-Morgantown, who leads the NAACP branch in Monongalia and Preston counties, faced blowback for Facebook posts that appear to have since been deleted accusing the late conservative activist of racism and claiming such "words of a racist nature" are tantamount to domestic terrorism.

"The value of truth exposes your values, priorities and beliefs. You can profess Jesus, tweet about Him, and talk about Him in your speeches, and yet be a racist," Hamilton posted, according to screenshots circulated by Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.V., former top Ted Cruz staffer Steve Guest and others.

"You can murder one woman on a train by stabbing her in the neck and be condemned by the masses or you can travel the nation spewing hatred and racism, harming thousands and be loved by the masses and both have the same outcome," the posts read.

"Speaking words of a racist nature is not your First Amendment right, but are acts of domestic terrorism upon the souls of American people," Hamilton continued, per the screenshots. 

Hamilton also said proper debate cannot take place where the Black population is "1.36%," which matches figures for Utah, where Kirk was killed.

Moore responded by calling for Charleston lawmakers to expel Hamilton, adding, "This is the ideology we are up against."

"Tolerating the warped mindset that leads to disgusting behavior like this from radical Leftists with no consequence is how we end up with a 31-year-old dad being shot and killed in cold blood."

Moore added that lawmakers cannot be "justifying murder."

Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.V., strongly condemned Hamilton.

"The delegate from the 81st (District) ought to be ashamed because celebrating the death of an individual who engages in regular political dialogue on college campuses is really, truly sad to see," said Justice.

The governor-turned-senator originally appointed Hamilton to the role — with a senior government staffer familiar with the appointment telling Fox News Digital he was bound by a rule to choose one of Democrats' handpicked options.

The staffer told Fox News Digital that Hamilton's comments show how common it is for the opposing parties in West Virginia to offer only the "most radical" candidates for vacancy appointments.

Del. Wayne Clark, R-Charles Town, reserved comment on Hamilton's statements but told Fox News Digital that Kirk's murder is a "tragic loss for our country" and that his "ability to debate while maintaining civility is unmatched in anyone in our lifetime."

"Those who feel that his assassination is justified for any reason should question their moral beliefs on the preservation of life," Clark said.

State Del. Geno Chiarelli, a Republican who also represents Monongalia County like Hamilton, confirmed discussions have been going on in the legislature about how to punish Hamilton, up to and including expulsion.

Chiarelli told Fox News Digital he isn't officially part of such considerations but would support expulsion if the caucus leadership decided that was the route they want to go.

A Charleston official also cited an uphill climb for expulsion versus censure or other punishments, as it would require a 2/3 vote of the 91-9 GOP-majority chamber.

"The left is already trying to downplay this, but the reality is sobering: Charlie Kirk was murdered by somebody who thought he was ‘full of hate'," Moore said, calling the murder "left-wing terrorism" brought about by "endless demonization" by the Democratic Party.

Beyond Mountaineer country, several other lawmakers have come under fire for their responses to Kirk's murder.

In Bernville, Pennsylvania — a quiet Pennsylvania Dutch community best known for its nationally recognized Christmas Village — the town's Democratic mayor posted a clip from Charlie Kirk's podcast implying he was glad Kirk had died.

"This is what MAGA represents. This is what Trump lowered flags for," wrote Mayor Shawn Raup-Konsavage, according to Allentown's WFMZ-69 News.

"If this represents you, then I don't want to hear that you are offended that I'm glad he is gone."

Raup-Konsavage previously made headlines after President Donald Trump's first assassination attempt, with a post that reportedly read, "Try harder."

Bernville Borough Councilman Wayne Lesher told WFMZ that while he disagrees with Raup-Konsavage, the remarks were made on a private page under First Amendment protections.

"You're celebrating the death of somebody. That's nothing to celebrate," Lesher said.

Separately, a councilmember in Tucson, Arizona, faced blowback for an apparently misspelled post meant to read "Karma," after Kirk's murder, according to the city's CBS affiliate.

Another West Virginia official – a mayor in the Northern Panhandle – expressed surprise at criticisms he said outnumbered people who voted in the previous municipal election.

Wellsburg, West Virginia, Mayor Dan Dudley reportedly wrote, "Sad day in America. Flying an American flag half-mast for a racist. Priceless. Wellsburg Mayor Daniel L. Dudley," according to Wheeling's ABC affiliate.

State Del. Jimmy Willis, R-Wellsburg, told the outlet that whether it is attacks on Kirk, Trump or Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, "violence is never the answer."

Fox News Digital reached out to Hamilton and the NAACP's Kingwood chapter for comment.

TACOMA, Wash. (AP) — A helicopter crashed in Washington state near Joint Base Lewis-McChord, the U.S. Army said Thursday. There was no immediate word of how many people were aboard and their conditions.

The helicopter crashed at about 9 p.m. Wednesday near the base, an Army official said in a statement.

“This remains a developing situation, and no additional details are available at this time,” the statement said. No details were released about the helicopter.

The base is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Tacoma under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Joint Base Headquarters.

The Thurston County sheriff's office, based in Olympia, posted online late Wednesday that deputies were dispatched to reports of a possible helicopter crash in the Summit Lake area, west of Olympia. 

“We have been advised that the military lost contact with a helicopter in the area,” the department said. It said it was working with the base and that no further details were available.

Thurston County Sheriff Derek Sanders said on Facebook that deputies located the crash site, “but have been unable to continue rescue efforts as the scene is on fire.”

The King County Guardian 1 helicopter and special operation rescue units responded to the crash site, the sheriff said.

Right on Crime executive director Brett Tolman and retired FBI special agent Robin Dreeke discuss the alarming rise in justifying political violence on ‘America Reports.'

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting blasted on social media after posting a picture supporting American Federation of Teachers (AFT) chief Randi Weingarten's new book that suggests her political opponents are "fascists."

"Congratulations to my friend [Weingarten] on ‘Why Fascists Fear Teachers.' From banning books to controlling curriculum, authoritarians go after public education because it's a cornerstone of democracy," Clinton posted on Wednesday, along with a picture of Weingarten holding the book. 

"Randi's new book is a critical read for this moment," she wrote.

Clinton was criticized by conservatives for the post, which they argued continued the smear campaign against political opponents that many believe contributed to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

"It's been one week since Charlie Kirk was murdered by a lunatic who wrote about ‘fascists' on shell casings," Republican communicator Matt Whitlock posted on X. 

"Now, Randi Weingarten has a new book arguing everyone who disagrees with her views on public education – which have destroyed public education in America – is a fascist."

American Culture Project senior fellow Corey DeAngelis wrote on X, "Hillary Clinton and Randi Weingarten are going full speed ahead with this disgusting rhetoric right after Charlie Kirk's assassination. Sick people."

"Charlie Kirk was murdered exactly one week ago," conservative influencer Jack Posobiec posted on X. "Here's Hillary Clinton today:"

"They wrote an entire book on a word they don't even understand," restaurateur and Huntington Beach City Council member Andrew Gruel posted on X.

"The room. That's what y'all should read," Washington Free Beacon investigative reporter Chuck Ross posted on X.

"Democrats Hillary Clinton and Randi Weingarten are still suggesting Republicans are ‘fascists,'" an account belonging to the Republican National Committee (RNC) posted on X.

"They really can't help themselves, can they?"

Fox News Digital reached out to Clinton's office for comment on the post, which has racked up 2 million views on X, but did not immediately hear back.

"Have they read the book?" Weingarten said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "If they did they'd discover it's a love letter to teachers."

Weingarten's book, which hit bookshelves Tuesday, elaborates on her views on battling what she says is fascist ideology and how it works to "undermine democracy, opportunity and public education as we know it."

"Attacks on schools and teachers have long been a hallmark of fascist regimes: Throughout history, as many dictators rose to power they began banning books and controlling curriculum," the book's preview reads. "Fascists fear teachers because teachers foster an educated and empowered population that can see past propaganda and scare tactics. Fascists fear teachers because they teach young people how to think for themselves." 

Media pundits and conservatives have been pointing to the left's years of claiming conservative figures such as Kirk are "fascists." 

Following Kirk's assassination at the hands of a shooter authorities say embraced a leftist ideology, numerous examples have surfaced of liberal pundits, politicians, professors and other individuals celebrating or downplaying the death of Kirk, prompting many to blame heated political rhetoric from the left as a contributor to Kirk's death.

WASHINGTON (AP) — At a moment of growing international alarm about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, more U.S. adults view Israel's military action in the Palestinian territory as excessive than at the beginning of the war, according to a new poll.

About half of Americans say the military response from Israel in the Gaza Strip has “gone too far,” according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That's up from November 2023, when 40% said Israel's military action had gone too far. That AP-NORC poll was conducted shortly after Hamas started the conflict by launching an Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages.

But at the same time, Americans overall, particularly Republicans, are less likely to say that negotiating a ceasefire should be a high priority for the U.S. government than they were just a few months ago when the U.S. was holding ceasefire talks with Hamas.

The shift in American attitudes about Israel's actions comes as Israel begins an expanded ground offensive on Gaza City. Israel is facing increased international scrutiny over its conduct in Gaza, with a team of independent experts commissioned by the United Nations' Human Rights Council this week announcing it has concluded that Israel is committing genocide. 

Israel has already destroyed vast areas of Gaza, displaced around 90% of the population and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with experts announcing a famine in Gaza City. The Palestinian death toll has surpassed 65,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

“The level of innocent women and children suffering,” said Renee Hollier, of Lafayette, Louisiana, who described herself as a political independent and mother of a toddler. “There's just no justification for this kind of suffering to continue.”

The poll found a bipartisan uptick in Americans finding Israel's military response has “gone too far.” 

About 7 in 10 Democrats say this now, up from 58% in November 2023. And roughly half of independents say the same, compared with about 4 in 10 in the earlier measure. Republicans have also moved slightly, from 18% to 24%.




Concern about overreach from Israel was high in January 2024, when 50% of U.S. adults said Israel had “gone too far,” but that fell slightly as the war continued.

And 45% of U.S. adults now say it's “extremely” or “very” important for the U.S. to provide humanitarian relief to Palestinians in Gaza, similar to Americans' views at the start of the war but up slightly from 41% in March.

Miguel Martinez, 55, of Miami, said it remains critical for President Donald Trump's Republican administration to prioritize humanitarian relief even as it backs the Israeli military's effort to defeat Hamas. Martinez supports Israel's aim to defeat Hamas, but he's concerned that the conflict is dragging on.

“Not everyone there is the enemy,” said Martinez, a Republican who said he broadly approves of Trump's handling of the conflict. “Those people need help.”

Despite the growing view that Israel has overstepped, Americans are less likely to consider it a high priority to negotiate a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas than they were when the Trump administration was heavily involved in negotiations. That downward shift is primarily driven by Republicans. 

About half of U.S. adults say it's “extremely” or “very” important, down from 59% in March but in line with views from last year. Republicans have grown less likely to say it's “extremely” or “very” important for the U.S. to negotiate a permanent ceasefire since earlier in the year, while Democrats haven't shifted.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the conflict will continue until Hamas is eliminated and the remaining hostages are released from captivity. Hamas has said its assault was in response to the more than decadelong blockade of Gaza, Israeli raids inside West Bank cities, increasing attacks by settlers on Palestinians and the growth of settlements.

In interviews, Americans across the political spectrum were dour about the prospects of the Trump administration mediating a lasting ceasefire. During the campaign, Trump pledged to quickly end the Israel-Hamas war as well as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He's struggled with both.

Approval of Trump's handling of the conflict is down slightly among U.S. adults to 37%, compared with 44% in March.

“There's an all-or-nothing attitude on both sides,” Martinez said of Israel and Hamas. “Any resolution, any ceasefire, it's hard to see it being anything more than temporary.”

Netanyahu last week approved an audacious strike targeting Hamas officials in the Gulf emirate of Qatar, an operation that killed six people but that Hamas claims failed to kill any of the group's leaders. The attack also threatened to upend months of ceasefire diplomacy mediated by Qatar, which has served as an intermediary with Hamas.

Larry Kapenstein, 71, a Democrat from Middletown, Pennsylvania, said he's worried about the conflict's long-term ramifications for Israel's economy and standing in the world.

“I side with Israel, and I think they're in the right in this, but I think Netanyahu has just taken this too far,” Kapenstein said. “There's got to be a better way.”

About 3 in 10 U.S. adults said it is “extremely” or “very” important to negotiate the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, unchanged from January 2024. But that belief is especially pronounced among Democrats: About half now say this is highly important, up from 41% in 2024. That compares with 19% of independents and 14% of Republicans. 

The U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly last week to support a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict and urge Israel to commit to a Palestinian state, a move that Netanyahu vehemently opposed and that the U.S. was one of the 10 countries to vote against.

The survey also found slightly less support for military aid for Israel.

About 2 in 10 U.S. adults said it is “extremely” or “very” important for the U.S. to provide aid to Israel's military to fight Hamas, down from 36% at the war's start. The decline has been particularly dramatic among Democrats, from 30% at the beginning of the war to 15% now.

Lehks Wright, 50, of Albany, Georgia, who is an independent, said it's difficult to justify spending billions of dollars backing Israel's military when the Trump administration is calling for sweeping cuts in federal spending on health care and other social programs.

“If you're going to say we're in a deficit and there's government bloat, and I am not doubting that, then cut spending on other countries, too,” Wright said.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,183 adults was conducted Sept. 11-15, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.

University of Oregon sophomore Maggie Thorsby discusses the 'Charlie Kirk effect' that has inspired an outpouring of support for Turning Point USA in the days following his assassination on a Utah college campus.

FIRST ON FOX: More than a dozen state attorneys general sent a letter to public university and college presidents in their respective states Thursday warning them against invoking the assassination of Charlie Kirk to chill conservative free speech, or face investigations and potential lawsuits, Fox News Digital exclusively learned. 

"Unfortunately, we have heard troubling reports that some university officials are using the murder of Charlie Kirk as a justification to shut down speech on campus," the letter reads. "While considering safety concerns, it is critical that universities are not imposing what would effectively be a tax on free speech." 

"Particularly at this moment, when free speech itself was attacked, our universities must show through their actions that they will defend free speech and resist the ‘Assassin's Veto.' You have an obligation to protect free speech—you must not use the burden of protecting free speech to prevent free speech."

The "assassin's veto" is understood as a phenomenon of using violence or threats of violence to silence opposing views.

At the heart of the letter is the issue of security costs as it pertains to conservative speakers. Colleges and universities previously have come under fire over accusations of charging higher security fees for conservative speakers.

Such accusations have led to free speech lawsuits in the past, including the University of California, Berekely, settling a lawsuit with campus conservative groups, the College Republicans and Young America's Foundation, in 2018 concerning allegations the school discriminated against conservative speakers by leveling higher security fees and other safety restrictions that led to the cancellation of right-leaning speakers on campus. 

Berkeley argued that the higher security fees were based on assessment from law enforcement officials that the speakers were likely to face an increase in public disruption and violence, before reaffirming its "commitment to free speech" and changing its security fee operations. 

The state attorneys general called on colleges to ensure they "impose security fees in a content-neutral and viewpoint-neutral manner" or face potential investigation and legal action.

YEARS OF CAMPUS ATTACKS ON CONSERVATIVE ACTIVISTS RESURFACE AFTER CHARLIE KIRK'S MURDER

"Any security policy that appears neutral on its face must not be applied in a discriminatory manner. There is a long and troubling trend of universities misusing security policies to unconstitutionally chill conservative speech on campus. For example, just last year, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico issued a preliminary injunction against the University of New Mexico after the university attempted to charge Turning Point USA over $5,000 in security fees for an October 2023 event featuring conservative speaker Riley Gaines. As the Court found, that was unacceptable," the letter continued, pointing to another instance of colleges using security fees to allegedly silence conservative voices. 

The letter was spearheaded by Republican Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird. A total of 17 Republican state attorneys general signed onto the letter, including top law enforcement officials from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Utah. 

"The tragedy of Charlie Kirk's assassination is a sobering reminder that the right to free speech must be protected," Bird told Fox Digital. "Charlie was murdered while debating on a university campus, a place where the free exchange of ideas should be encouraged; we cannot allow the actions of an assassin to stop free speech in any way. Colleges and universities must take steps to keep their students safe while preserving free discussion and open debate." 

Kirk was killed Sept. 10 while he was at Utah Valley University's campus as part of a Turning Point USA event. The conservative powerhouse was sitting under a tent while chatting with students when a single shot rang out and struck Kirk in the neck. 

"We were shocked and saddened by the assassination of Charlie Kirk on the campus of Utah Valley University on Wednesday," the letter reads. "As the chief law enforcement officers of our states, we unequivocally condemn political violence of any kind. The fact that the slaying took place on a college campus, during a debate, makes it even more tragic." 

"It is critical our state institutions of higher learning serve as forums for robust debate from all perspectives," the letter continued. "The campus should be the very place where the First Amendment rings loudest for all to hear. We urge you to say no to the 'Assassin's Veto.'"

The attorneys general argued that students might be considered "consumers" under the respective states' Consumer Fraud Acts or Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices laws, and that the universities might violate state "laws if you invoke ‘security concerns' to impose exorbitant fees on student groups," while simultaneously advertising to students that the school is open for discussion and dialogue across the political spectrum.

"If we receive complaints about your school, we will fully and fairly investigate those complaints subject to the authority of our respective offices," the state attorneys general wrote. "Our offices are committed to ensuring that all our state entities, including our public colleges and universities, follow the Constitution." 

Conservative nonprofits, including President of Defending Education Nicole Neily, celebrated that the AGs' calls for better protecting free speech is the ideal way to honor Kirk's legacy. 

"This is a moment for leadership, and we are deeply grateful that the nation's attorneys general are using their authority to remind university administrators of their sacred obligation to protect free speech and open discourse on college campuses," she said. "I can think of no better way to honor Charlie's legacy than through ensuring that students voices cannot be silenced by fear or malice." 

Will Hild, the executive director for Consumers' Research, a longtime nonprofit dedicated to consumer information, lauded Bird for leading the charge on ending the "assassin's veto."

"By sustaining the assassin's veto, these University bureaucrats are actively aiding Charlie's murderer, using the threat of violence to cut off free debate," Hild told Fox Digital. "Such a practice is not just antithetical to everything Charlie Kirk represented but to the very principles of America. Attorney General Bird's leadership in rallying states' top law enforcement officers to oppose the Assassin's Veto in all its forms is encouraging and should be emulated by others. Last week's atrocity should be a turning point for every American campus."

NEW YORK (AP) — Nvidia, the world's leading chipmaker, announced on Thursday that it's investing $5 billion in Intel and will collaborate with the struggling semiconductor company.

The two companies will team up to work on custom data centers that form the backbone of artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as personal computer products, Nvidia said in a press release.

Nvidia said it will spend $5 billion to buy Intel common stock at $23.28 a share. The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, comes a month after the U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel. 




“This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. “Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.”

The two companies said they will work on “seamlessly connecting” their architectures. 

In morning trading, Intel shares jumped 25%, its biggest one-day percentage gain in decades. Nvidia shares added 2%.

For data centers, Intel will make custom chips that Nvidia will use in its AI infrastructure platforms. While for PC products, Intel will build chips that integrate Nvidia technology.

The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, which was a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut. 

Intel fell even farther behind in recent years amid the artificial intelligence boom that's propelled Nvidia into the world's most valuable company. Intel lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, and expects to slash its workforce by a quarter by the end of 2025.

The U.S. government stepped in last month to secure a 10% stake, making it one of Intel's biggest shareholders. Federal officials said they invested in Intel in order to bolster U.S. technology and domestic manufacturing. 

The deal is “bullish for U.S. tech,” Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note.

“This is a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game,” Ives said. “Along with the recent U.S. government investment for 10% (equity stake in Intel) this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors.”

Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the artificial intelligence boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems. 

The deal between the two chipmakers comes as China moves to be less dependent on U.S. semiconductor technology. This week, Chinese officials reportedly forbade several large domestic technology companies from purchasing Nvidia chips, and Huawei announced that it was expanding its development of AI chips and manufacturing.

While Nvidia and Intel will work together to develop new chips, a manufacturing deal has yet to be struck between the two. The potential access to Intel's chip foundries by Nvidia poses a risk to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which currently manufactures the tech giant's flagship processors.

            Tesla is looking into redesigning the way to open its car doors in an emergency following﻿ several accidents where passengers were reportedly trapped in burning vehicles because rescuers could not open them.
    


            Even without an accident, other Tesla owners have reported having to break their own car windows after buckling their children in and then being unable to get in the car again, according to an investigation launched by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, citing owner complaints. An investigation by Bloomberg found 140 incidents of people being trapped in their Teslas due to problems with the door handles, including several that resulted in horrific injuries.
    


            Tesla design chief Franz von Holzhausen said in a podcast Wednesday that the company is looking to combine the manual and electronic release mechanisms in the doors, which are now separate, in order to make escaping the car easier and quicker in a “panic situation.”
    


            “The idea of combining the electronic one and the manual one together into one button, I think, makes a lot of sense,” he said in an interview for Bloomberg's Hot Pursuit! podcast. “That's something that we're working on.”
    


            It's unclear if Tesla is working on a fix for all of its cars or just the new ones, but it's unlikely the company will be able to combine the two ways of opening the door on existing models.
    


            The door handles of the Tesla Model S and Model X extend and retract, while the door handles on the Model 3 and Y mechanically flip out when pressed in. But when that fails, the doors need to be opened with a manual door release inside the vehicle to get out. That can happen if there's a loss of power following a crash.
    


            And the location of the manual release buttons can be difficult to find, especially to a young child alone in a car, or a passenger who is not familiar with the vehicle, like in an emergency situation. The Bloomberg investigation found numerous instances of passengers who were killed or severely burned by post-crash fires when rescuers on the scene were unable to open the doors.

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — After well over a century under construction, Barcelona's Sagrada Familia basilica is ready to raise its immense central tower and become the tallest Christian church in Europe.

The basilica's General Director Xavier Martínez said Thursday that “the tower will be finished at the end of this year or the beginning of 2026.”

“This is an important moment in the history of the building of the Sagrada Familia because it will reach its maximum height,” Martínez told The Associated Press. “We are used to seeing skyscrapers like those in the United States (go up), but it is remarkable that in the 21st century we are building a cathedral.”

Once the gigantic Tower of Jesus Christ is up, the masterpiece of architect Antoni Gaudí will rise to 172 meters (564 feet). That will make it taller than the Ulmer Münster church in southern Germany, which tops out at 162 meters (531.5 feet).

The first pieces are already in place and the rest will be added in phases over the coming months. Once complete, the structure will be crowned by a cross and tightly surrounded by five other towers, one dedicated to Mary and four slightly shorter ones for the four evangelists.




Work on the facades and interior will continue for several years, the church's head of construction Esteve Camps said, but the goal is to finish building work in approximately a decade from now.

Next year will be the 100th anniversary of the death of Gaudí. The church will hold several events to celebrate his legacy, which includes several stunning buildings in Barcelona and other places in Spain.

Pope Leo XIV has been invited for a solemn Mass to be held in Gaudí's memory on June 10, the day he died when struck by a streetcar in 1926. Sagrada Familia officials said that they hope to have a response from the Vatican in the coming weeks.

Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the Sagrada Familia (Holy Family in Spanish) and designated it a minor basilica in 2010.

The first stone of the Sagrada Familia was placed in 1882. Gaudí never expected it to be completed in his lifetime. Only one of its multiple towers was finished when he died.

A fervent Catholic, Gaudi incorporated both Christian symbolism and organic forms into his unique aesthetic.

Work has sped up over recent decades as the basilica became a major international tourist attraction. The money from entrance fees is used to fund the ongoing construction. Last year, 4.9 million people paid to visit it, with 15% of those tourists coming from the United States.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  In Snap, we look at the power of a single photograph, chronicling stories about how both modern and historical images have been made.



            Depicting a crisscross of welts and scars streaked across the body of a formerly enslaved Louisiana man, “Scourged Back” is one of the 19th century's defining photographs. The image was so widely circulated in America during the Civil War that it reshaped the abolitionist cause by laying bare the abominable cruelty of slavery to a largely oblivious northern public.
    


            More than 160 years later, the influence of this visceral portrait — whose subject may have been called Peter or Gordon — continues to be felt. Musuems, libraries and universities across the US display historic prints of the image, which is often used to educate audiences in a country still reckoning with its past.
    


            But amid growing political debate over how history is presented in America's museums, the 1863 photo has become a flashpoint in the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's efforts to eradicate what it calls “corrosive ideology” from federally owned sites.
    


            On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that officials at an unidentified national park had ordered that the photo be taken down, along with other signs and exhibits related to slavery. Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper described the move as being in line with an executive order Trump issued in March directing the US Interior Department to do away with content that disparages “Americans past or living.”
    


            The department, which oversees the National Park Service, has since denied the report.  Spokesperson Elizabeth Peace told CNN via email that sites were not asked to remove the photo. She added: “If any interpretive materials are found to have been removed or altered prematurely or in error, the Department will review the circumstances and take corrective action as appropriate.”
    


            By then, however, the story had already sparked concern among artists, activists and curators. The National Parks Conservation Association was among those voicing disapproval, with senior director of cultural resources Alan Spears saying that removing the photo would be “as shameful as it is wrong.”
    


            The dust-up comes as Trump escalates attacks on museums, going so far as to slam the Smithsonian Institution for being overly concerned with “how bad Slavery was.” In turn, the furor around “Scourged Back” has also generated renewed interest in the story behind the photo and what it means today.
    


            “I find it all very strange,” movie producer and The Black List founder, Franklin Leonard, told CNN's Abby Phillip in response to the Washington Post report. “What more great American story is there than the survival and triumph over enslavement, Jim Crow and (its) repercussions?”
    


            While there is limited historical consensus on Peter's escape — or even his name — the pictured man is thought to have fled a Louisiana cotton plantation in early 1863. Traveling on foot to Baton Rouge, his clothes torn and muddy, he eventually reached Union lines, which under President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was enough to be considered permanently free and eligible to join the US army's “Colored Troops.”
    


A sultry kiss, flipped — the artist turning found photographs into uncanny new images



            According to one written record of his testimony, the man said he was severely whipped by his former owner's overseer after attempting to “shoot everybody” (though he had no recollection of the alleged incident). He was bed-bound for months following the beating.
    


            After undergoing a medical examination, Peter seemingly sat for a series of portraits at a photography studio owned by William D. McPherson and J. Oliver. The studio produced at least three versions of the image, adjusting their composition and Peter's pose as they went along, with the most famous variant — the third — taken some time after the other two.
    


            To David Silkenat, a historian at Scotland's University of Edinburgh, this assiduous approach suggests that whoever took the photo understood how impactful it could be. “The most significant difference in the final photograph is that Gordon's neck is twisted more to the left towards the camera, revealing his full profile and his beard, which is either totally or partially obscured by his shoulder in the other images,” Silkenat wrote in an influential 2014 research paper on the photo. “The combined effect of these minor changes in the photos' composition made the final image subtly, but noticeably more arresting.”
    


            The picture was originally produced as a “carte de visite,” a relatively affordable kind of small-format photograph commonly sold, shared and traded by Civil War soldiers. Unlike earlier forms of photography, the negatives could be easily reprinted on paper, meaning images could spread quicker than before (cartes de visite are often dubbed the “social media” of their day).
    


            As the photo gained traction in the summer of 1863, abolitionist newspaper The Liberator recounted an enlightening example of its spread: A surgeon in an all-black regiment in the Union Army had sent a copy of “Scourged Back” to his brother in Boston along with a note reading, “I have seen, during the period I have been inspecting men for my own and other regiments, hundreds of such sights — so they are not new to me; but it may be new to you. If you know of anyone who talks about the humane manner in which the slaves are treated, please show them this.”
    


            The Liberator also directly disseminated the portrait, which is also known as “whipped Peter,” to readers for 15 cents, or $1.50 for 12.
    


            “If you look at abolitionist newspapers, they're not only talking about what this image means, they're also selling the image to subscribers,” said Matthew Fox-Amato, an associate history professor at the University of Idaho and author of “Exposing Slavery: Photography, Human Bondage, and the Birth of Modern Visual Politics in America,” in a phone interview. He added: “It goes viral, if you will, because it is that carte de visite technology that entails reproducibility.”
    


            By July 1863, “Scourged Back” had found its way onto the pages of Harper's Weekly, a more mainstream publication, where it appeared as part of a triptych in an article titled “A Typical Negro.” While the magazine claimed the three photos depicted the same man — whom they called Gordon — historians believe each picture showed a different individual. The magazine is also thought to have sensationalized the subject's story and conflated his account with that of other escapees, writing that Gordon rubbed himself with onions to throw bloodhounds off his scent (academics have since struggled to independently corroborate details of his journey to Baton Rouge).
    


            The hugely popular Harper's Weekly was how many middle- and upper-class Americans stayed up to date with the Civil War. In an early demonstration of the power of photography as a medium, it was the image, not the story itself, that captured — and horrified — their imaginations. This was especially so in the north, where people had largely been spared visceral depictions of slavery.
    


            “The image, in many ways, visually confirmed things that abolitionists — including formerly enslaved people — had been saying for the longest time: that violence was at the core of American slavery,” said Fox-Amato, adding “it also confirmed… what photography could do — that photography can serve as a tool of justice,” he added.
    


            The sight of Peter's scarred, beaten back continues to inspire and inform. In 2017, celebrated Black artist Arthur Jafa appropriated the photo for his sculpture “Ex-Slave Gordon.” Then, at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, the photo appeared in artist Kadir Nelson's George Floyd-themed collage for the New Yorker cover, while also inspiring photographer Dario Calmese's Vanity Fair shoot with Viola Davis, her back turned to the camera. The formerly enslaved man's story was then retold in the 2022 movie “Emancipation” starring Will Smith.
    


Rare 19th-century images show China at the dawn of photography



            Meanwhile, the National Portrait Gallery and the National Museum of African American History and Culture are among several US institutions that still own prints of the photo. Both museums are part of the Smithsonian, which — according to a letter sent to its secretary, Lonnie Bunch III, by White House officials last month — is now obliged to present America's heritage in ways that are simultaneously “historically accurate” and “uplifting.” The Trump administration has begun a wide-ranging review of Smithsonian museums' content, and has signaled that it expects the institution to start implementing corrections around the end of the year.
    


            Whether the resulting changes compromise the Smithsonian's stated mission of presenting “the complexity of our past” will undoubtedly become a matter of debate. And what  the president's attempts to restore “truth and sanity to American history” mean for future displays of “Scourged Back” remains to be seen.

            Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has described Gaza as a potential real estate “bonanza” and claimed he was talking to the United States about how to divide up the war-torn enclave.
    


            Speaking at the Urban Renewal Summit in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, the far-right minister said that Israel and the US had “paid a lot of money for the war, so we need to share percentages on the land sales in Gaza.”
    


            Smotrich also said he had already started negotiations with the US on how to divide Gaza, claiming there was a business plan on the matter sitting “on President (Donald) Trump's desk.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            “We have done the demolition phase, which is always the first phase of urban renewal – now we need to build,” he said.
    


            Smotrich's comments follow similar remarks by Israel's far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who said on Monday that he planned to build a “magnificent neighborhood” for Israeli police officers in Gaza after Israel's operation in Gaza City is over.
    


            Trump has previously said that he viewed Gaza as a “big real estate site” and proposed expelling 2.1 million Palestinians from the territory before transforming it into a “Riviera” that would be owned by the US.
    


            In February, the president even posted a video on his Truth Social account – which appears to have been created with generative AI – promoting the transformation of Gaza into a Gulf state-like resort featuring a golden statue of himself, a hummus-eating Elon Musk, and shirtless American and Israeli leaders lounging on a beach.
    


Israeli tanks surround Gaza City ahead of ground incursion as EU proposes sanctions amid global outcry



            The proposal received mass condemnation from the international community.
    


            Israel's far-right has long wanted to move Palestinians out of Gaza, a prospect that critics have said would amount to ethnic cleansing.
    


            Fears are rising further for Gaza's plight as Israel said it has begun a planned invasion of Gaza City, the enclave's largest, pushing more than 1 million residents to overcrowded areas further south in the strip.
    


            As of Wednesday, Israeli tanks were stationed on the edge of Gaza City ahead of the planned ground operation, according to eyewitnesses and satellite imagery.

The do's and don'ts of asking an AI for health advice.

An artist in Germany who liked to draw outdoors showed up at the hospital with a bug bite and a host of symptoms that doctors couldn't quite connect. After a month and several unsuccessful treatments, the patient started plugging his medical history into ChatGPT, which offered a diagnosis: tularemia, also known as rabbit fever. The chatbot was correct, and the case was later written up in a peer-reviewed medical study.

Around the same time, another study described a man who appeared at a hospital in the United States with signs of psychosis, paranoid that his neighbor had been poisoning him. It turns out, the patient had asked ChatGPT for alternatives to sodium chloride, or table salt. The chatbot suggested sodium bromide, which is used to clean pools. He'd been eating the toxic substance for three months and, once he'd stopped, required three weeks in a psychiatric unit to stabilize.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

You're probably familiar with consulting Google for a mystery ailment. You search the internet for your symptoms, sometimes find helpful advice, and sometimes get sucked into a vortex of anxiety and dread, convinced that you've got a rare, undiagnosed form of cancer. Now, thanks to the wonder that is generative AI, you can carry out this process in more detail. Meet Dr. ChatGPT.

AI chatbots are an appealing stand-in for a human physician, especially given the ongoing doctor shortage as well as the broader barriers to accessing health care in the United States. 

ChatGPT is not a doctor in the same way that Google is not a doctor. Searching for medical information on either platform is just as likely to lead you to the wrong conclusion as it is to point toward the correct diagnosis. Unlike Google search, however, which simply points users to information, ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) invite people to have a conversation about it. They're designed to be approachable, engaging, and always available. This makes AI chatbots an appealing stand-in for a human physician, especially given the ongoing doctor shortage as well as the broader barriers to accessing health care in the United States.

As the rabbit fever anecdote shows, these tools can also ingest all kinds of data and, having been trained on reams of medical journals, sometimes arrive at expert-level conclusions that doctors missed. Or it might give you really terrible medical advice.

There's a difference between asking a chatbot for medical advice and talking to it about your health in general. Done right, talking to ChatGPT could lead to better conversations with your doctor and better care. Just don't let the AI talk you into eating pool cleaner.

Plenty of people are talking to ChatGPT about their health. About one in six adults in the United States say they use AI chatbots for medical advice on a monthly basis, according to a 2024 KFF poll. A majority of them aren't confident in the accuracy of the information the bots provide — and frankly, that level of skepticism is appropriate given the stubborn tendency for LLMs to hallucinate and the potential for bad health information to cause harm. The real challenge for the average user is knowing how to distinguish between fact and fabrication.

“Honestly, I think people need to be very careful about using it for any medical purpose, especially if they don't have the expertise around knowing what's true and what's not,” said Dr. Roxana Daneshjou, a professor and AI researcher at the Stanford School of Medicine. “When it's correct, it does a pretty good job, but when it's incorrect, it can be pretty catastrophic.”

Chatbots also have a tendency to be sycophantic, or eager to please, which means they might steer you in the wrong direction if they think that's what you want.

The situation is precarious enough, Daneshjou added, that she encourages patients to go instead to Dr. Google, which serves up trusted sources. The search giant has been collaborating with experts from the Mayo Clinic and Harvard Medical School for a decade to present verified information about conditions and symptoms after the rise of something called “cyberchondria,” or health anxiety enabled by the internet.

This condition is much older than Google, actually. People have been searching for answers to their health questions since the Usenet days of the 1980s, and by the mid-2000s, eight in 10 people were using the internet to search for health information. Now, regardless of their reliability, chatbots are poised to receive more and more of these queries. Google even puts its problematic AI-generated results for medical questions above the vetted results from its symptom checker.

If you've got a list of things to ask your doctor about, ChatGPT could help you craft questions.

But if you skip the symptom checking side of things, tools like ChatGPT can be really helpful if you just want to learn more about what's going on with your health based on what your doctor's already told you or to gain a better understanding of their jargony notes. Chatbots are designed to be conversational, and they're good at it. If you've got a list of things to ask your doctor about, ChatGPT could help you craft questions. If you've gotten some test results and need to make a decision with your doctor about the best next steps, you can rehearse that with a chatbot without actually asking the AI for any advice.

In fact, when it comes to just talking, there's some evidence that ChatGPT is better at it. One study from 2023 compared real physician answers to health questions from a Reddit forum to AI-generated responses when a chatbot was prompted with the same questions. Health care professionals then evaluated all of the responses and found that the chatbot-generated ones were both higher quality and more empathetic. This is not the same thing as a doctor being in the same room as a patient, discussing their health. Now is a good time to point out that, on average, patients get just 18 minutes with their primary care doctor on any given visit. If you go just once a year, that's not very much time to talk to a doctor.

You should be aware that, unlike your human doctor, ChatGPT is not HIPAA-compliant. Chatbots generally have very few privacy protections. That means you should expect any health information you upload will get stored in the AI's memory and be used to train large language models in the future. It's also theoretically possible that your data could end up being included in an output for someone else's prompt. There are more private ways to use chatbots, but still, the hallucination problem and the potential for catastrophe exist.

Even if you're not using AI to figure out medical mysteries, there's a chance your doctor is. According to a 2025 Elsevier report, about half of clinicians said they'd used an AI tool for work and slightly more said these tools save them time, and one in five say they've used AI for a second opinion on a complex case. This doesn't necessarily mean your doctor is asking ChatGPT to figure out what your symptoms mean.

Doctors have been using AI-powered tools to help with everything from diagnosing patients to taking notes since well before ChatGPT even existed. These include clinical decision support systems built specifically for doctors, which currently outperform off-the-shelf chatbots — although the chatbots can actually augment the existing tools. A 2023 study found that doctors working with ChatGPT performed only slightly better at diagnosing test cases than those working independently. Interestingly, ChatGPT alone performed the best.

That study made headlines, probably for the suggestion that AI chatbots are better than doctors at diagnosis. One of its co-authors, Dr. Adam Rodman, suggests that this wouldn't necessarily be the case if doctors would be more open to listening to ChatGPT rather than assuming the chatbots were wrong when the doctor disagreed with their conclusions. Sure, the AI can hallucinate, but it can also spot connections that humans may have missed. Again, look at the rabbit fever case.

“Patients need to talk to their doctors about their LLM use, and honestly, doctors should talk to their patients about their LLM use.”

“The average doctor has a sense of when something is hallucinating or going off the rails,” said Rodman, a hospitalist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and instructor at Harvard Medical School. “I don't know that the average patient necessarily does.”

Nevertheless, in the near term, you shouldn't expect to see Dr. ChatGPT making an appearance at your local clinic. You're more likely to see AI working as a scribe, saving your doctor time taking notes and possibly, one day, analyzing that data to help your doctor. Your doctor might use AI to help draft messages to patients more quickly. In the near future, as AI tools get better, it's possible that more clinicians use AI for diagnosis and second opinions. That still doesn't mean you should rush to ChatGPT with your urgent medical concerns. If you do, tell your doctor about how that went.

“Patients need to talk to their doctors about their LLM use, and honestly, doctors should talk to their patients about their LLM use,” said Rodman. “If we just both step kind of out of the shadow world and talk to each other, we'll have more productive conversations.”

            The NFL season may be young, but the stakes are already high heading into Week 3. Joe Burrow is sidelined again, Patrick Mahomes is in uncharted territory, and a handful of teams are staring down the dreaded 0-3 start.
    


            Here are five things you need to know.
    


            Bad news in Cincinnati: Joe Burrow is out once again.
    


            The Bengals quarterback – who was placed on injured reserved on Tuesday – suffered turf toe that requires surgery and is expected to miss at least three months, according to reports, derailing another season before it really gets going.
    


            It's the latest blow in what's become a frustrating cycle of injuries for Burrow and the Bengals. Still, Cincinnati has opened 2-0 for the first time since 2018, giving the team a little cushion. Backup Jake Browning takes over as the Bengals visit the 1-1 Minnesota Vikings on Sunday.
    


            Minnesota has quarterback issues of its own, with rookie J.J. McCarthy sidelined two to four weeks by an ankle injury. That leaves Carson Wentz, once cast aside, with another chance to prove he belongs.
    


            The Indianapolis Colts have done something no NFL team has ever done in the Super Bowl era: they haven't punted through two games. That's not just efficiency – it's borderline absurd.
    


            Quarterback Daniel Jones, rejuvenated in Indy, has clicked with running back Jonathan Taylor to power a 2-0 start, capped by last week's win over Denver.
    


            For now, Rigoberto Sanchez has the strangest job in football: punter without a punt. That streak could end Sunday when the Colts play their first road game against Tennessee, but the fact it lasted this long shows just how dangerous Indy's offense looks.
    


            The Chicago Bears are in a rough spot at 0-2, including a 52-21 mauling at the hands of the Detroit Lions that showed how far they still have to go.
    


            Fans expected second-year quarterback Caleb Williams and new head coach Ben Johnson to spark a turnaround, but so far the offense has been inconsistent, and the defense has been flat-out bad.
    


            Chicago's next test is a clash with the Dallas Cowboys, whose defense just gave up 450 yards passing to Russell Wilson.
    


            If Williams and the offense can't take advantage of that matchup at home, expect the Soldier Field boos to rain down early.
    


            For the first time in his career, Patrick Mahomes is 0-2.
    


            The Chiefs' 20-17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in last week's Super Bowl rematch marked their third straight defeat dating back to last season. That hasn't happened since Andy Reid and Mahomes joined forces.
    


            Kansas City fans aren't used to this kind of start – especially after celebrating three Super Bowl titles in the last six years. No one's hitting the panic button yet, but if the Chiefs fall to the New York Giants on Sunday night and drop to 0-3, it would spark a full-on crisis in KC.
    


            Falling to 0-3 is essentially a death sentence for playoff hopes.
    


            Only six teams in NFL history have started 0-3 and rallied to reach the postseason. The most recent example was the 2018 Houston Texans, and before that you have to go back to the 1998 Bills. It's rare for a reason – digging out of a three-game hole in a league built on parity is almost impossible.
    


            This week, 10 teams are staring at that cliff: the Chiefs, Texans, New York Jets (who will be missing starting QB Justin Fields due to a concussion), Miami Dolphins, Giants, Cleveland Browns, Tennessee Titans, Bears, New Orleans Saints and Carolina Panthers. That means a slew of “must-win” games in Week 3, even though the calendar still says September.

Mehdi Hasan explains why he'll debate (almost) anyone.

The death of Charlie Kirk reignited heated discussions about political speech in America, especially the value of arguing with people you disagree with.

One company, Jubilee Media, has tapped into that sentiment and has been going viral on YouTube these last couple of years with its high-energy and high-drama — and yes, gimmicky — debate shows where one person faces off against a big group of people who disagree with them. (Kirk himself made an appearance on a Jubilee show in 2024: “Can 25 Liberal College Students Outsmart 1 Conservative?”)

Jason Y. Lee says he founded the company to foster debates and build empathy in a polarized country. But critics argue that some of Jubilee's content could be categorized more as voyeuristic clickbait than high-minded discourse. One show has women arranging themselves based on perceived attractiveness and men rearranging them; another involves blindfolded guessing games about which participant is Black or white.

More recently, Mehdi Hasan — author and founder of his own media company, Zeteo, and former host of his own MSNBC show — appeared on Jubilee's flagship debate show, Surrounded. His episode was called “1 Progressive vs 20 Far-Right Conservatives,” and that too made waves.

Hasan said he was prepared to vigorously defend his views, something he's become known for over the years. But when he showed up, he wasn't expecting some of the featured debaters to openly call for his deportation (Hasan is a US citizen originally from England) — or for one to proudly declare himself a fascist. The episode offered unusual insight into the promise and perils of political debate, how we practice politics in the age of algorithms, and the value — and limits — of engaging with those you fundamentally disagree with.

Today, Explained co-host Noel King spoke with Mehdi Hasan about his appearance on Surrounded — and what it taught him about this charged political moment.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Where did you learn to debate?

Where did I learn to debate? I think around the dinner table. My family is very disputatious. The Hasans are known for having strong views. There was a lot of debate around the kitchen table, the dining table, political, social, cultural, religious.

We planned to do a show on the Jubilee debates and the argument about whether they are of value or not. And we called you because you appeared in one of these debates that went very viral, and then Charlie Kirk was assassinated in Utah and many people said Charlie Kirk was doing it right. He was showing up; he was debating people he disagreed with. That's the right way to do politics. Do you agree with that?

No, I don't believe that Charlie Kirk was practicing politics the right way, to quote former Vox boss, now New York Times columnist, Ezra Klein, a good friend of mine. I totally disagree with Ezra on that piece he wrote. I do have to add the standard caveat because Fox keeps clipping some of us on the left out of context.

Obviously [Kirk] shouldn't have been killed. Obviously, we all condemn his murder. Obviously, a political assassination in response to speech you don't like is unacceptable in America and very scary.

But if you're asking me about the content of what Charlie Kirk said when he was alive, it was awful, it was horrific, it was reactionary, it was bigoted. This idea that he was some kind of Socratic debater trying to get to the truth? No, he wasn't. He was doing a “Prove Me Wrong” tour over the years where he and Ben Shapiro and others go to college campuses, find some guy with blue hair who says something provocative and then dunk all over him, and then clip it up and go viral and then have a YouTube video saying, “Charlie Kirk/Ben Shapiro destroys college student.”

All right. What about Jubilee?

So Jubilee's a little bit different. Jubilee claims to be nonpartisan; they say that they are trying to get people from all sides to get in a room together. I mean, on paper what they're aspiring to is at minimum neutral, if not good. What turns up on YouTube is not necessarily always the case.

Tell me why you decided to go on Surrounded.

There were multiple reasons. One is, as I say, I like a good argument and 20 to one — those are good odds. I'll take those odds. The idea of going into the lion's den and debating a bunch of people who disagree with me, I thought would be fun.

Number two, I spoke to my good friend Sam Seder from the Majority Report who had done a Jubilee, and he told me that it's worth doing. It does actually have value — you will reach a whole new audience. And people like my daughter and my nieces and others we're saying, “Oh yeah, Jubilee, we know Jubilee, all the kids watch Jubilee.”

And it's amazing since I did Jubilee how many younger people are now coming up to me in the street versus older people because they recognize me from that circle debate show. So it was a chance to reach a new audience. That was number two.

And number three, it looked like a lot of right-wingers have been dominating that space. Prior to me going on Jubilee, all the top-rated people who had done Jubilee on YouTube with the most views were Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, Candace Owens, Michael Knowles. That was the lean of YouTube and Jubilee. And I thought, well, actually, maybe people like me and Sam Seder can try and give a different point of view.

And what happened?

What happened was the craziest two hours of my professional life as a journalist. I was not expecting — and maybe I should have been — the kind of people I sat across. I'd watched a lot of Jubilees. I'd watched Sam Seder's show. I knew there were a couple of people who came and said white supremacist things and far-right things and dumb things. But I didn't expect one after another person to be telling me to my face that I should leave the country, that I'm not a real American. “I'm a proud fascist,” one person told me very early on in the debate.

What? Normally, people wanna deny the f-word. We spent the last week with Republicans up in arms that anyone would call them fascists, and how that's what led to the death of Charlie Kirk. And yet here I was sitting in a warehouse with a bunch of young, mainly white people saying proudly, yes, we are fascists, we are racist.

How do we debate fascists? Should a person debate fascists?

No. And that's why I said at the time, if you watch that clip, about halfway through the conversation, I said, “What are we doing here? I don't debate fascists.” And all of the right-wingers watching in the circle, they got very upset because Jubilee then moved this guy out. And so many of them spent the next two hours, every time they came up to the chair to debate me, they would say, “Oh, you're banning people you don't agree with.”

And I was like, “That's not what it is. I don't debate fascists because fascists don't believe in democracy. They don't believe in debate. They don't believe in my equal worth as a human being. So why would I debate such people?”

Fascism at its core is an anti-democratic, authoritarian, and yes, very violent ideology. So, no, I don't believe there is value to debating fascists. And if I'd known that people would be sitting down dismissing the Holocaust or saying, “I'm a fascist,” or saying the country was built for white people or whatever it is, I would not have gone on that show, or I would've said, “Get other people.”

Look, I come from a proud anti-fascist tradition on the left where you don't platform fascists, you don't indulge them, you don't meet them halfway. You defeat fascism by defeating the ideology, by offering something better and by being truthful.

You know, a person who appreciated your appearance on Surrounded might say, these fascist-y types are out there. They're influencing young people in a real way. At least you showed up and gave them a run for their money.

That is the silver lining. I guess you could argue if — and this is gonna make me sound very egomaniacal and immodest, so I apologize in advance — I guess people could say, if you're gonna debate fascists, might as well be someone who's good at debating. And that's what I'm known for doing. So it's better me than someone else who goes on and gets their ass handed to them.

So in that sense, I get it, but the counterargument I get as well, a lot of my critics were saying to me: “Just by going on, you legitimize them just by going on. You amplified them just by going on. You gave them credibility and respectability. They were able to clip up their clips and put it online and say, ‘Look, look, look, we own this mainstream journalist. We told them to get the F out of our country.' ”

Do you think you changed anyone's mind by appearing on Surrounded?

Certainly not in that room. No. And that wasn't the goal.

What is the goal in debating if not to change minds?

So my goal is not to change my opponent's mind. Very rarely can you change your opponent's mind. My goal is to change the people watching. When you're debating on stage, as I have done, or whether you're debating on YouTube and 10 or 11 or 12 million people now have watched that Surrounded show, you are hoping that in that 11 or 12 million people, there are a handful of people who are truly open-minded, truly independent people.

Most people are partisans, whether they want to admit so or not, but you hope that you found some independent folks to go, “Hmm, that's a good point that I hadn't heard before, that's a good statistic that I wasn't aware of, that's a good way of framing the issue.” And, look, people have reached out to me over the years. I've spent the last year and a half doing nonstop debates. I've done a lot of debating about Gaza, another very polarizing issue, and people have reached out to me, and I have had messages from people saying, “I have switched my positions on this issue.”

Charlie Kirk and meme culture's violent turn.

The bullet casings authorities recovered during their investigation of Charlie Kirk's killing make at least one thing clear: The alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, was speaking the language of memes.

“Hey Fascist! Catch!”, “If you Read This, You Are GAY Lmao,” and “O Bella ciao…” read some of the engravings on bullets, both used and unused, in the shooting last week. Their meanings are hard to parse — they're ideologically inconsistent, wrapped in layers of irony and earnestness, and reference various online communities and video games.

In a text exchange with his roommate and partner, reproduced by authorities in charging documents, Robinson references the inscriptions, calling them “mostly a big meme.” “[If] I see ‘notices bulge uwu' on fox new[s] I might have a stroke,” Robinson allegedly said.

It all suggests this act of violence, which seems to have been driven by opposition to “hate” Robinson thought Kirk was spreading as well as some left-leaning ideas, was also wrapped up in a kind of dark, nihilistic, deeply online meme culture that has been spawning, or at least inspiring, acts of violence over the last half-decade. Memes started to make more of an appearance in the killings carried out by mass shooters, beginning most notably in 2019, during attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Memes, and deeply online references, also appeared in Luigi Mangione's alleged killing of a health insurance CEO and in school shootings this year in Wisconsin and Minnesota.

It's a complicated world to parse, so we turned to Elle Reeve, someone who has a history of investigating and explaining the shady corners of the internet that have started dealing serious damage in the real world. Reeve is a correspondent for CNN and the author of the book Black Pill: How I Witnessed the Darkest Corners of the Internet Come to Life, Poison Society, and Capture American Politics — all about the kinds of (mostly) men who get sucked into dark worlds online, and as she's put it, “talk themselves into doing strange, cruel, or violent things because it all started with just jokes, man.”

Below is an excerpt of Reeve's conversation with us, edited for length and clarity. Listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

It's been almost a week since Charlie Kirk was killed. What do we know at this point about his alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson?

To me, we still don't know enough. We know that he was a young man, he is referred to as very smart and quiet by a lot of his friends that have talked to the press. He scored well in his ACT, according to a post his mom made, but he dropped out of college after the first semester. He was a big gamer — really into video games. And according to investigators, he was dating his roommate, [who they say is transgender].

The first tranche of information we got about this alleged shooter was when investigators revealed what he allegedly wrote on the bullet casings. Could you help us understand what exactly he wrote?

So the first one is “Notices bulge OWO what's this?” This is a furry meme. This one has thrown a lot of people for a loop. Luckily, people aren't trying to attribute a lot of politics to it because it's so confusing. But it's a reference to furries. It's a 10-year-old meme. It comes from an image that's a drawing of two middle-aged, unattractive men role-playing with each other online, making sexy talk as furries. And if people don't know, that's kind of like a sort of sexual thing where you like imagining yourself as an anthropomorphic animal, usually a specific one…

He wrote a whole bunch of jokes. He wrote dumb internet jokes. Some of them, if it were in a movie, would be funny. But he wrote them before killing a person. That's what's, honestly, pretty chilling. It's one of the details that's hard for me to get past.

So this can be interpreted as a pro-furry joke or an anti-furry joke because hating furries on the internet is a big thing both in the right-wing world and in other very online spaces. But it's also been reclaimed by furries, kind of like the word “queer.” So the point of saying all that is that an outsider trying to establish with certainty what exactly was being expressed by this message — that's a fool's errand. You just don't know. We just don't know. We're getting a few more details, but it's still pretty ambiguous.

Which feels similar to another casing, which said, “If you Read This, You Are GAY Lmao.”

Exactly. That's the fourth cartridge. And that one — again, I saw other people pick this up on the internet — for me, what it conjures is, like a grizzled law enforcement veteran, bulletproof vest, bends down in the dust to pick up a piece of evidence. And it says, “If you read this, you're gay,” right? You're supposed to laugh, or the image is funny. And yet he did it before killing somebody. So it's not a strong statement about how you should vote in the midterms, that's for sure.

What do the rest of them say?

So the second cartridge says, “Hey, Fascist! Catch!” and has these arrow symbols. It's a reference to a video game called Helldivers 2, which is kind of like a fascist satire. The arrow symbols are what bring the biggest bomb in the game. The third cartridge is, “Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Ciao, Ciao.” So that's an old anti-fascist song, history buffs are very familiar with this…I'm told it's a meme among anti-fascists — I have done quite a bit of reporting with them and I had never come across it. But that's the internet, I guess… It's become more popular because it's in a Netflix show called Money Heist. And if you go on TikTok, you can see people doing goofy dances to it while ordering coffee. And it's in a video game as well. But broadly, this could be taken as a left-wing anti-fascist message.

And is this what leads people to immediately say that this guy is left-wing?

That and the bulge thing, I heard Ted Cruz say it was a transgender meme, which is false.

Is there some sort of throughline in what Tyler Robinson may have written on these casings?

Well, he's really into video games. And the dominant pose in these very online chat rooms is ironic detachment — so many layers of irony that you can't even fully understand the author's meaning, other than that they're implying “we're part of an in-group and the people outside don't understand.”

And what do we know about the online spaces that Tyler may have lived in?

We don't know enough. We just don't know enough. We know he was in a few Discords at minimum.

Discord is a gaming chat platform, but you don't have to be using a video game to use it. If you have Slack at work, or something like that, it's kind of like that. There's a group chat function, you can do one-on-one chats, you can talk by audio and by video. I've done quite a bit of reporting in these Discord servers that become cultures unto themselves. They become almost cult-like. I've interviewed incels who spent like 18 hours a day in their Discord server. The Discord server of white nationalists became very important evidence in a federal civil trial involving Charlottesville [and the Unite the Right rally].

How can I put this? The culture, it can become this bubble that leads to very intense groupthink. But what we've seen so far of his messages on Discord — and Discord did confirm that Tyler Robinson had an account — it isn't like that.

We know he had a server with about 30 friends. They messaged him being like, “Bro, you look like these pictures of the alleged shooter.” He's like, “My doppelganger is trying to get me in trouble. Ha ha ha. Better throw away my manifesto and exact copy rifle.” So if he was in a very political space, we have not yet seen evidence of that.

And Discord itself does not necessarily have a right lean or a left lean.

No, no, it's not for that. And there are anti-fascist servers and communist ones and right-wing ones and fascist ones and incel ones.

The part of the culture that is unsettling is that you see in a lot of these spaces is just this nihilistic, black-pilled, ironic culture where nothing is taken seriously. Like you're a loser if you take something seriously.

Which maybe explains why the bullet casings have a bunch of absurdist memes written all over them.

Right. Exactly. Which is how you possibly could get to the place of writing on a shell casing, “if you read this, you're gay.”

Is the bullet casing thing becoming like the new manifesto? It's not the first time we've seen this in one of these high-profile killings in the past year.

So a lot of these mass shooters or public assassinations, they reference each other. So Luigi Mangione [allegedly] wrote on three bullets, “deny, defend, depose,” a reference to how health insurance companies deny people coverage for care that they need. The first time I remember this being a big thing, specifically with messages written on the weaponry in order to be a message to not the wider world, but the circle of online people, the crowd or gang that they hung out in, was with the 2019 Christchurch shooting. That man wrote all kinds of memes all over his guns before killing 51 people in two mosques in New Zealand. That guy had been on this website, 8chan, which is now called 8kun. And…I mean, it was clear from that that he wanted to be a meme. He wrote it for that audience. … It was about speaking to people on 8chan. And he did become a meme there. There are all kinds of illustrations and cartoons and memes about him there. And that's when I started noticing it happening over and over on these weapons.

There was the recent shooting at the Annunciation School in Minnesota. That person also seems to be part of a very strange, nihilistic Discord, and they wrote a lot of messages in English but with Cyrillic letters. But yeah, this is a recurring thing, writing memes on the gun.

And is that to say that these shooters, though they may have very different politics and beliefs, are influencing each other?

Oh, definitely. They obsess over each other. The shooter [who] killed several people at a grocery store in Buffalo in 2022 — his manifesto and actions very directly referenced the Christchurch shooter.

What more did we learn about the alleged Kirk shooter from the charges yesterday?

The really fascinating thing is his texts with his significant other/roommate after the shooting.

It's clear from the transcript that the roommate was surprised by this.

And he's obsessed with the rifle that was his grandfather's rifle, and particularly that his father will be angry if he has lost the rifle. It's one of the other just surreal things in this exchange. You [allegedly] just killed a guy, and all he can think about is, “my dad's gonna be so mad if I don't bring back grandpa's rifle.”

I think it speaks to the unreality of it all. And there's another message that's related to what we've been talking about. He says, “Remember how I was engraving bullets? The fucking messages are mostly a big meme. If I see, ‘notices bulge, uwu' on Fox News, I might have a stroke.”

This whole incident, or at least what we know of it so far, just feels like a very uncomfortable clash of I live online versus I live in the real world.

Yes, yes. And particularly when talking to older colleagues who did not grow up online, it's been very hard to explain. And you see it in the national discourse, too. This is not about supporting Trump, anti-Trump. It doesn't break down into easy political motivations. Many of the young people that I have talked to who are like…locked into these worlds, they think that's absurd, rooting for one party or another. You're a dupe or a fool if you care about that stuff.

It's probably helpful to clarify what we mean by these people being “very online.” It's something very different than what a lot of us know.

Right, it's not just like scrolling Twitter a lot and being appalled by it. Just to talk about the specific people I've talked to, I got really deep into this incel Discord, where people literally were spending 18 hours or more online, sometimes they go on binges, more than 24 hours, and the computer was their whole life. They'd be popping in and out of other related Discord servers, chatting, or going on camera or just going on voice.

The server that I was particularly investigating, these guys were obsessed with not being able to get laid, feeling doomed by the way they looked or their personalities, to never get a woman to have sex with them, much less have a relationship and be a normal part of society. But, well, you could start by going outside.

A guy I interviewed in southern Florida, he lived really close to the beach. But he said he'd only been a couple times. He even said to me that one time he was standing in the water looking out at the waves at the horizon and thought, “This is beautiful, but I would like it better if it were on my computer screen.”

That's grim.

Sometimes I'll interview people, and we're talking about this person [as if they're someone] I should know, a celebrity, and I look them up and maybe it's someone with a YouTube account with 300 subscribers. And I'm like, Why am I supposed to know about this? But it has been an object of fixation within that chat room for so much time, they forget that the outside world doesn't think that way.

One of the reasons this meme world talk has blown up is that policymakers and normal people are wondering, How big is this world? How big is this threat? Is it poisoning the minds of young people? How do we understand the scale of it all?

Well, one way to think of it is like Gen Z and Gen Alpha, for them, the internet is the mainstream media, right? It's not like maybe we watch the Emmys and we're checking Twitter on the side as old millennials. But their main stuff is TikTok, Discord, for whatever they're into.

Does that mean we can expect more of this element of absurdism, deeply layered irony in future violent extremists or shooters or gunmen? Will that be the case because of how widespread this online culture seems to be? 

It kind of depends on the subculture. I did a lot of reporting on accelerationists who are trying to accelerate the collapse of society because they think it's irredeemable. So what comes after will be something valuable, a golden age, something better than what we have now. The people I interviewed, that's how they give themselves permission to do bad things. “I'm bringing down this corrupt society.” So all of that is permitted.

So this isn't something that we should expect to not happen again.

Of course, there will still be people who believe in regular stuff, you know? But it is a very large contingent of online culture.

So what do we do to stop this, to combat this? Is it about isolation and loneliness? Is it about regulating online time?

You can look visually at what a lot of the memes communicate. There are a lot of depictions of lonely men who are sad, standing in the middle of a ruined society, some kind of grim atmosphere, and I think that does speak to the way people are feeling. And also like, a lot of kids who spent their critical years locked up during Covid, and it wasn't good for their brain. I mean, even in regular life, post-Covid, I've talked to a lot of people who feel this way, like the work happy hour is more awkward than it used to be, than it was before Covid when people retreated from the world.

Once you stop forcing yourself to confront social anxiety, it gets bigger and bigger and I think that leads to a lot of alienation. There's a nihilistic blackmail cult called 764, the FBI is investigating it, but they look for kids in these online spaces, convince them to send them nudes, and then blackmail these children into doing horrible things, like killing their own pets.

I'm a parent of a toddler. I just want to be like a crazy fundamentalist about my kid not going on the internet. That can be the adversity you have to overcome — a crazy mom who saw an incel shit his pants on purpose in front of her just to troll her. Like, sorry dude, you're just not going on the internet or you're not getting unfettered access to a phone until you're…I don't know, 35?

This is really grim.

Do you want some hope?

Yeah.

So I have these incels I first interviewed in 2018, I thought doing a story on them, maybe they would see that they're not so hopeless if they just went outside and joined society. They were still chatting me from it four years later, but I just reached out to them during this to ask, “What's your take?” And they've left. They rejoined, they have jobs, they go outside.

Some people that I thought were in like the blackest possible space have left, so it is possible. And when I go in that old Discord server, the incel one, I was scrolling up through it, all the chats were from deleted user, deleted user, deleted user. “Deleted user” being — their accounts are gone.

A Spirit Airlines pilot received a stern reprimand from an air traffic controller Tuesday morning after the commercial flight came within several miles of Air Force One, which was transporting President Donald Trump over New York en route to the United Kingdom.

According to live air traffic control audio shared on LiveATC.net, Spirit Flight 1300, traveling from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Boston, was instructed multiple times to alter its course after drifting within 8 miles of the president's aircraft.

“Pay attention, Spirit 1300. Turn 20 degrees right,” the air traffic controller is heard saying.

“Spirit 1300, turn 20 degrees right now.”

“Spirit Wings 1300, turn 20 degrees right immediately.”

🚨 WOW! Air Traffic Control had to SCREAM at a Spirit Airlines flight who was getting too close to Air Force One“Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right IMMEDIATELY! … Pay attention! Get off the iPad!”You couldn't PAY me to fly on Spirit at this point. pic.twitter.com/BUA8d7yWSY

As the Spirit flight hovered at 33,000 feet above Long Island and edged closer to Air Force One, the controller's tone grew increasingly exasperated.

“Spirit 1300, traffic's off your left wing by eight miles — 747. I'm sure you can see who it is. He's white and blue,” the controller snapped, adding, “Pay attention… Get off the iPad.”

The remark was striking in its directness and suggested the pilot may have been inattentive at a critical moment. While commercial pilots are allowed to use iPads and electronic tablets in the cockpit to access navigation charts and checklists, the tone of the exchange sparked questions about situational awareness in a restricted airspace.

Despite the tension in the exchange, aviation authorities confirmed that proper separation was maintained throughout the incident. Data from flight-tracking service Flightradar24 showed that the Spirit plane came no closer than eight miles laterally to Air Force One, which remained at 32,000 feet — just 1,000 feet below Spirit Flight 1300.

In a statement to Fox News, a Spirit Airlines spokesperson reportedly confirmed the aircraft “followed procedures and air traffic control instructions” and “landed uneventfully” in Boston.

“Safety is always our top priority,” the airline said.

The Federal Aviation Administration released a statement acknowledging the incident and confirming it is reviewing the interaction.

“The FAA is aware of social media posts about Air Force One and a Spirit Airlines flight in Boston airspace on Tuesday,” the agency said. “Required separation was maintained between the aircraft.”

Trump was reportedly en route to London for a two-day state visit hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla.

The audio was first flagged by aviation account JonNYC on Bluesky and quickly went viral across social media platforms, with users stunned by the bluntness of the phrase: “Get off the iPad.”

ABC News Chief National Correspondent Matt Gutman has issued a formal apology after facing intense backlash for describing text messages from Tyler Robinson, the alleged assassin of conservative figure Charlie Kirk, as “very touching” during a live broadcast.

The remarks came after a Utah County press conference revealed shocking details about Robinson's alleged murder plot and his text exchanges with his transgender partner, Lance Twiggs, following the Sept. 10 shooting at Utah Valley University.

Gutman attempted to highlight what he described as a “duality” in the case, the contrast between the brutality of the killing and the personal, emotional language in the messages between Robinson and Twiggs.

DISGUSTING: ABC's Matt Gutman says he's not sure “if we have seen an alleged murder with such specific text messages” that were “very touching, in a way, that I think many of us didn't expect — a very intimate portrait into this relationship between the suspect's roommate and the… pic.twitter.com/ulPcxoOwM3

“A very intimate portrait into this relationship between the suspect's roommate and the suspect himself,” Gutman said during the segment. “It was very touching in a way that I think many of us didn't expect.”

But the comment struck a nerve with many, who accused Gutman of romanticizing or sympathizing with the alleged killer.

In response to the controversy, Gutman took to X, formerly Twitter, to explain his intent. 

1. Yesterday I tried to underscore the jarring contrast between this cold blooded assassination of Charlie Kirk – a man who dedicated his life to public dialogue – and the personal, disturbing texts read aloud by the Utah County Attorney at the press conference.

Gutman said he had hoped to underscore the “jarring contrast” between what he described as a “cold-blooded assassination” and the “personal, disturbing” messages that were read aloud at the press conference. He referred to Kirk as “a man who dedicated his life to public dialogue,” and admitted that his commentary failed to make that contrast clear.

He went on to express regret, saying he “deeply” wished he had chosen his words more carefully. Gutman also made clear that there should be “zero doubt” about where he stands on the crime, writing that he “unequivocally condemns” the assassination and the suffering it caused — not only to Charlie Kirk's family and those present at the event, but also to “the millions of people he inspired.”

Despite the apology, critics remained unconvinced.

“ABC and Matt Gutman have really reached a NEW LOW,” one user said. “Gutman found the murderer's texts to his lover, sent immediately after shooting a husband and father in the neck, oh so ‘touching.'”

“Just… what? What are you doing, man?” OutKick commentator Mary Katharine Ham posted.

“He really needs to be fired,” another user added. “Read the room. Or better yet, just report the facts. It's called journalism.”

Others responded with biting sarcasm.

“Ah yes, a modern-day Romeo and Julius,” one user said.

The Utah County Attorney's Office released transcripts of messages between Robinson and Twiggs that prosecutors say were sent just hours after Kirk was fatally shot.

In one message, Robinson told Twiggs: “Drop what you are doing, look under my keyboard.”

There, Twiggs reportedly found a handwritten note from Robinson stating: “I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it.”

When Twiggs asked if the message was real, Robinson replied: “I am still ok, my love, but am stuck in Orem for a little while longer yet. Shouldn't be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still. To be honest, I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you.”

Finally, when Twiggs directly asked whether Robinson was the shooter, Robinson responded: “I am. I'm sorry.”

Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, obstruction of justice, and several additional offenses. Authorities say the act was premeditated and carried out in front of a crowd that included children, a factor that could carry serious sentencing implications.

In this article

President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested that the federal government might revoke the licenses of broadcast television networks that are "against" him.

Trump's comment came a day after ABC suspended airing the "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" show because of comments its host made linking the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to Trump's MAGA movement.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr earlier on Wednesday had hinted that the broadcast license of ABC — which is a subsidiary of Disney — was at risk if it did not "take action on Kimmel."

Speaking on Thursday to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said, "I have read someplace that the networks were 97% against me, again, 97% negative, and yet I won and easily, all seven swing states," referring to his 2024 election win.

"They give me only bad publicity, press. I mean, they're getting a license," Trump said, according to audio from a press gaggle provided by the White House.

"I would think maybe their license should be taken away," Trump said.

The president said that the decision "will be up to Brendan Carr."

Trump specifically referred to criticism he has gotten from Kimmel and CBS late-night talk-show host Stephen Colbert.

"Look, that's something that should be talked about for licensing, too," Trump said.

"When you have a network and you have evening shows, and all they do is hit Trump," he said. "That's all they do. If you go back, I guess they haven't had a conservative on in years or something, somebody said."

"But when you go back, take a look, all they do is hit Trump. They're licensed. They're not allowed to do that. They're an arm of the Democrat party," he said.

Carr earlier Thursday told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" that "we're not done yet" with changes in "the media ecosystem" that are consequences of Trump's election.

"I think Brendan Carr is outstanding, he's a patriot," said Trump, who nominated Carr to his position.

"He loves our country, and he's a tough guy. So we'll have to see."

Broadcast television stations affiliated with networks, including ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox, must receive a license from the FCC to operate because their content is transmitted over the air, and is technically free for viewers as long as they have an antenna.

That contrasts with cable TV networks, whose subscribers pay fees to distributors to watch.

In the days since Charlie Kirk's death, some companies have been forced to navigate a delicate situation: employees sharing their personal views about the conservative activist in public.

For employers, those remarks highlight the growing challenge of balancing free expression with corporate values and workplace harmony.

Major corporations such as Microsoft and Delta Air Lines are taking action against employees who have made social media posts critical of Kirk's own views, or even ones celebrating his death, which could be considered a violation of company values.

Kirk, an ally of President Donald Trump, advocated conservative beliefs on college campuses and was influential among young people on the right. But many find his comments about immigrants, trans rights, and feminism intolerant and divisive.

Here is how some companies are responding.

Microsoft shared an X post on Friday addressing negative remarks about Kirk made online by some of its employees.

"We're aware of the views expressed by a small subset of our employees regarding recent events," the company said. "We take matters like this very seriously and we are currently reviewing each individual situation."

Microsoft said, "Comments celebrating violence against anyone are unacceptable and do not align with our values."

Microsoft's statement came after Tesla CEO Elon Musk called out Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on X in response to an unverified claim that some employees at Blizzard, a video game company owned by Microsoft, had posted comments "trashing" Kirk.

The ODP Corporation, the parent company of Office Depot, apologized to consumers on Friday after footage taken at a Michigan Office Depot gained attention on social media. The footage appeared to show an employee refusing to print a poster for a vigil associated with Kirk.

"The behavior displayed by our associate is completely unacceptable and insensitive, violates our company policies, and does not reflect the values we uphold at Office Depot. On behalf of the Company, we sincerely apologize for this regrettable situation," the company said in a press release.

The company said it fired the employee involved in the interaction.

"We also launched an immediate internal review and, as a result, the associate involved is no longer with the organization," the press release said. "We continue to aggressively investigate the matter and will take action where appropriate."

A spokesperson told Business Insider that Office Depot was continuing to "closely manage" its response to the interaction.

On Friday, Nasdaq said it fired an employee for their remarks about Kirk because they violated company policy.

"We are aware of social media posts by an employee regarding the shooting of Charlie Kirk that were a clear violation of our policy. Nasdaq has a zero-tolerance policy toward violence and any commentary that condones or celebrates violence," the company said on X. "The employee in question has been terminated, effective immediately."

The political analyst Matthew Dowd was widely attacked online after making remarks about Kirk during an appearance on MSNBC's "Katy Tur Reports" on Wednesday.

MSNBC's president, Rebecca Kutler, called Dowd's comments "insensitive" in an X post later that day.

"During our breaking news coverage of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, Matthew Dowd made comments that were inappropriate, insensitive, and unacceptable," the statement said. "We apologize for his statements, as has he. There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise."

Dowd responded in a subsequent Substack article on Friday, confirming that MSNBC had fired him.

"The Right Wing media mob ginned up, went after me on a plethora of platforms, and MSNBC reacted to that mob," he wrote. "Even though most at MSNBC knew my words were being misconstrued, the timing of my words forgotten (remember I said this before anyone knew Kirk was a target), and that I apologized for any miscommunication on my part, I was terminated by the end of the day."

Comcast and Versant executives urged employees to "treat people with kindness" in a memo on Friday. Comcast is MSNBC's parent company. Versant is an independent media company being spun off from Comcast and NBCUniversal that will eventually own MSNBC.

"Regardless of whether you agreed with his political views, his words and actions underscore the urgency to maintain a respectful exchange of ideas — a principle we must champion," the memo said.

The memo added: "As employees, we ask you to embody our values in your work and communities. We should engage with respect, listen, and treat people with kindness."

Perkins Coie, a law firm already at odds with the Trump administration, didn't escape the fray either.

The firm fired a lawyer whose social media posts about Kirk gained attention online, where commentators noted his place of work, a spokesperson told Business Insider.

"These comments do not reflect the views of our firm, and the individual's conduct in posting them fell far short of the expectations we have of everyone who works here," the spokesperson said. "This is not who we are, and the individual was separated from the firm with immediate effect. We offer our deepest sympathies to Mr. Kirk's family."

On Thursday, the Carolina Panthers addressed comments from one of its employees, writing on X, "The views expressed by our employees are their own and do not represent those of the Carolina Panthers."

"We do not condone violence of any kind. We are taking this matter very seriously and have accordingly addressed it with the individual," the post said.

A source told The Athletic the organization fired a public relations employee over his remarks about Kirk.

Delta Air Lines suspended an unknown number of employees over their social media posts about Kirk, a companywide memo viewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian wrote in the memo that those employees were under investigation because the content "went well beyond healthy, respectful debate," according to the AJC.

He added, "Violations of our social media policy can carry meaningful consequences, including termination."

Karen Attiah said she was fired as an opinion writer from The Washington Post after posting on social media about Charlie Kirk.

Attiah wrote a Substack post published Monday that said she was fired after "speaking out against political violence, racial double standards, and America's apathy toward guns."

A Washington Post spokesperson said the paper doesn't comment on personnel matters. The Post's social media policy says in part that Post journalists should not undermine the paper's ability to cover the news fairly and should be civil and treat people with respect.

The day Kirk was shot, Attiah said in a Bluesky post that there was a double standard in how the shooting deaths of Democrats were treated and a failure to address "white men" who commit violence. Attiah wrote a post mentioning Kirk that said the left was prematurely being blamed for his death. Another of her posts referred to not doing performative mourning for "a white man that espoused violence."

It is not clear what particular social-media posts led to Attiah's firing.

Attiah's departure comes in the wake of the Jeff Bezos-owned Post's overhaul of its opinion section, which is now focused on "personal liberties and free markets." That led to the departure of opinion editor David Shipley, along with several of his colleagues, and the appointment of Adam O'Neal to replace him in June.

An ABC spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that it "indefinitely" suspended production of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on Wednesday.

The decision came after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr criticized Kimmel's remarks about Charlie Kirk during a recent episode. During an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson, Carr said the FCC could intervene after Kimmel's comments.

Nexstar, an ABC affiliate, subsequently issued a press release saying it would "preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' for the foreseeable future."

"Nexstar strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk and will replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets," a press release said.

Sinclair, another ABC affiliate, also suspended the show on its stations. The broadcasting company said ABC did not reprimand Kimmel enough and called on the network and the FCC to take "additional action."

"Sinclair also calls upon Mr. Kimmel to issue a direct apology to the Kirk family," a press release said. "Furthermore, we ask Mr. Kimmel to make a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA."

Sinclair said it would fill Kimmel's timeslot with a special dedication to Kirk.

The Trump administration on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to lift lower court rulings that have blocked President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.

The request came a day after Cook participated in a meeting of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, which decided to cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point.

"This application involves yet another case of improper judicial interference with the President's removal authority — here, interference with the President's authority to remove members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for cause," Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the Justice Department's filing Thursday at the Supreme Court.

Trump said on Aug. 25 that he was firing Cook from the seven-member Fed Board, citing allegations that she committed mortgage fraud in connection with two residences she owns.

Cook, who denies wrongdoing, sued Trump to block her removal, arguing he lacked the required legal cause to do so.

A federal district court judge in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 9 barred Trump from firing Cook as her suit plays out. The Justice Department asked a three-judge panel on the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington to stay that order, and that the panel do so before the FOMC met.

The appeals panel in a 2-1 ruling on Monday night refused that request, effectively allowing Cook to remain in her job and to participate in the FOMC deliberations.

Sauer said that the Supreme Court, for several reasons, should stay the district court judge's preliminary injunction reinstating Cook to the Fed while her suit is pending.

He said that the Justice Department is likely to prevail in the lawsuit "because Cook lacks a Fifth Amendment property interest in her continued service as a Governor of the Federal Reserve System," and that her job is not protected by due process considerations.

Sauer also disputed the judge's alternative finding that Trump's rationale for firing Cook for "cause" is not valid because her alleged conduct occurred before she was appointed to the Fed.

"The Federal Reserve Act's broad 'for cause' provision rules out removal for no reason at all, or for policy disagreement," Sauer wrote.

 "But so long as the President identifies a cause, the determination of 'some cause relating to the conduct, ability, fitness, or competence of the officer' is within the President's unreviewable discretion."

Sauer said, "Cook had made contradictory representations in two mortgage agreements a short time apart, claiming that both a property in Michigan and a property in Georgia would simultaneously serve as her principal residence."

"Each mortgage agreement described the representation as material to the lender, reflecting the reality that lenders usually offer lower interest rates for principal-residence mortgages because they view such mortgages as less risky," Sauer wrote.

"When her apparent misconduct came to light, the President determined that Cook's 'deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter' renders her unfit to continue serving on the Federal Reserve Board, and at a minimum demonstrates 'the sort of gross negligence in financial transactions that calls into question [her] competence and trustworthiness as a financial regulator,' "Sauer wrote.

The solicitor general also argued that the district court judge "lacked authority to order reinstatement as an equitable remedy for the removal of an officer of the United States, as we have discussed in several recent stay applications."

If Trump ultimately prevails in firing Cook, he would be poised to have nominated four out of the seven Fed governors.

On Tuesday, the Senate narrowly confirmed White House Council of Economic Advisors Stephen Miran as a Fed governor. Trump nominated Miran to serve the remainder of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's term, which ends Jan. 31.

Kugler unexpectedly resigned in August, without giving a reason.

Miran participated in the FOMC meeting this week.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Thursday sued Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, over what it called "illegal" ticket resale tactics.

The lawsuit was filed in federal court in California. Seven states joined in the lawsuit, including Florida, Illinois and Virginia.

In the filing, the FTC wrote that the companies "tacitly worked" with scalpers, allowing them to "unlawfully purchase" tickets to increase their profits.

"[Ticketmaster and Live Nation's] illegal conduct frustrates artists' desire to maintain affordable ticket prices that fit the needs of ordinary American families, costing ordinary fans millions of dollars every year," the lawsuit reads.

The lawsuit alleged Ticketmaster has taken a "bait and switch" approach, which allows the company to alter its advertising of ticket prices to effectively lift total prices, according to the FTC. It also alleges that the company allows broker to exceed ticket limits on purpose with resale and violates the Better Online Ticket Sales Act.

The FTC alleged that Ticketmaster is effectively "triple dipping" by collecting fees from brokers on the primary market, brokers on the secondary market and consumers on the secondary market. The consumer protection agency said the company made $3.7 billion in resold tickets between 2019 and 2024.

The FTC said the alleged practices have caused injuries to consumers and artists on both sides of the Ticketmaster sales.

"American live entertainment is the best in the world and should be accessible to all of us," FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. "It should not cost an arm and a leg to take the family to a baseball game or attend your favorite musician's show."

According to the FTC, Ticketmaster controls roughly 80% of major concert venues' ticketing, and between 2019 and 2024, consumers spent more than $82 billion purchasing tickets on the platform.

Ticketmaster and Live Nation did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Shares of Live Nation fell roughly 2% after news of the lawsuit.

Ticketmaster is also under investigation in the U.K. over its use of "dynamic pricing" for ticket sales for reunion concerts from Britpop band Oasis. Dynamic pricing is a tactic used in many concert sales to reflect broader shifts in the market, justifying higher prices.

Last year, the Justice Department sued to break up Live Nation and Ticketmaster over alleged antitrust violations, claiming the company had too large a monopoly in the ticketing industry. The lawsuit followed a 2022 probe into the company after a rollout of tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour came under intense scrutiny for its botched rollout.

Starbucks says that customers can ask for political names on their drinks following a viral video in which a barista declined to write the name of assassinated conservative Charlie Kirk on a customer's cup.

Eight baristas told Business Insider that before the corporate clarification, they felt trapped between corporate policy, social media infamy, and, in some cases, their own personal beliefs when customers requested politically loaded names on their to-go cups.

A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the company does not restrict customers who want to use a fake name on their order, even if that name is political. However, the company prohibits baristas from writing other political messages or pop culture references on drinks.

"We aim to be a community coffeehouse where everyone feels welcome, so we have previously provided guidance to our partners to respectfully ask the customer to use a different name when attempting to use political slogans or phrases in place of their name," Starbucks said in a statement published Wednesday. "We are clarifying with our team now that names, on their own, can be used by customers on their café order, as they wish."

The statement was made in response to a TikTok video that went viral on Tuesday. The video showed a Starbucks customer requesting Kirk's name on their Mint Majesty tea, a nod to what the political commentator said in a July video was his favorite drink. The barista behind the counter declined the request to write Kirk's name, citing a corporate policy not to write political messages on cups, and offered instead to write "Charlie."

The customer, who did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, then told the barista to "forget it" and canceled the order.

After the TikTok clip was posted online, it gained traction on conservative social media accounts. It racked up hundreds of thousands of views across platforms and more than 4,000 comments on TikTok, and prompted an avalanche of negative Yelp reviews of the Starbucks store in Yucaipa, California. Many commenters said the barista should be fired.

Kirk, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump's and a right-wing podcaster, was shot and killed on September 10 during an event at Utah Valley University in what authorities have called a "political assassination."

While it's unclear how often Starbucks customers are making such requests of their baristas, several subsequent copycat posts have sprung up on social media, and some Kirk fans have begun posting online, calling for a boycott of the coffee brand.

While the most recent viral incident centered on Kirk, baristas told Business Insider that customers have made similar requests related to Trump, the war in Gaza, Black Lives Matter protests, and other social movements. They said it has become more common since cup notes became required.

"When things like this gain traction, they basically become a meme," one West Coast barista told Business Insider. "And I won't be the punchline."

Since CEO Brian Niccol took the helm in September 2024, the company has mandated that "meaningful" handwritten notes in Sharpie be added to each customer's to-go cup.

Eight baristas who spoke to Business Insider had varying interpretations of Starbucks' guidelines for writing political names on cups, based on what they were told by managers before Wednesday's clarification. Six said they believed they were prohibited, while two said they believed customer requests for political names on their orders would be acceptable under the policy.

Six said the seemingly conflicting policies make them feel set up to fail when customers come in requesting political names written on their to-go cups.

The baristas were granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about Starbucks, but their identities are known to Business Insider. Many others have taken to posting online about how customers increasingly use them as characters in their social media posts about culture war topics. Starbucks has more than 350,000 global staff.

A Kentucky-based Starbucks shift supervisor who has been with the company for over a year told Business Insider they would instruct the baristas in their store to refuse a customer request if they were uncomfortable, despite the risk of discipline or harassment.

"It puts baristas in a very uncomfortable position, given that we are at a workplace and would effectively be getting caught up in a customer's opinion that we may or may not agree with and cannot walk away from," a barista who has worked at Starbucks for more than six years told Business Insider.

A New York-based barista who is a fan of Kirk said such a request wouldn't make them uncomfortable. "I do believe the people doing it are probably just trying to get a reaction out of Starbucks workers," they said.

Robert Post, a constitutional law professor and First Amendment scholar at Yale, told Business Insider that these types of viral social media issues become problematic for Starbucks because they result in negative publicity and put baristas in a "stressful situation."

"You can't win for trying," Post said.

Michael Goldberg, a professor of entrepreneurship and finance at Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Management, told Business Insider that if Starbucks doesn't clearly communicate the rules to in-store staff, it risks problems with retaining talent at a delicate time while striving to improve the customer experience and its stock performance.

Goldberg said the incident is an example of a company policy that aims to better connect the business with its customers, but has a messy rollout at the individual or store level. That messiness results in customers questioning the corporation's position "because these hundreds of thousands of baristas represent the company."

"Retention of talent is paramount to a company like Starbucks — you're only as good as your employees are," Goldberg added. "And it seems as though people genuinely like working at Starbucks, but if they strip away all the things that are appealing about working there, there are many other retail establishments that are hiring, like McDonald's or Wendy's — are they writing notes on their burgers? Maybe Starbucks becomes less attractive."

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and other crypto executives took to Capitol Hill this week as part of a regulatory showdown between the industry and banks with potentially trillions at stake.

Banking advocacy groups are urging lawmakers to prohibit crypto exchanges like Coinbase from offering customers rewards that are structured like interest payments banks offer.

"I'm not sure why the banks would want to bring that up again at this point, but they should have to compete on a level playing field in crypto," Armstrong told CNBC on Wednesday.

Coinbase currently offers a 4.1% reward for those holding USDC stablecoin. Kraken offers a 5.5% on USDC holdings.

Under the recently passed GENIUS Act, customers can't earn interest on stablecoins, but exchanges can offer rewards.

Bank advocacy groups are warning that allowing the rewards will lead to a rush of customers yanking funds from community banks and putting them into stablecoins or other crypto.

"If people are pulling their deposits out of their bank accounts and transferring them into stablecoin investments, you are effectively neutering, to some degree, the ability of the banks to continue to lend into the real economy and to support and fuel the economic growth," said John Court, executive vice president at the Bank Policy Institute, an advocacy group representing banks.

The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee estimated that $6.6 trillion could go from deposits to stablecoins in an April report.

Armstrong called the argument a "boogeyman."

"The real reason that they're bringing this up as an issue is that they're trying to protect the $180 billion that they made on their payment business," he said. "This is something that big banks are funding behind the scenes. It's not small banks whatsoever."

Following a meeting with Senate Republicans on Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the subject of stablecoin rewards did not come up, but that regulators need to be thoughtful about any regulations.

"We're not against crypto," he said.

The American Bankers Association and state association asked in an August 12 letter for lawmakers to "close this loophole and protect the financial system."

Crypto groups hit back several days later in their own letter to lawmakers, saying that preventing exchanges from offering rewards "would tilt the playing field in favor of legacy institutions, particularly larger banks, that routinely fail to deliver competitive returns and deprive consumers of meaningful choice."

While senators have released several drafts of the market structure bill, changes to crypto exchanges offering rewards are still being worked out. 

Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., who is working on the bill with Banking Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., said she believes the issue is settled.

"The issue was heavily litigated in the GENIUS Act, and I am supportive of the compromise achieved by the banks and the digital asset industry," she said in a statement to CNBC. "I do not think this issue should be reopened."

The IRS and U.S. Department of the Treasury this week finalized rules for certain provisions from the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022, including catch-up contributions for 401(k) and other plans, which apply to workers age 50 and older.

Starting in 2027, catch-up contributions generally must be after tax (also called Roth), rather than pretax, for workers who made more than $145,000 from their current employer during the previous year. But some plans could make the change in 2026 "using a reasonable, good faith interpretation of statutory provisions," the IRS said.

In the meantime, those investors can pick between pretax and Roth retirement catch-up contributions, assuming their workplace plans have both choices and their cash flow permits, experts say.

Here's a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business.

Lawmakers added the Roth catch-up contribution provision to Secure 2.0 as a "pay-for" to help fund the legislation.

Roth contributions are after-tax deposits, but the funds grow tax-free. By comparison, pretax contributions reduce your adjusted gross income upfront, but you owe regular income taxes when you withdraw the funds.

Of course, you need to consider your full financial picture when making Roth contributions since a higher AGI can impact eligibility for other deductions.

"Now is the time to work with your advisor or tax preparer to run multi-year tax projections," said CFP Patrick Huey, owner of Victory Independent Planning in Portland, Oregon. 

This could help you decide whether to "accelerate" pretax catch-up contributions through 2026 or "embrace the transition to Roth" sooner, he said.

For 2025, workers can defer up to $23,500 into 401(k)s, and investors age 50 and older can make an extra $7,500 in catch-up contributions. There is also a "super catch-up" contribution for workers aged 60 to 63, which raises the catch-up limit to $11,250.

In 2024, nearly all retirement plans offered catch-up contributions, but only 16% of eligible workers made these deferrals, according to a 2025 Vanguard report based on more than 1,400 plans and nearly 5 million participants.

Most catch-up contribution participants earned $150,000 or more, the report found.

However, the choice between Roth vs. pretax catch-up contributions may depend on several factors, including current and expected future tax brackets, experts say.

The "key takeaway" for investors is, "do not sit on the sidelines" as the rules change, said certified financial planner Jared Gagne, assistant vice president and private wealth manager with Claro Advisors in Boston.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr said Thursday that ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel appeared to "mislead" the American public about facts regarding conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing in the days leading up to his show's suspension.

Carr also told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" that "we're not done yet" with the changes in "the media ecosystem" that are consequences of President Donald Trump's election last fall.

ABC on Wednesday night said it was pulling "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air "indefinitely" because of the host's comments, which linked Kirk's alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, to Trump's "Make America Great Again" movement.

"The issue that arose here, where lots and lots of people were upset, was not a joke," Carr said Thursday on CNBC.

"It was not making fun," said Carr, who hours before Kimmel's show was pulled off the air suggested the FCC might take action against ABC and its parent company, Disney.

"It was appearing to directly mislead the American public about a significant fact that probably one of the most significant political events we've had in a long time, for the most significant political assassination we've seen in a long time," he said.

Utah court documents filed Tuesday in connection with the murder charge against Robinson say his mother told investigators, "Over the last year or so, her son had become more political and had started to lean more to the left, becoming more pro gay and trans-rights oriented."

Those documents also say that when Robinson was asked why he killed Kirk, "Robinson explained there is too much evil, and [Kirk] spreads too much hate."

A day before those documents were filed, Kimmel, in his show's opening monologue Monday, said, "The MAGA Gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it."

Trump on Wednesday evening praised Kimmel's suspension and called on NBC to cancel its own late-night shows, "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," and "Late Night with Seth Meyers."

"Squawk the Street" anchor Carl Quintanilla asked Carr about that on Thursday.

"I asked earlier about Fallon and Seth Meyers, but is the President's view that they should also be taken off the air, shared by the FCC?" Quintanilla asked.

Carr replied,"I don't speak for the President, so he speaks to himself on that."

"Our goal and our obligation here is to make sure that broadcasters are serving the public interest," Carr said.

"And if there's local TV stations that don't think that running that programming does it, then they have every right under the law in their contracts to pre-empt it. And we'll see how this plays out."

"I do think that again, we are in the midst of a massive shift in dynamics in the media ecosystem for lots of reasons, again, including the permission structure that President Trump's election has provided," the FCC chief said.

"And I would simply say we're not done yet with seeing the consequences of that," he said.

CNBC anchor David Faber followed up on that.

"What does that mean when you say you're done yet?" Faber asked. "Then, I mean, will you only be pleased when none of these comedians have a show on broadcast television?"

Carr replied, "No, it's not any particular show or any particular person. It's just we're in the midst of a very disruptive moment right now, and I just, frankly, expect that we're going to continue to see changes in the media ecosystem."

Asked by anchor Jim Craker if the U.S. government should "have someone who reviews the writers before the host says something," Carr said, "No."

Speaking in England on Thursday, Trump said Kimmel "said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk, and Jimmy Kimmel is not a talented person."

"He had very bad ratings, and they should have fired him a long time ago. So, you know, you can call that free speech or not," Trump said. "He was fired for lack of talent."

Kimmel has not been fired.

The president nominated Carr as FCC chair.

On Wednesday, before ABC yanked Kimmel's show, Carr called Kimmel's comments "truly sick" and said there was a "strong case" for action against ABC and Disney.

"This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr told right-wing commentator Benny Johnson that day. "These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead."

"They have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest," Carr said.

Hours after Carr's comments were reported by Johnson, Nexstar Media Group said its stations that are affiliated with ABC would preempt Kimmel's show "for the foreseeable future" because of Kimmel's remarks.

Nexstar is seeking regulatory approval from the FCC for its planned $6.2 billion merger with Tegna

About 10% of ABC affiliates are owned by Nexstar.

House Democratic leaders on Thursday called for Carr's resignation, alleging that he had engaged "in the corrupt abuse of power."

In a statement, the Democrats accused the FCC chairman of "bullying ABC, the employer of Jimmy Kimmel, and forcing the company to bend the knee to the Trump administration."

Former President Barack Obama, in a post on X on Thursday, said, "After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like."

"This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it," Obama wrote.

Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC under a planned spinoff.

Nvidia, once again, has stolen the show — specifically the chip titan's announcement of a massive investment in a struggling rival. 

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite touched fresh records on Thursday, with the indexes coming to life after a tepid response to a widely expected rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. 

The catalyst? A $ 5 billion deal between Nvidia and Intel, which sparked a big rally led by chip stocks in early morning trading. 

Nvidia shares ticked rose 3%, while Intel soared as much as 28%. That puts Nvidia up 30% for the year, while Intel is up about 53% year-to-date.

Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday:

Here were the biggest gainers in the market:

The two chip giants said they would jointly develop custom products, with Nvidia incorporating some of Intel's chips into its AI infrastructure for datacenters, while Intel incorporates some of Nvidia's chips into its PC systems.

"This is a game changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game. Along with the recent US Government investment for 10% this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors," Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note.

The good news is coming after a disappointing Fed day for markets. The central bank issued its widely anticipated 25 basis-point rate cut after its policy meeting on Wednesday.

Investors appeared to sell the news as the cut was priced in for weeks leading up to the meeting, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, told BI.

Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper said the Federal Reserve could cut rates a bit more, but then risks more inflation and other dangers to the economy and markets if the central bank goes further than that.

In other words, be careful what you wish for.

"If they go too much more on interest rates, depending what happens with the economy ... it gets into the danger territory," Tepper said Thursday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "You've got to be careful not to make things too hot."

His comments come after the central bank lowered interest rates by a quarter point Wednesday, the first cut this year, while signaling two more reductions are coming this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the cut as "risk management" rather than something more directed at shoring up a weak economy. President Donald Trump has been pressuring the chief to slash the fed funds rate quickly and aggressively.

Tepper feared that if the Fed lowers rates while inflation hasn't been fully tamed, demand can pick up faster than supply, reigniting price pressures. Meanwhile, too-easy monetary policy could potentially create asset bubbles as investors keep flocking into riskier corners of the markets.

"My view has been that one easing or two easings or even three easings don't matter because we're still in a little restrictive territory with a little bit too high inflation, even without the tariff-induced inflation. So they should be a little bit restrictive," Tepper said. "Beyond that, you're really risking a lot of things, a weaker dollar, more inflation and those sort of things."

The founder and president of Appaloosa Management noted valuations are high, but he wouldn't bet against stocks yet while the Fed is still in easing mode.

"I don't love the multiples, but how do I not own it?" Tepper said. "I'm not ever fighting this Fed especially when the markets tell me ... one and three quarter more cuts before the end of the year, so that's a tough thing not to own."

The S&P 500 is trading at almost 23 times forward earnings, near the highest level since April 2021, according to FactSet. Valuations for some of the megacap tech names have become sky high. Nvidia's price-earnings ratio is at 30 times, while Microsoft trades at nearly 32 times forward earnings.

"I'm constructive because of the easing right now, but I'm also miserable because of the levels," he said. "Nothing's cheap anymore."

Tepper, also the owner of NFL team the Carolina Panthers, revealed he's been trading his Nvidia position. At the end of June, Appaloosa held about $277 million worth of the chip stock, owning it as the fund's seventh-biggest bet.

"I do own Nvidia, but I go back and forth a little bit ... trade a little bit," Tepper said. "We've always had some Nvidia position, but not the same size."

The Federal Reserve's decision to cut its key borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point seems to be sitting well with the White House, if National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is any indication.

In a CNBC interview Thursday, the day after the Fed's move, Hassett noted that the administration, and new Fed Governor Stephen Miran, had been pushing for a bigger reduction. Miran, who is on leave as head of the Council of Economic Advisers, pushed for a half-point cut but was outvoted 11 to 1 on the Federal Open Market Committee.

However, Hassett was not critical of the committee's decision.

"The bottom line is that moving kind of slow and steady and heading towards a target, watch the data come in, that's what prudent policy is," he said on "Squawk Box." "So I know that my colleague Stephen wanted to go to 50 [basis points], but I think 25 was pretty broad consensus, and I think that's a good first step in the right direction to much lower rates."

President Donald Trump, who nominated Miran to the post, has yet to comment on the Fed's decision.

In the past, Trump has launched a barrage of criticism at the central bank, nicknaming Chair Jerome Powell "Too Late" and calling for quick and aggressive cuts. The president has suggested the benchmark federal funds rate should be 3 percentage points lower, a position not reflected in FOMC projections for the future course of policy in updates released Wednesday.

Hassett noted strong economic growth trending above 3% for the third quarter, something that normally wouldn't argue for lower interest rates, particularly with inflation running above the Fed's 2% target.

However, Trump has said cuts are needed to support the struggling U.S. housing market and to help manage financing costs for the nation's $37 trillion debt.

Assessing the economic variables at play and deciding on the incremental reduction was a proper move, said Hassett, who has been mentioned on the short list of Trump's picks to succeed Powell as chair next year.

"I think it's much more prudent for the Fed to be looking at all the models, to have a diversity of opinions and decide, 'What are we going to do in this economy that really looks to be taken off with inflation that's decelerating, but higher than the target?'" he said. "They split the baby in this decision, and I think that's probably a pretty prudent call."

Larry Ellison built the world's second-largest fortune by holding on to his Oracle shares over nearly five decades of ups and downs. At the same time, he's spent billions to fund his philanthropy, vast real estate holdings, sports investments and his son's fast-growing media empire.

How does he manage to spend so much while selling so little?

A close look at the Oracle chairman's finances and shareholdings reveals a fortune built on mountains of leverage and risk, allowing him to borrow against his shares and raise cash without giving up shares or control. At a time when many tech CEOs are following their wealth managers' prudent advice to "take money off the table" and diversify through share sale programs, Ellison represents a triumph of old-school, go-for-broke wealth creation, even at the age of 81.

"Ellison does seem to stand out,  not just for his wealth but for the sheer size of his pledged shares," said Michael Sury, associate professor of practice in finance and managing director for the Center for Analytics and Transformative Technologies at the University of Texas at Austin. 

According to SEC filings, Ellison owned 1.16 billion shares of Oracle stock as of July, representing 41% of the company's total outstanding shares. His individual share ownership is far and away the largest of any of the top 10 tech billionaires. Elon Musk, for instance, owns less than 20% of Tesla, while Mark Zuckerberg owns about 14% of Meta shares and Jeff Bezos' stake in Amazon is down to about 8% of shares outstanding after selling more than $18 billion worth in the past two years.

Ellison has sold Oracle shares over the years, but mostly to exercise options and pay taxes. According to Smart Insider, Ellison has net a total of $5.1 billion from selling shares – representing a fraction of his stake, now worth over $350 billion. The sales included $900 million of shares he sold in 2001, right before the stock plunged on a disappointing earnings report, which sparked an insider trading lawsuit and eventual settlement.

Oracle has also done its part to turbocharge Ellison's equity stake. According to Barron's, Oracle's share repurchase program has reduced the number of outstanding shares by 36% over the past 15 years. The drop in outstanding shares has boosted Ellison's stake from 23% of outstanding shares to 41%, even though his number of shares has remained stable.

Still, Ellison has continued to spend record sums on real estate, sports, collectibles and other assets. His personal empire includes dozens of luxury properties, the Indian Wells tennis tournament, the Hawaiian resort island of Lanai, a collection of vintage fighter jets, a 288-foot mega-yacht and the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa in Manalapan, Florida, which he bought for $277 million last year. The purchase came after he paid $173 million for the 62,200-square-foot mansion in Manalapan that marked the highest-ever sale price at the time for Florida real estate.   

Ellison has also funded a vast array of private companies. He invested in Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter, now called X, offering Musk "a billion or whatever you recommend," according to a text exchange that was later made public. Ellison has also invested in several longevity and tech startups, and he co-founded global sailing league SailGP.

More recently, Ellison has emerged as a behind-the-scenes media magnate. He backed Skydance Media, run by his son David, in its purchase of Paramount for $8 billion, a merger that closed last month. Now, the Ellison family is reportedly backing Paramount's largely cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery in what could be a more than $70 billion deal. Oracle is also among the companies teaming up to buy TikTok's U.S. operations, although it's unclear whether Ellison himself would personally invest.

Ellison has also given hundreds of millions of dollars to philanthropy and made headlines last year as part of an NIL deal for University of Michigan football recruit Bryce Underwood that was reportedly worth $10 million. A signer of The Giving Pledge, Ellison posted on X in July that he will be "concentrating his resources" on the new Ellison Institute of Technology, a partnership with the University of Oxford to find solutions to climate change, disease and world hunger.  

To fund all that spending and still maintain his stake in Oracle, Ellison borrows heavily against his Oracle shares. According to the most recent SEC filing, Ellison has pledged 277 million shares of Oracle common stock as collateral "to secure certain personal indebtedness." The shares represent about a quarter of his total Oracle shares and would have a market value of more than $82 billion on Wednesday's closing price.

Most companies prevent or limit executives from borrowing against their shares to avoid a forced sale during a crisis or share decline. Oracle, however, has given its chairman and largest shareholder more leeway. Oracle's governance committee stated in an SEC filing that it "believes that Mr. Ellison's pledging arrangements do not pose a material risk to stockholders or to Oracle in part because the pledged shares secure personal term loans only used to fund outside personal business ventures." The board said it also believes that Ellison "has the financial capacity to repay his personal term loans without resorting to the pledged shares."

Sury said the size and value of Ellison's pledged shares is "off the charts," and that most boards would never allow that degree of leverage because of the risks to shareholders.

"Ellison is an exception," Sury said. "His wealth and influence make lenders comfortable in a way they would not be with most executives. For many other companies this level of borrowing would raise real governance concerns and likely be viewed as a red flag."

It's unclear how much Ellison has drawn down on the loans. In a rare comment on his borrowing and spending strategy, Ellison told CNBC in 2012 that a $4 billion line of credit against his shares at the time was never drawn down but kept as potential dry powder for big purchases.

"I've got a line of credit just in case I go shopping and something catches my eye," he said, mentioning the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers as a potential example if they came up for sale.

Ellison's hold-and-borrow strategy stands in stark contrast to the sales of Oracle CEO Safra Catz. Catz has continued to sell the options she receives from Oracle as they vest, maintaining a small stake in the company. She exercised and sold options totaling $2.5 billion in the first half of the year, making her the largest insider seller of the year, according to Smart Insider. She sold through a so-called 10b5-1 program, which is a pre-scheduled share sale program, and missed out on the 50% run-up in Oracle stock in the months following.

Bankers and wealth advisors to tech founders and CEOs say there is no right or wrong approach to managing a large stock position in a company.

"It all depends on the person," said Solenn Séguillon, technology practice head at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco, who works with many top tech founders and CEOs. "Everyone has a different comfort level in handling single-stock volatility."

Most tech founders and CEOs, she said, are bullish on their own companies and want to hold onto their stakes as long as possible to grow their wealth. At the same time, they typically want to fund other tech ventures launched by friends or colleagues. Borrowing against their shares not only provides cash, but also potential tax benefits, since they can often deduct the interest on the loans if the proceeds are used for investments.

While some see share pledges and loans as compounding risk, Séguillon said it can be a form of diversification if the loans are used to fund outside investments.

"Borrowing to invest in a number of assets that are accretive or private companies or a more diversified portfolio can help build a hedge," she said. "We discuss with our clients how to be mindful of the risks so they don't end up in a situation where they're over-levered." 

When lending to CEOs or founders with concentrated positions, private banks and wealth management firms say they look at a client's entire balance sheet rather than just the stock position.

Kurt Niemeyer, head of Merrill Lending Solutions group, which offers complex loans to the ultra-wealthy, said a loan to a founder or CEO might include a wide range of collateral, such as real estate, art or even a yacht.

"The larger loans are more focused on the entire balance sheet," he said.

LONDON — Deliveroo CEO Will Shu is set to step down from the food delivery company he co-founded over a decade ago.

Shu, who established Deliveroo in 2013 with childhood friend Greg Orlowski, said Thursday that he will step down as CEO after its takeover by U.S. rival DoorDash is completed.

DoorDash announced its deal to buy the British online takeout platform in May. The acquisition values Deliveroo at £2.9 billion ($4 billion).

"I have decided that now is the right time for me to step down," Shu said in a statement Thursday. "Taking Deliveroo from being an idea to what it is today has been amazing."

"Today the Company's growth and profitability are accelerating and we are delivering on our mission to transform the way people shop and eat, but after 13 years I want to contemplate my next challenge," Shu added.

Deliveroo said that its acquisition by DoorDash "continues to progress as anticipated" and is expected to close on Oct. 2 following a scheduled Sept. 30 court hearing to sanction the deal.

Once it closes, the takeover will represent an end to Deliveroo's tumultuous time in the public markets.

Deliveroo saw its shares plunge 30% in 2021 on the day of its initial public offering, dealing a significant blow to London's ambitions to compete with New York for more high-profile tech listings.

Nvidia said it will invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a deal to co-develop data center and PC chips with the troubled chipmaker, which took on the U.S. government as an investor last month.

Nvidia is investing its stake at a price of $23.28 a share, a release from the company said. Intel shares closed 22.8% higher to $30.57 following news of the deal.

Intel posted its best day since October 1987. Nvidia shares closed 3.54% higher on Thursday.

"This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem -- a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing," said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a release.

Nvidia now joins Softbank and the U.S. government in supporting Intel's turnaround.

Intel shares, which hit their lowest in more than a decade earlier this year, rebounded after finding renewed support from the Trump administration, striking a deal for the U.S. government to invest 10% in the chipmaker in August.

White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said in a statement Thursday that the partnership was a "major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing."

SoftBank also made a $2 billion investment with Intel in August.

The government put $8.9 billion into the chipmaker for 433.3 million shares. That stake is now worth $13.2 billion with shares at $30.57.

A senior White House official said the administration was not involved with the Nvidia-Intel deal.

"What's unclear is whether this represents token cooperation intended for political purposes, or if it's the start of a wider collaboration that would more significantly benefit INTC," wrote Wolfe Research's Chris Caso in a note Thursday following the announcement.

Caso said the biggest question is if Nvidia will manufacture at Intel's fabs.

The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, does not appear to include the manufacturing of Nvidia chips with Intel's foundry.

Intel will build x86 central processing units for Nvidia's AI infrastructure platforms, according to the release. On the PC front, Intel will build x86 system-on-chips using Nvidia's RTX graphics processing units that will power computers.

Nvidia is in the middle of U.S. and China trade negotiations to get approval to sell less-advanced chips in China.

Intel shares were pacing for their best day since October 1987, when they gained 26.4%.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday left Windsor Castle — where he and his wife Melania received the royal treatment — to head to Chequers, the official country residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

The two leaders are engaging in trade and geopolitical talks, as well as meeting with delegations from the U.K. and U.S.

Trump was greeted by Starmer and his wife Victoria, along with another ceremonial guard of honor and bagpipers, when he arrived at Chequers — a 16th-century manor house near London that prime ministers use as a rural retreat and more informal venue for international diplomacy.

Finalizing commitments laid out in the "economic prosperity deal" or U.S.-U.K. trade deal of May are expected to take center stage, as well as more thorny matters regarding 25% tariffs on British steel and aluminum that the U.K. wants reduced to zero. The ongoing wars in Ukraine and Middle East are also likely to feature on the agenda.

Speaking to reporters as he boarded Air Force One to travel to Britain on Tuesday, Trump said he was "into helping" the U.K. finesse the countries' trade deal.

"They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit," he said "We've made a deal, and it's a great deal, and I'm into helping them," he said at the time. "They'd like to see if they could get a little bit better deal. So, we'll talk to them."

On Thursday, the U.S. president and U.K. PM will join British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves for a business reception before giving a joint press conference later in the day.

The state visit has already yielded fruit for the U.K., with £150 billion ($204 billion) worth of inward investment announced in the run-up to and during the trip. The British government hailed the investments on Wednesday, stating that these deals would "boost jobs, drive growth and deliver opportunity for working people up and down the country."

What could be key to day three of the state visit is that Starmer and Trump appear to truly get on. Just why that's the case — when the two men have such different political backgrounds and perspectives — continues to defy logic.

"The Donald Trump-Keir Starmer friendship is an unlikely pair. Starmer is a center-left human rights lawyer, Donald Trump, being the way that we know he is, what defines their relationship is a bit mysterious," Tina Fordham, founder at Fordham Global Foresight, told CNBC on Thursday.

"I'm going to put it in terms of 'soft power' and all of Trump's positive associations [with the U.K.]. Trump doesn't have very many friends on the global stage that are from the left. And it's better than the alternative [of the leaders not getting on]," she said.

While it's uncertain how the Thursday talks will play out, there's no doubt that the U.K. has pulled out the stops to impress its transatlantic ally.

The U.S. president's visit has captivated the nation, with U.K. and U.S. flags lining the packed streets of Windsor on Wednesday, while onlookers spilled out into the roads and blocked cars, vying for better positions.

As early as 5:30 a.m. Thursday, tents lined the streets, housing numerous journalists and TV cameras.

Among onlookers, CNBC's crew spotted several wearing blue "Make Britain Great Again" hats — a spin on Trump's infamous campaigning slogan.

A number of locals commented on the high level of security implemented on site for the president's visit, which some said should not have taken place at all. Indeed, the U.S. president's visit wasn't wholly embraced, with protests against it taking place across Britain.

One American citizen, who said she does not support Trump, nevertheless told CNBC's Ritika Gupta the atmosphere on ground was "marvelous."

The U.S. president notoriously delights in a crowd — and has so far signaled that he is enjoying his second state visit to the U.K.

At a glittering state banquet held at Windsor Castle on Wednesday night, Trump told a swathe of guests that included senior royals, top U.S. and British officials and business leaders, that being invited to Britain for an unprecedented second state visit was one of the "highest honors of my life."

He then raised a few laughs when he joked that he hoped he'd be the only president to get two state visits.

King Charles, in his own speech, praised the U.S. president's "personal commitment to finding solutions to some of the world's most intractable conflicts."

Trumps otherwise basked in the royal limelight on Wednesday, visibly enjoying the pomp and ceremony, which included a royal gun salute, carriage procession through Windsor and guard of honor. Taken with the raft of investments, "it's been a pretty flawless last 24 hours," Duncan Edwards, the CEO of BritishAmerican Business, a transatlantic business networking group, told CNBC Thursday.

"From a U.K. government perspective, they couldn't really have asked for a better slew of announcements coming over the last three days with the civil nuclear, financial services and all the AI announcements," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

Edwards cautioned that "promised dollars" were not the same as "actual dollars" and that it remained to be seen whether the investments promised over the last few days actually materialize.

"You just need to watch what happens over the next months and years what actually gets committed," he said.

The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday stateside cut interest rates by a quarter point, bringing the overnight funds rate range between 4% and 4.25%. That move was fully priced in markets — so traders got what they expected.

It was a near-unanimous decision by the Fed. Only Stephen Miran, picked by U.S. President Donald Trump and confirmed to the Fed board just on Monday, dissented and voted for a half-point cut. Prior to the meeting, there was chatter that governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller — both of whom were also appointed by Trump — might advocate for a larger cut.

While Fed unity projects an image of independence, bolstering its credibility in the eyes of financial markets, the expected rate cut did little to cheer markets.

A majority of central bank officials see only one cut in 2026, far fewer than traders had been pricing in, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The dot plot also showed disparity in rate projections for next year, which means uncertainty over economic outlook. And Chair Jerome Powell characterized the cut as "risk management," suggesting that the Fed was lowering rates out of caution rather than seeing it as necessary to support the labor market.

The S&P 500 edged down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.3%. Only the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose, adding 0.6%.

Markets for now have not really cheered the Fed move — awaiting Trump's calls for a 100 basis point cut to materialize?

Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points and sees two more this year. The decision, made Wednesday, was near unanimous — only newly appointed governor Stephen Miran voted for a 50-point cut. Chair Jerome Powell called it a "risk management cut."

China reportedly bans Nvidia chip. That's according to the Financial Times, which reported that Beijing had ordered companies not to buy Nvidia's RTX Pro 600D, which was custom-made for the country. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he was "disappointed."

Meta unveils first consumer-ready smart glasses. The Meta Ray-Ban glasses cost $799 and come with a built-in display, the company announced Wednesday. The digital display can be controlled by hand gestures via a wristband that detects muscle activity.

U.S. stocks traded mixed on Wednesday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose and hit an intraday high. Markets were mixed in Asia on Thursday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 adding more than 1% to hit an all-time high, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell.

UK's top fintech companies: 2025

The global fintech landscape has been shifting as investors look to countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Singapore for new opportunities. The U.K., however, remains a key hub, thanks to its vibrant financial services sector and venture capital ecosystem.

CNBC and Statista have identified the top 150 fintechs in the U.K, encompassing a diverse set of companies across seven market segments, both within London and beyond. The report builds on a global list of the top 300 fintech companies which CNBC published in partnership with Statista in July.

Novo Nordisk said Wednesday that late-stage trial results for its once-daily obesity pill showed "significant" weight reduction and tolerability in line with its blockbuster Wegovy injection, as drugmakers race to get an oral treatment to market.

Results from the phase 3 Oasis 4 trial showed the oral semaglutide pill led to average weight reduction of 16.6% after 64 weeks in patients with obesity or overweight and at least one weight-related comorbidity, the Danish pharmaceutical firm said.

Shares jumped 5.4% by 10:23 a.m. London time (5:23 a.m. ET). 

Dubbed the "Wegovy pill," Novo Nordisk's Chief Science Officer Martin Holst Lange told CNBC that the oral treatment offered patients an important alternative to its existing once-weekly injection.

"Our job was to show that, with the tablet, we could get the same efficacy and the same safety and tolerability as we can with the injectable. That we have now done," Lange said by phone.

"That basically means that we can offer patients the choice between the tablet and the injectable, and that will make a difference for some patients," he added.

Novo Nordisk's oral treatment relies on the same Semaglutide GLP-1 medication that underpins the company's existing obesity and diabetes treatments, Wegovy and Ozempic. Wegovy was shown to reduce weight by 15% on average in patients with overweight or obesity and at least one weight-related comorbidity in an earlier Novo study.

The pill is currently under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, having been submitted under a New Drug Application in February. A decision is due in the fourth quarter of this year.

If approved, the company said the pill will be made fully in the U.S. It comes as global pharma firms have been ramping up their U.S. investments amid pressure from the Trump administration to bolster domestic production.

There are currently no approved oral versions of GLP-1s on the market, however competition is quickly heating up. Pill treatments are considered a key milestone for firms seeking to make the drugs more accessible, including to those with an aversion to needles.

Analysts told Reuters Tuesday that rival Eli Lilly's competitor obesity pill, Orforglipron, could be fast-tracked for approval within one to two months under the FDA's "Commissioner's National Priority Voucher" — a new initiative to further the Trump administration's drug development goals.

Lange said Novo welcomes "good competition" but added it was focused on drug outcomes, including long-term adoption rates.

"In this situation, we look at the data," Lange said. "Semaglutide as a tablet has the potential to offer 17% body weight loss and with a good safety and tolerability profile."

"What we've seen from our competitor is slightly more than 12% weight loss. And, again, we can't do direct comparisons, but at least we can see a discontinuation rate, suggesting that maybe Semaglutide also has a [more] effective safety and tolerability profile."

In a phase 3 ATTAIN-1 trial released Tuesday, Eli Lilly said Orforglipron resulted in average weight loss of 12.4% at the highest dose after 72 weeks in adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one comorbidity.

Nevertheless, the U.S. drug maker said Wednesday that its pill outperformed Novo's in the first head-to-head study comparing the two medicines' efficacy in lowering blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes. 

Both companies have been experimenting with new so-called next-generation drugs, with Novo on Tuesday flagging promise in its Cagrilintide long-acting amylin analogue — a nascent form of weight loss treatment.

It comes as the Danish company last week announced plans to cut around 9,000 roles as part of a wider shake-up under new CEO Mike Doustdar, who has vowed to reset the company after a period of weaker growth.

"What we are doing now is focusing on our core, which is diabetes and obesity. That will include continuous investment in both diabetes and obesity, and also, as we discussed, the related comorbidities," Lange said Wednesday.

BEIJING — Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei announced Thursday new computing systems for powering artificial intelligence with its in-house Ascend chips, as it steps up pressure on U.S. rival Nvidia.

The company said it plans to launch its new "Atlas 950 SuperCluster" as soon as next year.

The U.S. has sought to cut China off from the most advanced semiconductors for training AI models. To cope, Chinese companies have turned more to grouping large numbers of less efficient, often homegrown, chips together to achieve similar computing capabilities.

Huawei announced it would roll out three new versions of its Ascend chips through the end of 2028, with the aim to "double compute" capabilities with each year's release.

The chips form the basis of Huawei's AI computing infrastructure, in which a supercluster is connected to multiple superpods, which, in turn, are built from multiple supernodes. Supernodes, which form the base, are built on Ascend chips, using system design to overcome technical limitations imposed by U.S. sanctions.

Huawei said its new Atlas 950 supernode would support 8,192 Ascend chips, and that the Atlas 950 SuperCluster would use more than 500,000 chips.

A more advanced Atlas 960 version, slated for launch in 2027, would support 15,488 Ascend chips per node. The full supercluster would have more than 1 million Ascend chips, according to Huawei.

It was not immediately clear how the systems compared with those powered by Nvidia chips. Huawei claimed in a press release that the new supernodes would be the world's most powerful by computing power for several years.

In a speech Thursday, Eric Xu, vice chairman and rotating chairman of Huawei, claimed that its forthcoming Atlas 950 supernode would deliver 6.7 times more computing power than Nvidia's NVL144 system, also planned for launch next year.

Xu even predicted that Huawei's product would "be ahead on all fronts" compared with another Nvidia system planned for launch in 2027 — and claimed the Atlas 950 supercluster would have 1.3 times the computing power of Elon Musk's xAI Colossus supercomputer.

"Huawei's announcement on its computing breakthrough is well timed with recent increasing emphasis by the Chinese government on self-reliance on China's own chip technologies," said George Chen, partner and co-chair, digital practice, The Asia Group.

While he cautioned that Huawei might exaggerate its technical capabilities, Chen pointed out that the Chinese company's ambition to be a world AI leader "cannot be underestimated."

Research firm SemiAnalysis found in April that Huawei's self-developed CloudMatrix system was able to perform better than Nvidia's — despite each Ascend chip delivering only about one-third the performance of an Nvidia processor. Huawei built its advantage by having five times as many chips.

"Computing power has and will continue to be the key for AI," Rotating Chairman Xu said Thursday in a statement, translated by CNBC. He was speaking at the opening of the company's annual Huawei Connect event in Shanghai. The event runs through Saturday.

Two years ago at the same event, Huawei announced its Atlas 900 SuperCluster. The company currently sells a "Atlas 900 AI Cluster" with "thousands" of Ascend chips.

Huawei said Thursday it had deployed more than 300 of its Atlas 900 A3 supernodes to more than 20 customers in telecoms, manufacturing and other industries.

Huawei's announcement comes as China promotes homegrown alternatives to Nvidia. Earlier this week, the two countries wrapped up trade talks in Spain that included a path toward resolving the long-contested U.S. operations of social media app TikTok, owned by Beijing-based startup ByteDance.

In another aggressive signal, China on Monday announced it was extending a probe into Nvidia over alleged monopolistic practices.

Pressure has only risen since on the U.S. chipmaker. Its shares fell more than 2% Wednesday after the Financial Times, citing sources, said China has ordered local tech giants to stop tests and orders of the Nvidia RTX Pro 6000D chip.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told reporters he was "disappointed" to hear the news of the reported ban. He's previously described Huawei as a "formidable" competitor.

Mark Zuckerberg's Meta AI glasses demo went wrong live onstage — twice.

On Wednesday, the CEO took to the stage at the company's annual Meta Connect event to reveal the second-generation Meta Ray-Bans, a neural wristband, Meta Ray-Bans Display with heads-up display, and sports-centered glasses with Oakley.

To drive his point home that AI should serve people and not just "sit in a data center," Zuckerberg connected food content creator Jack Mancuso to the big screen for a live demo on how the newly upgraded Ray Ban Meta glasses could help Mancuso cook — and that is when things began to get awkward.

Mancuso asked the glasses with voice control to show him how to mix a "Korean-inspired steak sauce" for his steak sandwich, but instead of starting with the basics, the AI responded that he should use soy sauce and sesame oil. Mancuso pressed the question of what he should do first multiple times, but the AI ignored his inquiries and moved on with its instructions.

"You've already combined the base ingredients, so now grate the pear and gently combine it with the base sauce," the AI repeated twice.

Mancuso handed the stage back to Zuckerberg and chalked the incident up to a "messed-up" WiFi, and the audience gave an encouraging cheer.

"The irony of the whole thing is that you spend years making technology and then the WiFi at the day catches you," Zuckerberg said before moving on.

The second live demo glitch was not long after he revealed the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses alongside a neural wristband, and called it "one of those special moments."

The Ray-Ban Display is the newest addition to Meta's smart glasses lineup. Not only does it have voice assist and camera features like the Meta Ray-Bans, which have been out for two years, the Meta Ray-Ban Display also has a heads-up display, or HUD, that appears on the right side of the glasses to deliver notifications and navigation prompts without requiring users to look down at a phone.

During the live demo of the Meta Ray-Ban Display, Zuckerberg used the wristband to type messages to Andrew Bosworth, Meta's chief technology officer.

But the demo had a hiccup when Zuckerberg suggested that Bosworth give him a video call. The CEO repeated hand motions with the wristband in attempts to pick up the calls, but none worked, before Bosworth came to the rescue in person.

"This WiFi is brutal," said Bosworth.

"Yeah, I don't know," Zuckerberg responded. "We'll debug that later. You practice these things like 100 times, and then, you never know what's going to happen."

"I promise you no one is more upset about this than I am, because this is my team that now has to go debug why this didn't work on the stage," Bosworth added.

An editor at Business Insider noted that WiFi at large conferences is often spotty. Business Insider reached out to Meta for more information.

Meta shares saw moderate gains of half a percentage point after the demonstrations, and the demo glitches did not seem to lower audience morale. To put it in Bosworth's words, "this is how we know it's live."

President Donald Trump on Wednesday celebrated the news that ABC was pulling "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air for comments the host made following Charlie Kirk's death — and he wants other late-night hosts to be next.

"Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. "Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT."

Trump appeared to be referencing the NBC late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.

The White House and a representative for NBC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump also referred to Stephen Colbert, whose late-night show on CBS was canceled in July. CBS said the cancellation was "purely a financial decision."

ABC, which is owned by Disney, confirmed to Business Insider earlier on Wednesday that it was pulling Kimmel off the air indefinitely. The decision came after the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, publicly condemned Kimmel's comments about Kirk, and after Nexstar, which owns ABC affiliate stations, said it would be pulling Kimmel.

Sinclair, which also owns ABC affiliate stations, said in a post on X that it had also informed ABC it would be pulling Kimmel.

The cancellation followed comments the late-night host made on Monday's episode of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"

"We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them," Kimmel said.

Democratic lawmakers were swift to condemn the cancellation on social media.

"Everybody across the political spectrum should be speaking out to stop what's happening to Jimmy Kimmel," Sen. Chuck Schumer wrote. Sens. Ed Markey and Adam Schiff also expressed outrage at the suspension.

ABC said it pulled Jimmy Kimmel off the air "indefinitely" over his comments about Charlie Kirk's killing, in a move that raised questions about how far is too far for a comedian in 2025.

The suspension is the latest example of a company taking action against an employee following comments that were critical of the circumstances around the conservative activist's killing. Hours earlier, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission had slammed Kimmel's remarks and threatened ABC.

On Monday's show, Kimmel made pointed remarks about President Donald Trump and Kirk's killing.

"We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them," Kimmel said.

According to charging documents cited by CNN, the alleged killer's mother said he "had started to lean more to the left — becoming more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented."

Kimmel also mocked Trump's response to a reporter's question about how he was holding up after Kirk's death. During Trump's answer, the president quickly pivoted to talking about the construction of the White House's new ballroom.

"This is not how an adult grieves the murder of somebody he called a friend," Kimmel said on his Monday show. "This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish."

Kimmel hosts "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," which premiered in 2003. Until this suspension, he was the longest-serving late-night host currently on the air. He's hosted the Primetime Emmy and Academy Awards multiple times.

Disney-owned ABC's decision came after pressure from both the FCC and a prominent company that owns ABC affiliate stations, Nexstar. Affiliate stations carry ABC programming under contract but aren't owned by the network itself.

FCC chair Brendan Carr publicly condemned Kimmel's comments, calling them "the sickest conduct possible." In an interview with YouTuber Benny Johnson, Carr also warned that affiliate licenses could come under review, and that broadcasters are required to operate "in the public interest."

Nexstar subsequently issued a statement saying it would pull Kimmel from the ABC stations it owned, citing his Kirk comments.

"I want to thank Nexstar for doing the right thing," Carr said in a statement to Business Insider after the news that ABC had pulled the show. "Local broadcasters have an obligation to serve the public interest. While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community values. I hope that other broadcasters follow Nexstar's lead."

Some context: Nexstar is seeking FCC approval for its $6.2 billion mega deal to acquire TEGNA. The deal would include 13 ABC stations and make Nexstar by far the country's biggest local TV station owner. The FCC would have to raise the 39% ownership cap to let the deal advance.

Sinclair, another major company that owns ABC affiliate stations, said it would not lift the suspension of Kimmel's show on its networks "until formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability." It also called on Kimmel to issue a direct apology to the Kirk family, and make a "meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA."

The pressure campaign that preceded Kimmel's suspension highlights the government's considerable power to regulate broadcast networks like ABC, as opposed to cable TV and streaming platforms.

Trump cheered the news of the suspension on Truth Social:

The suspension is the latest twist in the culture wars following Kirk's death. Voices on the right have decried certain reactions to Kirk's killing as heartless and horrifying, and others have said such contentions themselves are a form of speech suppression. Meanwhile, defenders of such comments say people on the right who once criticized cancel culture are practicing it.

Some in Hollywood spoke out in support of Kimmel on social media.

The Writers Guild of America West and East said it stood with Kimmel and his writers and against those who oppose free speech. "Shame on those in government who forget this founding truth. As for our employers, our words have made you rich. Silencing us impoverishes the whole world."

"This isn't right," Ben Stiller wrote.

"This is the actual cancel culture everyone claims to hate so much," Alex Edelman of "The Paper" wrote.

Several Democratic lawmakers did the same.

"Everybody across the political spectrum should be speaking out to stop what's happening to Jimmy Kimmel," Senator Chuck Schumer wrote. Senators Ed Markey and Adam Schiff similarly supported the comedian and expressed outrage at the suspension.

Kimmel's suspension comes a few months after the controversy around the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's late-night show in July. At the time, CBS executives said the move was "purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night." Some lawmakers raised concerns that the cancellation could have had a political motivation, noting Colbert had just called out CBS's parent, Paramount, for settling Trump's lawsuit over "60 Minutes" for $16 million. Paramount won the FCC's approval to merge with Skydance later that month.

As Telegram trading bot Snorter Bot Token (SNORT) nears $4 million in presale funding, the project has also rolled out major ecosystem updates that strengthen its position as a serious competitor to existing Telegram bots.

Snorter is Solana-native by design, which gives it faster speeds and lower transaction costs than Ethereum-based rivals that remain weighed down by that network's limitations, even as they expand multichain.

The latest updates show pieces of the roadmap now becoming reality, with features like MEV protection, automated copy trading, and expanded DEX support already taking shape.

The presale remains ongoing, with the current round pricing SNORT at $0.1047 per token for the next 20 hours before the price moves higher in the following round.

The main value of Snorter lies in its ability to spot tokens before the moonshot begins. It achieves this through dedicated RPC endpoints – essentially private data highways that connect directly to the blockchain – giving it faster visibility into the mempool, where pending transactions appear before reaching public order books. 

By tracking liquidity injections, wallet flows, and new contract deployments in real time, the bot identifies tokens showing breakout potential and executes sub-second swaps directly inside Telegram. This gives retail traders a rare chance to act before the wider market catches on.

Until recently, most of that trading happened on Raydium, Solana's primary DEX, which meant Snorter's reach was limited to a fraction of the opportunities. The latest update – first shared by the team on August 22 – expands support to Pump.fun and PumpSwap, Solana's busiest launchpads for new meme coins.

With this integration, Snorter can now plug directly into their smart contracts, scanning fresh pools and routing trades instantly. In practice, this widens coverage so retail users can catch plays at the very start of a coin's lifecycle, when the upside is often greatest.

The updates also make trading more hands-off for users. Automated trading now runs on smarter infrastructure that watches the market continuously and pulls the trigger when targets are met, with real-time notifications sent the moment trades go through. 

Copy-trading has been upgraded as well, with faster wallet mirroring that lets users reliably follow top traders without missing a move.

On September 11, the project released new updates that show the team fine-tuning some of Snorter's core features. 

Withdrawals are now in testing, with added security checks and fee calculations being refined to ensure smooth transfers of SOL and other tokens to third-party wallets. 

Copy-trading is also undergoing early testing, with the team refining mirror logic to ensure trades from tracked wallets are matched smoothly and accurately. 

At the same time, reliability upgrades are being implemented to strengthen failover systems and improve transaction handling, keeping the bot consistent even under heavy load.

These refinements matter because they push Snorter beyond raw speed and early detection. In crypto – where retail often struggles with failed transactions, unreliable copy-trading, or clunky withdrawal processes – stability and security can make the difference between securing profits and losing them.

Taken together, these updates show that Snorter is progressing from concept to a fully operational system tailored for retail traders. 

They lay the foundation for a bot built to give smaller players the same kind of edge whales have long enjoyed, packaged in a tool that runs accessibly inside Telegram.

Investor interest in the presale reflects that potential as $4 million could be hit in a matter of hours. Traders see Snorter as a rare chance to back a bot that could soon rival – or even surpass – incumbents like Banana Gun, Maestro, and Trojan.

And at the center of it all is the SNORT token, which powers the ecosystem by unlocking the lowest fees in the market at just 0.85%, while also serving as the currency for staking rewards, governance, and advanced features that make the bot more effective.

It's no surprise then that top crypto news outlets like Cryptonews have already predicted SNORT could deliver a 30x return once it launches.

To join the presale, head to the Snorter Bot Token site to secure your SNORT tokens using SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or even a credit card.

For the smoothest transaction, use a WalletConnect-certified non-custodial wallet such as Best Wallet, which is regarded as one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets in the space. 

Balances from the presale display directly in-app, with claiming made easy. Holders also gain exclusive access to brand new project launches through its Upcoming Tokens section.

Best Wallet is available for download on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

Milk & Mocha aren't just cartoon bears anymore; they're the face of one of the most community-driven presales of the year. Their $HUGS token brings together fans and blockchain utility in a way that's simple, fun, and rewarding. However, everything is currently locked behind one thing: the whitelist.

The Milk Mocha $HUGS whitelist is filling fast, and without signing up, you'll miss early access to every perk. That means no chance to enter mini-games with token prize pools, no shot at NFTs that can be upgraded with burns, and no ability to start staking $HUGS at a fixed 50% APY.

Later buyers will face higher prices, fewer rewards, and a long climb to catch up with leaderboard players and stakers who got in first. The whitelist isn't just early access, it's early dominance.



At the center of the Milk & Mocha ecosystem are interactive mini-games that turn holding into playing. Every action inside these games requires $HUGS, whether it's entering a tournament, unlocking a cosmetic upgrade, or competing in time-limited events.

This closed-loop system means that $HUGS doesn't just sit idle; it circulates, rewards players, and constantly pushes demand upward. Whitelist participants have the advantage of gaining entry before the crowds, allowing them to secure first entry into tournaments and enjoy better access to reward pools. Missing the whitelist means showing up late to the game when prizes are already being claimed and the competition is stacked against you.

Staking is one of the most attractive features of the $HUGS token. From the moment you stake, you start earning a fixed 50% APY. Rewards accumulate in real time and can be claimed daily, offering flexibility and consistent growth.

Unlike other systems that lock you down, $HUGS staking is designed to be both accessible and powerful. Additionally, leaderboards will recognize top stakers with exclusive NFT badges and bonus prizes.

Early whitelist members who accumulate tokens first will naturally have a stronger staking position, securing higher returns long before the wider audience gets in. Those who wait risk buying at higher prices later and missing weeks of compounding rewards.



Milk & Mocha NFTs are not just collectibles; they are functional assets within the $HUGS ecosystem. Every NFT drop can only be purchased with $HUGS, meaning whitelist members have early access to limited collections.

This system creates both demand and scarcity simultaneously. With each upgrade or merge, more $HUGS are permanently removed from circulation. The result is a constantly deflationary supply while providing holders with interactive and valuable assets. Whitelist members will be first in line for the rarest drops and upgrades, while non-whitelisted users will be forced to chase the leftovers at higher prices.

The $HUGS whitelist is more than a form; it's the master key to the entire Milk & Mocha ecosystem. Inside, participants unlock the opportunity to play mini-games with live reward pools, stake tokens at a 50% APY with daily payouts, and mint NFTs that serve as both collectibles and ecosystem tools. Each of these activities burns supply, drives demand, and rewards those who got in early.

Those who skip the whitelist will pay more later, miss out on early staking compounding, and face competition that has already secured positions at the top of leaderboards. Whitelist members aren't just early buyers, they're early winners. The whitelist isn't just early access, it's early dominance. Missing it means falling behind before the game even starts. Sign up today and secure your place inside the story Milk & Mocha is building.

What is the whitelist for $HUGS?
It's the only way to get early access to the presale before the public phase.

Do I need KYC to join?
No, whitelist entry is simple and open to everyone with just an email sign-up.

What are the benefits of being whitelisted?
Lower entry price, early staking rewards, NFT access, and better chances in mini-games.

How does staking work?
All stakers earn a fixed 50% APY, with rewards calculated daily and withdrawable anytime.

Do NFTs provide utility?
Yes, they unlock events, discounts, and can be upgraded through token burns.

Oops, something went wrong

Plasma, a new blockchain built specifically for stablecoins, is set to flip the switch on its long-awaited mainnet beta next week, introducing the chain and its native token, XPL, on Sept. 25.

According to a blog post from the team, the network will debut with more than $2 billion in stablecoin liquidity from over a hundred partners on day one — an aggressive attempt to position Plasma not as just another general-purpose chain, but as the backbone for stablecoin transfers.

That won't be an easy feat. Ethereum and Solana already dominate stablecoin volumes, while newer chains continue to optimize for similar flows. Plasma's bet is that its architecture, dubbed PlasmaBFT, will give it an edge. The system is designed for fast, composable stablecoin transactions the team said, and from launch, users will be able to move USDT with zero fees through Plasma's dashboard — a feature the team hopes will stand out in a crowded DeFi landscape.

Token distribution is also aimed at broad accessibility. Prior to launch, 10% of XPL was sold in a public offering. At launch, 25 million tokens will be allocated to the community, with another 2.5 million reserved for members of the so-called Stablecoin Collective.

Backing the project are heavyweights from the crypto and venture worlds: the $24 million in seed and Series A funding was led by Framework Ventures, with participation from Bitfinex, Peter Thiel and Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, among others.

“Plasma's mission is to become the foundation for global money movement. Mainnet beta is the next step in making that vision real,” the team wrote.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.

As Bitcoin BTC/USD edges closer to $118,000, prominent analyst Trader Mayne says the long-awaited 25-basis points interest rate cut clears the macro overhang and sets up one last Bitcoin-led push before an altcoin finale.

What Happened: On his podcast after the FOMC decision, Mayne argued the market can "just focus on the charts," noting a whipsaw in the S&P 500, strength in gold and muted initial crypto reaction.

He expects the current range to resolve upward, which could "sucker more people into the market," followed by a cleaner buying opportunity on weakness.

Structurally, Mayne still treats the higher time frame as bullish. 

His trading sequence for the coming weeks: look for a final pop toward the upper boundary of Bitcoin's range around $120,000, short into that resistance for a potential flush of long positions, then flip long for what he calls the final parabolic leg. 

That roadmap features Bitcoin leading one more surge, after which dominance stalls and extreme altcoin moves see Ethereum ETH/USD hitting up to $7,000, Solana SOL/USD surging above $400 and Dogecoin DOGE/USD pushing for a new all-time high.

Why It Matters: Mayne established clear invalidation levels for his thesis.

Referring to 2024's all-time high of $109,00 as a critical support level, he says any significant time spent below that level should be seen as weakness.

Otherwise, the playbook stays simple: fade the over-extension, buy the flush, and ride Bitcoin's last push into the long-awaited “altcoin season.”

The Reform Party has dismissed CBDC as governmental overreach, while advocating for a thriving private stablecoin market.

The United Kingdom's minority party Reform has formally rejected the Bank of England's proposal to cap stablecoin holdings and its broader plan to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

In a Sept. 18 statement on X, the party's head of policy, Zia Yusuf, alongside party figurehead Nigel Farage, warned that the measures would damage Britain's competitiveness in the global digital economy.

Last week, the Bank of England proposed restricting stablecoin exposure for individuals and businesses. Under the draft proposal, citizens would be limited to holding between £10,000 and £20,000 in systemic stablecoins, while businesses would face a maximum cap of £10 million.

The regulator argues that the plan aims to reduce financial risks as digital assets become more mainstream.

However, the Reform party leaders framed the proposal as an attack on innovation rather than a safeguard.

They argued that limiting the use of stablecoins risks choking off demand for British government debt while strengthening the position of global rivals.

According to the statement, dollar–pegged stablecoins like USDC and USDT funnel significant liquidity into US Treasuries, reinforcing the dollar's dominance in digital finance. By contrast, the UK lacks any mechanism equivalent to a backstop demand for gilts.

Yusuf wrote:

“Now ask yourself: where is the British equivalent? Where is the pound-backed stablecoin with deep liquidity, one that global markets can trust, one that channels fresh demand into UK gilts? It doesn't exist, because policymakers here have been openly hostile to innovators. Instead of building the future, Britain's regulators have smothered it.”

Considering this, Yusuf argued that “stablecoins are not a danger to financial stability.” Instead, he described the assets as:

“[A] bridge between the digital world and the traditional banking system. A bridge between entrepreneurs and customers, between investors and opportunity. They are simply new wrappers around money – safer, faster, programmable money that can settle instantly across borders without costly intermediaries.”

The Reform Party has also fought hard against the creation of a digital pound.

According to the party, a state-backed CBDC would hand the Bank of England “unprecedented control” over financial activity, stifling competition and discouraging private-sector innovation.

Instead, they advocate for regulated, privately issued stablecoins that could drive growth without giving government entities direct control over citizens' wallets.

To support that approach, the party said it would advance its proposed Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill to establish a transparent and proportionate regulatory framework.

By creating rules that balance consumer protection with market freedom, Reform argues the UK could emerge as a leader in the global stablecoin race and generate new employment opportunities in fintech and digital finance.

The stance marks another step in the party's embrace of crypto. Earlier this year, it became one of the first political groups in the UK to accept donations in Bitcoin and other digital assets.

[Editor's Note: Context on UK politics.  Reform holds five parliamentary seats within the current government behind Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, SNP, and Sinn Féin. It has minimal sway in current UK legislation.

However, a collapse in support for Labour has placed Reform at the top of YouGov polling for the over-50s around a hypothetical snap election. The next election is scheduled for 2029.]

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin dominance has been slipping and could go even lower than it is now—but experts still expect Bitcoin to rise to new highs this year.

Bitcoin dominance, or the ratio of BTC market capitalization to the rest of the crypto market, sits at 57.79% on Thursday morning. In the past day, the price of BTC has gained 1% after the Federal Open Markets Committee met expectations that it would lower federal interest rates with a 25 basis point cut.

In the immediate aftermath, Bitcoin held steady—but then rose to its highest price in more than a month Thursday morning, rising to a recent peak just shy of $118,000.

John Glover, chief investment officer at Bitcoin lender Ledn, said Bitcoin's initially placid reaction to yesterday's rate cut doesn't mean it won't still end the year strong.

“I'm forecasting a BTC price of circa $140K to $145K by year end,” he told Decrypt. “The rate cuts will help to push this narrative as money moves to BTC for safe haven among expectations of a USD devaluation.”

Other analysts have forecast that the long-term outlook for Bitcoin is still extremely bullish. But in the near-term, altcoins have taken the spotlight with larger gains ahead of expected SEC approvals of a wide variety of crypto ETFs.

“Short-term statistics may show that Bitcoin dominance is slipping as traders rotate into altcoins in the hope that the SEC will greenlight new spot ETFs,” BOB co-founder Dom Harz told Decrypt. “That rotation may play out in the short term, but it's important to remember that Bitcoin remains the most secure network, the most proven digital asset, and the one with the deepest institutional conviction.”

At the time of writing, XRP has gained 3% in the past day to trade for $3.12; crypto exchange Binance's BNB has risen about 5% to $996 and set a new all-time high above $1,000 overnight.

Solana, which recently got a massive boost from billions worth of SOL being bought by corporate treasuries, has climbed almost 6% in the past day to $248, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko. Solana is one of the biggest gainers among top assets over the last month, rising 35% during that span.

Users on Myriad, a prediction market owned by Decrypt parent company Dastan, have swung bearish on Bitcoin dominance as enthusiasm for altcoins builds. At the time of writing, 53% of users think Bitcoin dominance will slip further to 53% before it manages to climb back to 63%.

Bitcoin dominance was last that high in the middle of July, when BTC set what was then a new all-time high above $112,000.

BTC broke that record a month later and topped out above $124,000, but it's still given up some ground to altcoins. Even so, Harz said that doesn't change much for institutional investors.

“ETFs alone have seen six straight days of inflows this week,” he added, “pulling in over $2 billion, while 7% of total supply now sits in corporate and government treasuries.”

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

NBA superstar Kevin Durant can't find the password to his Coinbase account, which holds bitcoin that he began buying in earnest when he was playing for the Golden State Warriors in 2016. His agent couldn't be happier.

Durant's predicament has "only benefited" the hoopster, agent Rich Kleiman said.

"We've yet to be able to track down his Coinbase account info, so we've never sold anything, and this bitcoin is just through the roof," Kleiman said Tuesday at CNBC's Game Plan conference in Los Angeles."It's just a process we haven't been able to figure out, but Bitcoin keeps going up … so, I mean, it's only benefited us," he said.

Durant, who will play for the Houston Rockets this upcoming season, began snapping up bitcoin around 2016, after the U.S. Olympic team legend and Kleiman attended a dinner in which his then-teammates kept discussing the cryptocurrency.

"I just heard the word 'bitcoin' 25 times this evening, and the next day, we started investing in bitcoin," Kleiman said. The agent did not say how much bitcoin Durant bought.

Bitcoin sold for between about $360 and $1,000 back in 2016, according to CoinGecko. The leading cryptocurrency is now trading at almost $116,000, or more than 11,000% above its highest price the year Durant was buying.

Durant has been unable to access his Coinbase account for "a few years" due to a "user error on our end," Kleiman told CNBC on Wednesday.

"We've already been working directly with the Coinbase team on Kevin's account recovery, which is why it was easy for me to make a joke about it on stage," Kleiman said.

Kleiman said he and Durant are also investors in Coinbase Global, and that the company "has been a valuable resource in growing our business." In 2021, the duo's Thirty Five Ventures struck a multiyear deal with Coinbase to promote the trading platform, which includes creating content about digital assets for Durant's sports and entertainment website, Boardroom.

Coinbase, in a statement to CNBC, said its users can reset their passwords using self-service tools within the trading platform's app. The platform for buying, selling and storing cryptocurrencies also has an around-the-clock support team fielding account recovery requests and other inquiries, according to a spokesman.

 Solana's price may jump 20% within weeks, mirroring BNB's breakout pattern that led to fresh record highs above $1,000. 

Key takeaways:

Solana is mirroring BNB's 2024–25 rally, eyeing a breakout above $295.

A cup-and-handle pattern sets SOL's upside target near $540.

Solana (SOL) appears to be following a nearly identical chart trajectory to BNB (BNB), suggesting it may be on the verge of its own breakout.

A side-by-side comparison of SOL and BNB weekly charts shows striking similarities for more than a year, as highlighted by BitBull on Thursday. 

Both BNB and Solana have traced nearly identical market structures since early 2024. 

Each posted a sharp first-leg rally, followed by a multimonth reaccumulation phase between mid-2024 and early 2025, characterized by sideways consolidation and corrective pullbacks, before resuming their uptrends.

For BNB, this setup matured in August 2025, when it reclaimed its previous all-time high of $794.30. The breakout quickly gathered momentum, and within weeks, BNB extended its rally to a new record peak above $1,000 on Thursday.

Solana now appears to be entering the same breakout phase that fueled BNB's parabolic rise, eyeing a breakout over its current record high at around $295 within a month, up about 20% from current levels. 

The pattern underscores how investor behavior tends to rhyme across markets: Early rallies draw in momentum, consolidations shake out weak hands and renewed liquidity inflows help the uptrend resume. 

For instance, Ether (ETH) surged from ~$10 to ~$400 in the first half of 2017, entered a six-month reaccumulation phase, then broke out again to hit about $1,400 by January 2018. 

The structure looked almost identical to Bitcoin's (BTC) earlier 2013 cycle.

Solana is painting a classic bullish continuation pattern known as a “cup and handle,” positioning it for a potential breakout to new highs.

The weekly SOL/USDT chart shows the “cup” phase forming during the long bottoming process from late 2021 to mid-2023, followed by the “handle” consolidation stretching into 2025. 

This structure has created a neckline resistance around $267, which SOL has been testing for a breakout since November 2024. 

A decisive close above this neckline could trigger the next leg higher, with a technical breakout target projected over $540, up 120% from current price levels, by the year's end or early 2026.

As crypto industry growth creates a huge demand for talent, crypto founders need to know how to find and recruit great people — both crypto natives and people with traditional tech experience. One of the biggest questions that come up, however, is whether you need to hire someone who has crypto-native experience, or someone that can learn the industry? It's the source of endless internal debates.

The good news is that crypto is hardly the first industry to struggle with talent pipelines. That means there are well-established practices you can draw on to find the right people with the right skill sets. That's what this guide is for: to help founders and recruiters determine where crypto experience is crucial, where other kinds of experience can have the biggest impact, and what challenges and considerations need to be addressed along the way. 

To keep things simple, think of it like this: There are definitely ways that crypto companies differ from traditional tech firms. But when it comes to the processes and best practices of finding, hiring, and onboarding talent, you're not building a crypto company per se — you're just building a tech company. So be sure to apply those established best practices for finding the right people with the right skillsets. 

As a rule of thumb, crypto-native professionals have a crucial advantage: the ability to hit the ground running. High-stakes projects often operate under tight timelines, where every day counts. And sometimes, native crypto expertise can be indispensable. The roles where this is especially true involve foundational constructs of blockchain technology and its applications, where even the most skilled professionals may face a steep learning curve.

Smart-contract development is a prime example. These self-executing agreements, encoded directly on the blockchain, demand precision and an understanding of decentralized logic that's different from traditional programming. A single vulnerability in a smart contract can be catastrophic and result in millions of dollars in losses, making this a high-stakes discipline where it's important to know the rules of the road.

Onboarding talent into an industry with such a steep learning curve can be a challenge, as the candidate may require time to acclimate to the nuances of blockchain technology — decentralized vs. centralized, more open source, and so on — and the crypto “ethos,” which includes everything from different cultural lingo to mindsets. But there are many areas in which talent from non-crypto companies can fuel crypto's growth, especially as a company begins to scale. For example, traditional professionals with backgrounds in software engineering or operations can bring versatility and a breadth of experience honed through their experiences at larger software companies. These professionals have often worn multiple hats and have had to manage vast amounts of internal bureaucracy and barriers to get things shipped. In crypto's quickly growing multidisciplinary teams, this kind of operational flexibility becomes a powerful asset. 

Experience at scale also plays an important role. Traditional candidates have often worked on products used by millions, and they've confronted (and solved) the challenges that come with such success: Ensuring systems stay up under extreme infrastructure load, optimizing performance at scale, and preparing for unpredictable spikes in demand. This expertise translates directly to web3 products as they move from niche, crypto-savvy audiences to more mainstream adoption.

Candidates that come from fintech firms, for example, may have significant relevant experience in payments technology or financial regulations that may be important in your world too. Building infra? A consumer app? Well there's a world of talent that's been doing this for years at scale.Consider what experience overlaps and where you can ramp them on crypto specific tech to build your unicorn team in house. More broadly, candidates who have experience in design, user experience, scalability, security, and leadership can also help accelerate crypto innovation, as these skills often have domain expertise that transfers well and may even work better than someone who doesn't have this experience.. 

After you've identified the skills and people you need — including determining whether they really need to have crypto-native experience or not — the next step is to go out and recruit them.

The biggest challenge and the biggest opportunity are flip sides of the same coin: You're a crypto company. 

For some candidates coming from established companies, crypto industry volatility, recent regulatory uncertainty, insider jargon, and decentralized products will be too new or unappealing or both. For others, that same unfamiliarity and occasional instability will be exciting — a feature rather than a bug. In recruiting conversations, drill into how the candidate thinks about the stability and comfort of a big company versus the opportunities and challenges of a rapidly growing company. Walk them through a challenge your team encountered in the last few weeks, explain how it was handled and highlight the onus on each team member given the size and stage of the company. Their reaction may tell you how they might have responded in a similar situation and at the very least, will let them know what's expected of anyone at your company when the next situation arises.  

A candidate might not know a ton about crypto when you first make contact, but natural curiosity and interest in the benefits of decentralization are key. A big signal over the recruitment process will be how much their knowledge and engagement deepens along the way: Are they researching things on their own? Are they asking more specific questions based on learning new things from you and others?… and so on. 

To differentiate between the two types of candidates — the crypto-wary and the crypto-curious — and to avoid wasting your time and money, seek to understand people's motivations as early as possible to make sure they and your company are moving in the same direction. This is recruiting 101, but it's worth underlining because it's so important, especially in the crypto industry. 

Every pitch needs to be customized to each specific candidate: What drove them to their current job? What kept them in their past roles? Those same things are likely to be a critical part of their decision-making process this time around, too. Start learning the answers to those questions in your very first call with a candidate.

By the end of the recruiting process, you want to be hiring someone who is aligned with your company's vision and excited about your product. And your team needs to be excited to work with the new hire, too; that will help you align whether the candidate fits your company or not regardless of degree of crypto experience. That's always your north star. 

Since you're going after highly intellectually curious candidates, tailor your pitch accordingly to appeal to them. You might start by explaining the difference between the computer and the casino cultures of crypto (that the first sees blockchains as a way to build new networks powering a new computing movement, and the other is mainly interested in speculation, trading, and gambling). You could then share how the emergent industry offers them a unique chance to reshape the future of technology, not unlike the early days of the internet. 

A useful thought experiment is to figure out how to talk about your product and company without talking about crypto. What problems does your company solve? What inspired you to build it? Why will the world be a better place because of it? This will allow you to sell the premise and promise regardless of the underlying technology without your audience getting tripped up in the details. 

Another good starting point is simply to ask, “What do you know about crypto?” Even if you get skeptical answers — stories from the news, the casino-culture narrative — it will give you an opening, and allow you to listen for what they are really scared about: external factors (policy), intrinsic ones (tech complexity), personal ones (risk tolerance), and so on. You might share that many people in crypto agree with some of that skepticism, and bring the conversation around to the cool technical problems that your project is solving. 

Not everyone's primary motivation will be money, but be ready to highlight the financial rewards available, too. Historically, top talent has been reluctant to join early-stage companies for three reasons: (1) a grindfest culture, (2) bad work-life balance, and (3) lack of liquid compensation. Even if you solve for the first two, the third can eliminate a significant portion of your potential candidate pool. 

Compensation innovation, such as token-based structures, can provide both financial upside and liquidity at early-stage companies — compared to the rare liquidity events like an IPO or acquisition that you see in web2. Be sure to use a vesting/token grant schedule that locks people into the long term to some extent. Compensation is a complicated topic and is obviously top of mind for candidates, so make sure you're thoroughly prepared to talk about it. 

If you do these steps well, you'll have a solid chance of getting top talent from outside the industry interested in your company. Next, you'll want to help them see exactly how they can contribute their best work in their day-to-day roles.

Integrating new talent into web3 companies is about educating your new hires to shorten their ramp-up time. You'll know each person's gaps because you identified them in the interview process. Use that knowledge to design onboarding experiences that specifically close those gaps, and as quickly as possible. 

For example, new hires may need help to see beyond the technicalities of blockchain and decentralized systems, so they understand the real-world problems they'll be solving and gain confidence in their roles. 

Regular knowledge-sharing session between new hires and veteran employees with deeper crypto experience will foster collaboration and allow team members to learn from one another's strengths. Mentorship programs can pair newcomers with experienced web3 professionals to provide invaluable hands-on learning. Even better, you can structure the program so that crypto “unicorn” talent (someone who has all the skills, knowledge, and background) is paired with newcomers who can develop over time into crypto unicorns of their own.

Upskilling and education are also essential, and will remain so as the industry keeps evolving. Resources like blockchain-focused blogs, podcasts, and education courses -– in things like how to use a smart wallet, how to stake, tokenomics, smart contract design, or basic concepts around how blockchains are being leveraged in different use cases– offer a strong starting point for continual learning. Mentorship roles with established crypto organizations can provide practical experience, while thought leaders in the industry can offer insights through reports (including our own State of Crypto report). 

The key takeaway is, whatever your new hires need to excel, your job is to help them learn, find, or access it from day one.

Regardless of whether you hire someone crypto-native or crypto-curious, your mantra should always be to: Hire smart people to build products that serve users. 

The transition to crypto isn't just about adopting new technology. It's about cultivating a shared vision that blends the best of both worlds. Experienced professionals bring critical expertise in scaling, usability, and strategic leadership, while crypto-native talent offers specialized knowledge of blockchain systems and decentralized principles. Together, they form the ideal team to tackle the challenges of a rapidly evolving industry.

But this won't all happen organically. To succeed, your organization must invest in thoughtful onboarding, collaborative team structures, and continuous education to set them up for that collaboration and success. This includes helping experienced talent see beyond the technicalities of crypto to understand the real-world problems they'll help solve and the transformative potential of their work. By fostering shared purpose and bridging gaps in knowledge and culture, the industry can accelerate innovation and unlock the full promise of crypto for all.

Key Takeaways

As U.S. President Donald Trump visits the U.K. American Big Tech firms have announced billions of dollars of investment in the country. 

But while AI has taken center stage in the transatlantic partnership, it's business as usual for the U.K. crypto sector.

To coincide with the agreement of a “Tech Prosperity Deal” between the U.K. and the U.S. on Wednesday, American firms unveiled £31 billion ($42.3 billion) of planned investments in the U.K.

Leading the charge, Microsoft committed  to spending $30 billion over the next four years to fund its ongoing operations in the country and build new AI infrastructure.

Half of the money, which represents Microsoft's largest ever investment in the U.K., will be used to expand its data center footprint in the country. It will help finance a new supercomputer equipped with 23,000 Nvidia GPUs the firm said would be the largest in the country. 

Overall, Nvidia said  it plans to ship 120,000 Blackwell processors to the U.K., “representing the largest AI infrastructure rollout in the country's history.”

The chipmaker announced a fresh £500 million investment from BlackRock in partnership with Digital Gravity Partners, which will be used to upgrade existing data centers with new Nvidia tech. It also touted previous commitments to invest up to £11 billion in the U.K. 

Meanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang, who joined Donald Trump at Wednesday night's state banquet with the king, announced  that Nvidia would acquire a £500 million stake in NScale. 

The British AI infrastructure startup is a major beneficiary of the recent flurry of Big Tech investments, being a partner in Microsoft's supercomputer project and a joint venture with OpenAI and Nvidia announced on Tuesday.

Stargate UK plans  to deploy 8,000 GPUs in the first quarter of 2026, with the potential to scale to 31,000 processors over time.

Against Microsoft's headline investment, other hyperscaler's U.K. data center plans paled in comparison. 

On Tuesday, Google committed  £5 billion over two years to support AI research and cloud infrastructure development in the country. Meanwhile, Coreweave will spend  an additional £1.5 billion boosting its data centre capacity in the U.K.

Amid a whirlwind of announcements highlighting transatlantic collaboration on AI, crypto has so far been absent from the government's rhetoric. 

Prior to Trump's arrival in London, the crypto sector lobbied the government to include digital assets and stablecoins as a “core strand” of any deal with the U.S. 

According to the Financial Times, British officials still hope to agree on closer U.S.-U.K alignment on the issue. But as of Thursday, no such deal had been announced. And regardless of whether they reach an agreement on crypto, it doesn't appear to be a top priority for Westminster. 

Where the White House has centered crypto in its economic and technological vision for America, Kier Starmer's government has been far more reserved.

In May, then-Economic Secretary to the Treasury Lucy Reynolds ruled out establishing a national Bitcoin reserve equivalent to the one proposed by Donald Trump in the U.S. 

The U.K.'s approach to crypto is less bombastic. Lawmakers are focused on steady legislative progress rather than headline-grabbing initiatives and partisan battle lines.

A framework  drafted by the Treasury in April largely resembles proposals developed by the previous government, granting the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) new powers to regulate the crypto sector.

As it prepares for its expanded remit, the FCA has signalled  that it will exempt the sector from some of the strictest rules it imposes on traditional financial firms.

“We want to develop a sustainable and competitive crypto sector – balancing innovation, market integrity and trust,” David Geale, the FCA's executive director of payments and digital finance, said on Wednesday.

Oops, something went wrong

Renowned investor Kevin O'Leary expressed his belief on Wednesday that owning only Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) can capture the majority of the cryptocurrency market's volatility and yield.

O'Leary took to X, sharing a clip from his recent interview with Al Arabiya English, in which he said that instead of chasing the hordes of “irrelevant” tokens in the market, one should focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum to “capture the promise” of cryptocurrency.

“You could own Bitcoin and Ethereum, and you would capture more than 90% of the alpha or price volatility of the entire crypto market,” O'Leary, also known as "Mr Wonderful," stated.



He further noted that as Wall Street moves on-chain, through the adoption of tokenized securities, digital payment systems, and stablecoins, the best way to gain exposure to these developments is by owning ETH, something he described as the “number one blockchain product.”

“One is basically digital gold, if you want to call that Bitcoin, and the other is Wall Street going on chain, which is Ethereum,” O'Leary said.

O'Leary has been one of the most vocal advocates of cryptocurrency. He previously revealed investments in companies such as Circle Internet Group Inc. (NYSE:CRL), cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) and tokenized stock provider Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) to bet on the infrastructure side of cryptocurrency.

He said last month that the younger generation, specifically the GenZs, are investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside traditional stocks, a chance he did not get early in his investment journey.

Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was exchanging hands at $117,067, down 0.14% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. ETH traded up 0.55% at $4,576 at last check.Read Next:

 The latest mainnet upgrade brings native EVM and CosmWasm to a single chain. Backed by a VARA-regulated VASP license, the chain focuses on tokenization with institutional guardrails. 

Mantra has upgraded its mainnet to natively run both the Ethereum Virtual Machine and CosmWasm, bringing a MultiVM architecture to an RWA-focused layer 1 so developers can use familiar tooling on a chain tuned for tokenization.

Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) presents an addressable market that analysts estimate at about $16 trillion. But progress has been slowed by fragmented developer tooling, uncertain regulatory pathways and limited interoperability across ecosystems.

To close those gaps, the RWA-focused layer-1 blockchain Mantra has upgraded its mainnet to add native support for both the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and CosmWasm — a smart-contract framework for Cosmos that compiles to WebAssembly.

The upgrade embeds specific requirements at the protocol level and is backed by Mantra Finance's virtual asset service provider (VASP) license from Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).

Mantra's upgrade marks a notable first for RWA-focused layer-1 chains: a MultiVM design that unifies EVM depth with CosmWasm in production. MultiVM means the chain can run more than one smart-contract virtual machine side by side, so teams keep familiar tooling while gaining a base layer with compliance checks wired in, designed for institutional workflows.

“Mantra Chain is at the heart of the Mantra ecosystem,” said Mantra founder and CEO John Patrick Mullin. “With this EVM upgrade, we're not just improving performance; we're further embedding compliance into the protocol, opening the door to a new era of accessibility, trust and regulatory clarity when tokenizing RWAs. It's another important step toward making the future of finance more open and efficient for everyone.”

Many blockchains add controls only through application-level contracts, yet those can vary from app to app and create uneven enforcement. Shifting certain requirements into the base protocol is meant to provide consistent guardrails across the network, which reduces ambiguity for compliance teams and simplifies risk reviews for institutions that must evidence controls end-to-end.

Here's what changes for developers and institutions:

Deploy as-is: Developers can launch Solidity-based decentralized applications (DApps) on Mantra Chain without code changes and can fork DeFi protocols for RWA use.

EVM depth: The chain supports low-level EVM instructions (opcodes) and optimized system contracts (precompiles), along with low fees and RWA-oriented infrastructure.

Institutional pathway: EVM-compatible, self-sovereign chain coupled with Mantra Finance's licensed infrastructure.

Bridging next: Straightforward transfers from other EVM chains are on the near-term roadmap.

From here, the team says it will scale adoption, onboard new asset issuers and demonstrate how tokenized finance can run with clear audit trails, permissioning and policy enforcement.

Mantra's announcement follows several weeks of updates. In August, the project announced a strategic partnership with Inveniam to build an institutional RWA stack anchored in the UAE and the United States. Governance and decentralization have advanced as Mantra onboarded Binance, Nansen and Inveniam as validators while winding down internal ones.

“Two critical factors that distinguish Mantra from the competition are our VASP license from Dubai's VARA, and our compliance-driven infrastructure,” Mullin summarized:

Next up, Mantra plans permissioned liquidity pools, institutional compliance frameworks and deeper interoperability with other blockchains. It will also host Agentic., a two-day summit in Abu Dhabi on Oct. 21–22 focused on tokenization, market structure and capital flows.

Mantra's MultiVM upgrade unifies native EVM and CosmWasm under an architecture with compliance built into the protocol designed for RWA use cases.

Traditional finance has long had a way of splitting capital from coupons, allowing investors to separate interest-payment flows from the principal. Now, a team of stablecoin and blockchain-based real-world asset (RWA) pioneers is doing the same for tokenized assets.

A new startup, STBL, emulates TradFi's zero-coupon strip structures by converting digital assets into a dollar-pegged stablecoin and yield-bearing non-fungible token (NFT). Just as with the traditional equivalent, the components can be held separately, allowing investors to keep the part that appeals to them and sell the other bit to counterparties with different attitudes to risk.

The product, currently in beta testing, goes beyond just packaging risk into different tranches. It also widens the stablecoin issuance model. With regular stablecoins, like USDT, the issuing company, in this case Tether, keeps the returns on the Treasuries they hold to maintain the token's peg to the dollar. It's profitable business, Tether reported $4.9 billion net profit in the second quarter. With STBL, whoever deposits a tokenized asset into the system becomes the minter and keeps the returns.

“Our mission at STBL is to evolve stablecoins from corporate products into public infrastructure,” said STBL co-founder Reeve Collins, who was also a cofounder of Tether. “For the first time, minters, not issuers, retain the value of reserves. This is the defining shift of Stablecoin 2.0: money that is stable, compliant, and built to serve the community.”

When a yield-bearing on-chain asset — this could be any yield-bearing RWA, such as Franklin Templeton's BENJI, BlackRock's BUIDL or Ondo's USDY — is deposited and locked into the STBL protocol, it splits into a stablecoin (USST) that can circulate and serve as collateral or reserves in decentralized finance (DeFi) and a separate, yield-accruing non-fungible token (NFT) called YLD.

The design is intended to remain a non-security in spirit and align with the U.S. GENIUS Act and other regulatory frameworks by separating principal from yield, said CEO Avtar Sehra, who is also a co-founder of the project and was CEO and founder of Kaio (formerly Libre Capital).

“When a user who's already whitelisted with a Franklin Templeton or BlackRock fund locks that asset into STBL, they receive an NFT that controls the vault,” Sehra said in an interview. “You hold the NFT and accrue interest, while the stable asset can be used as collateral, as reserves, or to mint an ecosystem-specific stablecoin aligned with GENIUS Act requirements.”

In the year or so before STBL started up, Sehra and Collins were looking at how RWAs or tokenized securities could be used in DeFi; asking how they worked as collateral; how money market funds became the reserves for minting stablecoins, and so on.

There had been a view that wrapping an asset, that is taking a tokenized security and placing it into a vault, meant the asset no longer counted as a security as far as U.S. regulations were concerned. But it's not clear that wrapping something "deviates from or extracts the security-like essence" of the asset, Sehra said.

To ensure the USST stablecoin component isn't viewed as a security required a mechanism to maintain the dollar peg. This is achieved by ensuring it is slightly over collateralized coupled with an incentive system related to mint fees and burn credits should deviation happen in a volatile market. Sehra referred to STBL's peg-maintenance system as “synthetic” rather than “algorithmic.”

“The reason I call it a synthetic is because, even though it has this interest-rate algorithmic component to it, it is 103% over collateralized with pure money market assets,” he said. “As a result of this novel structure, eligible participants that hold permitted RWAs can mint and burn compliant stablecoins. So while minters can hold the yield, the stable asset can be openly used without breaking the non-yield bearing requirements of the GENIUS Act. That's exactly how STBL operates.”

The protocol's decentralized governance token, also called STBL, has been added to Binance Alpha, Binance Futures and Kraken Spot, and will list on other spot exchanges soon, Sehra said.

The Sept. 16 debut of the STBL governance token has been lauded as one of the most successful token generating events of 2025, Sehra added. It launched at $100 million fully diluted value, and demand pushed it over $1 billion. It is currently at $1.3 billion, having hit an all time high of about $2.3 billion within 24 hours.

The next steps involve a $100 million minting using Franklin Templeton's BENJI token, Sehra said, and also the announcement of several other partnerships, including with a U.S. based payments firm. The protocol is due to open to the public in the fourth quarter.

In the current cycle, Bitcoin has anchored most of the capital inflow. In 2025, 66% of investors selected Bitcoin as their first digital purchase, driven by more global regulatory clarity and ease of access. With the cycle progressing and Bitcoin dominance falling below 58%, altcoins have gained momentum, with 73% of institutional investors now holding or allocating capital into them. This shift signals a growing trend among investors as they view altcoins as a diversifying strategy.

Interest rate fluctuations are a primary driver for how institutions allocate capital towards risk on assets. Lower interest rates trigger higher investor risk appetite, as patterns indicate stronger inflows into digital assets. Notably, TOTAL3 has increased by 109.43% YoY, highlighting how altcoins often outperform Bitcoin as higher-beta assets during easing cycles.

Bitcoin dominance is showing signs of reversal as the altcoins market jumped from below 35% to 41% in early September, while Bitcoin's dominance slid below 58% for the first time in 2025. Institutional inflows are reinforcing the trend as Ethereum ETFs attracted $3 billion in net flows in a single week.

The global M2 liquidity has expanded by $5.6 trillion in 2025, indicating a notable increase in global liquidity. Consequently, more capital is available for investment following monetary policy easing, with capital historically rotating into altcoins that can outperform Bitcoin up to 200%.

Institutional capital is no longer solely concentrated on Bitcoin. The existing cycle shows a growing institutional interest across multiple crypto verticals. Binance Research (PDF) has highlighted stronger performance in sectors such as DeFi, stablecoins, and RWA. At the same time, research on institutional adoption of DeFi emphasises that 24% of institutions currently engage with crypto products, and this number is expected to triple in the next two years.

DeFi recorded a 44.5% year-to-date gain, while stablecoin had a 38.6% increase. Both sectors outperformed Bitcoin's YTD increase of 19.8% is illustrating why capital is shifting from Bitcoin towards altcoins and infrastructure. As Bitcoin dominance falls below 57%, institutions are diversifying by capitalising on the regulatory tailwind, indicating that institutional interest is no longer confined to a single asset.

Binance France President David Princay recently commented on a potential altcoin season, “If or when BTC prices plateau, institutions and corporations may look to diversify their crypto holdings further. It will be interesting to observe how an altcoin season unfolds in a more mature and regulated crypto market.”

Rising DEX volumes are an early indicator of investors pivoting their strategy to increase altcoin exposure. With many new tokens initially unavailable on centralised exchanges, DEXs capture dislocated liquidity by offering listings ahead of traditional platforms. DEX volumes doubled over the past year, with spot reaching 23.1% and futures climbing to 9.3%.

Additionally, DEX trading volumes reached a combined total of over $1.15 trillion in 2025. Similarly, Ethereum has reached an all-time high monthly DEX volume of $139.63 billion in August 2025, emphasising how investors seek DEXs as alternative trading infrastructures to access new assets.

Fee reductions on Ethereum have supported increased activity and reduced costs for DeFi users. The network has also enabled higher on-chain trading volumes, which more than doubled in 2025 while centralised exchange activity declined. Growing on-chain metrics emphasise the structural shift toward decentralised infrastructure as a driver of market activity.

On-chain data illustrate that DeFi protocols are continuing to grow in value. Total value locked (TVL) on lending increased by 65% to $79.8B for the first time, with investors identifying new opportunities to deploy capital towards on-chain lending.

Larger protocols such as AAVE are capturing the growth with half of the on-chain lending market –  $39.9 billion. Ethereum's DeFi TVL has expanded from $54 billion to over $97 billion while total staked ETH neared 35.8 million ETH. The Paceta accelerated this trend by increasing the validators' stake from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, prompting entities to allocate capital and capitalise on the opportunities.

Regulatory clarity helped drive demand for DeFi products. The SEC's announcement not to classify liquid staking as a security prompted positive institutional momentum. According to DeFi Llama, total liquid staking increased by 103% year-over-year, reflecting growing institutional demand for deploying altcoins to generate reliable yields.

Such developments underline DeFi's role in evolving beyond deposit and towards active use cases. Stablecoin deposits on exchanges climbed to an all-time high of $68 billion, indicating available capital for potential deployment from retail and institutional investors towards digital assets.

As Bitcoin's dominance continues to ease, the rise of altcoins underscores a broader maturation of the digital asset market. What was once seen as a speculative corner of crypto is now attracting serious institutional attention, reshaping portfolio strategies in the process.

If the trend continues, altcoins may move beyond being seen as just “alternatives” to Bitcoin. Instead, they could become core pieces of diversified crypto strategies, signalling a shift in how investors approach the next phase of the digital economy.

Ethereum is approaching a decisive phase that could carry it into five-figure territory, according to a multi-timeframe analysis from trader Cantonese Cat (@Cantonmeow).

Ethereum Ready To Smash All-Time Highs

In a video published today, the analyst argues that ETH has cleared a cluster of late-cycle resistances and is now exhibiting a confluence of technical signals—on monthly, weekly, daily, and intraday charts—that “favor some of the higher targets to be met, maybe 1.272, 1.414, 1.618, anywhere around potentially five figures.” These Fib levels would put ETH at $7,752, $9,883 and $14,011 respectively.

On the monthly chart, the analyst centers his case on the log-scale Fibonacci structure and volatility regime. ETH, he says, spent months stalling around the 0.886 retracement near $4,000—the same zone that repeatedly repelled the market in prior attempts—but “last month, we had the break through that here, convincingly.”

He notes that the wick of the latest push already poked above the wick from the November 2021 peak, reinforcing the idea that supply at the former top is thinning. Simultaneously, the monthly Bollinger Bands are expanding while price “is impulsively going to the upside here along with the upper Bollinger Band,” a backdrop he describes as consistent with trend acceleration rather than mean reversion. “It does favor some of the higher targets to be met,” he said, while stressing sequencing: “We need to kind of break above the previous all-time high here first before we can actually talk about moving further up.”

A second pillar of the bullish thesis is the Ichimoku profile across cycles—specifically the fusion of Tenkan-sen (conversion line) and Kijun-sen (base line). “When you have the Tenkan and Kijin fused together and price is riding up along with it, this fusion over here is called Katana,” he explained. Historically, he said, this “precipitates a big move,” and with price now above the Katana, “the Katana is shooting the price up.” On the current structure: “We got a Katana here being built up and price is currently impulsively going to the upside, so that is also favorable for Ethereum.”

On the weekly timeframe, Cantonese Cat frames ETH's advance through a three-cycle template defined by a “cycle liquidity zone” acting as a pivot. Each prior cycle saw deviations above and below a governing trend line before a sustained move once the zone was recaptured. He places the present consolidation directly on that blueprint: after breaking the “$4,000 liquidity level,” ETH is “consoling sideways… trying to find some energy before breaking up higher.” A back-test is possible but not required, he said; the “primary case” remains continuation unless the chart invalidates.

Lower Timeframe Signals

The lower timeframes, in his view, are already aligning with that outcome. On the daily chart, he highlights a developing “Adam and Eve continuation pattern” nested within a classic cup-and-handle, where “the handle… volume is not that great,” which he views as textbook, followed by “a pretty decent volume bullish engulfing candle.”

Measured against log-scale retracements, price was rejected at 0.786, found support at 0.5, and is now “trying to break through 0.6… work our way back… to 0.786,” a rhythm he says “is being respected pretty decently.” He also points to a short-term bottoming sequence—“you can see something called a tweezer bottom… if you have anywhere around two or three of these kind of wick sticking down like that, that's usually a pretty decent bottom”—and a three-candle “morning star” reversal: “It's a reversal pattern and it could end up leading to a reversal here… seems to be working out pretty well.”

On the 12-hour chart, he reads the structure as reaccumulation in a Wyckoff sense, referencing the “rounded bottom,” a strengthening secondary test—“the ST is higher than the VCLX”—and the emergence of a “creek” overhead that price appears ready to vault. “It does look like a reaccumulation type pattern… showing some strength… consolidating sideways… to reaccumulate before [a] bullish continuation,” he said, adding that after the prior vertical leg, digestion at elevated levels is constructive.

Relative-strength diagnostics, he argues, reinforce the ETH-led narrative. Ethereum's market-share gauge (ETH.D) “has broken above the Ichimoku cloud… with strength,” then “back-tested the cloud for about four weeks,” and may be waiting for the Tenkan to “rise… as support” before the next leg. On a monthly volatility basis, he adds, “the 20-month moving average was reclaimed… and we simply spent a month here back-testing” it—evidence that dominance could trend higher if the back-test holds. “That's basically meaning that Ethereum wants to continue to outperform the rest of the cryptocurrency market here for [the] foreseeable future,” he said.

Breadth indicators outside of ETH also tilt risk-on in his framework. The Total3 index (total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) is “trying to break above and form an all-time high” on a monthly “cup and handle” structure, while the “Others” index (market cap excluding the top 10 coins) has punched through the 0.786 level on the weekly and is “gravitat[ing]… to the next level, the 0.886.”

He emphasizes the distinction between log and linear retracements, noting a failed linear 0.886 breakout in a prior attempt: “If we were to break above the linear, as well as the log 0.886 here with style, then I think Others would end up performing extremely well and would end up following the footsteps of Ethereum.” His conclusion is unambiguous: “I am bullish on Ethereum. I'm bullish on altcoin. I'm bullish on the cryptocurrency market space in general.”

At press time, ETH traded at $4,565.

 Australia's financial regulator has granted licensing exemptions for intermediaries distributing AFS-licensed stablecoins, starting with AUDM. 

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has introduced licensing exemptions for intermediaries involved in the distribution of stablecoins issued by licensed entities.

Under the newly published ASIC Corporations (Stablecoin Distribution Exemption) Instrument 2025/631, intermediaries distributing a stablecoin issued by an Australian financial services (AFS) licensee are no longer required to hold their own AFS, market or clearing and settlement facility licenses.

“ASIC is committed to supporting responsible innovation in the rapidly evolving digital assets space, while ensuring important consumer protections are in place by having eligible stablecoins issued under an AFS licence,” the regulator said in a Thursday announcement. 

According to ASIC, the exemption only applies to stablecoins classified as financial products under the current Corporations Act and issued by eligible AFS-licensed entities.

Currently, the exemption applies to a single issuer, Catena Digital Pty, which issues the AUDM stablecoin. However, ASIC said it may extend the scope of the exemption as more stablecoin issuers obtain AFS licenses.

The exemption covers a range of financial services related to secondary stablecoin distribution, including providing general advice, making a market, dealing in (but not issuing) the stablecoin and custodial services.

The measure follows public feedback on a recent consultation paper that explored updates to ASIC's crypto asset guidance. Industry stakeholders flagged the burdensome compliance costs for intermediaries under current licensing rules, especially during a transitional period.

ASIC said this relief will be a bridge until those reforms, particularly a proposed licensing framework for payment stablecoins, are fully implemented. The exemption is temporary and will expire on June 1, 2028, unless repealed earlier.

Australian crypto users continue to face restrictions from banks when depositing funds into exchanges, according to a new Binance survey. Of the 1,900 respondents, 58% called for easier, unlimited deposits, while 22% reported switching banks to gain better crypto access.

The friction persists despite notable regulatory progress, including Anti-Money Laundering rules for exchanges since 2018 and the launch of spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs in 2024.

Spot bitcoin BTC$117,545.53 ETFs saw their first daily outflows in over a week on Wednesday, shedding a net $51.28 million, as investors reacted to the Federal Reserve's unexpectedly cautious outlook on future policy.

The outflow broke a seven-day streak that had brought in nearly $3 billion. Assets under management remain above $150 billion, according to SoSoValue data, but the tone in markets shifted after Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized economic uncertainty and signaled fewer cuts ahead than traders had hoped.

As expected, the Fed lowered its benchmark rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to a range of 4.00% to 4.25%, in its first cut of the year. But the real surprise came from the central bank's updated projections, which indicated just two more cuts in 2025 and fewer in 2026 than markets had priced in.

In a cautious press conference, Powell warned of “elevated” inflation and rising “downside risks” to employment, striking a tone that left traders wary. Markets interpreted the move as a hawkish cut, triggering a mild pullback in risk assets.

Ethereum ETFs also saw redemptions, with net outflows for a second straight day. Withdrawals amounted to $1.89 million following the exit of $61.7 million the day before.

Cryptocurrency prices edged higher. Bitcoin rose around 0.3% in the last 24 hours while ether moved up 1.7%. The broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index rose 2%.

Analysts told CoinDesk early this week that major cryptocurrencies led by bitcoin would resume their slow grind higher following Wednesday's Fed rate cut. 

That's exactly what has happened since the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points to 4% late Wednesday. The central bank also hinted rapid easing in the next 12 months.

Bitcoin BTC$117,545.53, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, topped $117,900, the highest level since Aug. 17, ending the sideways trend since Friday and resuming the slow recovery from early September lows near $107,200, CoinDesk data show. As of writing, the cryptocurrency was up nearly 1% on a 24-hour basis.

Ethereum's ether (ETH) token, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was up 2.7%, but remained locked within the four-week-long narrowing price range, or contracting triangle, as noted by CoinDesk early this week.

Other majors such as dogecoin DOGE$0.2839, solana SOL$251.54 and BNB (BNB) were up over 4% while the payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP traded nearly 3% higher, looking to build upside momentum in the wake of a bullish descending triangle breakout.

Programmable blockchain Solana's SOL token briefly topped $245, almost testing the weekend high, as CME's decision to offer SOL options from Oct. 13 raised hopes of increased institutional participation. These options will help institutions manage their exposure more effectively. The CME is also going to debut XRP options on the same day.

Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said that the Fed's openness to accelerate the pace of easing is creating an asymmetric setup for bitcoin.

"The dots [interest rate projections] leaned more dovish, signaling the Fed is open to accelerating the pace of easing if conditions demand it. That repricing risk is now front and center - creating an asymmetric setup for Bitcoin. While today's 25bps cut provided the spark, it is the path implied by the dots - more than the cut itself - that may set the stage for Bitcoin to challenge new highs into year-end," Mena said in an email to CoinDesk.

He added that bitcoin could set an all-time high above $124,000 by the end of October, with ether topping the $5,000 psychological barrier.

The path to new lifetime highs, however, may not be smooth, as the dollar is showing signs of life.

Despite the dovish Fed rate projections, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, including the euro, has bounced to 97.30, quickly recovering from the initial drop below the July 1 low of 96.37.

Perhaps the Fed's dovishness is already factored in by the foreign exchange markets. After all, the DXY has dropped 10% this year largely on the back of Fed rate cut bets. BTC, too, has rallied by 25% this year, hitting new highs above $124,000 in August, supported by dovish Fed expectations.

The dollar's resilience likely reflects Chairman Jerome Powell's emphasis that rapid, successive rate cuts are not guaranteed. He also highlighted that quantitative tightening (balance sheet runoff) remains in effect and inflation continues to run high. These remarks dampened the optimism sparked by the dovish dot plot projections.

A strong bounce in the DXY could lead to financial tightening, potentially weighing on BTC and other risk assets.

Sophisticated market participants are pricing tail risk, according to crypto financial platform BloFin.

Tail risk refers to low-probability, high-impact events, such as market crashes or major economic crises, that cause disproportionately large losses, often occurring at the "tails" of a probability distribution.

"As one of the most interest rate-sensitive assets, the recent increase in interest rate risk has led to a growing demand for tail protection, prompting market makers and traders to incorporate more interest rate risk into their pricing. Meanwhile, block trades data also includes a short-dated (about 4DTE) put spread order with 2,000 contracts (clearly intended for tail protection), which is not often seen," BloFin told CoinDesk.

A put spread is a strategy designed to profit from a decline in the price of the underlying asset, in this case, BTC.

CBDCs are tools of sovereignty in a world shifting eastward, edging away from dollar dominance

We are living in a rapidly transforming financial landscape. 

In July the US passed the Genius Act, the first formal federal framework for stablecoins. It mandates full reserve backing in US dollars or short-term treasuries – a bid to make America the “crypto capital of the world”, funding deficits while reviving the dollar's long-cherished “exorbitant privilege”.

The prize is tempting. Global cryptocurrency value has rocketed from just $5 billion in 2015 to more than $3 trillion by mid-2025, fuelled by technology, institutional adoption, exchange-traded funds and speculative fever. 

Yet crypto's story is one of boom and bust. Volatile prices, thin reserves and fragile pegs have repeatedly triggered bank-run dynamics. Stablecoins, e-money and cryptocurrencies are “currencies” in name only: they lack the unit of account, the store of value and the state guarantee that underpin true money.

That's why the next chapter won't be written by private tokens but by central banks. 

The digital economy already accounts for $16 trillion – 14 percent of global GDP – and it is being supercharged by artificial intelligence. Such a system demands infrastructure with security, trust and scale. 

Enter central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

CBDCs come in two forms. Retail CBDCs extend digital cash to the public. Wholesale CBDCs streamline interbank payments and settlements. Both can cut costs, enhance security and integrate seamlessly with tokenised assets. 

More strategically, they are becoming tools of sovereignty in a world shifting eastward, fragmenting and edging away from dollar dominance. 

For many states, CBDCs are no longer optional – they are defensive shields against US financial power and offensive tools for economic inclusion.

The UAE has grasped this early. Its planned digital dirham could be live by the end of 2025, supporting domestic payments, cross-border trade and e-commerce. 

It builds on the UAE's role as a crypto hub – home to Vara, the world's first independent virtual asset regulator and to pioneering tokenisation projects in real estate. Fractional ownership platforms let investors buy into Dubai property for as little as AED2,000 ($550). Tokenised assets are moving from theory to practice.

A digital dirham will make the payment system more efficient, facilitating transactions between individuals, businesses and governments, securely and at a lower cost.

It will widen access. Millions of expatriate workers and small businesses in the Gulf remain excluded from formal finance. 

A state-backed digital currency can bring them into the fold securely, lowering remittance costs and expanding economic participation. Smart contracts will add automation, creating new efficiencies in trade and finance.

Globally, the race is on. As of July, 137 countries are exploring CBDCs; 72 are in advanced development and three have already launched. 

China leads with its e-CNY, piloted in 29 cities with transactions topping $986 billion. The UAE, meanwhile, has conducted joint CBDC trials with Saudi Arabia and China through the Bank for International Settlements-backed mBridge project, and with Riyadh through Project Aber. 

These efforts hint at an alternative financial architecture – one not reliant on the dollar. 

Today, the greenback still accounts for nearly half of all international payments and dominates trade finance with an 82 percent share. But 98 percent of stablecoins are also pegged to the dollar, reinforcing its grip.

The stakes are geopolitical as much as financial. Imagine a trade transaction flowing between China and the UAE, settled instantly in e-CNY and digital dirham without touching dollars or the Swift payments system. That is no longer hypothetical – it's already been tested. 

Such flows foreshadow a future in which cross-border transactions are faster, cheaper and less dollar-dependent.

The UAE is well placed. It is the third-largest crypto adopter in Mena and among the top 40 globally, handling more than $30 billion in transactions in the year to June 2024, according to Chainalysis. 

Decentralised finance usage in the country has grown 74 percent year on year, and the Dubai Land Department predicts tokenised real estate could reach $16 billion by 2033.

But the opportunity is also a challenge. Unless the UAE and other forward-leaning economies scale CBDCs quickly, they risk ceding ground to dollar-denominated stablecoins. 

Washington has made its intentions clear. Beijing has already built its alternative framework. The global financial system is being redesigned – and whoever controls it will shape trade, power and trust in the digital age.

Blockchain analytics tools can enhance banking institutions' compliance programs and prevent illegal activities, Harris said in a press release announcing new guidance on the use of the tools by New York State-regulated banking organizations that are considering or already conducting virtual currency-related activities.

According to the release, blockchain analytics can be used to assess risk exposure through customer wallet screening and funds verification involving virtual asset service providers; conduct holistic monitoring for illicit activity exposure and risk management of third parties; augment due diligence controls to evaluate expected versus actual activity of customers engaged in virtual currency activity; and weigh the risks associated with virtual currency products or services.

“As traditional banking institutions expand into virtual currency activities, their compliance functions must adapt, onboarding new tools and technologies to mitigate new and different risks,” Harris said in the release.

The release said this guidance for banking institutions builds upon guidance that was issued to New York State-regulated virtual currency entities in April 2022.

In that guidance, Harris established the use of blockchain analytics tools as a best practice for these entities to prevent and manage financial risks and suspicious activities.

Blockchain analytics has made it easy to conduct transaction monitoring and determine whether a transaction came from, for example, a regulated institution or a darknet market, Caitlin Barnett, director of regulation and compliance at Chainalysis, told PYMNTS in an interview posted in November 2022.

“I remember the first time I saw blockchain analytics,” Barnett said. “I saw that we were getting very clear information that funds were either coming from an OK source or a risky source. We were seeing very clearly if we were getting funds from a darknet market or if a customer was sending funds to a darknet market.”

PYMNTS reported in April that Washington's evolving regulatory stance is poised to potentially reshape how banks and custodians engage with digital assets.

Andrew Daniels and John Gilpatrick discuss how your brain could fight to stay alive after your body gives up.

You know the stories: a flash of light, a tunnel, maybe even a mysterious voice telling you it's not your time. Near-death experiences have fascinated people for decades, but now scientists are starting to think there's something even stranger going on: Right as the body shuts down, the brain might be kicking into overdrive, firing off one last burst of consciousness in a final push to stay alive.

That's the mind-blowing idea behind one of Pop Mech's most-read recent stories, “A ‘Twilight Consciousness' May Exist in Dying Patients. Could That Mean Death Isn't Final?” In the story, scientists detail a huge spike in gamma brainwaves—those linked with memory, awareness, and sensory experience—after patients are declared clinically dead. The discovery basically challenges everything we thought we knew about what it means to die.

Watch Andrew Daniels and John Gilpatrick break down the weird phenomenon of “twilight consciousness” and share a few stranger-than-fiction stories, like the man who woke up on the operating table just before his organs were harvested, and the 95-year-old woman who rose from her coffin after six days and made herself a bowl of porridge because she was hungry.

Andrew and John also explore the deeper implications: Does your brain really make one last attempt to find a reason to live? What if we're seriously misjudging the moment of death entirely?

Global warming intensifies wildfires and exacerbates greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions1. However, global projections remain incomplete, hindering effective policy interventions amid uncertain warming futures2. Here, we developed an interpretable machine learning framework to project global burned areas and wildfire emissions. This framework accounts for the impacts of future climate change on fire activity and quantifies associated premature deaths and radiative forcing from fire-induced particulate matter (PM2.5). Here we show that from 2010–2014 to 2095–2099, fire carbon emissions are projected to increase by 23% under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2-4.5. Increased fire-related aerosols reduce the 0.06 W m⁻² cooling effect north of 60°N. Projections show a surge in premature deaths from wildfire smoke, reaching 1.40 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.66–2.25) million annually during 2095–2099, roughly 6 times higher than current levels. Africa is projected to experience the greatest rise in fire-related deaths (11-fold), driven by emission changes and an aging population. Europe and the U.S. would experience a 1–2-fold increase under SSP2-4.5, linked to rising fire occurrences in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere. Overall, the health burden would become more evenly distributed across nations of differing development levels than present patterns, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts.

Wildfire activity has increased in the US and is projected to accelerate under future climate change 1–3. However, our understanding of the impacts of climate change on wildfire activity, smoke, and health outcomes remains highly uncertain, due to the difficulty of modeling the causal chain from climate to wildfire to air pollution and health. Here we quantify the mortality burden in the US due to wildfire smoke fine particulate matter (PM2.5) under climate change. We construct an ensemble of statistical and machine learning models that link climate to wildfire smoke PM2.5, and empirically estimate smoke PM2.5-mortality relationships using data on all recorded deaths in the US. We project that smoke PM2.5 could result in 71,420 excess deaths (95% CI: 34,930 - 98,430) per year by 2050 under a high warming scenario (SSP3-7.0) – a 73% increase relative to estimated 2011-2020 average annual excess deaths from smoke. Cumulative excess deaths from smoke PM2.5 could reach 1.9 million between 2026-2055. We find evidence for mortality impacts of smoke PM2.5 that last up to three years after exposure. When monetized, climate-driven smoke deaths result in economic damages that exceed existing estimates of climate-driven damages from all other causes combined in the US 4,5. Our research suggests that the health impacts of climate-driven wildfire smoke could be among the most important and costly consequences of a warming climate in the US.

Some Dogs Can Learn Categories like Human Toddlers Do

These dogs can extend words to new objects based on function the way children do in early language learning

By Anirban Mukhopadhyay edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Researchers found that some dogs can learn terms for functional categories, such as ‘pull' and ‘throw' toys.

Arya, a six-year-old border collie in Italy, can learn a new toy's name from just one or two mentions. Her owners say she even knows her favorite foods' names; when pizza is on the menu, the word has to be whispered. Arya's gift made her a natural for a new Current Biology study showing that some dogs with unusually large vocabularies can go beyond simply memorizing names.

For the study, owners of 10 talented dogs—mostly border collies—taught them words for two categories: tug toys, called pulls, and fetch toys, called throws. All toys were different in size, shape and color, so appearance could not guide learning.

Arya was one of 10 gifted word-learner dogs—eight border collies, one blue heeler, one Labrador retriever and one Welsh corgi pembroke—to participate in the new experiment.

After four weeks of training, brand-new toys that looked nothing like typical pulls or throws were introduced. This time, the dogs only experienced each toy's function (either tugging or fetching) during play; they were not taught words for any of them. After a week of play, when asked to fetch a pull or a throw, the dogs chose the right toy two thirds of the time—well above the 12.5 percent expected by chance. “These gifted word-learner dogs are not only able to memorize the labels of many different objects, but can also extend a familiar word to new objects that share the same function, even if they look very different,” says study lead author Claudia Fugazza, an ethologist at Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary.

Fugazza emphasizes that these animals are exceptional; most family dogs never build such vocabularies. She says the dogs' ease and flexibility applying words by function, similar to how human children begin extending their vocabularies, was surprising.

Elika Bergelson, a Harvard University language scientist who was not part of the new study, says human infants “mostly rely on how things look. But by 14 months they can also use role or function—for instance, telling apart who is chasing and who is being chased in a scenario—to extend words” to new things, much like the dogs in the study did. In everyday life, function and appearance usually go together: all cups share a basic shape because it makes them good at holding liquid. “Unlike the real world, where ropes look tug-worthy and balls appear throwable, this study isolates the function,” Bergelson says. “Taking away visual cues is a clean way to probe how categories might form across species.”

Back home, Arya is busy with her favorite search games and word play, oblivious to her superpower. “Because these dogs live in families and pick up words naturally,” Fugazza says, “their parallel to early child learning could offer scientists unique possibilities to explore how language-related abilities might have evolved—and how they can emerge in a nonlinguistic species.”

Arya relaxes.

It's all thanks to a titanium beam.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has announced a new way to reliably make element 116, livermorium. The results, made by using a titanium beam to irradiate a sample, could point toward the elusive “island of stability” for even heavier nuclear elements—and show researchers a route to create the next feasible element, number 120.

Many of us remember a time when the periodic table appeared with some curious blank spots. Your age determines what those blank spots were, but they've been consistent, because discovery of elements has never been in full numerical order. Their availability has depended on location, stability, and accessibility of both the naturally occurring forms and a method to separate them. 

After a certain point, the elements transition from naturally occurring to laboratory-prepared. These elements may exist somewhere in the universe, but Earth is not cold enough, high-pressure enough, and so forth to create those conditions outside a lab. But inside labs like Berkeley, they use increasingly advanced technologies to jam more protons inside the nuclei of atoms in order to create these new elements.

In their preprint paper, a large team of scientists explain that we've reached the limits of a current generation method to make new heavy elements. The heaviest discovery to date, element 118 oganesson, was made using a beam of calcium isotope 48 particles. Calcium 48, with its definitive 20 protons plus 28 neutrons, is a common and very effective starter for physical chemistry. 

At the same time, we've now run out of materials to beam Calcium 48 into in order to produce new elements. While it's true that we only need to keep pumping protons into existing nuclei, the atoms we start with need to have a lot of protons in order to support that reaction. To make elements 119 or 120, the researchers explain, they'd need einsteinium (99)  or fermium (100). “Unfortunately, neither of these elements can be produced in sufficient quantities to produce a suitable target,” they write.

So, what's a super heavy element enjoyer to do? The next big thing in physical chemistry, it seems, is titanium. 

Titanium 50 has 22 protons plus 28 neutrons and is very stable. These scientists brought it in as titanium 50 oxide, reduced it to just titanium, and then cooked it into a beam of ions using a special oven. Over a period of 22 days, the beam irradiated a plutonium foil and triggered the nuclear reactions that create element 116, livermorium. The researchers were pleased with how well the beam held together and performed.

The titanium 50 beam is proof of concept after a period of intensive research and experimentation. If heavy element chemistry were a sports franchise, they won the world championships with calcium 48, and then had to take time to rebuild after everyone retired. Now, a new generation of players is ready to take over full time. The titanium 50 beam has new benefits and drawbacks, and its potential is even better in the long run.

You may wonder why these heavy elements are worth all this exploration and experimentation. The thing is, we just don't know yet what might happen when using these extraordinary and strange elements. Scientists want to find out, and that research could reveal properties and use cases we can't even dream of today—but we can only make a few atoms at a time, and they last for just microseconds before the protons spray back out of the nucleus. It's impossible to do further research.

For decades, scientists have predicted the existence of an island of stability in the extended catalog of elements and their isotopes. Cramming nuclei full of protons is inherently unstable because the protons act like the wrong ends of a magnet, but the island of stability may hold isotopes that last far longer without decaying. There are scientific explanations for this, including theories about layers of particles in the nucleus, and “magic numbers” of protons and neutrons that may be stable in combination.

If we can find stable super heavy elements, scientists may be able to make much larger samples that can be subjected to more rigorous experimentation. Elements have always had the capacity to surprise us, like mercury, which is a liquid metal at room temperature; bismuth, which always repels magnets; and copper, which is responsible for almost a rainbow of naturally occurring colors by itself.

What's the mercury or bismuth of the super heavy elements? We can only find out once there's enough to play with. The titanium 50 beam, or something similar inspired by it, could unearth the next half dozen elements—and one or more could be our stable holy grail.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Nestled between Hawaii and the western coast of Mexico lies the Pacific Ocean's Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 4.5 million-kilometer-square area of abyssal plain bordered by the Clarion and Clipperton Fracture Zones. Although this stretch of sea is a vibrant ecosystem filled with marine life, the CCZ is known best for its immense collection of potato-sized rocks known as polymetallic nodules. 

These rocks, of which there are potentially trillions, are filled with rich deposits of nickel, manganese, copper, zinc, cobalt. Those particular metals are vital for the batteries needed to power a green energy future, leading some mining companies to refer to nodules as a “battery in a rock.”

However, a study reports that these nodules might be much more than simply a collection of valuable materials for electric cars—they also produce oxygen 4,000 meters below the surface where sunlight can't reach. 

This unexpected source of “dark oxygen,” as it's called, redefines the role these nodules play in the CZZ. The rocks could also rewrite the script on not only how life began on this planet, but also its potential to take hold on other worlds within our Solar System, such as Enceladus or Europa. The results of this study were published in the journal Nature Geoscience. 

“For aerobic life to begin on the planet,” Andrew Sweetman, deep-sea ecologist with the Scottish Association for Marine Science and lead author of the study said in a press statement, “there had to be oxygen and our understanding has been that Earth's oxygen supply began with photosynthetic organisms. But we now know that there is oxygen produced in the deep sea, where there is no light. I think we therefore need to revisit questions like: where could aerobic life have begun?”

The journey toward this discovery began more than a decade ago when Sweetman began analyzing how oxygen levels decreased further into the depths of the ocean. So it came as a surprise in 2013 when sensors returned increased levels of oxygen in the CCZ. At the time, Sweetman dismissed the data as the result of faulty sensors, but future studies showed that this abyssal plain somehow produced oxygen. Taking note of the nodule's “battery in a rock” tagline, Sweetman wondered if the minerals found in these nodules were somehow acting as a kind of “geobattery” by separating hydrogen and oxygen via seawater electrolysis. 

A 2023 study showed that various bacteria and archaea can create “dark oxygen,” so Sweetman and his team recreated the conditions of the CCZ in a laboratory and killed off any microorganisms with mercury chloride—surprisingly, oxygen levels continued rising. According to Scientific American, Sweetman found a voltage of roughly 0.95 volts on the surface of these nodules, likely charging up as they grow with different deposits growing irregularly throughout, and this natural charge is enough to split the seawater. 

This discovery adds more fuel to the already-fiery debate over what to do with these nodules. Mining outfits like the Metals Company, the CEO of which coined the phrase “battery in a rock,” sees these nodules as the answer to our energy problems. However, 25 countries want the governing body—the International Seabed Authority (ISA) Council—to implement a moratorium, or at the very least a precautionary pause, so more research can be conducted to see how mining these nodules could affect the ocean. This is especially vital considering that the world's seas are already facing a litany of climate challenges, including acidification, deoxygenation, and pollution. 

In response to this discovery, Scripps Institution of Oceanography's Lisa Levin, who wasn't involved with the study, highlighted why such a moratorium is so important for protecting these deep-sea nodules in a comment to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition: 

The ISA is still negotiating with key players on deep-sea mining regulations. 

So while the future of the world's oceans is approaching a critical moment of conservation or exploitation, science has proven once again that disrupting these ecosystems could have consequences we can't even imagine.

The ocean is a wondrous place—let's keep our waste out of it.

Here's what you will learn when you read this story:

From the 1930s until the 1970s, multiple government agencies approved the dumping of hazardous materials, including chemicals such as DDT and other caustic waste, at 14 locations off the coast of California. According to the Los Angeles Times, the idea at the time was that “dilution was the solution to pollution,” essentially using the immensity of the world's oceans to dilute harmful chemicals to a harmless level of parts per million (ppm).

The idea did not go according to plan, a disconcerting prospect with an estimated half a million barrels still underwater today. 

Armed with the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) SuBastian aboard the research vessel Falkor, scientists from UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography took a closer look at these barrels littering the ocean floor and found something distressing. There appeared to be a ghostly halo emanating from many of them, suggesting something was leaking out into the ocean environment. In a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) Nexus, the authors detail the concerning results of humanity's broad disregard for oceanic ecosystems. 

While the researchers were expecting to find concentrations of DDT—a pesticide that serves as the main chemical antagonist of Rachel Carson's famous book Silent Spring, and whose use is now illegal in the U.S.—they instead discovered that the halos were created from alkaline caustic waste that form an extremophile environment. The team says the halos mimic the conditions of areas such as hydrothermal vents.

“DDT was not the only thing that was dumped in this part of the ocean and we have only a very fragmented idea of what else was dumped there,” Johanna Gutleben, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “We only find what we are looking for and up to this point we have mostly been looking for DDT. Nobody was thinking about alkaline waste before this and we may have to start looking for other things as well.”

The halos formed a thick, concrete-like crust, which was difficult for the ROV to collect using coring devices. Instead, the SuBastian relied on its robotic arm to tear off pieces for further analysis. The research shows that when alkaline waste leaked from the barrels, its reactions with magnesium in the seawater created brucite, the mineral form of magnesium hydroxide. Where this high pH material meets seawater at the edges, it forms calcium carbonate—the chalky, outer edge of the halo. 

“It's shocking that 50-plus years later you're still seeing these effects,” Paul Jensen, another co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “We can't quantify the environmental impact without knowing how many of these barrels with white halos are out there, but it's clearly having a localized impact on microbes.”

Unfortunately, removing these ecological disasters isn't simple, as disturbing the ocean floor would likely create sediment plumes that spread the contamination further throughout the water column. The best hope is to study the DDT-poisoned sediments and see what microbes could possibly break down the chemical and slowly clean-up this short-sighted, human-made disaster. 

Whether its DDT, caustic waste, microplastics, trash, or other kinds of refuse, the mindset of viewing the ocean as the world's dumping ground is one that's sadly still alive and well to this day.

Nature Climate Change

                         (2025)Cite this article


Climate change has large economic costs for society. An important effect is the disruption of natural resource supply by climate-mediated disturbances such as wildfires, pest outbreaks and storms. Here we show that disturbance-induced losses for Europe's timber-based forestry could increase from the current €115 billion to €247 billion under severe climate change. This would diminish the timber value of Europe's forests by up to 42% and reduce the current gross value added of the forestry sector by up to 15%. Central Europe emerges as a continental hotspot of disturbance costs, with projected future costs of up to €19,885 per hectare. Simultaneous climate-related increases in forest productivity could offset future economic losses from disturbances in Northern and Central Europe but not in Southern Europe. We find high disturbance-related cost of unmitigated warming, highlighting that climate change adaptation in forestry is not only an ecological but also an economic imperative.

Climate change has strong impacts on global ecosystems1,2. These impacts are likely to result in high economic costs for society3. Recent studies estimated economic losses related to climate impacts on global ecosystems to several trillion dollars4, with income reductions of 19%5, several hundred billions of dollars needed to compensate for loss and damage6, and reductions in the gross domestic product of 1.2% per 1 °C increase in global mean temperature7. In particular, the already observed8 and projected future9,10,11 increases in frequency and intensity of extreme events, such as droughts, wildfires and floods, have severe consequences for the global economy4,12.

Forest ecosystems are particularly prone to climatic extremes because trees are sessile and long lived13,14. As forest products are central to a bio-based economy15,16,17, changing extreme events pose a major challenge for a wider use of bio-based materials. A major concern in this regard are forest disturbances, that is, large-scale pulses of tree mortality from wildfires, pest outbreaks and storms18,19. Forest disturbances have increased in frequency and severity in many parts of the globe in recent decades20,21 and are expected to further increase under continued climate change22. A hotspot of changing forest disturbances is Europe, where disturbance rates doubled in less than 20 years for major disturbance agents20, and a massive recent pulse of tree mortality was unprecedented in at least 170 years23. Societies in Europe are strongly dependent on forests for providing jobs, supporting rural livelihoods, and contributing to environmental and economic well-being24. Yet, the continental-scale economic impacts of climate-mediated disturbances remain unclear so far.

Understanding the economic impacts of disturbances is complex, as interactions with other climate-induced changes have to be considered. For instance, climate change affects forest productivity, with decreases projected for water-limited regions25 but broad-scale increases expected due to CO2 fertilization25,26,27 and an extension of the growing season particularly in boreal and mountain ecosystems28,29. Changing forest productivity interacts with disturbance costs: increasing productivity increases the growing stock, which in turn enhances the timber value of forests. Simultaneously, productivity-related increases in harvest levels lead to higher returns that might partly or completely offset the economic costs of increasing disturbances30,31. These interactions require a joint evaluation of the economic consequences of changing disturbance and productivity30,31.

Here we present an estimate of the current and future economic costs of forest disturbances at continental scale, accounting for climate-mediated changes in both forest productivity and disturbance in Europe. Specifically, we investigated the historical costs of disturbance on the timber-based forest value (under the climate conditions of the reference period 1981–2005) and how they are likely to evolve under scenarios of future climate change (representing the climate conditions expected for the period 2076–2100). We assessed hotspots of economic disturbance impact in Europe and whether increasing forest productivity can offset economic losses from disturbance under climate change.

To address our questions, we coupled three crucial elements, (1) spatially explicit (16 ×16 km) forest growth simulations at the level of individual tree species, (2) >150,000 Monte Carlo simulations of forest disturbances informed by latest remote sensing data and (3) economic models to quantify the costs of changing productivity and disturbance across continental Europe focusing on the commercially most relevant species (a total of 91 million ha, or two-thirds of Europe's forest area). We studied a total of 1,536 scenarios under three different representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario families and quantified the cost of disturbance by comparing scenario simulations to the counterfactual of simulations without disturbance under the same climate conditions. Economic effects were quantified by converting simulated time series of planned (that is, business-as-usual management) and unplanned (that is, disturbance-related) timber harvests to economic cashflow, which was subsequently discounted and summed to obtain forest value (Extended Data Fig. 1). We translated the present value of total disturbance costs into annual costs by multiplying with a discount rate of 1.5%. Disturbances are discrete events in space and time, and averaging over extended spatiotemporal scales masks their immediate local effects12. Hence, we report costs for both the average (mean across all stochastic simulations) and the extreme case (defined as the average of the worst 5% of simulations, conditional value at risk), with the latter being particularly informative for planning under the precautionary principle32.

Under historical conditions (1981–2005), the economic costs of natural disturbances in Europe (loss of forest values) were €115 ± 3 billion (mean ± s.d., Fig. 1), with an average annual cost of €1,729 ± 48 million yr−1 and an average cost per unit area of €1,265 ± 35 ha−1. These costs were the result of on average 74.5 million m3 of timber disturbed per year (Table 1). Disturbances reduced the total forest value of Europe by 28.6 ± 0.7% compared with the counterfactual of no disturbance. Under climate change, total future timber harvest increased by 17.1%, from 259.6 to 304.1 million m3 yr−1 (for the period 2076–2100) under scenario RCP4.5 (increases of 12.9% and 28.0% under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively), resulting from both increasing productivity (increasing planned harvest) and increasing disturbance (increasing unplanned harvest; Table 1). Distinct increases in unplanned, that is, disturbance-induced, harvests increased costs of disturbance to €186 ± 8 billion under RCP4.5, and up to €247 ± 15 billion under RCP8.5 (RCP2.6: €146 ± 3 billion). This reduced the potential forest value relative to the counterfactual of no disturbance by up to 42.1 ± 2.5%, and translated to average annual costs of €2,783 ± 116 million yr−1 under RCP4.5 (RCP2.6: €2,191 ± 42 million yr−1; RCP8.5: €3,711 ± 218 million yr−1), and average costs per unit area of €2,037 ± 85 ha−1 (RCP2.6: €1,603 ± 31 ha−1; RCP8.5: €2,715 ± 160 ha−1). Simulating a moderate shortening of the rotation period by 10 years as a measure to adapt to changing climate and disturbance regimes reduced the cost of disturbance by up to €10 billion under scenario RCP8.5 (Extended Data Fig. 2). All economic results were sensitive to varying discount rates, with higher costs of disturbance at lower discount rates (Extended Data Fig. 3). Different climate model projections within the same RCP family resulted in similar trajectories (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Bars show the timber-based forest value losses from disturbances relative to the counterfactual of undisturbed forest development under the same climate scenario. Data denote mean ± s.d. across all simulations (N = 300). ‘Historical' assumes climate conditions from 1981–2005, while RCP scenarios are for projected future climate conditions for the period 2076–2100.

The economic costs of natural disturbances varied widely across Europe (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 1). Hotspots of future disturbance costs were mainly located in Central Europe (especially in parts of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic; Fig. 2c), where disturbances lowered the economic value of forests on average by €3,233 ha−1 under moderate climate change (RCP4.5), and €2,460 ha−1 and €4,375 ha−1 under mild (RCP2.6) and severe (RCP8.5) climate change, respectively (Fig. 2a). Extreme costs in this region (that is, the average of the economically worst 5% of simulations, conditional value at risk) were €17,067 ha−1 under RCP4.5 (€13,932 ha−1 and €19,885 ha−1 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively). In contrast to the high disturbance costs in Central Europe, forests in Northern Europe had 60–65% lower economic costs of disturbance, with average losses of €1,164 ha−1 under RCP4.5 (€966 ha−1 and €1,523 ha−1 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively). Nonetheless, local extremes were also high in Northern Europe, exceeding €10,000 ha−1 (RCP2.6: €9,747 ha−1, RCP4.5: €12,370 ha−1, RCP8.5: €14,664 ha−1, Extended Data Table 1). Generally, the continental-scale differences in disturbance costs decreased when considering extreme values (Fig. 2). Disturbance costs in Southern Europe (Fig. 2c) were between those in Northern and Central Europe (Extended Data Table 1).

The increase in forest productivity under climate change (Table 1) overcompensated the economic losses from disturbances in Europe overall, but regional variation was high. The productivity-related increase in forest value can be attributed to two effects: higher initial growing stocks and increased sustainable harvest levels from elevated tree growth (Extended Data Fig. 5). These effects were strongest under scenario RCP8.5, yet in this scenario, disturbance-induced losses also increased most strongly (Fig. 3a). The economic effects of productivity and disturbance increased at similar rates across climate scenarios, resulting in little variation in overall forest value with climate change (RCP2.6: €337.9 ± 12.6 billion, RCP4.5: €328.6 ± 20.8 billion, RCP8.5: €340.8 ± 34.9 billion). However, scenario uncertainty was lowest under RCP2.6 and increased considerably with increasing severity of climate change (Fig. 3b). Productivity-related offsets of disturbance losses varied distinctly across Europe. In Northern Europe, economic gains from increasing productivity clearly outweighed disturbance-mediated losses under climate change (Fig. 3c,d). In contrast, productivity stagnated or declined in Southern Europe while disturbances increased, resulting in decreasing net forest values under climate change. In Central Europe, productivity was projected to increase, albeit at a lower rate than in Northern Europe. Here, economic losses from disturbances are compensated by gains in productivity, yet the offset capacity decreases with increasing severity of climate change (Fig. 3c,d). Only under the mild climate scenario RCP2.6 was the forest value of all European regions (and 92% of all European countries, Extended Data Fig. 6) projected to increase relative to historical levels, when considering the net effects of both changing productivity and disturbance.

Here we provide a continental-scale estimate of forest disturbance costs for Europe. Our findings suggest that disturbance costs could more than double under climate change. Under severe climate change, the annual losses estimated here correspond to up to 15% of the current gross value added of the forestry sector in Europe24. We furthermore highlight considerable differences in the economic costs of forest disturbances throughout Europe, identifying particular hotspots in Central Europe. Local-scale studies from this region show that disturbance costs could be even higher than estimated here, when only considering disturbance impacts on the economically most valuable tree species32. Nonetheless, our results of disturbance-based losses on the timber-based forest value of up to €19,885 ha−1 suggest that disturbances could posit major economic challenges for timber-based forestry in the future. Our results also indicate that simultaneous increases in forest productivity under climate change could offset economic losses from increasing disturbances. The finding that Northern Europe is the main beneficiary of climate change, with increasing forest values in Europe's boreal zone, is in agreement with previous studies on the economic effects of climate change33. In contrast, the timber-based forest value in Southern Europe is already considerably lower than in other parts of the continent24 and will decrease further under climate change. The negative impacts of climate change on Southern Europe identified here correspond well with previous assessments9,25,33,34.

Important limitations need to be considered when interpreting our results. First, our estimates of the cost of disturbances are likely conservative, because we only focused on timber-related forest values. Although timber remains the main marketable good from forests throughout Europe, disturbances have broad impacts beyond timber35, and the societal costs of disturbance impacts on non-marketable ecosystem services were not considered here. Similarly, we focused on the economically most important tree species and did not study the effect of tree species change in response to changing climatic conditions. More broadly, the consideration of alternative silvicultural strategies was beyond the scope of our analysis. Rather, we assumed even-aged management as the most widely used silvicultural strategy across the continent24,36,37 and considered local differences in productivity and their effect on rotation periods. While this approach is not able to capture the full variability of forest management regimes applied in Europe24,36, it approximates the dominant management of the simulated tree species well36,38, and provides a robust and consistent baseline for quantifying continental-scale disturbance costs. We also omitted income from thinning, likely underestimating Europe's forest value. However, previous studies showed that considering thinnings does not substantially reduce disturbance costs32. The increasing volatility resulting from disturbances may also drive risk-averse forest owners to exit the market39, which can have considerable economic effects beyond the ones considered here. Moreover, we only incorporated the three most important forest disturbance agents in Europe, namely, wildfires, windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks. The advent of novel disturbances such as invasive alien pests and pathogens could considerably alter future disturbance regimes at the continental scale40 and further increase economic costs of disturbance. Another important assumption in our analysis is that some of the disturbed timber is salvage harvested and thus enters the timber market. This is the current default management response to disturbances in Europe41,42, yet the practice is increasingly criticized for its ecological impacts43,44. Lower salvage rates would likely further increase the economic costs of forest disturbances32,43.

While our quantification of disturbance costs is likely conservative, the estimate of the compensatory effect of increasing productivity might be optimistic. Productivity gains offset disturbance losses because they simultaneously increase initial forest values and periodic returns in our analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5), yet the assumptions with regard to initial values are uncertain (that is, similar forest age structure at higher productivity levels). Furthermore, effects of reduced water use efficiency45 or acclimation effects in response to elevated CO246 were not considered here. In fact, recent studies already indicate declining forest growth even in some areas of Northern Europe47. While we here used best available modelling approaches at continental scale, these uncertainties call for further research on economic effects of both changing productivity and disturbance34,48.

The high economic costs of disturbance identified here have important implications for forest policy and management. First, losses from disturbances need to be considered more explicitly in forest planning and the economic valuation of different forest management strategies. While even-aged coniferous forests were propagated throughout Europe on the basis of economic grounds in the past, these considerations ignored the substantial disturbance risk of these silvicultural systems13,49, and hence also the associated costs. As disturbances are likely to increase further under climate change, future considerations of forest planning and management need to explicitly account for their impacts50. Second, we show that considerable adaptation efforts are needed to reduce disturbance impacts in Europe's forests. While these efforts (including measures such as planting less disturbance-prone tree species and managing for structured and mixed forests49,51) require resources, they will also reduce disturbance risk49,51 and thus disturbance-related costs. This highlights that there is not only an ecological but also an economical imperative to climate change adaptation in forestry. We show that moderately reducing rotation lengths might reduce disturbance costs, illustrating the potential of climate change adaptation measures in silviculture. However, such measures could also have unintended consequences on other ecosystem services such as forest carbon storage and habitat value36,52, and should thus only be applied after careful consideration of local trade-offs. Efforts should particularly focus on hotspots of disturbance impacts in Central and Southern Europe, where the expected rise in disturbance-related costs could become increasingly prohibitive for regular forest management in the absence of adaptive measures. Lastly, our results underline the importance of climate change mitigation. Only when climate change was limited to mild levels (scenario RCP2.6) did net positive economic effects of changing productivity and disturbance emerge throughout the European continent. In contrast, largely unmitigated climate change (scenario RCP8.5) could lead to severe economic losses from disturbances, particularly in Southern and Central Europe. We thus conclude that mitigating climate change can avoid substantial disturbance-related costs in the forestry sector.

We modelled forest development explicitly for 16 × 16 km grid cells across Europe at 10-year time steps using a matrix model (Extended Data Fig. 1). In each grid cell, we considered the forested area of the four economically most important tree species in Europe38, namely, European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and deciduous oaks (Quercus robur L. and Quercus petraea Matt. Liebl.). Together, these species account for more than 95% of the European timber market53 and two-thirds of Europe's forest area (91 million hectares). Stand age distributions were extracted from an analysis based on remote sensing54, and tree species shares for each 10-year age-class bin were considered proportional to the species composition at grid-cell level. For each 16 × 16 km grid cell, the forest area was thus distributed to 104 classes (4 tree species × 26 age classes).

For the sake of parsimony and to consistently compare the effects of disturbance and productivity change across Europe, we assumed a single silvicultural system for all simulated forests. As the clear-cut system is still the dominant silvicultural system in Europe for the tree species considered here24,36,37, we simulated even-aged stand development followed by clear cutting and planting. We accounted for local variation in management intensity across Europe by deriving rotation lengths at the cell level. Specifically, we calculated economically optimal rotation lengths (that is, the age of final cutting that maximizes forest value) contingent on tree species and local site productivity for each cell (see Supplementary Table 1 and section ‘Calculation of the economically optimal rotation age' in Supplementary Methods for more details). For the calculation of optimal rotation lengths, we assumed timber production to start from bare ground and we disregarded disturbances.

Forest managers are actively adapting their management to the emerging changes in environmental conditions. While a comprehensive assessment of the economic effects of climate change adaptation measures is beyond the scope of our analysis, we considered two elements of climate change adaptation in our simulations: First, we simulated an adaptation of optimal rotation periods to the emerging changes in productivity under climate change. This was implemented by deriving optimal rotation periods separately for each climate scenario and grid cell (see section ‘Climate data' in Supplementary Methods for more details). Thus, rotation periods are effectively shortened in locations where productivity increases, and rotation periods are extended in areas where productivity decreases, simulating dynamic adaptation of managers to changing environmental conditions. Second, we tested the effect of adapting the rotation length from its local economic optimum value in a sensitivity analysis, varying rotation period length by up to ±20 years from the economic optimum (Extended Data Fig. 2). In Europe, reducing rotation period length is a measure that is frequently discussed in the context of dampening the impacts of disturbances52,55, while extending rotation periods can increase forest carbon storage and habitat value36. Thinnings were disregarded in our simulations32, and we simulated no tree species change, that is, species were replanted in their current proportions after final harvesting or disturbance (but see refs. 53,56).

We assessed the effect of climate change by considering two time slices, one representing historical climate (1981–2005) and one future climate (2076–2100). For each time slice, we simulated 500 years of forest development starting from current forest conditions, with climate conditions averaged for each time slice. We chose this approach over transient scenario simulations as it better quantifies the long-term economic consequences of changing climate and disturbance regimes, given that discounting in economic analyses strongly reduces the weight of future changes in transient analyses. We chose a simulation period of 500 years, as it contains multiple rotations, and aggregated cash flows beyond this period have little influence on the forest value because of discounting. Additional to the time slice representing historical climate, we considered 3 climate scenarios (representing different radiative forcing levels, that is, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 from CMIP5) each derived from 3 different climate models, downscaled to our 16 × 16 km grid cells (for details see section ‘Climate data' in Supplementary Methods). This resulted in 12 different climate scenarios considered in the analyses. Climate affected both productivity and disturbance in the simulations, as described in the following paragraphs.

Forest productivity and its response to climate change was quantified by dynamically simulating the potential net primary productivity (NPP) per grid cell and species. Potential NPP was defined as the NPP of a fully stocked pure stand of a species under a given climate, during the stand development stage in which tree growth culminates. Potential NPP for each grid cell and scenario was estimated using a deep neural network trained on data generated by the process-based simulation model iLand57,58. To derive training data for the deep neural network, we used iLand to simulate NPP values of the four tree species across the full climate and soil gradients of Europe and under the 12 different climate scenarios considered. In iLand, NPP increases with temperature (as long as temperatures are below optimal temperatures for photosynthesis) and atmospheric CO2 concentration, while water availability (in the atmosphere and soil) and plant-available nitrogen limit the carbon uptake of trees (a detailed description of iLand and the mechanisms used to calculate NPP can be found in refs. 57,58 and on the model website https://iland-model.org). We ran simulations on the basis of daily climate data for each climate scenario (see section ‘Climate data' in Supplementary Methods) and extracted the resulting annual NPP values. We developed a feedforward convolutional deep neural network with 13 layers and 189,000 trainable parameters. We subsequently trained the deep neural network on 14 million datapoints derived from iLand to predict annual potential NPP values for the four tree species under study, contingent on the soil and climate conditions prevailing at a grid cell (see section ‘Forest productivity under climate change' in Supplementary Methods). The deep neural network was well able to learn the responses of the underlying process-based model and generalized well between climate change scenarios. Predicted potential NPP values for current climate conditions were evaluated against independent observations from satellite data (see section ‘Forest productivity under climate change' in Supplementary Methods). To derive merchantable timber volume in our matrix model simulations, we used species-specific yield table estimates (see section ‘Yield tables' in Supplementary Methods for more details), dynamically calculating the respective yield class from potential NPP values per cell. Specifically, we used a quadratic link function to capture the nonlinear relationship between NPP and yield class (see section ‘Mapping of NPP values to yield tables' in Supplementary Methods), assuming correspondence between the range of potential NPP values predicted in simulations under historical climate and the range of yield class values covered in yield tables. In this way, we combined the robust estimates of merchantable timber volume from yield tables with dynamically simulated productivity changes under climate change, resulting in realistic projections of future timber production at cell level.

To comprehensively assess the impact of natural disturbances, we considered two types of disturbances in the simulation: first, climate-sensitive ‘background' disturbances were derived on the basis of statistical survival probabilities estimated on the basis of continental-scale forest inventory data59 (see section ‘Background disturbances' in Supplementary Methods). This disturbance type represents small- to medium-scale events that happen regularly (for example, small-scale mortality from drought or insect infestations, small-scale windthrow), but do not lead to larger-scale economic implications such as market crashes. They were sensitive to changing mean annual temperature, maximum temperature of the warmest month, minimum temperature of the coldest month, annual precipitation sum and precipitation sum of the warmest quarter in our simulations59. For each grid cell and tree species, we simulated these disturbances within each time step by resetting a proportion of the cell's area to age class zero and replanting the area, with the proportion affected by disturbance derived from a climate-sensitive hazard probability function59. Second, to account for economic risks from rare but large disturbance events, we simulated stochastic, landscape-scale extreme events, such as severe fires, windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks, using biome-specific remote sensing data60,61,62. Extreme events were defined for each scenario as those affecting more than twice the area disturbed in an average year of the scenario. To estimate the occurrence of such extreme disturbance events, we first calculated historical biome-specific average disturbance rates (1986–2005). We subsequently developed scenarios of potential future changes in average disturbance rates based on expected increases in drought intensity and frequency in Europe2, as well as on other best available estimates for future disturbance change20,22 and the already observed responses to recent climate change (Supplementary Table 2). On the basis of these analyses, we assumed mean disturbance increases by a factor of 2, 4 and 6, respectively, for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and investigated the sensitivity of our results to a wide range of different potential future disturbance changes (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). Subsequently, the specific frequencies and magnitudes of extreme events were derived using Taylor's power law equations fit to remote sensing data63 (Supplementary Fig. 1), estimating the temporal variance of disturbance rates per agent and biome under historical and increased future mean disturbance rates. The occurrence of extreme events in a simulated time step was determined at the level of biomes by drawing from Poisson distributions. The affected area in each biome was calculated by multiplying the number of extreme events in each time step by their magnitude. Affected cells were then drawn randomly until the estimated disturbed area was reached. In disturbed cells, depending on the disturbance agent (see section ‘Extreme disturbances' in Supplementary Methods), all or most of the forest area was reset to age class zero.

Revenues from timber-based forest management were calculated from tree diameter- and species-dependent timber prices and establishment costs53 (Extended Data Table 2). Revenues were discounted and summed over the whole simulation period to quantify forest value32,53 (default discount rate of 1.5%, but see Extended Data Fig. 3 for a sensitivity analysis of different discount rates). Simulated increases in productivity under climate change influenced forest value via increased timber harvests, which positively affected forest value. Simulated disturbances had a range of nuanced economic impacts in the simulation (Extended Data Table 3). For climate-sensitive background disturbances, we assumed that the impacted timber is sold with a 50% decrease in net revenue due to a loss of timber quality and increased harvesting costs (see section ‘Prices' in Supplementary Methods). For extreme disturbance events, revenues from disturbed timber were set to zero for the affected grid cell, assuming a collapse of the timber market in the region as a result of large quantities of disturbed timber flooding the market32. For extreme events, planting costs for the next cohort of trees were assumed to increase by a factor of two, to reflect higher post-disturbance expenses from planting large areas and to account for typical shortages in nurseries after large disturbance events. To assess the sensitivity of our results to additional market effects of disturbances (that is, price drops from extreme disturbance events radiating out to larger areas), we conducted an auxiliary analysis in which we reduced the timber prices of regular harvests in cells adjacent to those affected by extreme disturbance events (see section ‘Prices' in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 7).

To account for the stochastic nature of disturbances, we used Monte Carlo simulations32 to consider a wide range of potential future disturbance impacts. This method involved running multiple simulations for each studied scenario. Within each simulation, different random disturbance events were generated to capture a wide range of disturbance sequences and their corresponding economic outcomes. This allowed us to quantify the variability of the economic impacts of disturbances. Monte Carlo approaches have been widely used in economics and ecology64,65,66,67, and are particularly suited to capture the impacts of highly variable events32. Specifically, we ran 100 Monte Carlo simulations for each scenario and cell with different random numbers used for (1) drawing extreme disturbance events in each time step and (2) choosing which cells are affected by these events. To assess the economic impact of disturbances, we calculated losses as the average difference in economic value between simulations with and without disturbances across all simulations. In other words, simulations without disturbances in the respective climate scenarios served as the counterfactual to quantify the economic impacts of disturbance. Since disturbances, particularly extreme events, disproportionately impact the fat tail of skewed economic damage distributions (Supplementary Fig. 2), and mean comparisons cannot fully capture the effects of increasing frequencies of rare events12, we also analysed extreme values from our Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, for each scenario and simulated cell, we calculated the average of the worst 5% of economic losses across all Monte Carlo runs (conditional value at risk). To transform losses in net present value into annual costs, we calculated an annuity by multiplying the losses by the assumed discount rate of the simulation (1.5%). Regional analyses were conducted for European regions as suggested in the Forest Europe report24 (Fig. 3c). Within each region, hotspot areas were defined as cells above the 99th percentile of all values in that region (Extended Data Table 1). To estimate economic costs per unit forest area, the total costs were divided by the forested area for each cell.

We successfully evaluated our simulation approach against independent data for several key metrics. The simulated standing timber volume and annual timber extraction rates under historical climate matched observed values well (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). The model estimated that 28.7% of the annual timber harvest was due to natural disturbances under historical climate, which amounted to 74.5 million m3 timber yr−1 (Table 1). These values are well within the range of empirical data from recent decades, reporting 42.6–78.5 million m3 of timber disturbed annually and 12%–32% of unplanned canopy openings from disturbances relative to the total harvested timber volume for the period 1986–200520,68. These results highlight the robustness of our simulations; full details of the evaluations conducted are provided in Supplementary Methods (see sections ‘Standing timber volume' and ‘Amount of extracted timber'). We used TensorFlow69 in combination with Keras API70 in Python for implementing the deep neural network. All other simulations and analyses were done using the R programming environment71 in R Studio72 v.2023.12.1.402.

We initialized the simulated forests (16 ×16 km grid cells) using recent species distribution maps38 and age class information extrapolated from NFI data for continental Europe54. Forest growth was simulated based on soil- and climate-sensitive NPP estimates for each tree species, derived from a deep neural network trained on simulations of a process-based forest growth model. NPP values were mapped to yield tables to obtain information on merchantable timber volume and mean tree diameter. We simulated an even-aged clear-cut system (pictograms in top row), with the rotation length varying between cells. To calculate optimal rotation length per cell, we converted extracted timber volumes into economic cashflow and computed the net present value for each possible rotation length (from 0 to 260 years in 10-year intervals), assuming a discount rate of 1.5%. The optimal rotation length was defined as the one that maximizes net present value. After final harvest, we assumed the area was regenerated with the same tree species. To quantify the effect of disturbances, we explicitly simulated two types of disturbances: First, climate-sensitive, background disturbances derived from empirically parameterized hazard probabilities59 (center row), and second, stochastic extreme disturbance events informed by observations from remote sensing61 and scaled to future scenarios using Taylor's power law equations63 (bottom row). In the event of a disturbance, the revenues from timber were reduced for background disturbances, and set to zero for extreme disturbances, representing the combined effects of market price responses, wood devaluation, and increased harvesting costs in the wake of disturbances32. Figure created with BioRender.com.

Changing rotation periods from their economic optimal values can be used in silviculture to reduce disturbance risks, and to improve other forest functions such as forest carbon storage and habitat value. Changes in the rotation period have two effects: (1) they result in economic losses because the rotation period is no longer at its economically optimal value (blue bars), and (2) they affect the economic costs of disturbance (orange bars). Bars indicate average values, whileE error bars indicate the standard deviation (N = 300), and points are the net effect and its standard deviation of both economic implications. A positive net effect means an overall increase in forest values compared to default rotation lengths.

Lower discount rates decrease forest value due to higher costs of disturbance. The overall effect of climate change on the costs of disturbance is apparent for all evaluated discount rates and climate models used. Each bar indicates the average disturbance costs (N = 300 for panel ‘All', N = 100 for each climate model), while the error bars show the average costs ± the standard deviation of simulated costs. The ‘All' panels include results of all simulated climate models. Raw data is shown as points.

The color of each point represents the cost per hectare of forest within a 16 by 16 km cell, and the size of each point corresponds to the forested area within that cell. Panel (a) shows average disturbance costs across all simulations, while panel (b) indicates extreme values, expressed as the mean over the 5% highest costs. For visibility, only cells with a forest cover of at least 5 % are displayed. For comparability with Fig. 3, we kept the color scale the same as in Fig. 3. We note, however, that 0.1% of the extreme disturbance costs under RCP8.5 are beyond the color scale used. The map uses the ETRS89-LAEA Europe projection (EPSG:3035).

Changes in forest value at the continental (a) and regional (c) scale under future climate compared to historical values as in Fig. 3. Blue bars represent losses due to increasing disturbances, green bars show gains from increasing productivity. Productivity-related gains are attributed to effects on initial growing stock (derived relative to growing stock levels under historical productivity) – indicated by the transparent portions of the bars – and effects related to increased sustainable harvest levels over the simulation period (solid portion of the bars). Dots indicate the net change in forest value compared to historical values. Dots within the transparent area of the bars indicate high uncertainty of net positive economic effects, as economic effects would turn negative in these cases if initial forest values were to remain constant with increasing productivity. Continental (b) and regional (d) forest values under different climate scenarios as in Fig. 3. Gains due to a productivity-related increase in initial forest value are indicated as the transparent portion of the bars. In all panels, data show the mean ± s.d. across all simulations (N = 300) in the respective stratum. Regions were defined as in Fig. 2c.

Changes in forest value for each country under future climate compared to historical values. Blue bars represent average losses due to increasing disturbances, green bars show average gains due to increasing productivity. Dots indicate the net change in forest value compared to historical values, error bars represent the standard deviation across all simulations (N = 300) in the respective country.

Differences in risk factor exposure and access to prevention resources have led to unequal health outcomes for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) globally. Recent studies elucidate the health benefits of arts participation, but no systematic reviews have focused on NCD prevention and health promotion. Here we share results of a mixed-methods systematic review that included 95 studies of arts programs, practices and activities, addressing NCD risk factors across 27 countries. We found that most reported outcomes were related to physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, mental health, and systemic, structural and social drivers of health. Our findings suggest that the arts may support NCDs prevention and health promotion by generating cultural relevance, providing opportunities for increased physical activity and social connectedness and by helping to identify and address systemic, structural and social forces contributing to health disparities and inequities.

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. If detected early, it can be efficiently treated, but the cost and discomfort of colonoscopies -- the main diagnostic method currently in use -- often result in delayed diagnosis. Using machine learning algorithms, a team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) identified for the first time all human gut bacteria to a level of detail that makes it possible to understand the physiological importance of the different microbial subgroups. This inventory was then used to detect the presence of colorectal cancer according to the bacteria present in simple stool samples, a non-invasive and low-cost screening tool. The potential applications are vast, ranging from the diagnosis of other cancers to a better understanding of the links between gut microbiota and health. These findings are published in Cell Host & Microbe.

Colorectal cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage when treatment options are limited. This underscores the need for simpler, less invasive diagnostic tools, particularly in the face of a still unexplained rise in cases among young adults. While it has long been known that gut microbiota plays a role in the development of colorectal cancer, translating these findings into clinical practice has proven challenging. This is because different strains of the same bacterial species can have opposite effects, with some promoting the disease and others having no effect.

"Instead of relying on the analysis of the various species composing the microbiota, which does not capture all meaningful differences, or of bacterial strains, which vary greatly from one individual to another, we focused on an intermediate level of the microbiota, the subspecies," explains Mirko Trajkovski, full professor in the Department of Cell Physiology and Metabolism and in the Diabetes Centre at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine, who led this research. "The subspecies resolution is specific and can capture the differences in how bacteria function and contribute to diseases including cancer, while remaining general enough to detect these changes among different groups of individuals, populations, or countries."

With the help of machine learning

The first step was to analyse huge amounts of data. "As a bioinformatician, the challenge was to come up with an innovative approach for mass data analysis," recalls Matija Trickovic, PhD student in the laboratory of Mirko Trajkovski and first author of this study. "We successfully developed the first comprehensive catalogue of human gut microbiota subspecies, together with a precise and efficient method to use it both for research and in the clinic."

By combining this catalogue with existing clinical data, the scientists developed a model that can predict the presence of colorectal cancer solely based on the bacteria present in stool samples. "Although we were confident in our strategy, the results were striking," enthuses Matija Trickovic. "Our method detected 90% of cancer cases, a result very close to the 94% detection rate achieved by colonoscopies and better than all current non-invasive detection methods."

By integrating more clinical data, this model could become even more precise and match the accuracy of colonoscopy. It could become a routine screening tool and facilitate the early detection of colorectal cancer, which would then be confirmed by colonoscopy but only in a selected group of patients.

A new world of applications

A first clinical trial is being set up in collaboration with the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) to determine more precisely the cancer stages and the lesions that can be detected. However, the applications go beyond colorectal cancer. By studying the differences between subspecies from the same bacterial species, researchers can now identify the mechanisms of action by which the gut microbiota influences human health. "The same method could soon be used to develop non-invasive diagnostic tools for a wide range of diseases, all based on a single microbiota analysis," concludes Mirko Trajkovski.

Google is making it possible to now share your Gemini Gems — custom AI assistants and experts designed for specific tasks — the company announced on Thursday. The feature launched last year, initially as part of the Gemini Advanced paid subscription, allowing users to write instructions to create an AI chatbot for different scenarios. For instance, Google launched with premade Gems like a learning coach, a brainstorming assistant, a career guide, a writing editor, and a coding partner.

Now, Google says you'll be able to share your Gems with friends, family, or coworkers as easily as you can share a file from Google Drive. 

This would make Gems more accessible to more people, as not everyone uses the advanced customization feature. It could also help prevent people from building the same Gems as others. For instance, if multiple coworkers were using a similar type of custom Gemini assistant, they could just share the same resource instead of each making their own version that could have slight inconsistencies between them. 

Google suggests Gem sharing could also be useful for people working on family vacation plans and guides, meal planners, or collaborative writing projects.

To share a Gem, you'll open the Gem manager on the web app and click the “Share” icon next to any Gem you've created. Also similar to Google Drive, you can control who can view and use your Gems and who's allowed to edit them.

After first rolling out to Gemini Advanced, Gemini Business, and Gemini Enterprise subscribers in over 150 countries, Google announced in March that Gems were now available to everyone and could support file uploads.

Google announced Thursday that it's rolling out Gemini in Chrome to all Mac and Windows desktop users in the U.S. after previously limiting the capability to Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra subscribers. The tech giant also announced that it's bringing agentic capabilities to Chrome in the future, adding its AI Mode search feature to the address bar, launching new Gemini features, using AI to combat AI-generated scams, rolling out automatic password resets, and more.

U.S. users who have their language set to English can now ask Gemini to clarify complex information on any webpage they're reading using the Gemini icon in the top-right corner of their Chrome window. For example, you could open up a page that features a banana bread recipe and ask Gemini to make the recipe gluten free.

Gemini can now work across multiple tabs, allowing users to quickly compare and summarize information across multiple websites. For example, you could be planning your flight, hotel, and vacation in multiple tabs and work with Gemini to organize your trip. Or, you might be shopping for a new mattress and want to compare all of the different models you're looking at in multiple tabs.

Gemini will soon be able to retrieve web pages you've previously visited, making it easier to return to past browsing sessions without sifting through your browser history. That means you will be able to ask something like “On which site did I see the walnut desk last week?” or “What was that blog I read on back to school shopping?”

Additionally, Google is launching a deeper integration between Gemini in Chrome and other Google apps, like Calendar, YouTube, and Maps. Google says this will allow users to do things like schedule meetings, see location details, and more more without having to leave the page they're on. For example, if you're trying to find a a specific spot in a YouTube video, you can ask Gemini to take you there. 

Google notes that the AI assistant will be able to complete tedious tasks, like booking a haircut or ordering weekly groceries. Gemini will navigate to the site, add things to your cart, and let you take the final action by checking out with your payment option.

Google says the new agentic capabilities will be coming to Chrome in the coming months. It's worth noting that OpenAI launched Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously, earlier this year.

Google is also bringing AI Mode, its advanced search feature, directly into the Chrome address bar. With AI Mode, users can ask complex questions with follow-ups to dig deeper into topics. For example, instead of searching for “best mattress,” you could type out “I'm a side sleeper with occasional lower back pain, make me a table comparing the different mattress types” directly in the address bar. From there, you could ask follow-up questions and keep your search going with queries like, “How long do memory foam mattresses typically last?”

This update will be rolling out later this month in English in the U.S.  and expanding to more countries and languages in the future. 

Also coming to the address bar is the ability to ask questions about the page you're on. Chrome can now suggest relevant questions based on the context of the page to kickstart your search in the address bar. Google says users will get a helpful AI Overview and the option to ask follow-up questions with AI Mode. 

Google says Chrome will also soon be able to use its Gemini Nano model to detect and protect against scams, such as fake virus alerts and fraudulent giveaways. These scams often impersonate trusted brands and use generative AI to create convincing phishing attempts, Google notes. 

Google also announced that it's using AI to help users fix compromised passwords with a single click on supported sites, like Coursera, Spotify, Duolingo, H&M, and more. If Chrome warns you that you password was exposed in a data breach, you can allow it to create and save a new one for you.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Katie Wilson has never held elected office, but the longtime community organizer and Transit Riders Union co-founder is now the Democratic front-runner for Seattle mayor after winning nearly 51% of the vote in the August primary against incumbent Bruce Harrell.

For many Seattle civic leaders, the tech companies operating here have often represented a double-edged sword. Corporations including Amazon, Expedia Group, Google, Meta and numerous others provide well-paying jobs that stoke the economy, but the influx of affluent workers has strained the region's housing affordability and availability.

As Seattle grapples with persistent issues including homelessness and fentanyl abuse while debating how to fund city services, Wilson wants to engage the tech sector as part of the solution. But how that would specifically play out is unclear.

“Seattle's a very innovative city,” she said. “We have a lot of big challenges here, but as I'm going around the city and I'm talking to residents and I'm talking to business owners and talking to tech workers, there's so much promise here.”

Wilson helped design and pass Seattle's controversial JumpStart payroll expense tax in 2020. A majority of the revenue — $360 million in 2024 — is generated from 10 companies, including Amazon. 

“The JumpStart tax, overall, I would call it a very successful policy,” she told GeekWire. “It both prevented devastating service cuts during the recession, and also has basically allowed the city's budget to be balanced for the last four years.”

The tax evolved from a previous “head tax” proposal in 2018 that drew sharp criticism from Amazon, which later announced that it was moving thousands of jobs to nearby Bellevue. 

Speaking at the GeekWire Summit in 2021, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy called out the strained relations with Seattle leadership, saying that “the City Council has become less enamored with business or with Amazon.” 

Those tensions have eased during Harrell's term, and Wilson said she aims to work with the company. She touted her coalition building efforts and said collaboration is possible even if parties are not aligned on every issue.

“Obviously Amazon and the other big tech companies are very important players in our city and in our economy, and so I think it's very important that the city has working relationships there,” she said. 

But the question of how to fund city operations continues to plague Seattle, which now faces a two-year budget deficit of nearly $150 million.   

The overarching challenge, Wilson said, is that Washington has the nation's second-most regressive tax system due to its lack of a state or local income taxes, and reliance on taxes that hit lower-income residents harder than the wealthy.

The state passed several new taxes on businesses earlier this year to help fund public schools, community safety programs and other services. Some tech leaders in Washington, including Microsoft President Brad Smith, have been vocal in criticizing recent state tax proposals that impact businesses.

To help fill Seattle's budget hole, voters earlier this year passed a tax on big companies to pay for public housing. Wilson supported the measure, while Harrell, Amazon and Microsoft opposed it. 

Harrell proposed an alternative funding mechanism for public housing from the existing JumpStart tax. In a recent debate, the mayor said he wants affordable housing, but expressed concern about businesses leaving Seattle over higher taxes.

Wilson is also a proponent of taxing profits made from the sale of stocks and bonds, though the Seattle City Council last year narrowly rejected a proposed 2% capital gains tax.

What the state and city need, Wilson said, “is a progressive tax system that is robust enough that it is funding the public goods and services that we all depend on to have a functional state, to have a functional city.” 

Economic diversification

While tech dominates the Seattle economy, Wilson is interested in diversifying that focus. In a recent post on Reddit, she cautioned that a heavy reliance on the tech sector could pose problems for Seattle down the road.

“We've really been blithely riding the tech wave for the past 15 years and I don't think we can just assume that will continue,” she wrote.

Wilson told GeekWire she's making “building a green economy” a high priority. That would include partnering with the University of Washington and the Port of Seattle to foster job creation around clean energy and other climate technologies.

In January, the city teamed up with the UW and others in launching the Seattle Climate Innovation Hub to support entrepreneurs in the climate sector and to aid the revitalization of the city's downtown.

Revitalizing and re-envisioning downtown

Seattle's downtown continues to regain some of its pre-COVID vitality, which has improved as employees are recalled to offices. But the recovery remains fragile as downtown vacancy rates are above 30%. Wilson is interested in developing a stronger residential presence in the city's core to boost its vibrancy beyond 9-5 working hours.

“The future of downtown is obviously very central to Seattle's future as a whole,” she said. “And I would really want to put a big focus on the transformation of downtown to also more of a residential, 24-hour neighborhood.”

That could entail building more housing downtown and converting offices to residential spaces where feasible. The city would also need to add more amenities such as grocery stores, pharmacies and childcare, plus improving safety.

Tackling homelessness and substance abuse

While Amazon and Microsoft have stoked the region's economy, those gains have contributed to rising housing costs. To help address the situation, the tech giants are funding the construction and preservation of affordable housing. Amazon recently touted the creation of 10,000 units in the Seattle area since 2021. 

But the homeless crisis in Seattle and the surrounding county has continued to worsen over the past decade. 

Wilson has vowed to establish 4,000 spaces for people experiencing homelessness, including tiny shelters, overnight beds in church facilities, and other emergency solutions. She said next summer's World Cup matches in Seattle will put pressure on the city to move unhoused people off the streets.

She also wants to explore the creation of a municipal voucher program to help people rent the thousands of vacant apartments that are earmarked for affordable housing, but still too expensive for many renters.

And as the fentanyl crisis continues in Seattle, Wilson is eager to employ new treatments available to people struggling with the drug, and also wants to pair treatment with shelter stability and housing.

“It's going to take money,” Wilson said of her plans to address homelessness. “A lot of that is going to be existing, repurposed money, and potentially also new money. But I think we can get there over four years.”

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

by Todd Bishop on Sep 18, 2025 at 8:22 amSeptember 18, 2025 at 8:22 am

In an e-commerce twist almost worthy of The Twilight Zone or Black Mirror, Amazon is now officially supporting orders placed on Walmart.com — allowing sellers to tap into Amazon's logistics network to fulfill purchases made on the site of its biggest retail rival.

The move, announced Thursday at Amazon's Accelerate seller conference, is part of a broader expansion of its Multichannel Fulfillment (MCF) service. Amazon is also deepening its Shopify support and plans to begin fulfilling orders from fast-fashion juggernaut Shein later this year.

It's part of a larger effort to offer services to sellers beyond the virtual walls of Amazon.com, and one of a series of updates to its Supply Chain by Amazon initiative at the conference. The company is pitching itself as an end-to-end logistics partner, offering the ability to move products from manufacturer to customer regardless of sales channel.

In the process, it's competing more directly with services from rivals like ShipBob, FedEx, UPS, and DHL, in addition to services from Walmart and Shopify themselves. 

Amazon already supports fulfillment of orders from sites including eBay, Etsy, Temu and others. But using MCF for unsupported platforms requires a manual, cumbersome process. 

“This is now a direct integration, so that anytime you get a Walmart order, we'll just fulfill it,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon's vice president of selling partner services, in an interview.

This doesn't mean Walmart online shoppers will see the smiling Amazon logo on the box they receive. But they won't have the blue and yellow Walmart logo, either. Walmart prohibits deliveries in Amazon boxes, so the products go out in boxes and envelopes without logos.

It's one slice of a big business for Amazon. The company's revenue from third-party seller services — which includes commissions, fulfillment and shipping fees, and related services — reached $156 billion in 2024, or nearly a quarter of its total revenue of $638 billion.

As businesses around the world have shifted their digital infrastructure over the last decade from self-hosted servers to the cloud, they've benefitted from the standardized, built-in security features of major cloud providers like Microsoft. But with so much riding on these systems, there can be potentially disastrous consequences at a massive scale if something goes wrong. Case in point: Security researcher Dirk-jan Mollema recently stumbled upon a pair of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Azure's identity and access management platform that could have been exploited for a potentially cataclysmic takeover of all Azure customer accounts.

Known as Entra ID, the system stores each Azure cloud customer's user identities, sign-in access controls, applications, and subscription management tools. Mollema has studied Entra ID security in depth and published multiple studies about weaknesses in the system, which was formerly known as Azure Active Directory. But while preparing to present at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas in July, Mollema discovered two vulnerabilities that he realized could be used to gain global administrator privileges—essentially god mode—and compromise every Entra ID directory, or what is known as a “tenant.” Mollema says that this would have exposed nearly every Entra ID tenant in the world other than, perhaps, government cloud infrastructure.

“I was just staring at my screen. I was like, ‘No, this shouldn''t really happen,'” says Mollema, who runs the Dutch cybersecurity company Outsider Security and specializes in cloud security. “It was quite bad. As bad as it gets, I would say.”

“From my own tenants—my test tenant or even a trial tenant—you could request these tokens and you could impersonate basically anybody else in anybody else's tenant,” Mollema adds. “That means you could modify other people's configuration, create new and admin users in that tenant, and do anything you would like.”

Given the seriousness of the vulnerability, Mollema disclosed his findings to the Microsoft Security Response Center on July 14, the same day that he discovered the flaws. Microsoft started investigating the findings that day and issued a fix globally on July 17. The company confirmed to Mollema that the issue was fixed by July 23 and implemented extra measures in August. Microsoft issued a CVE for the vulnerability on September 4.

“We mitigated the newly identified issue quickly, and accelerated the remediation work underway to decommission this legacy protocol usage, as part of our Secure Future Initiative,” Tom Gallagher, Microsoft's Security Response Center vice president of engineering, told WIRED in a statement. “We implemented a code change within the vulnerable validation logic, tested the fix, and applied it across our cloud ecosystem.”

Gallagher says that Microsoft found “no evidence of abuse” of the vulnerability during its investigation.

Both vulnerabilities relate to legacy systems still functioning within Entra ID. The first involves a type of Azure authentication token Mollema discovered known as Actor Tokens that are issued by an obscure Azure mechanism called the “Access Control Service.” Actor Tokens have some special system properties that Mollema realized could be useful to an attacker when combined with another vulnerability. The other bug was a major flaw in a historic Azure Active Directory application programming interface known as “Graph” that was used to facilitate access to data stored in Microsoft 365. Microsoft is in the process of retiring Azure Active Directory Graph and transitioning users to its successor, Microsoft Graph, which is designed for Entra ID. The flaw was related to a failure by Azure AD Graph to properly validate which Azure tenant was making an access request, which could be manipulated so the API would accept an Actor Token from a different tenant that should have been rejected.

“Microsoft built security controls around identity like conditional access and logs, but this internal impression token mechanism bypasses them all,” says Michael Bargury, the CTO at security firm Zenity. “This is the most impactful vulnerability you can find in an identity provider, effectively allowing full compromise of any tenant of any customer.”

If the vulnerability had been discovered by, or fallen into the hands of, malicious hackers, the fallout could have been devastating.

“We don't need to guess what the impact may have been; we saw two years ago what happened when Storm-0558 compromised a signing key that allowed them to log in as any user on any tenant,” Bargury says.

While the specific technical details are different, Microsoft revealed in July 2023 that the Chinese cyber espionage group known as Storm-0558 had stolen a cryptographic key that allowed them to generate authentication tokens and access cloud-based Outlook email systems, including those belonging to US government departments.

Conducted over the course of several months, a Microsoft postmortem on the Storm-0558 attack revealed several errors that led to the Chinese group slipping past cloud defenses. The security incident was one of a string of Microsoft issues around that time. These motivated the company to launch its “Secure Future Initiative,” which expanded protections for cloud security systems and set more aggressive goals for responding to vulnerability disclosures and issuing patches.

Mollema says that Microsoft was extremely responsive about his findings and seemed to grasp their urgency. But he emphasizes that his findings could have allowed malicious hackers to go even farther than they did in the 2023 incident.

“With the vulnerability, you could just add yourself as the highest privileged admin in the tenant, so then you have full access,” Mollema says. Any Microsoft service “that you use EntraID to sign into, whether that be Azure, whether that be SharePoint, whether that be Exchange—that could have been compromised with this.”

For the first time, scientists have uncovered a large amber deposit in South America containing fossilized insects and other preserved creatures. The small, half-transparent fossils hold a rich assortment of ancient bugs—and a slice of life from little-known ecosystems from over 100 million years ago.

A Communications & Earth Environment study published today details amber samples from Ecuador's Genoveva quarry—the first discovery in South America to yield fossilized insects and other life forms. The team, led by paleobiologist Xavier Delclòs from the University of Barcelona in Spain, employed a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the fossils in fine detail. Their efforts unveiled the prior existence of a vibrant, tropical rainforest as the Earth underwent major environmental shifts.

“It is the largest Cretaceous amber deposit ever found in the Southern Hemisphere—and in terms of volume, it even surpasses the richest deposits of the North,” Delclòs told Gizmodo.

Indeed, the sheer volume of the deposits gave the team a rare opportunity to study and identify about 21 bio-inclusions, or living things that get stuck in amber. The discovery “opens a new window into the forests of South America at the time of the dinosaurs, preserving creatures so small and delicate that they almost never fossilize,” Delclòs said.

Amber is fossilized resin, also known as tree sap. Resin remains sticky for a couple of days to several months, trapping the occasional insect or organism that stumbles across its path. Eventually, exposure to the air hardens the resin, fastening the molecular bonds within and turning it to hard amber—along with whatever poor creature was stuck inside.

Paleontological records indicate that trees have produced resin for over 320 million years, but it's only been within the last 120 million years that amber has “formed in large enough quantities” to create sizable fossil deposits, Delclòs explained. While amber can preserve smaller animals less likely to fossilize, the long process quickly decomposes bodily parts weaker than the exoskeleton of arthropods.

Of course, nature sometimes works miracles, and some amber deposits keep muscles, organs, and even brains intact. The new discovery, for instance, found fragile, thin strands of spider silk. The team also discovered some of the oldest flowering plants ever found in western South America. That said, DNA molecules are the fastest to go, so “the Jurassic Park dream remains science fiction,” Delclòs added.

“And this is just the beginning,” he said. “In a very small sample, we already identified six different insect orders. The site promises to be a treasure trove.”

To make every observation count, the team relied on a highly multidisciplinary approach involving methods from geochemistry and paleobotany. Studying the amber from these angles helped them pinpoint the exact age of the fossils, as well as the plants that may have produced the resin. They even borrowed a synchrotron—that is, a particle accelerator—to light the samples and “reveal the fine anatomical details of insects,” Delclòs explained.

“Together, these lines of evidence allow us to reconstruct, with unprecedented accuracy, the ecosystem of a Cretaceous rainforest that once thrived where today lies the Amazon,” he said.

The researchers believe there are more undiscovered amber deposits in South America. The next step is to explore further—which Delclòs is already doing. (No, seriously—he responded to Gizmodo's interview request while out in the field.)

By identifying and studying the amber, we'll soon have a better idea of “how this ecosystem started and evolved at the very heart of the equator—something we have never been able to do before in South America,” Delclòs said.

The House Oversight Committee has requested that the CEOs of Discord, Twitch, Reddit, and gaming platform Steam testify on October 8 about their platforms' alleged involvement in any online “radicalization” and the “incitement to commit politically motivated acts,” according to letters sent from the House committee to the four tech CEOs. 

In a statement, Rep. James Comer, chairman of the Oversight Committee, referenced the murder of Charlie Kirk and “other acts of politically motivated violence” as reasons why Congress has a “duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,” he said. 

“To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes.” 

TechCrunch reached out to the companies summoned.

Discord told TechCrunch it looked forward to testifying in October. 

“We continuously engage with policymakers on these critical issues and look forward to continuing this important dialogue next month,” a spokesperson said. 

Reddit, meanwhile, told Reuters it was investigating the link between its platform and Kirk's death, saying it hasn't yet seen proof that the suspect in Kirk's death was an active Reddit user. The company told the outlet that it “has strong policies against hateful content and content that incites, encourages, glorifies or calls for violence.”

Kirk was a prominent conservative activist and a close ally of President Trump. Suspect Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Utah resident, has been arrested for shooting and killing Kirk last week while Kirk spoke at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Robinson appeared to have confessed to committing the crime in a chat on Discord shortly before his arrest. The bullets used were also apparently engraved with memes and references to video games. 

This piece was updated to add a statement from Discord's spokesperson.

Nvidia has agreed to buy a $5 billion stake in Intel as part of a broader deal to together develop “multiple generations” of data center and PC products.

Nvidia will acquire the Intel stock for $23.28 per share, a slight discount on the company's previous trading price. According to Reuters, the deal would make Nvidia one of Intel's largest shareholders, owning about 4% of the company. Intel shares were up as much as 30% in early trading on Thursday morning.

The companies will integrate their two architectures using Nvidia's NVLink interface, which enables data and control code transfers between CPUs and GPUs. NVLink enables faster transfers between chips compared with other standards like PCI Express; that's crucial for AI applications, which require many GPUs to run together and process immense workloads.

For data centers, Intel will manufacture a new line of x86 CPUs specifically customized for Nvidia's AI infrastructure platforms, to be offered to enterprise and hyperscale customers.

For the consumer PC segment, Intel will build x86 system-on-chips that will incorporate chiplets of Nvidia's RTX GPUs, which will no doubt give Intel an edge over rival AMD's CPUs. The companies are calling these chips “x86 RTX SoCs” at the moment, and claim these chips will power a “wide range of PCs.”

The deal comes after a rough few years for Intel, which has struggled to capitalize on the AI chip race unlike its new partner. Intel brought on a new CEO, laid off thousands of staff as it sought to shore up margins, and spiked manufacturing projects to prioritize more financial discipline.

The deal comes on the heels of another record quarter for Nvidia, which has grown into both the world's most lucrative semiconductor company and, by market cap, one of the largest companies the world. Over the same period, Intel has struggled to keep pace with the fluctuations of market demand, particularly the intense semiconductor demands of AI. As a result, the collaboration could allow Intel to win back market share from rivals like AMD.

“Intel's leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry,” said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan in a statement.

There's one thing people want to know when they see my first-gen Ray-Ban smart glasses, and it's got nothing to do with AI, or cameras, or the surprisingly great open-ear audio they put out. They want to know what's probably front-of-mind right now as you're reading this: Do they have a screen in them? The answer? Sadly, no… until now.

At Meta Connect 2025, Meta finally unveiled its Ray-Ban Display smart glasses that, as you may have gathered from the name, have a screen in them. It doesn't sound like much on the surface—we have screens everywhere, all the time. Too many of them, in fact. But I'm here to tell you that after using them in advance of the unveil, I regret to inform you that you will most likely want another screen in your life, whether you know it or not. But first, you probably want to know exactly what's going on in this screen I speak of.

The answer? Apps, of course. The display, which is actually full-color and not monochrome like previous reporting suggested, acts as a heads-up display (HUD) for things like notifications, navigation, and even pictures and videos. For the full specs of that display, you can read the news companion to my hands-on here. For now, though, I want to focus on what that screen feels like. The answer? A little jarring at first.

While the Ray-Ban Display, which weigh 69g (about 10 more grams than the first-gen glasses without a screen) do their best not to shove a screen in front of your face, it's still genuinely there, hovering like a real-life Clippy, waiting to distract you with a notification at a moment's notice. And, no matter what your feelings are about smart glasses that have a screen, that's a good thing, since the display is the whole reason you might spend $800 to own a pair. Once your eyes adjust to the screen (it took me a minute or so), you can get cracking on doing stuff. That's where the Meta Neural Band comes in.

The Neural Band is Meta's sEMG wristband, a piece of tech it's been showing off for years now that's been shrunk down into the size of a Whoop fitness band. It reads the electrical signals in your hand to register pinches, swipes, taps, and wrist turns as inputs in the glasses. I was worried at first that its wristband might feel clunky or too conspicuous on my body, but I can inform you that it's not the case—this is about as lightweight as it gets. The smart glasses also felt light and comfortable on my face despite being noticeably thicker than the first-gen Ray-Bans.

More importantly than being lightweight and subtle, it's very responsive. Once the Neural Band was tight on my wrist (it was a little loose at first, but better after I adjusted), using it to navigate the UI was fairly intuitive. An index finger and thumb pinch is the equivalent of “select,” a middle-finger and thumb pinch is “back,” and for scrolling, you make a fist and then use your thumb like it's a mouse made of flesh and bone over the top of said fist. It's a bit of Vision Pro and a bit of Quest 3, but with no hand-tracking needed. I won't lie to you, it feels like a bit of magic when it works fluidly.

Personally, I still had some variability on inputs—you may have to try to input something once or twice before it registers—but I would say that it works well most of the time (at least much better than you'd expect for a literal first-of-its-kind device). I suspect the experience will only get more fluid over time, though, and even better once you really train yourself to navigate the UI properly. Not to mention the applications for the future! Meta is already planning to launch a handwriting feature, though it's not available at launch. I got a firsthand look… kind of. I wasn't able to use handwriting myself, but I watched a Meta rep use it, and it seemed to work, though I have no way of knowing how well until I use it for myself.

But enough about controls; let's get to what you're actually doing with them. I got to briefly experience pretty much everything that the Meta Ray-Ban Display have to offer, and that includes the gamut of phone-adjacent features. One of my favorites is taking pictures in a POV mode, which imposes a window on the glasses display that shows you what you're taking a picture of right in the lens—finally, no guess and check when you're snapping pics. Another “wow” moment here is the ability to pinch your fingers and tweak your wrist (like you're turning a dial) to zoom in. It's a subtle thing, but you feel like a wizard when you can control a camera by just waving your hands around.

Another standout feature is navigation, which imposes a map on the glasses display to show you where you're going. Obviously, I was limited in testing how that feature works since I couldn't wander off with the glasses in my demo, but the map was quite sharp and bright enough to be used outdoors (I did test this stuff in sunlight, and the 5,000 nits brightness was sufficient). Meta is leaving it up to you whether you use navigation while you're in a vehicle or on a bike, but it will warn you of the dangers of looking at a screen if it detects that you're moving quickly. It's hard to say how distracting a HUD would be if you're biking, and it's something that I plan to eventually test in full.

Another interesting feature you might actually use is video calling, which pulls up a video of the person you're calling in the bottom-right corner. The interesting part about this feature is that it's POV for the person you're calling, so they can see what you're looking at. It's not something that I'd do in any situation, since usually the person you're calling wants to see you and not just what you're looking at, but I can confirm that it works at least.

Speaking of just working, there's also a live transcription feature that can listen in on your environment and superimpose what the other person is saying onto the display of the smart glasses. I had two thoughts when using this feature: the first one is that it could be a game-changer for accessibility. If your hearing is impaired, being able to actually see a live transcript could be hugely helpful. Secondly, such a feature could be great for translation, which is something that Meta has already thought of in this case. I didn't get a chance to use the smart glasses for translating another language, but the potential is there.

One problem I foresee here, though, is that the smart glasses may pick up other conversations happening nearby. Meta thought of this too and said that the microphones in the Ray-Ban Display actually beamform to focus just on who you're looking at, and I did get a chance to test that out. While one Meta rep spoke to me in the room, others had their own conversations at a fairly normal volume. The results? Kind of mixed. While the transcription focused mostly on the person I was looking at, it still picked up stray words here and there. This feels like a bit of an inevitability in loud scenarios, but who knows? Maybe beamforming and AI can fill in the gaps.

If you're looking for a killer feature of Meta's Ray-Ban Display smart glasses, I'm not sure there necessarily is one, but one thing I do know is that the coupling of the glasses with its Neural Band should be nothing short of a game-changer. Navigating the UI in smart glasses has been a constant issue in the space, and until now, I haven't seen what I thought was a killer solution, but based on my early demos, I'd say that Meta's “brain-reading” wristband could be the breakthrough we were waiting for—at least until hand or eye tracking at this scale becomes possible.

I'll know more about how everything works when I get a chance to use Meta Ray-Ban Display on my own, but for now I'd say Meta is still clearly the frontrunner in the smart glasses race, and its head start just got pretty massive.

Meta's Ray-Bans are back with a new generation, and this time they're finally giving people the one thing they really want—a screen. At Meta's annual Connect developer conference, the company officially took the wraps off its Meta Ray-Ban Display, which are, as the name suggests, its first pair of AI-infused smart glasses to come with a full-color in-lens display.

The smart glasses, which still bear the same Ray-Ban branding, will cost $799 and are available for preorder today. As you might expect, they can do quite a few things that their predecessor can't, including message notifications, turn-by-turn navigation, and telling you when queries to Meta AI are processing. There are several app integrations, including WhatsApp and Instagram, allowing you to watch reels and make video calls natively in the glasses. One major upgrade on the message notifications front is that the Meta Ray-Ban Display will not be limited to only WhatsApp, meaning it will be able to show notifications on both iOS and Android devices.

That's not the only major shift in this generation. Meta says its first-ever display has a 600 x 600 resolution and 20-degree field of view. The display is monocular, which means it's only in one lens—at the bottom right-ish corner—and has a refresh rate of 90Hz. Brightness goes up to 5,000 nits and as low as 30 nits, which makes them usable outdoors in full light. One of the coolest parts of the display is that Meta claims that there's less than 2% light leakage, which means that you can't see when someone has their display activated.

Speaking of light leakage, all of Meta's Ray-Ban Display smart glasses will come with transition lenses. On one hand, that feels like a weird choice, but it also makes sense since this is a gadget you're going to want to use indoors as well as out, and for $800, you should be able to use them for as long as you like without having to take them off. “As long as you like,” in this case, will be no more than 6 hours, according to Meta, which is a lot longer than I was expecting. That solid battery life is thanks in part to what Meta is calling “ultra-narrow steelcan batteries.” I wish I knew exactly what that meant, but for now, I can only look forward to getting more of a deep dive in the future.

Glasses are only half the appeal of Meta's Ray-Ban Display, though. The other half is its sEMG wristband that you use to control the UI in the glasses.

The Meta Neural Band, as Meta is calling it, is arguably the most innovative part of its new Ray-Ban package, since no other product like it exists on a commercial scale. Outside of being a first, it also offers a potential solution to a problem that no other maker of smart glasses has quite solved—that problem being, how the hell do you actually use smart glasses? While most smart glasses (Meta's first-gen Ray-Bans included) have a voice assistant for shouting commands like “take a picture” and a fairly simple touch-sensitive bar for physical inputs (i.e., pause/play), neither is ideal in every situation.

The fact is, adding a screen complicates smart glasses—the more you can do, the more you'll need to convey to your glasses, and in order to do that, you need an input system as nuanced as the eyewear itself. Not only that, but if you want to use your smart glasses discreetly (or in a normal fashion at all, really), shouting into a crowded subway car is less than ideal. With the Neural Band, however, you can navigate the UI discreetly by pinching, swiping, and tapping through various menus in the smart glasses. My favorite gesture is a pinch to zoom for taking photos and videos. It's Vision Pro-esque, but all done without cameras. In case you're wondering, yes, the neural band is included in that $800 cost.

I got a chance to use Meta's Ray-Bans and its new Neural Band, and you can read my full impressions here.

Like previous iterations of Meta's Ray-Ban glasses, this year's edition will also come equipped with cameras and speakers. Camera-wise, Meta is going with a 12-megapixel ultra-wide sensor that can also capture 1080p at 30fps in a 1,440 x 1,920 resolution. There's also a 3x digital zoom.

The camera is used for the computer vision in the glasses, aka Meta AI, as well. Despite being a fan of Meta's Ray-Bans (they're the only device I ever want to take calls with), Meta AI has been a weak spot for me. While the voice assistant works well most of the time for basic stuff like taking pictures/videos, playing Spotify, and asking what your battery life is, the heavier AI lifting is hit-or-miss at best. Whether Meta's new smart glasses fix that remains to be seen since I haven't had a chance to use them, but I'm hoping for an upgrade here.

But even if AI is still finicky and the cameras and audio are about the same, these smart glasses still have a freaking screen. That's a big step forward, even if functionality is limited for now. When people ask me about my first-gen Ray-Bans, the first thing they want to know is whether they have a display in them, and they're inevitably very disappointed when I have to let them down. Now, I'll actually have something to show them, and if Meta's wristband works, I'll even have something to show them that only Meta can provide.

Usually, there are sports movies and there are horror movies, and the two don't really cross over. In Friday the 13th, Jason Voorhees wears a hockey mask, but he doesn't take a slap shot. A killer might swing a baseball bat, but they aren't stepping up to the plate. Him, the new film from Justin Tipping, is one of the first, and maybe biggest, films to ever blend horror and sports, which, just for that, is worth being excited about. The film uses the violence of football, as well as the hero worship, drug use, aggression, obsessions, and cold, hard cash at its core, to tell a multifaceted tale with lots of intensity and unease. Whether or not all of those ideas come together in a satisfying way is another story.

Him stars Tyriq Withers as Cameron Cade, a star college quarterback with an eye on being drafted into the pros. His favorite team is the Saviors, whose quarterback, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), has won eight championships. He's the greatest of all time. The GOAT. And when Cameron is mysteriously and violently attacked, Isaiah invites him to his compound to train and ready himself for the draft.

Some of Him‘s problems start right there. While Tipping does a very good job of bringing his audience into this world and introducing all its characters, the inciting incident is so out of left field and largely forgotten about for the majority of the film that there's an initial sense that not all of this was as thought-out as it could've been. It's a feeling that permeates the entire film.

Thankfully, another feeling that permeates the entire film is dread. As Cameron arrives at Isaiah's home, everything instantly feels wrong. Isaiah's got worshipers camped outside the gates. He has yes-men who'll do whatever he says. There are monuments to his greatness everywhere, all of which clash against his seemingly down-to-earth personality. He also, creepily, employs a doctor to give him blood when he's not feeling great and his training methods are more than a little intense. But Cameron, like the audience, goes with it.

Wayans is a revelation as Isaiah. He's got all the confident swagger you'd expect from the pro sports legend, and just the right amount of evil boiling below the surface. As he and Cameron train and bond, we're on the edge of our seats, begging to learn more about what the hell is going on here, especially as things get darker and weirder.

Unfortunately, every time things get darker and weirder, Him finds a way to dial things way back. Cameron wakes up, works out, and parties, and yes, all of that is peppered with weird, potentially culty stuff, but it never feels like it's the point. More than anything, most of the tension in the film comes from the film's exploration of sports in general.

Big chunks of Him are dedicated to Isaiah talking about everything he had to give up to become the best of all time. Cameron has to struggle with whether he's ready to do the same. We spend time with some of Isaiah's obsessive fans and their agent (played with perfectly muted comedic relief by Tim Heidecker) and listen as they wax poetic about the glory of victory and the agony of defeat. As much as we think Him is going to be exclusively about weird, culty horror stuff, it's surprisingly, and almost disappointingly, tangential. More than anything, the film is about the horrors that fame and fortune can bring and what it takes to achieve them.

Thankfully, all of that leads to a wild third act where everything comes together in a fantastic, gory, and wholly satisfying way. You just wish that pace and excitement were more evenly seeded throughout the film. As it plays here, it all happens so fast and without warning that you can't help but feel like there's more to the story. But, once the credits roll, Him leaves you with a lot to talk about, both in terms of the narrative and the themes. You just can't help but feel like it's all a bit too much and way out of balance.

In the end, Withers gives a star-making performance as Cameron, more than holding his own against the equally excellent Wayans. As a result, Him is more interesting than not. It's just not quite as entertaining and engaging as it aims to be.

Him opens Friday, September 19.

Productivity software giant Atlassian is making its largest acquisition yet to add a developer productivity tool to its product suite.  

Atlassian announced Thursday it has agreed to acquire the developer productivity insight platform DX for $1 billion in cash and restricted stock. Enterprises use DX to analyze how productive their engineering teams are and identify bottlenecks slowing them down.

DX was launched five years ago by Abi Noda and Greyson Junggren. Noda told TechCrunch in 2022 that he founded the company to find a better way to understand what hampered engineering teams. At the time, he felt the metrics he was using as a product manager at GitHub weren't giving him the full picture, and he wanted to build something better that didn't make developers feel like they were being surveilled.  

“The assumptions we had about what we needed to help ship products faster were quite different than what the teams and developers were saying was getting in their way,” Noda told TechCrunch at the time. “Even teams didn't always have awareness about their own issues and leadership.” 

DX came out of stealth in 2022 and has since tripled its customer base every year. The company now works with more than 350 enterprise customers, including ADP, Adyen and GitHub, among others, while raising less than $5 million in venture funding.  

Atlassian co-founder and CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes told TechCrunch that after trying to build an in-house developer productivity insight tool for three years, his Sydney, Australia-based company realized it made sense to look for an external, existing option.

DX was a natural choice, Cannon-Brookes said, considering 90% of DX's customers were already used Atlassian's project management and collaboration tools as well.

“DX has done an amazing job [of] understanding the qualitative and quantitative aspects of developer productivity and turning that into actions that can improve those companies and give them insights and comparisons to others in their industry, others at their size, etc.,” Cannon-Brookes said. 

He added that the timing was right due to the rise of AI tools and companies looking for ways to measure how they are being used.  

 “You suddenly have these budgets that are going up. Is that a good thing?” Cannon-Brookes said. “Is that not a good thing?  Am I spending the money in the right ways? It's really, really important and critical.” 

He added that there was a great cultural fit, too. Cannon-Brookes said he's always felt an affinity for Utah-based entrepreneurs — DX is based in Salt Lake City — and he liked that both companies were able to scale without taking on much outside funding.  

The feeling was mutual.  

Noda told TechCrunch this week that he thinks DX and Atlassian are better together than apart and that many of Atlassian's tools are complementary to the data and information that DX's platform gathers.  

“We are able to provide customers with that full flywheel to get the data and understand where we are unhealthy,” Noda said. “They can plug in Atlassian's tools and solutions to go address those bottlenecks. An end-to-end flywheel that is ultimately what customers want.” 

DX's platform will be integrated into the broader Atlassian product suite. 

This is Atlassian's second acquisition this month. The company announced it was buying AI-browser developer The Browser Company in early September.

Many Republicans are blaming social media for the murder of MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk since it's been revealed the suspect engraved internet meme messages on the bullets and used Discord to allegedly confess to the killing. And now a high-profile congressman wants some of the executives from various tech platforms to testify about it all.

James Comer, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, released a statement Wednesday calling for the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit to testify at a committee hearing on October 8, 2025.

“The politically motivated assassination of Charlie Kirk claimed the life of a husband, father, and American patriot. In the wake of this tragedy, and amid other acts of politically motivated violence, Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,” Comer said in a statement published online.

“To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes.”

Discord told Gizmodo in a statement on Wednesday that its CEO would be testifying.

“We have received the Committee's invitation and welcome the opportunity to testify,” a spokesperson told Gizmodo. “We continuously engage with policymakers on these critical issues and look forward to continuing this important dialogue next month.”

Kirk was shot and killed Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, while doing one of his debate-style talks on campus. Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old from Utah, turned himself in to authorities late the next day after his parents reportedly recognized him from security footage released by the FBI.

The bullet cartridges found near the scene of the crime were found to have messages engraved, one of many signs that the suspect was plugged in to internet trolling culture.

The messages reportedly included:

Robinson also allegedly talked with friends on Discord, which is presumably why Comer wants to bring the CEO of the company in for a hearing. But it's unclear why he's also calling in executives who oversee companies like Twitch, Steam, and Reddit.

The shooter's exact politics have yet to be determined, but the indictment alleges Robinson said Kirk was full of “hate.” The indictment also suggests that Robinson's messages were just a way to perform as a troll rather than an attempt to make an earnest statement.

But that's not going to stop legislators from insisting that something about platforms like Discord is in some way responsible for Kirk's death, no matter how ridiculous that idea may be.

Reddit, Twitch, and Valve (the owner of Steam) didn't respond to questions emailed on Wednesday about whether their respective CEOs would be attending the hearing. Gizmodo will update this article when we hear back.

The full-screen Xbox experience is no longer exclusive.

Earlier this year, Microsoft and Asus announced the ROG Xbox Ally, an update to the first-gen ROG Ally, now adorned with Xbox branding. Along with the new name came new specs, but more importantly, the Xbox partnership wasn't just a token collaboration — rather, a deeply integrated experience finally meant to "fix" Windows on handheld devices. Hence, the ROG Xbox Ally would ship with a new full-screen Xbox app that it would boot into by default, superseding Windows 11 entirely. This was exclusive to the ROG Xbox Ally and was supposed to come to other handhelds later; however, it seems the opposite has happened.

The Verge's Tom Warren reports that the full-screen Xbox experience meant for ROG Xbox Ally devices has leaked early, and can now be installed on any handheld running Windows. The actual ROG Xbox Ally is set to launch next month, which means that everyone else will get to enjoy Microsoft's new handheld gaming mode before the very device that was set to debut it. There's a full guide on Reddit that breaks down how to install it, and it's relatively easy to follow as long as you know your way around Windows. If you have a regular Ally, Lenovo's Legion Go, or the myriad of PC handhelds out there, you should be eligible.

The only requirement for this to work is the 25H2 Windows 11 update, for which you need to be part of the Windows Insider program. The build resides in the Release Preview channel, so once you've got that going, there are a few registry edits you need to make if you don't see the "Enter full-screen experience on start up" toggle right away. After all is said and done, a restart should boot you directly into the new Xbox experience, where all your favorite games should be consolidated into one place — including stores like Steam, Epic Games, and Battle.net.

The full-screen handheld mode is still based on Windows 11, just running without any of the extra stuff that hogs up resources in the background. It should use less memory, and the UI should be a lot more handheld-friendly. Windows Central tested the update on an original ROG Ally and saw marked improvements across the board in terms of performance—going from 29 FPS in Shadow of the Tomb Raider to 38 FPS—and even an extra hour gained in battery life. These upgrades mostly come courtesy of disabling unnecessary background processing and startup apps, not some significant underlying change to the Windows kernel itself.

It's important to note that you're not locked into the full-screen experience either; the ability to Alt-Tab out of apps and go into the regular desktop environment is still there. That being said, Microsoft itself recommends using mouse and keyboard for that since it's not designed for handhelds.

Cats and Dogs, living together!

In a surprise announcement that finds two long-time rivals working together, Nvidia and Intel announced today that the companies will jointly develop multiple new generations of x86 products together — a seismic shift with profound implications for the entire world of technology. Before the news broke, Tom's Hardware spoke with Nvidia representatives to learn more details about the company's plans.

The products include x86 Intel CPUs tightly fused with an Nvidia RTX graphics chiplet for the consumer gaming PC market, named the ‘Intel x86 RTX SOCs.' Nvidia will also have Intel build custom x86 data center CPUs for its AI products for hyperscale and enterprise customers. Additionally, Nvidia will buy $5 billion in Intel common stock at $23.28 per share, representing a roughly 5% ownership stake in Intel. (Intel stock is now up 33% in premarket trading.)

The partnership between the two companies is in the very early stages, Nvidia told us, so the timeline for product releases along with any product specifications will be disclosed at a later, unspecified date. (Given the traditionally long lead-times for new processors, it is rational to expect these products will take at least a year, and likely longer, to come to market.)

Nvidia emphasized that the companies are committed to multi-generation roadmaps for the co-developed products, which represents a strong investment in the x86 ecosystem. But representatives tells us it also remains fully committed to other announced product roadmaps and architectures, including the company's Arm-based GB10 Grace Blackwell processors for workstations and the Nvidia Grace CPUs for data centers, as well as the next-gen Vera CPUs. Nvidia says it also remains committed to products on its internal roadmaps that haven't been publicly disclosed yet, indicating that the new roadmap with Intel will merely be additive to existing initiatives.

The chip giant hasn't disclosed whether it will use Intel Foundry to produce any of these products yet. However, while Intel has used TSMC to manufacture some recent products, its goal is to bring production of most high-performance products back into its own foundries.

Some products never left. For instance, Intel's existing Granite Rapids data center processors use the ‘Intel 3' node, and the upcoming Clearwater Forest Xeons will use Intel's own 18A process node for compute. This suggests that at least some of the Nvidia-custom x86 silicon, particularly for the data center, could be fabbed on Intel nodes. Intel also uses TSMC to fabricate many of its client x86 processors, however, so we won't know for sure until official announcements are made — particularly for the RTX GPU chiplet.

In either case, Nvidia has been mulling using Intel Foundry since 2022, has fabbed test chips there, and participates in the U.S. Defense Dept.'s RAMP-C project with Intel. The DoD project involves Nvidia already making chips on Intel's 18A process node, so it wouldn't be a total surprise.

While the two companies have engaged in heated competition in some market segments, Intel and Nvidia have partnered for decades, ensuring interoperability between their hardware and software for products spanning both the client and data center markets. And the PCIe interface has long been used to connect Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs. The new partnership will find tighter integration using the NVLink interface for CPU-to-GPU communication, which affords up to 14 times more bandwidth along with lower latency than PCIe, thus granting the new x86 products access to the highest performance possible when paired with GPUs. Let's dive into the details we've learned so far.

For the PC market, the Intel x86 RTX SoC chips will come with an x86 CPU chiplet tightly connected with an Nvidia RTX GPU chiplet via the NVLink interface. This type of processor will have both CPU and GPU units merged into one compact chip package that externally looks much like a standard CPU, rivaling AMD's competing APU products.

This type of tight integration packs all the gaming prowess into one package without an external discrete GPU, providing power and footprint advantages. As such, these chips will be heavily focused on thin-and-light gaming laptops and small form-factor PCs, much like today's APUs from AMD. However, it's possible the new Nvidia/Intel chips could come in multiple flavors and permeate further into the Intel stack over time.

Intel has worked on a similar type of chip before with AMD; there is at least one significant technical difference between these initiatives, however. Intel launched its Kaby Lake-G chip in 2017 with an Intel processor fused into the same package as an AMD Radeon GPU chiplet, much the same as the description of the new Nvidia/Intel chips. You can see an image of the Intel/AMD chip below.

This SoC had a CPU at one end connected via a PCIe connection to the separate AMD GPU chiplet, which is flanked by a small, dedicated memory package. This separate memory package was only usable by the GPU. The Nvidia/Intel products will have an RTX GPU chiplet connected to the CPU chiplet via the faster and more efficient NVLink interface, and we're told it will have uniform memory access (UMA), meaning both the CPU and GPU will be able to access the same pool of memory.

Intel notoriously axed the Kaby Lake-G products in 2019, and the existing systems were left without proper driver support for quite some time, in part because Intel was responsible for validating the drivers, and then finger-pointing ensued. We're told that both Intel and Nvidia will be responsible for their respective drivers for the new models, with Nvidia naturally providing its own GPU drivers. However, Intel will build and sell the consumer processors.

We haven't spoken with Intel yet, but the limited scope of this project means that Intel's proprietary Xe graphics architecture will most assuredly live on as the primary integrated GPU (iGPU) for its mass-market products.

Intel's new x86 RTX CPUs will compete directly with AMD's APUs. For AMD, that means it faces intensifying competition from a company with the leading market share in notebook CPUs (Intel ships ~79% of laptop chips worldwide) that's now armed with GPU tech from Nvidia, which ships 92% of the world's gaming GPUs.

Intel will fabricate custom x86 data center CPUs for Nvidia, which Nvidia will then sell as its own products to enterprise and data center customers. However, the entirety and extent of the modification are currently unknown. We do know that Nvidia will employ its NVLink interface, which tells us the chips could leverage Nvidia's new NVLink Fusion tech that enables custom CPUs and accelerators to enable faster, more efficient communication with Nvidia's GPUs than found with the PCIe interface.

 




Intel has long offered custom Xeons to its customers, primarily hyperscalers, often with relatively minor tweaks to clock rates, cache capacities, and other specifications. In fact, these mostly slightly-modified custom Xeon models once comprised more than 50% of Intel's Xeon shipments. Intel has endured several years of market share erosion due to AMD's advances, most acutely in the hyperscale market. Therefore, it is unclear if the 50% number still holds true, as hyperscalers were the primary customers for custom models.

Intel has long said that it will design completely custom x86 chips for customers as part of its IDM 2.0 strategy. However, aside from a recent announcement of custom AWS chips that sound like the slightly modified Xeons mentioned above, we haven't heard of any large-scale uptake for significantly modified custom x86 processors. Intel announced a new custom chip design unit just two weeks ago, so it will be interesting to learn the extent of the customization for Nvidia's x86 data center CPUs.

Nvidia already uses Intel's Xeons in several of its systems, like the Nvidia DGX B300, but these systems still use the PCIe interface to communicate with the CPU. Intel's new collaboration with Nvidia will obviously open up new opportunities, given the tighter integration with NVLink and all the advantages it brings with it.

The likelihood of AMD adopting NVLink Fusion is somewhere around zero, as the company is heavily invested in its own Infinity Fabric (XGMI) and Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) initiatives, which aim to provide an open-standard interconnect to rival NVLink and democratize rack-scale interconnect technologies. Intel is also a member of UALink, which uses AMD's Infinity Fabric protocol as the foundation.

Nvidia's $5 billion purchase of Intel common stock will come at $23.28 a share, roughly 6% below the current market value, but several aspects of this investment remain unclear. Nvidia hasn't stated whether it will have a seat on the board (which is unlikely) or how it will vote on matters requiring shareholder approval. It is also unclear if Intel will issue new stock (primary issuance) for Nvidia to purchase, as it did when the U.S. government recently became an Intel shareholder (that is likely). Naturally, the investment is subject to approval from regulators.

Nvidia's buy-in comes on the heels of the U.S government buying $10 billion of newly-created Intel stock, granting the country a 9.9% ownership stake at $20.47 per share. The U.S. government won't have a seat on the board and agreed to vote with Intel's board on matters requiring shareholder approval “with limited exceptions.” Softbank has also recently purchased $2 billion worth of primary issuance Intel stock at $23 per share.

The U.S. government says it invested in Intel with the goal of bolstering US technology, manufacturing, and national security, and the investments from the private sector also help solidify the struggling Intel. Altogether, these investments represent a significant cash influx for Intel as it attempts to maintain the heavy cap-ex investments required to compete with TSMC, all while struggling with a negative amount of free cash flow.

“AI is powering a new industrial revolution and reinventing every layer of the computing stack — from silicon to systems to software. At the heart of this reinvention is Nvidia's CUDA architecture,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem—a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.”

“Intel's x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing for decades – and we are innovating across our portfolio to enable the workloads of the future,” said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. “Intel's leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the confidence Jensen and the Nvidia team have placed in us with their investment and look forward to the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow our business.”

We'll learn more details of the new partnership later today when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan hold a webcast press conference at 10 am PT.

Cybercriminals have a new way of sending millions of scam text messages to people. Typically when fraudsters send waves of phishing messages to phones—such as toll or delivery scams—they may use a huge list of phone numbers and automate the sending of messages. But as phone companies and telecom services have rolled out more tools to detect scams in texts, criminals have started driving around cities with fake cell phone towers that send messages directly to nearby phones.

Over the last year, there has been a marked uptick in the use of so-called “SMS blasters” by scammers, with cops in multiple countries detecting and arresting people using the equipment. SMS blasters are small devices, which have been found in the back of criminals' cars and sometimes backpacks, that impersonate cell phone towers and force phones into using insecure connections. They then push the scam messages, which contain links to fraudulent websites, to the connected phones.

While not a new type of technology, the use of SMS blasters in scamming was originally detected in Southeast Asian countries and has increasingly spread to Europe and South America—just last week, Switzerland's National Cybersecurity Centre issued a warning about SMS blasters. The devices are capable of sending huge volumes of scam texts indiscriminately. The Swiss agency said some blasters are able to send messages to all phones in a radius of 1,000 meters, while reports about an incident in Bangkok say a blaster was used to send around 100,000 SMS messages per hour.

“This is essentially the first time that we have seen large-scale use of mobile radio-transmitting devices by criminal groups,” says Cathal Mc Daid, VP of technology at telecommunication and cybersecurity firm Enea, who has been tracking the use of SMS blasters. “While some technical expertise would help in using these devices, those actually running the devices don't need to be experts. This has been shown by reports of arrests of people who have been basically paid to drive around areas with SMS blasters in cars or vans.”

SMS blasters act as illegitimate phone masts, often known as cell-site simulators (CSS). The blasters are not dissimilar to so-called IMSI catchers, or “Stingrays,” which law enforcement officials have used to scoop up people's phone data. But instead of being used for surveillance, they broadcast false signals to targeted devices.

Phones near a blaster can be forced to connect to its illegitimate 4G signals, before the blaster pushes devices to downgrade to the less secure 2G signal. “The 2G fake base station is then used to send (blast) malicious SMSes to the mobile phones initially captured by the 4G false base station,” Mc Daid says. “The whole process—4G capture, downgrade to 2G, sending of SMS and release—can take less than 10 seconds,” Mc Daid explains. It's something people who receive the messages may not even notice.

The growth of SMS blasters comes at a time when scams are rampant. In recent years, technology firms and mobile network operators have increasingly rolled out greater protections against fraudulent text messages—from better filtering and detection of possible scam messages to blocking tens of millions of messages per month. This month, UK telecom Virgin Media O2 said it has blocked more than 600 million scam text messages during 2025, which is more than its combined totals for the last two years. Still, millions of scam messages get through, and cybercriminals are quick to try to evade detection systems.

Because blasters operate outside of traditional mobile networks, the messages they send are not subject to the security measures that have been put in place by mobile providers. “None of our security controls apply to the messages that phones receive from them,” says Anton Reynaldo Bonifacio, the chief information security officer and chief AI officer at Philippines communications firm Globe Telecom. “Once phones are connected to these fake cell sites, they can spoof any sender ID or number to send the scam message.”

Back in 2022, Globe Telecom made the decision to stop delivering SMS messages that contain URLs, and Bonifacio says he believes scammers use the blasters to “bypass” these measures. “The technology used to be more niche, but I think sales and assembly of these IMSI catcher devices have become more prevalent for criminal organizations,” he says. Researchers have found SMS blasters being sold openly online for thousands of dollars.

Samantha Kight, the head of industry security at the mobile operator industry group the GSMA, says the Asia-Pacific region has been most impacted by SMS blasters so far, but there are cases appearing in Western Europe and South America. “It might be a problem in one or two regions, but then we tend to see these things pop up in different regions,” Kight says. Reporting from Commsrisk and Risky Business, have highlighted reports of SMS blasters being used in Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, New Zealand, Qatar, Indonesia, Oman, Brazil, Hong Kong, and more in recent months. Law enforcement officials in London say they have so far seized seven SMS blasters, and in June, a student from China was sentenced to jail for more than a year after being caught using one of the devices.

Kight says that tackling SMS blasters involves telecom operators and government regulators being aware of the devices, law enforcement agencies taking actions, as well as people recognizing and reporting scam messages to the relevant authorities. “As the mobile industry, we want to be able to find these, we want people to trust what's on their device, and we want to be able to protect them,” Kight says.

Yomna Nasser, a software engineer at Android, says people can stop their phones connecting to 2G networks in their settings. “Once enabled, your device will no longer scan for or connect to 2G cell towers,” Nasser says, adding the only exception is if an emergency call is being made and 3G, 4G and 5G are not available. Android's Advanced Protection mode will also disable 2G automatically on some newer phones. Apple did not answer WIRED's request for comment by the time of publication, although its Lockdown Mode will disable 2G connections.

Ultimately, you may not know if an SMS blaster is used to send you a scam. Ben Hurley, a detective sergeant with the City of London's Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit, which is investigating cases locally, says that while the delivery is different, the actual scams themselves haven't changed. Phishing messages are often designed to get you to click on a malicious link and hand over your personal information. “It's a new way of doing the same thing,” Hurley says. “It's changed how we have to investigate it, but actually it's not changed the end result,” he says, adding that people should always be cautious of clicking links in unknown messages and take a moment before acting if the message feels suspicious.

As with all cybercrime, though, there is a chance that those operating the schemes and blasters could evolve their tactics. “The actual SMS blaster devices they use are relatively unsophisticated so far,” Mc Daid says, adding that the type of technology originally came from the world of governments, law enforcement, and militaries. If criminals are able to gain access to more sophisticated technology and expertise, he says, “this could be the beginning of a cat and mouse game.”

In the early days of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg and his team famously adopted the motto “Move fast and break things.” Posters with the phrase reportedly adorned the company's Silicon Valley headquarters, alongside other, similar sentiments like “Done is better than perfect,” and “Fail quicker.” The focus for the young company was clear: Being first was more important than getting it right first time.

As the company grew, Zuckerberg—in an interview with WIRED— started to distance himself from, or at least temper, those mantras. But with Wednesday's announcement of the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses, it feels like some of that old mentality might have started to creep back in.

“Our goal is to build great-looking glasses that deliver personal superintelligence,” said Zuckerberg yesterday at the very start of the Meta Connect event. He then immediately outlined some “clear values” that Meta holds sacrosanct for smart glasses. Number-one for Zuckerberg was “they need to be great glasses first” with “refined aesthetics” that “shave every millimeter” from the hardware. No doubt Meta has shaved every millimeter it can from its new flagship specs, but in a rush to fully realize these next-gen glasses it looks like Meta has broken that primary value right out the gate.

I got a chance to demo the Meta Ray-Ban Display, ahead of Meta Connect, at a preview event in London. The big news is they feature a small display built into the right lens that gives users visual prompts and guidance. They come with a wristband that understands hand gestures, which can be used to interact with the things displayed on the screen. Meta has labeled them the “world's most advanced AI glasses,” and having tried them, it‘s easy to agree. They are undoubtedly impressive, and I think most people who get to try them will like them.

The display appears in the right lens.

The whole experience—from the quality of the display itself, to the gesture controls and the on-glasses capabilities—all feels polished and intuitive, particularly considering this is Meta's first commercial stab at such a product.

But here's the problem: As impressive as they are, I still wouldn't buy them. Outside of tech fans and early adopters, I don't think a lot of people will. Not this iteration, anyway. And that's not even because of the arguably punchy $800 price tag.

The thing that truly lets them down is their aesthetic, and that's not what I expected from the company that made such a success of the original Ray-Ban Metas because of their design. While the originals (and their just-announced successors) basically look like Ray-Ban glasses, these, in what can only be described as a glaring faux pas, are far from being fashion-first. They look like smart glasses, but the old kind you don't really want to be seen wearing.

The chunk factor cannot be ignored.

Oh, there is a whiff of the Wayfarer about the Meta Ray-Ban Display; you can tell the intention is there to try and replicate the success of the most popular Ray-Ban style. But somehow distant alarm bells are ringing. Even though “statement glasses” are fashionable, these are just a bit too chunky to blend in.

At a glance, you can tell that something is going on with them. We've arrived in the uncanny valley of smart glasses, where the subtle bulges and added girth of the frames demand your attention, but not in a good way.

Interestingly, there is a subtle nod to this shift in aesthetics in the naming structure. While the original Ray-Ban Meta glasses lead with the Ray-Ban branding in their name, the Meta Ray-Ban Display switch that focus around. Which of the two brands made that call hasn't been made clear, but these are Meta's self-branded, tech-first glasses, and that feels a like misstep, especially considering the experience Meta already has in the market.

The new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses on a human model.

In her recent piece for WIRED, Amy Francombe notes how vitally important aesthetics are in creating mass acceptance of products such as this: “In the world of wearable tech, aesthetics have killed more ideas than poor battery life. Frames are fashion. No one wants to wear a prototype on their face.” Too right.

Meta knows how to build the platforms, she adds, but not necessarily the products people want to wear. It's why Essilor Luxottica, the company that owns Ray-Ban, has proved such a valuable ally in this journey so far—so valuable in fact, that Meta invested $3.5 billion for a minority stake in the business back in July.

Having shown off its prototype Orion AR glasses at Meta Connect last year, the announcement of Meta Ray-Ban Display this year feels like a forced attempt to solidify the company's position as the leader of the product category, but by embracing the old mantras of its founding company and moving first.

This creates an aesthetic compromise, where the tech is clearly not quite ready to fit into the tried and tested formula that Meta, and Essilor Luxottica, knows sells in its millions.

The original Ray-Ban Meta glasses are sleek and fashionable—and look very much like regular glasses.

But perhaps Meta isn't ready for that anyway. We know that the Meta Ray-Ban Display are going to launch initially in the US only, and in limited numbers. An in-store fitting requirement will also slow adoption, as will a high price that makes them far from a spontaneous purchase.

With the Meta Ray-Ban Display, it feels like Meta is dipping its toe in, testing the water, while simultaneously bragging about what it's capable of and seeing if customers will swallow this compromise of form and function.

It's a bold move for a company that has already proved the model for success, and yet so quickly is actively choosing to go against it. Yes, the Display glasses look fine—we're nowhere near Google Glass or Snapchat Spectacles territory here—but I would definitely feel self-conscious walking around with these on my face in a way I don't in Ray-Ban Meta.

The good news is that when the tech does catch up, and the design aligns more with what buyers have come to expect from the Ray-Ban Meta partnership (in that order), the experience on the glasses will already be waiting. As will the consumers that so loved the original Ray-Ban Metas.

It's a bad time to be a JavaScript developer.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


It's a bad time to be a JavaScript developer, after Koi Security revealed yesterday that it is tracking "the largest and most dangerous npm supply-chain compromise in history."The security firm said the Shai-Hulud malware campaign "has now impacted hundreds of packages across multiple maintainers," including "popular libraries such as @ctrl/tinycolor as well as packages maintained by CrowdStrike." (Emphasis theirs.) And the problem is probably going to get worse before it gets better, because the malware in question is a worm that autonomously spreads from package to package."Attackers published malicious versions of @ctrl/tinycolor and other npm packages, injecting a large obfuscated script (bundle.js) that executes automatically during installation," Koi Security said in the blog post revealing this campaign. "This payload repackages and republishes maintainer projects, enabling the malware to spread laterally across related packages without direct developer involvement."To be clear: This campaign is distinct from the incident that we covered on Sept. 9, which saw multiple npm packages with billions of weekly downloads compromised in a bid to steal cryptocurrency. The ecosystem is the same — attackers have clearly realized the GitHub-owned npm package registry for the Node.js ecosystem is a valuable target—but whoever's behind the Shai-Hulud campaign is after more than just some Bitcoin."The injected script performs credential harvesting and persistence operations," Koi Security said. "It runs TruffleHog to scan local filesystems and repositories for secrets, including npm tokens, GitHub credentials, and cloud access keys for [Amazon Web Services], [Google Cloud Platform], and Azure. It also writes a hidden GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/shai-hulud-workflow.yml) that exfiltrates secrets during CI/CD runs, ensuring long-term access even after the initial infection. This dual focus on endpoint secret theft and backdoors makes Shai-Hulud one of the most dangerous campaigns ever compared to previous compromises."That might be confusing to anyone who doesn't have to worry about developing and distributing Node.js software. But the long and short of it is that Shai-Hulud is using a well-known offensive security tool (TruffleHog) alongside developer tooling (GitHub Actions) in an environment that is designed specifically to help distribute software without much developer involvement (npm).We suggested in our previous report that whoever compromised the npm packages to steal cryptocurrency did us a favor, because they could have used their access to those packages to accomplish far worse attacks. Now it seems that someone is looking to do just that — and it's hard to feign surprise when the Node.js ecosystem and the tooling built around it were practically built to enable widespread attacks like this.Koi Security is updating its blog post with a list of npm packages known to have been compromised via the Shai-Hulud campaign. StepSecurity has also published indicators of compromise alongside a technical breakdown of how the malware spreads, what it does, and how organizations should respond if they discover that a compromised package has been used somewhere in their infrastructure.

Google's Nano Banana image-generation model, officially known as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, has fueled global momentum for the Gemini app since launching last month. But in India, it has taken on a creative life of its own, with retro portraits and local trends going viral — even as privacy and safety concerns begin to emerge.

India has emerged as the No. 1 country in terms of Nano Banana usage for now, according to David Sharon, multimodal generation lead for Gemini Apps at Google DeepMind, who spoke at a media session this week. The model's popularity has also propelled the Gemini app to the top of the free app charts on both the App Store and Google Play in India. The app has also climbed to the top of global app stores' charts, according to Appfigures.

Given India's scale — the world's second-largest smartphone market and second-biggest online population after China — it is no surprise the country is leading in adoption. But what is catching Google's attention is not just how many people are using Nano Banana, it is how: Millions of Indians are engaging with the AI model in ways that are uniquely local, highly creative, and in some cases, completely unexpected.

One of the standout trends is Indians using Nano Banana to re-create retro looks inspired by 1990s Bollywood, imagining how they might have appeared during that era, complete with period-specific fashion, hairstyles, and makeup. This trend is local to India, Sharon told reporters.

A variation of the retro trend is what some are calling the “AI saree,” where users generate vintage-style portraits of themselves wearing traditional Indian attire.

Another trend local to India is people generating their selfies in front of cityscapes and iconic landmarks, such as Big Ben and the U.K.'s retro telephone booths.

“We saw a lot of that in the beginning,” Sharon said.

Indian users are also experimenting with Nano Banana to transform objects, create time-travel effects, and even reimagine themselves as retro postage stamps. Others are generating black-and-white portraits or using the model to visualize encounters with their younger selves.

Some of these trends did not originate in India, but the country played a key role in helping them gain global attention. One example is the figurine trend, where people generate miniature versions of themselves, often placing them in front of a computer screen. The trend first emerged in Thailand, spread to Indonesia, and became global after gaining traction in India, Sharon said.

In addition to Nano Banana, Google has observed a trend where Indian users are utilizing its Veo 3 AI video-generation model on the Gemini app to create short videos from old photos of their grandparents and great-grandparents.

All of this has helped drive Gemini's popularity on both the App Store and Google Play in India. Between January and August, the app saw an average of 1.9 million monthly downloads in the country — about 55% higher than in the U.S. — accounting for 16.6% of global monthly downloads, per Appfigures data shared exclusively with TechCrunch.

India downloads have totaled 15.2 million this year until August; the U.S., on the other hand, has had 9.8 million downloads so far this year, per Appfigures data.

Daily downloads of the Gemini app in India significantly surged following the release of the Nano Banana update, beginning on September 1 with 55,000 installs across both app stores. Downloads peaked at 414,000 on September 13 — a 667% increase — with Gemini holding the top overall spot on the iOS App Store since September 10 and on Google Play since September 12, including across all categories, Appfigures data shows.

Despite India leading in downloads, the country does not top in-app purchases on the Gemini app, which has generated an estimated $6.4 million in global consumer spending on iOS since launch, per Appfigures. The U.S. accounts for the largest share at $2.3 million (35%), while India contributes $95,000 (1.5%). However, India posted a record 18% month-over-month growth in spending, reaching $13,000 between September 1 and 16 — compared to an 11% global increase during the same period. That puts India seven percentage points above the global rate and more than 17 points ahead of the U.S., where growth was under 1%.

That said, as with other AI apps, there are concerns about users uploading personal photos to Gemini to transform their appearance.

“When a user asks us to fulfill their query, we do our best to fulfill that query. We don't try to assume what the user's intent is,” Sharon said while addressing questions on how Google is dealing with data misuse and privacy concerns among users in India and other top markets. “We've really tried to improve that, and we have improved that to be bold and fulfil your request.”

Google places a visible, diamond-shaped watermark on images generated by the Nano Banana model and also embeds a hidden marker using its SynthID tool to identify AI-generated content. SynthID allows Google to detect and flag whether an image was created using its models.

Sharon told reporters that Google is testing a detection platform with trusted testers, researchers, and other experts. The company also plans to launch a consumer-facing version that would allow anyone to check whether an image is AI-generated.

“This is still day one, and we're still learning, and we're learning together. There are things that we might need to improve on in the future, and it's really your feedback from users, press, academia, and experts that helps us improve,” Sharon said.

Research led by The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and College of Medicine explores the ways brain cells communicate, revealing fresh insight into the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

A multidisciplinary team used advanced imaging and computational modeling to analyze the "crosstalk" between neurons and their supporting glial cells in the human brain. This approach highlights the brain's interconnected cellular network.

"By mapping these cell interactions at the molecular level, we identified key pathways that could be pivotal in both the onset and progression of neurodegeneration," said study co-author Oscar Harari, PhD, director of the Division of Neurogenetics and director of the Center for Neurobiology of Aging and Resiliency at The Ohio State University Neuroscience Research Institute.

Study findings are published in Science Translational Medicine.

"This insight is critical for developing effective treatments, as 'cellular crosstalk' may serve as an attractive molecular target for drug development. Many of these cell-to-cell communication pathways include proteins at the cell membrane, which are often regarded as promising targets for therapeutic intervention," said Harari, who is also the Helen C. Kurtz Associate Professor of Neurology at Ohio State.

Harari, who joined Ohio State in early 2024, completed the manuscript for the research he started while at the Washington University School of Medicine. He collaborated equally with study co-author Tae-Wan Kim, PhD, associate professor of Pathology and Cell Biology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York.

Our research shows that Alzheimer's is not only driven by plaques and tangles, but also by a breakdown in communication between brain cells. By uncovering the SEMA6D–TREM2 crosstalk pathway, we reveal a new way to enhance the amyloid-clearing functions of microglia and potentially slow Alzheimer's progression."

The study included investigators from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, as well as collaborators from Australia, South Korea, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Indiana University School of Medicine, and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network.

The Massage Therapy Foundation (MTF) announces the award of a research grant to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The grant will support a three-year study entitled Myofascial Release Therapy in Irritable Bowel Syndrome led by Primary Investigators Maria Mascarenhas, MBBS and Alain J. Benitez, MD, MSTR.

The study aims to evaluate the impact of abdominal myofascial release (MFR)-a gentle, manual therapy-on symptom relief, quality of life, and bowel function in adolescents with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C). This randomized controlled study pairs MFR with a novel, non-invasive Wireless Patch System to objectively measure gastrointestinal activity. By integrating patient-reported outcomes with real-time physiological data, the study aims to uncover both therapeutic benefits and underlying mechanisms of MFR. Findings could pave the way for safer, developmentally appropriate treatments for pediatric irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and establish new standards for non-invasive motility assessment. 

We're excited to explore how massage helps children and adolescents with IBS and to better understand how it works in the body. This research can help make massage a regular part of care, not just a nice addition to the care plan. It will support efforts to get insurance to cover the service, so more families can access the option."

Maria Mascarehhas, MBBS, pediatric gastroenterologist and Medical Director of the Integrative Health Program at CHOP

"This study exemplifies the power of interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together researchers and skilled massage therapists to co-develop and deliver a practice-informed intervention for pediatric IBS-C. We're proud to support research that not only advances scientific understanding but also honors the expertise of massage therapy professionals in creating meaningful, patient-centered care," said Kim Kane-Santos, MTF President.

Funds for this groundbreaking research project were provided by the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA), in alignment with their shared mission with MTF to advance the art, science, and practice of massage therapy.

"We are proud to support this groundbreaking research exploring myofascial release therapy for pediatric IBS-C. By combining manual therapy with innovative, non-invasive monitoring, this study exemplifies the kind of integrative, evidence-based care that can transform lives and advance the massage therapy profession," said Cindy E. Farrar, AMTA National President.

Women suffering from long COVID have a greater risk of experiencing abnormal uterine bleeding. The symptoms of the illness intensify during the perimenstrual and proliferative phases of the menstrual cycle, notably fatigue, headaches, and muscle pain. This bidirectional relationship between long COVID and menstrual disorders has been revealed by a French-British research team co-led by a CNRS researcher. An inflammatory reaction is suspected of being behind this connection, after the discovery of an immune cell cluster in the endometrium of the patients receiving treatment. No abnormalities were detected in relation to ovarian hormones.

These conclusions, which were just published in Nature Communications, are based on a combination of three approaches: a study conducted among 12,187 British women; follow-up care for 54 women suffering from long COVID for three months; and analysis of blood and endometrial samples.

As long COVID affects 3-7% of the world's population, and is twice as prevalent among women than men, this novel study paves the way for new therapeutic prospects. It also underscores the importance of considering the menstrual cycle in long COVID biomarkers, as well as the need to develop therapies specifically adapted to women.

As the second leading cause of death globally, cancer is a worldwide health crisis, particularly as life expectancies continue to increase. In its final stages, cancer spreads throughout the body in a process known as metastasis. Here, the cancer cells enter the circulatory system, moving to various distal sites where they cause the formation of new tumors. Metastasis accounts for a vast majority of cancer-related deaths, but the molecular machinery driving this behavior is still poorly understood.

The cytoskeleton is a critical component of cancer cell migration and is broadly involved in cell structure and motility. The formation of actin filaments (F-actin), in particular, is a notable driver of cell motility, and the presence of F-actin structures can serve as a biomarker of cell migration. Actin filaments can also be used as an indicator of cell necrosis, as the loss of membrane integrity causes F-actin to become exposed.

Previous investigations of F-actin in cancer cells were largely performed in 2D, providing relatively limited information, since cell processes ultimately occur in 3D. Tumors in particular can be challenging targets for such approaches, as they are heterogeneous, and 2D cross-sectional visualization may not provide a complete picture of the cellular dynamics at play. Therefore, an accurate molecular understanding of the cytoskeleton's role in metastasis would necessitate imaging techniques that capture volumetric data.

A recent study from the Vienna University of Technology, Austria, used light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) to examine cytoskeletal changes in spheroids composed of either colorectal cancer (CRC) or non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells in 3D. The 2D data measured with this technique were deconvoluted in NeuroDeblur (MBF Bioscience) and reconstructed into a 3D representation using Thermo Scientific Amira Software, which revealed intricate internal and external tissue structures.

Light sheet fluorescence microscopy uses a laser to trigger fluorescence through a cross-section of a sample. When this is done at discreet intervals throughout an entire sample volume, precise optical sectioning of the specimen becomes possible, producing a data series that can be deconvoluted and stacked into a 3D volume.

Prado-López et al. used this approach to analyze cancer-cell spheroids produced from CRC and NSCLC specimens. They found that the internal structures of the cells exhibited sufficient autofluorescence for differentiation and segmentation. In particular, F-actin structures could be clearly identified, along with quantification of their intensity in individual cells (see below).

Quantitative analysis through Amira Software segmentation also allowed F-actin intensity to be correlated to CRC and NSCLC cell necrosis. Six distinct regions were identified and mapped to different cellular states, such as proliferation, senescence, and necrosis.

F-actin polymerization, which leads to cell stiffening, correlates with increased cell mobility. Prado-López et al. found they could directly observe this F-actin behavior in a more physiologically relevant, 3D context.

Subsequent segmentation in Amira Software provided a quantitative analysis of F-actin distribution. This approach is an exciting step forward in our ability to view cancer cell mobility and metastasis at a molecular level. These insights will enhance our understanding of this process and provide avenues for potential intervention and treatment.

electronRx, a leading digital medicine and biomarker company driving healthcare through pulmonary innovation, today announced that it will launch pDx at HLTH 2025. The pDx app offers chronic respiratory disease (CRD) patients a cardiopulmonary assessment device, engineered to medical grade standards, to measure lung function at home using a mobile phone, laptop or tablet. This enables clinicians to remotely assess cardiopulmonary function, track disease progression, and adjust treatment protocols to optimise therapeutic outcomes. By reducing the need for frequent hospital visits, pDx empowers patients to better manage their conditions, while helping healthcare systems to streamline delivery and reduce the strain on resources.

The pDx app and complementary clinical dashboard are designed to enhance the detection, monitoring, and treatment of CRDs including asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension, which are the third leading cause of death, globally*. The app expands upon electronRx's proprietary purpleDx technology, adding tailored questionnaires and access to real-time detailed results for patients, as well as their clinicians. In addition to purpleDx's mobile phone accessibility, pDx can now be accessed using any device with a screen, such as a laptop or tablet, depending on the individual's preference.

The technology leverages the device's camera sensors to capture and measure blood flow biomechanics, generating digital biomarkers that translate into clinically actionable metrics. These include key physiological metrics such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and tidal volume. The data is delivered in real time to healthcare providers via a secure clinical dashboard, enabling remote monitoring of lung function and dynamic adjustment of treatment plans to optimise drug efficacy.

electronRx is dedicated to transforming the lives of people living with breathing disorders. pDx represents a major step forward in personalised respiratory care and we very much look forward to demonstrating the technology at HLTH. The platform's scalable architecture supports integration into existing care pathways, allowing for proactive intervention and reduced reliance on in-person visits. By facilitating continuous monitoring, pDx helps clinicians personalise care while improving patient adherence and reducing healthcare burden. Most importantly, it gives patients greater flexibility and control over their healthcare journey."

GaGe high-performance digitizers are transforming neurological diagnostics and brain research by delivering the speed and accuracy required for sophisticated brain imaging and neurological research. In focused ultrasound therapies, these devices enable instantaneous tracking to open the blood-brain barrier for safe and precise drug delivery.

Moreover, their ultrafast data acquisition supports EEG, MEG, and brain-computer interface applications, delivering precise signal capture for diagnostics and therapeutic development. GaGe technology provides more detailed insights into both brain function and next-generation neurotherapies.

Challenge: This paper examines the use of cavitating micro-bubbles to breach the Blood-Brain Barrier, which typically prevents the brain from absorbing medication. A high-power focused ultrasound transducer aimed at the brain was employed to induce cavitation in microbubbles injected into the bloodstream.

Tracking a Passive Cavitation Detector (PCD) in contact with the brain to generate spectrograms has been demonstrated to be a robust method to detect and characterize cavitation in mice brains. This study investigates usage of such a PCD to detect cavitation in monkey brains, where detection is more difficult due to their thicker skulls.

How the GaGe digitizer was used: A GaGe Digitizer was employed to measure the electrical field induced by the TMS coils. The digitizer recorded the voltage variations acquired by a dipole probe in the head model, allowing for computation of electrical field strength and distribution.

This paper examines the use of cavitating micro-bubbles to breach the Blood-Brain Barrier and aid absorption of medication by the brain.

Challenge: The objective was to induce cavitation in microbubbles injected into the bloodstream. This induction was achieved by aiming a high-power focused ultrasound transducer at the brain.

How GaGe digitizers were used: The amplitude of the focused transducer's excitation was monitored by a Gage CompuScope digitizer. The resulting CompuScope data was used to estimate absolute ultrasonic pressure, enabling analysis of its effect on microbubble cavitation within mouse brains.

Challenge: Neuroimmunomodulation is a drug-free treatment that uses high-power focused ultrasound to irradiate the brain. The treatment can be effective for neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's.

The underlying mechanism of the treatment is not well understood. This paper experimentally compared three separate proposed mechanisms in mice brains. The irradiating high-power focused ultrasonic transducer contained a smaller low-power transducer used to align the focused transducer and to track ultrasonic activity in the brain in some applications.

How GaGe digitizers were used: Measurements of infrared light absorption and scattering can provide insight, for instance, on blood oxygenation and tissue composition. A Gage digitizer was utilized to track signals from two photodetectors – one measuring raw laser power and the other connected to the signal from the infrared interferometer containing the sample. The Gage waveform data was subsequently utilized to determine final infrared absorption and scattering measurements.

In medical and brain research, studying tissues at the molecular level without damaging the samples is critical. Conventional approaches can be rough and do not always provide a clear picture.

Challenge: Examining brain tissue at the molecular level is crucial for advancing medical research, but conventional mass spectrometry approaches may damage fragile samples and lack the detailed images required for 3D analysis.

How GaGe digitizers were used: Through the combination of high-speed laser pulses with an ultrafast GaGe Digitizer, the research team developed a robust, novel imaging method. This system gently eliminates and evaluates small layers of brain tissue, with precise, real-time signal capture, producing non-destructive, high-resolution 3D images that expose the structure and chemical makeup of brain samples. This approach lays the foundation for improved diagnostics and brain research.

This study is related to developments in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a method utilized in neuroscience and neurology for non-invasive brain stimulation. TMS is commonly employed in research and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Challenge: Conventional TMS coils, such as the figure-8 coil, have constraints in stimulating deep brain regions without causing undesired cortical stimulation. This limits TMS efficacy for treating conditions involving deeper brain structures.

How the GaGe digitizer was used: A GaGe Digitizer measured the electrical field induced by the TMS coils. The digitizer captured the voltage differences recorded by a dipole probe in the head model, allowing calculation of electrical field strength and distribution.

Locomotor activity is the motion necessary to get from one place to another. It is closely linked to complex human activities such as learning and motivation, and it is key to avoiding or approaching a stimulus, target, or big-picture goal.

Locomotor activity tendencies of avoiding or seeking are a central component of the human experience, with locomotor activity tests enabling the assessment of spontaneous locomotor activity in rats and mice in order to establish the baseline level of motor activity.

The acoustic startle response is an unconditional reflex manifested as a rapid contraction of facial and skeletal muscles in response to a sudden and intense startling stimulus.

Translational research, in particular, benefits from the study of the acoustic startle response because this response is consistent across a range of different species. The acoustic startle response also uses neural circuitry, which is simple in nature while being sensitive to a range of experimental manipulations.

The rodent acoustic startle response is widely employed in the study of the central nervous system's intrinsic properties, including fear and anxiety, sensitization, habituation, classical conditioning, sensorimotor gating, and drug effects.

Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is an important phenomenon used to model sensorimotor gating. PPI involves the suppression of the startle response when a weak pre-stimulus is applied prior to a strong startling stimulus.

Sensorimotor gating issues are key elements of a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, OCD, and Huntington's disease. PPI of the rodent acoustic startle response is, therefore, at the forefront of research into these disorders' genetics, pathophysiology, and pharmacology.

The acoustic startle response in rodents is extremely brief, making this difficult to assess. In order to address this challenge, rodent acoustic startle response is often monitored in stabilimeter chambers, which limit animal movement. This is stressful and unpleasant for animals; however, it necessitates extensive calming and habituation.

The acoustic startle response manifests as an exaggerated flinching response to an unanticipated strong auditory stimulus (pre-pulse). It may be possible to weaken this response via a preceding weaker stimulus (pre-pulse). This is the primary underlying pre-pulse inhibition (PPI).

PPI has been documented in a range of species, including mice and humans, affording researchers a useful means of operationally measuring sensorimotor gating and determining an animal's ability to successfully integrate and prevent sensory information.

San Diego Instruments' SR-LAB acoustic startle response system is the most widely used startle reflex research system designed to quantify PPI, fear-potentiated startle (FPS), and acoustic startle response.

The SR-LAB is a holistic software and hardware solution designed to accommodate a wide range of acoustic startle response applications. For high-throughput applications, as many as 16 stations are available.

The SR-LAB acoustic startle response software controls a diverse array of tone, noise burst, light, foot shock, air puff, and background noise combinations. It can also support various test paradigms without requiring additional software.

The SR-LAB system can easily accommodate the most prevalent test paradigms via a single software program, making it more cost-effective than similar systems.

Users can design customized paradigms as required, and data is easily verifiable because each response allows users to confirm numeric data by reviewing the entire waveform.

The SR-LABS's tubular enclosures allow animals to turn without constraint, removing the restraint stress that often significantly impacts acoustic startle response test results. The tubular design also ensures that animals are kept over the sensor, ensuring reliable results.

People with temporal lobe epilepsy in particular often wander around aimlessly and unconsciously after a seizure. Researchers at the University Hospital Bonn (UKB), the University of Bonn, and the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) have identified a neurobiological mechanism that could be responsible for this so-called post-ictal wandering and potentially other postictal symptoms. According to their hypothesis, epileptic seizures are not directly responsible for post-ictal symptoms, but rather seizure-associated depolarization waves, also known as spreading depolarization (SD). The results of the studies have now been published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

In everyday clinical practice, symptoms are regularly observed after epileptic seizures, known as "post-ictal symptoms", which, in contrast to the usually short duration of seizures, typically last several minutes to hours. Besides symptoms such as impaired speech and language comprehension, a state of disorientation may occur. This wandering about, known in technical terms as postictal wandering, can sometimes be life-threatening if, for example, the affected unconscious person runs onto the street. "Postictal symptoms are traditionally referred to the preceding epileptic seizure. However, it is unclear whether there is actually a direct neurobiological connection or whether the symptoms are based on another pathology," says corresponding author Prof. Michael Wenzel from the Dept. of Epileptology at the UKB, who is also a member of the Transdisciplinary Research Area (TRA) "Life & Health" at the University of Bonn.

The Bonn research team initially wanted to better understand the development of epilepsy as a result of an initial acute disease-in this case, viral encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain caused by viruses. To do this, they used modern cellular-resolution fluorescence microscopy in combination with electrophysiology and optogenetics in a mouse model, which allows them to study network dynamics and the communication of different brain cell types in the living brain with high resolution over a period of months. "In doing so, we accidentally discovered a network phenomenon in the hippocampus-a structure relevant to epilepsy located inside the temporal lobe-that could explain postictal symptoms but, surprisingly, does not represent seizures themselves," says first author Bence Mitlasóczki, a doctoral student at the University of Bonn in Prof. Wenzel's research group at the UKB.

The observed phenomenon consists of slow depolarization waves, which are mainly known from neurological disorders such as migraine or acute brain injuries. This so-called spreading depolarization (SD) causes the collapse of the neuronal membrane potential and the failure of the affected network for minutes to hours. The structures in the inner region of the temporal lobe, such as the hippocampus, may be more sensitive to SD during epileptic seizures than the multisensory and motor part of the cerebral cortex, known as the neocortex.

This could also explain why postictal symptoms are most commonly observed in temporal lobe epilepsy."

Bence Mitlasóczki, Doctoral Student, University of Bonn

In addition, SD waves are filtered out in standard clinical EEGs in epileptology because they are so slow. "As a result, SDs have been 'invisible' in clinical EEGs for decades, which is an important reason why the strictly seizure-related concept of postictal symptoms persists, even though this may not be accurate," states Prof. Wenzel.

In addition, the Bonn researchers found evidence that seizure-associated SDs also exist in deep regions of the human brain. To do this, they used a special feature of pre-surgical diagnostics at the UKB for people with difficult-to-treat epilepsy, which tests whether a local seizure focus can be surgically removed. As part of the study, the research team initially examined some participants using the electrodes implanted for diagnosis with additional microwire bundles – which were established by the working group led by co-author Prof. Florian Mormann at the UKB – to determine whether local SD can also be detected deep in the human brain as soon as the EEG bandwidth is extended beyond the international standard, thus enabling very slow potential fluctuations to be recorded.

The conclusion of the Bonn researchers is that epileptic seizures, although assumed to be the cause for decades, may not be the direct cause of postictal symptoms. "Our hypothesis is that local seizure-associated SD is a key factor in epilepsy that has been massively understudied to date," says co-author Prof. Heinz Beck from the UKB and DZNE. He is a spokesperson for the Transdisciplinary Research Area (TRA) "Life & Health" and a member of the ImmunoSensation Cluster of Excellence at the University of Bonn. The results point to a possible general role of SD in a variety of different postictal disorders, which now need to be investigated further. "In addition, our results require a review of previous studies which, because SD was filtered out, related effects and effect sizes to epileptic seizures, even though this may not be the case," says Prof. Wenzel. "Finally, our study could stimulate a discussion on whether the international EEG standard needs to be expanded to make SD directly visible in clinical EEG as well."

Details of a new drug that aims to treat the underlying causes of obesity are being presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Vienna, Austria (15-19 September).

The treatment of obesity has been transformed in recent years by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists such as semaglutide, which reduce appetite, slow the release of food from the stomach and increase feelings of fullness.

These drugs are highly effective for weight loss but many people regain weight after stopping treatment. That's because obesity is driven by more than appetite alone – it also involves disrupted lipid and glucose metabolism, changes in adipose tissue and mitochondrial dysfunction, leaving plenty of room for new approaches, explains Riccardo Panella, co-founder and CEO of Turin-based biotech Resalis Therapeutics.

The company's approach involves an antisense oligonucleotide – a small, lab-made fragment of genetic material designed to block a specific RNA in the body. The new drug, which is called RES-010, is designed to block an RNA molecule called miR-22.

miR22 is a "master controller" of many processes involved in obesity, including lipid metabolism (how the body breaks down and uses fats), the production and activity of mitochondria (the tiny structures that provide cells with energy) and adipose tissue remodeling (changes in how body fat is organized and how it functions), says Dr Panella, who is one of the authors of the new research.

The hope is that by tackling all these factors simultaneously, RES-010, which is administered once a week as a subcutaneous injection, will reprogram the metabolism, producing long-lasting weight loss.

Pre-clinical studies show that the compound can induce significant weight loss – and that the lost weight isn't regained when treatment stops. A phase 1 trial is now under way.

In tests on obese mice, mice given weekly injections of the drug lost about 12% more weight than untreated mice. The weight loss occurred gradually over the five months of treatment, leading to the animals returning to healthy weight.

Importantly, the treated mice lost weight despite eating the same amount as the untreated mice, which suggests RES-010 isn't suppressing appetite but reprogramming the metabolism."

Riccardo Panella, Co-Founder and CEO, Resalis Therapeutics

Experiments also showed that mice that had been treated with RES-010 did not regain weight after the drug was stopped.

The team also explored giving RES-010 and semaglutide alone and together to mice and non-human primates (NHPs).

They found that RES-010 selectively targeted fat mass. This is important because rapid weight loss when on a diet or taking GLP-1 drugs can lead to lean mass, which includes muscle and bone, being lost too.

"Lean mass, especially skeletal muscle, is central to strength, stamina and blood sugar regulation, and so its loss is potentially harmful," says Dr Panella.

NHPs given RES-010 lost 15% fat mass and 1% lean mass over ten weeks. This compares with 16% fat mass and 8% lean mass for semaglutide alone.

The team also looked at whether the animals regained weight after treatment was stopped.

They observed that while the NHPs given semaglutide alone regained weight after semaglutide was discontinued, the animals receiving the combination treatment did not regain weight after semaglutide was stopped and they remained on RES-010 alone. Moreover, no rebound occurred when RES-010 was also stopped a few weeks later.

No significant side-effects were seen in the mice or the NHPs at therapeutic doses, says Dr Panella.

Tests on animals and non-human organoids have shown how the drug works.

Dr Panella says: "RES-010 works by reprogramming how cells handle fat and energy

"Rather than reducing appetite, it changes the way in which the body uses fats, boosts the production and activity of mitochondria, the 'batteries' that power cells, and helps convert white fat, which stores energy, into brown fat, which burns it.

"Because it acts on these fundamental pathways, weight regain is less likely.

"RES-010 is pioneering a new class of RNA medicines that reprogram the body's metabolism, with the aim of producing long-lasting weight loss and improved metabolic health by, for example, improving liver health."

The drug is now being given to humans for the first time, in a phase 1 clinical trial in the Netherlands.

The randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, will involve up to 80 participants (including some with overweight or obesity) and assess the safety and side-effects of various doses. The first participants were treated in November 2024 and the initial results are expected at the beginning of 2026.

A novel targeted radiation approach for a rare form of malignant tumor-the solitary fibrous tumor (SFT)-has shown significant success, achieving a near-complete response in three patients. The therapy significantly reduced cancer activity and provided symptom relief, underscoring its potential as a viable treatment option. This research was published in the September issue of The Journal of Nuclear Medicine.

SFT is a rare type of soft tissue tumor with few treatment options available. Although most SFTs are classified as benign with minimal risk of recurrence, about 15 to 20 percent are malignant, and those considered benign have the potential for malignant transformation. For patients with malignant disease, treatment options are scarce, and outcomes are often poor.

In several sarcomas, particularly SFT, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is highly expressed on the surface of tumor cells and surrounding fibroblasts. We sought to deliver radiation therapy directly to the FAP target with the novel radioligand therapy, 90Y-FAPI-46."

Helena Lanzafame, MD, researcher, Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Essen, Germany

The study included three patients who had already tried multiple standard therapies without success. Molecular analysis of their tumor tissues revealed remarkably high levels of the FAP protein, confirmed with advanced FAPI-46 PET imaging. Patients received four cycles of 90Y-FAPI-46 therapy and their treatment response was evaluated with 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT.

Imaging revealed that all patients experienced tumor shrinkage or disease stabilization, as well as significant relief from symptoms, such as severe fatigue and abdominal pain. In addition, no serious side effects were observed among the patients.

"This is the first time we have seen such strong and deep responses in advanced SFT using this precision radiation approach," noted Rainer Hamacher, MD, lead oncologist in the Department of Medical Oncology, Sarcoma Center, West German Cancer Center at University Hospital Essen. "Our findings suggest that screening for FAP expression could help identify patients most likely to benefit from this novel therapy."

The team emphasizes that these are early results from a small number of carefully selected patients. Larger prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm the therapy s safety and effectiveness, and to understand how best to integrate it into existing treatment strategies.

Getting out of bed in the morning without the risk of passing out is a game-changer for 32-year-old Cody Krebs.

In 2022 Krebs experienced a severe spinal cord injury (SCI) in a motor vehicle accident. Since that time, Krebs requires the use of a wheelchair. The damage to his spinal cord means his brain can no longer control blood pressure in his body. He was vulnerable to blood pressure drops where he was at risk of losing consciousness, and spikes placing him at risk of a heart attack and stroke. However, an international clinical trial led by teams at the University of Calgary, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), and University of Lausanne (UNIL), in Switzerland, and Sint Maartenskliniek, Radboudumc, in the Netherlands has given him control again. 

"Before the accident, I had no idea how volatile blood pressure can be. Just transferring from my bed to my chair almost knocked me out at times when my blood pressure would drop," says Krebs. "At other times during the day, my blood pressure would spike due to severe nerve pain, causing me to break out in a sweat and experience severe migraines."

Krebs is part of ongoing research at the University of Calgary based on a major discovery to stabilize blood pressure for people with SCI.

In a rare double publication in both Nature and Nature Medicine, a pair of landmark studies by Dr. Aaron Phillips, PhD, UCalgary, Dr. Grégoire Courtine, PhD, EPFL, and Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, MD, UNIL, describe the development of a targeted therapy to address blood pressure regulation in 14 participants across four clinical studies conducted at three separate medical centers in Canada, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.

The study participants and Krebs now have an implantable system on their spine consisting of a new class of electrode arrays. These arrays connect to a purpose-built pulse generator-similar to a cardiac pacemaker-that delivers finely tuned electrical stimulation, calibrated to each person's needs. The result is a compact, adaptable system capable of restoring blood pressure stability through targeted neuromodulation that can be controlled through an app.

Our mechanistic discoveries in Nature were crucial in bridging the gap from foundational neuronal mapping to clinical application. This synergy is what allowed us to move so quickly from theory to therapy. The Nature Medicine study demonstrates several important factors. First, we show that low blood pressure after a spinal cord injury has serious medical consequences that must not be clinically ignored. Second, we show that our neuromodulation therapy for blood pressure instability after SCI can be deployed effectively in diverse clinical settings, at several centers in different countries with different medical protocols."

Dr. Aaron Phillips, PhD, director of the RESTORE Network and associate professor at the Cumming School of Medicine

Phillips adds the Nature paper also showed that long-term use of the therapy treats not only the low blood pressure occurring after SCI but also prevents the development of life-threatening spikes in blood pressure.

"In the Nature study we were able to identify the entire neuronal architecture of the spinal cord that is responsible for uncontrolled, life-threatening elevations of blood pressure, called autonomic dysreflexia. We also showed that spinal cord stimulation can compete with this neuronal architecture to safely and precisely regulate blood pressure," says Courtine, director of NeuroRestore Center and professor at EPFL.

The results were consistent in study participants across all sites: once activated, the system restored blood pressure to a functional range, often within minutes.

"Based on our experiences with this novel treatment, participants report experiencing less brain fog, having more energy, being able to speak louder, and suffering less from a postprandial dip. In addition, once the surgery was performed by neurosurgeon Erkan Kurt at Radboudumc, this system proved relatively easy to use in their home environment," says Dr. Ilse van Nes, MD, PhD, who successfully deployed the system at the rehabilitation center Sint Maartenskliniek in Nijmegen, Netherlands.

"The international deployment shows that the surgery and therapy are safe and effective regardless of local practices. It's a key milestone toward making this technology widely available," says Bloch, neurosurgeon at Lausanne University Hospital.

While much of the focus in SCI care has been on restoring movement, a majority of patients live with chronic hypotension, a condition that leaves them exhausted, cognitively dulled, prone to fainting, and predisposes to cardiovascular disease over the long-term.

"The implanted devices have a robust safety profile, as they are commonly implanted in the treatment of various pain disorders," says Dr. Fady Girgis, MD, neurosurgeon at the Foothills Medical Centre. "Therefore, it's an easy transition to implant them for this novel indication. We've seen very impressive and immediate improvements in blood pressure that are evident as soon as the device is turned on intra-operatively."

Krebs says he's proud to be in a clinical trial advancing discoveries in this field. "It feels good to be able to boost my blood pressure when I need to, I have more energy and am thinking more clearly. Also, there are fewer dangerous spikes in my blood pressure. I am very grateful for all the research being done."

The implantable neurostimulation system evaluated in these studies was developed by ONWARD Medical. ONWARD Medical has recently received FDA approval to initiate a pivotal trial of this therapy, which is expected to involve approximately 20 leading neurorehabilitation and neurosurgical research centers across Canada, Europe and the United States.

A study led by UC San Francisco and UC Davis has concluded that radiation from medical imaging is associated with a higher risk of blood cancers in children.

The researchers examined data from nearly 4 million children and estimated that 1 in 10 blood cancers - some 3,000 cancers in all - may be attributable to radiation exposure from medical imaging. The risk increased proportionally based on the cumulative amount of radiation the children received.

The study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), appears Sept. 17 in The New England Journal of Medicine. 

The investigation is the first comprehensive assessment using data from children and adolescents in North America that quantifies the association between radiation exposure from medical imaging and blood and bone marrow cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, which are the most common forms of cancer in children and adolescents.

Medical imaging saves lives by enabling timely diagnosis and effective treatment, but it also exposes patients to ionizing radiation, a known carcinogen, particularly through computed tomography (CT). 

The authors caution that doctors and parents should avoid excessive radiation doses and minimize exposure when clinically feasible. 

Children are particularly vulnerable to radiation-induced cancer due to their heightened radiosensitivity and longer life expectancy."

Rebecca Smith-Bindman, MD, a radiologist and professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, as well as Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at UCSF and first author of the paper

"While medical imaging can be lifesaving, our findings underscore the critical need to carefully evaluate and minimize radiation exposure during pediatric imaging to safeguard children's long-term health," said Smith-Bindman, who is also a member of the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies. "This involves ensuring that imaging is performed only when it provides essential information for the child's care and, in cases such as CT scans, using the lowest possible radiation doses."

The study uses a retrospective cohort design, looking back at the complete imaging histories of 3.7 million children who were born between 1996 and 2016. The children were treated at six health care systems in the U.S. and Ontario, Canada. Investigators found a significant relationship between cumulative radiation dose and the risk of a hematologic malignancy, which includes tumors affecting the blood, bone marrow, lymph, and lymphatic system.

The risk of developing cancer varied significantly by imaging modality. CT, which is used to detect many abnormalities such as tumors, heart disease, and injuries of the spinal cord and brain, entails significant radiation exposure. But radiographs, which are used to diagnose both broken bones and pneumonia, expose children to much lower doses.

Among all the forms of medical imaging, the study found that chest radiography was the most common imaging exam that doctors performed. The most common form of CT was of the head and brain. 

For children who underwent a head CT, the researchers attributed about a quarter of the children's subsequent hematologic malignancies to radiation exposure. For those who had radiographs, by contrast, they estimated that only a small fraction of the children's subsequent cancers were associated with radiation exposure.

Getting one or two head CTs was associated with a 1.8-fold increased risk of a cancer diagnosis, and this rose to 3.5 times for children who received more scans and were therefore exposed to more radiation.

Altogether, 2,961 hematologic malignancies were diagnosed during the study period. Lymphoid malignancies accounted for 79.3%, while myeloid malignancies and acute leukemia together accounted for 15.5%. About 58% of cancers occurred in males, and about half were diagnosed in children under 5.

The authors said that up to 10% of hematologic malignancies in children and adolescents could be prevented by reducing unnecessary imaging and optimizing radiation doses. In many cases, the authors said, substituting non-ionizing imaging modalities like ultrasound or MRI may be feasible without compromising diagnostic accuracy. 

The authors emphasized that while medical imaging remains an invaluable tool in pediatric care, their findings highlight the need to carefully balance its diagnostic benefits with potential long-term risks. 

"This study provides robust, directly observed evidence of a clear dose-response relationship between radiation from medical imaging and hematologic malignancy risk in children and adolescents," said Diana Miglioretti, PhD, UC Davis Health professor and chief of the Division of Biostatistics. 

"Our findings align with international research highlighting that children are especially radiosensitive," Miglioretti added. "It's crucial for clinicians to weigh the immediate benefits of imaging against potential long-term health risks and to optimize imaging protocols to minimize radiation exposure."

A Swedish-led research team at Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital has shown in a new randomized clinical trial that a low dose of the well-known medicine aspirin halves the risk of recurrence after surgery in patients with colon and rectal cancer with a certain type of genetic alteration in the tumor.

Every year, nearly two million people worldwide are diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Between 20 and 40 percent develop metastases, which makes the disease both more difficult to treat and more deadly.

Previous observational studies have suggested that aspirin may reduce the risk of certain cancers and possibly also the risk of recurrence after surgery in patients with colorectal cancer harboring mutations in genes within the PIK3 signaling pathway.

These genes regulate key cellular processes such as growth and division. When mutated, these processes can become dysregulated, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer development. However, prior findings have been inconsistent and no randomized clinical trials had previously confirmed the association. To address this gap, the ALASCCA trial was initiated and has now been published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The current study included more than 3,500 patients with colon and rectal cancer from 33 hospitals in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. Patients whose tumors showed a specific genetic mutation in the PIK3 signaling pathway-a mutation found in approximately 40 percent of patients-were randomized to receive either 160 mg of aspirin daily or a placebo for three years after surgery.

For patients with the genetic mutation in PIK3, the risk of recurrence was reduced by 55 percent in those who received aspirin compared with the placebo group.

"Aspirin is being tested here in a completely new context as a precision medicine treatment. This is a clear example of how we can use genetic information to personalize treatment and at the same time save both resources and suffering," says first author Anna Martling, professor at the Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, and senior consultant surgeon at Karolinska University Hospital.

So how does aspirin reduce the risk of recurrence of colon and rectal cancer? The researchers believe that the effect is likely due to aspirin acting through several parallel mechanisms – it reduces inflammation, inhibits platelet function and tumor growth. This combination makes the environment less favorable for cancer.

Although we do not yet fully understand all the molecular links, the findings strongly support the biological rationale and suggest that the treatment may be particularly effective in genetically defined subgroups of patients."

Anna Martling, Professor, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet

The researchers believe that the results could have global significance and influence treatment guidelines for colon and rectal cancer worldwide. Anna Martling sees the fact that the drug is well established as a major advantage.

"Aspirin is a drug that is readily available globally and extremely inexpensive compared to many modern cancer drugs, which is very positive," says Anna Martling.

The study was funded in part by the Swedish Research Council and the Swedish Cancer Society.

New research presented today at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress 2025 reveals that people with psoriasis face a significantly increased risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss.

Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease with multiple comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This study is among the largest to date investigating whether psoriasis also predisposes individuals to AMD, an eye disease affecting millions worldwide.

Dr. Alison Treichel and her team conducted a 15-year retrospective cohort study using data from the US TriNetX collaborative network. The study included 22,901 patients over the age of 55 with psoriasis and compared their outcomes with three propensity-matched control groups: individuals with melanocytic nevi (MN) to represent other dermatology patients; patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) to account for chronic disease and healthcare use; and patients who had undergone an ophthalmologic exam to ensure comparable opportunities for AMD diagnosis. Individuals with a prior diagnosis of AMD were excluded.

In a separate analysis, psoriasis patients treated with biologics were compared to those treated with topical corticosteroids who had not received biologics before or during the follow-up period.

Over the 10-year follow up period, people with psoriasis had a higher likelihood of developing AMD compared with patients in the MDD and MN cohorts, with a 56% and 21% increased risk, respectively. Looking at the two main forms of AMD – exudative (wet) and non-exudative (dry) – psoriasis was associated with a 40% and 13% higher risk, respectively, compared with the MDD cohort.

Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disease in which lipid dysregulation contributes to cardiovascular disease. Because abnormal lipid deposition in the retina is a hallmark of age-related macular degeneration, particularly the dry form that causes progressive vision loss, it is biologically plausible that psoriasis could increase AMD risk. Our study is the first to demonstrate a novel association between psoriasis and non-exudative (dry) AMD and serves as a hypothesis generating observation for future studies"

Dr. Alison Treichel

Notably, psoriasis patients treated with biologic therapies had a 27% lower risk of developing AMD compared with biologic-naïve patients treated with topical corticosteroids only.

"Our findings support a connection between psoriasis and AMD, both exudative and non-exudative, which could be mediated by shared lipid dysregulation," Dr. Treichel explained. "They also suggest that biologic therapies could offer protective benefits beyond skin symptoms. Further research is needed to determine whether these treatments have a true disease-modifying effect and to better understand the role of shared risk factors, including smoking, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and access to specialist care."

Dr. Treichel emphasised that individuals with psoriasis should remain vigilant. "Patients with psoriasis should continue to follow standard eye exam guidelines and promptly report any changes in their vision to their healthcare providers. More research is needed before specific screening recommendations can be made."

Looking ahead, the research team plans to build on these findings by analysing retinal imaging data from psoriasis patients to better characterise ocular abnormalities, define the prevalence of AMD, and evaluate the long-term effects of biologic therapy on disease progression.

Psoriasis patients treated with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) face a 78% lower risk of death and a 44% lower risk of major cardiovascular events compared to those taking other diabetes or weight-loss medications, new research has shown.

The study – the largest of its kind and presented today at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress 2025 – also found that GLP-1RAs significantly reduced the risk of alcohol abuse by 65% and substance abuse by nearly 50%.

Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition affecting 2-3% of the population, linked not only to visible symptoms but also to higher risks of heart attack, stroke and psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety and increased alcohol or substance use. GLP-1RAs, including semaglutide and liraglutide, are widely used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, this emerging evidence suggests they may also offer important benefits for psoriasis patients..

The international research team retrieved data from a database of over 110 million patients in the United States. Outcomes were compared for over 6,000 psoriasis patients with diabetes or obesity over a two-year period, including 3,048 who were treated with GLP-1RAs and 3,048 who received other anti-diabetic or anti-obesity drugs.

Patients included in the retrospective cohort analysis were over 18 years old, had a confirmed diagnosis of psoriasis requiring systemic therapy, and had received continuous treatment with either a GLP-1RA or an alternative anti-diabetic or anti-obesity medication for at least 24 months. After matching for age, sex, and comorbidities, the benefits of GLP-1RAs were clear and consistent across all sensitivity analyses, using propensity score matching to control for potential confounders.

Our findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists may offer benefits beyond their effects on weight and glucose control, particularly for cardiovascular and psychiatric outcomes in people with psoriasis. We hypothesise that GLP-1 receptor activation may inhibit proinflammatory mediators, which are elevated in people with psoriasis. Additionally, GLP-1 receptors are expressed in parts of the brain involved in mood and the reward system, which could explain the reductions we observed in alcohol and substance use."

Professor Ralf Ludwig, lead author of the study

These benefits appeared especially pronounced in psoriasis patients compared with matched controls, suggesting a possible synergy between systemic inflammation in psoriasis and the mechanisms of GLP-1RAs. Safety outcomes were consistent with those seen in the general population, with no significant increase in adverse effects such as hypoglycemia, nausea, or constipation.

"Given their safety profile and the range of benefits observed, GLP-1RAs could become a preferred treatment for people with psoriasis who also require therapy for diabetes or weight management," Prof. Ludwig furthered.

"Psoriasis management has traditionally focused on controlling skin symptoms, but these findings emphasise the need to consider the wider health risks faced by patients. GLP-1RAs may offer a valuable dual benefit, improving both metabolic control and long-term health outcomes, representing an important step forward in holistic care for people living with psoriasis."

When the Missouri legislature allocated $50 million toward FIFA World Cup 26 efforts in May 2023, the bulk — $42.5 million — was earmarked to help get GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium ready.

With two of five phases now complete, KSHB 41 has obtained documents that detail the money has been spent so far — more than $19.6 million — and what work remains.

During the second phase of the project, which was completed between Chiefs seasons, the club removed 3,000 seats along the visiting sideline and replaced them with modular, removable seating.

RELATED | How seating changes at Arrowhead could make Chiefs games even louder

The changes are necessary to accommodate the wider and perfectly leveled playing surface FIFA requires for next summer's six World Cup games, including two knockout games.

According to invoices submitted for the project, most of the taxpayer money paid out so far went to general contractor Turner Construction, which has received more than $17.1 million through the Sept. 16 batch of receipts.

Populous, a world-renowned Kansas City-based architecture firm, has received more than $1.73 million so far and serves as the construction administrator for renovation.

But that leaves another $23.5 million earmarked for the final three phases.

After the 2025 Chiefs season ends, the temporary seats in place for football season will be taken out again and work will begin on the field, which will impact the schedule once again at Arrowhead.

“The quality of the playing surface is of the highest priority,” Chiefs Executive Vice President of Operations and Events Matt Kenny said. “We'll need enough time to do that, which means no concerts during next summer. … We'll also raise, as opposed to lower (the playing surface), so that crown, as we call it, in the center of the pitch, the football field, will actually go away because you raised the sides.”

Kansas City Stadium — as the unbranded Arrowhead will be known during the World Cup — also has to be stripped of current branding.

“They are required to provide what FIFA calls a clean site,” KC2026 CEO Pam Kramer said. “Any commercial branding that is not a FIFA commercial partner will need to be covered for the World Cup inside the stadium, so they (the Chiefs) are working with FIFA right now on those — understanding and developing the clean-site look, and what the details of that will be.”

It's a huge undertaking.

“FIFA and their subcontractors will come in and do a number of things related to media, broadcasting, signage and things of that nature,” Kenny said.

Kramer added, “How much signage is at Arrowhead, right? It's just one of the requirements that FIFA has for all host cities — not just Arrowhead, but all host cities — in delivering that stadium.”

After the final World Cup match in Kansas City, a quarterfinal on July 11, the Chiefs must revert all the branding, re-install the modular seats and restore the crown, or midfield hump that assists with drainage, before another NFL season gets rolling.

“That's a tight window for all the activity, because not not only do I have to prepare the pitch, you have to sort of unravel all of the FIFA elements that come through, but we're working with them and their subcontractors on that schedule,” Kenny said.

FIFA is aware that the Chiefs and other NFL teams need to be able to host preseason games within a few weeks of the soccer tournament ending.

“We'll hit the mark,” Kenny said.

The final phase of taxpayer-funded construction comes after the 2026 season, when the Chiefs remove the modular seats again and rebuild permanent concrete seating all over again.

KC2026, the nonprofit formed to deliver on the contractual obligations between the city and FIFA, received the other $7.5 million from the state legislature's allocation two and a half years ago.

PSG Reaffirms Dominance in Ligue 1 Ahead of Clásico Against Marseille


Paris Saint-Germain has returned to the top of the Ligue 1 table, once again confirming its supremacy in French football. The reigning champions are not only defending their domestic crown but also cemented their status as the latest UEFA Champions League winners, joining Olympique de Marseille as the only French clubs to conquer Europe's most prestigious trophy.





In the last French Clásico, played in March 2025, PSG defeated Marseille 3-1 at the Parc des Princes. That victory not only widened the gap between the two teams but also reinforced Paris' hegemony in the modern era, driven by young stars and a dynamic playing style. Months later, the club lifted the Champions League trophy.


PSG vs. Marseille: A Clash Steeped in History and Pride


This Sunday, September 21, PSG will face Marseille again in one of the most anticipated matches of the season. The last time Marseille managed to come out on top was in February 2023 in the Coupe de France. Can they repeat the feat now in Ligue 1?

The PSG vs. Marseille Clásico is more than just a football match: it's a rivalry that pits the North against the South, Paris' elite against Marseille's working class, with national pride and prestige on the line.

Where to Watch the PSG vs. Marseille Clásico

Every French Clásico is unforgettable, and this one will be no exception. The PSG vs. Olympique de Marseille match can be watched live this Sunday, September 21, at 2:45 PM ET / 11:45 AM PT on beIN Sports and beIN Sports en Español.

Spain and Lamine Yamal took top spot from Argentina and Lionel Messi in the FIFA men's rankings published on Thursday, and lead for the first time since being dethroned as world champion in June 2014.

Spain's two-win start to a 2026 World Cup qualifying group this month — against Turkey and Bulgaria — lifted the European champion up from second place behind 2022 World Cup winner Argentina, which fell to third.

Argentina's loss in a World Cup qualifier in Ecuador also let France rise one place to No. 2.

England stayed at No. 4, and Portugal climbed one place to No. 5 in a swap with Brazil, which lost a game at Bolivia.

Morocco at No. 11 was the best of the African nations and Japan led Asia at No. 19. Both have already qualified for the World Cup.

Mexico and the United States were Nos. 14 and 16 respectively as the World Cup co-hosts both fell one place. Canada, the third co-host next year, rose two to No. 26.

The rankings are updated in October and again in November when the standings are more significant.

The November rankings should decide seedings for the 48-team World Cup tournament draw being held on Dec. 5 in Washington, plus draws for playoffs in Europe and the intercontinental brackets. Those games are scheduled in March.

The World Cup draw will have 42 confirmed entries and six placeholders for the eventual playoff winners. Those placeholders all must come from the lowest-ranked teams in seeding pot 4 and could include Italy.

Spain have reportedly threatened to boycott the 2026 World Cup if Israel qualify. After a United Nations commission of inquiry stated that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza this week, Spanish government officials say they will "assess" the situation if Ran Ben-Shimon's team make it to next year's tournament in North America.

Chelsea suffered defeat in their opening Champions League game of the season to Bayern Munich, and one of their rivals from the recent Club World Cup success were keen to add to the misery.

The Blues lost 3-1 in Germany despite Cole Palmer's brilliance, and will now have to look forward to a showdown with Jose Mourinho as their first chance to pick up three points in Europe this season.

It was a display filled with uncharacteristic errors from some of Chelsea's key men, after Enzo Maresca named a very similar side to the one who faced PSG in the Club World Cup final.

There was criticism sent the way of Enzo Fernandez for his display, with Blues supporters calling for Andrey Santos to start against Manchester United.

Despite replicating the system that had decimated PSG in the Club World Cup, there was no luck for Chelsea this time around.

During that competition, the Blues didn't make many friends, and actually formed a bit of an online rivalry  with Flamengo, after their fiercely-contested group stage game.

That one ended 3-1 to the Brazilians, something their official Twitter account made sure they reminded Chelsea of after their defeat by the same scoreline on Wednesday night.

We've seen that one before 👀 https://t.co/2TNXqSzFYq

While Flamengo won the original battle with the Blues, Chelsea very much won the war as they shot back at the Brazilian side after they exited the competition.

Flamengo were the only side to beat Chelsea during the Club World Cup, however the game was overshadowed by a very brief cameo in the second half.

Nicolas Jackson was subbed on during the game, however minutes later was sent off for the second time in four appearances for the Blues.

This proved to be the last meaningful impact he had in a Chelsea shirt before being loaned out to Wednesday's opposition, Bayern.

Despite there being no obligation in the loan to Germany, it looks as if his time at Stamford Bridge has now come to an end.

Atletico Madrid and UEFA will reportedly launch an investigation into the heated clashes that overshadowed Liverpool's 3-2 Champions League win at Anfield. Atletico boss Diego Simeone was shown a red card following a heated exchange with a Reds fan on Wednesday night after Virgil van Dijk's late winner. Now, a probe will look into an Atletico employee appearing to spit into the crowd.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (Sept. 17, 2025) – Alright, alright, alright.

It might seem trite to quote actor, renowned Texan and Austin FC minority owner Matthew McConaughey when his club comes out on top, but the latest result for the Major League Soccer side was more than a win.

This win was historic.

Austin FC edged out Minnesota United FC 2-1 in dramatic fashion in the Semifinal of the 2025 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup at MNUFC's home stadium of Allianz Field in St. Paul on Wednesday night with a remarkable game-winning goal in the 120th minute.

And the implications for the expansion club that entered MLS in 2021 are more than just alright. The victory continues the longest Open Cup run in Austin FC's five-year history and means Los Verdes will host the tournament's Final in two weeks on Oct. 1.

“It's a special moment,” said Austin FC head coach Nico Estévez. “[It means] everything. For everyone that works for the club – for every player, every staff member, the fans, all the families – it's an important moment for the history of the club.”The goal that made all that possible arrived at the very death of an intense match that was level at 1-1 for nearly an hour. With both teams briefly finding flashes in 30 minutes of extra time, a penalty kick shootout felt inevitable to determine which of the MLS Western Conference clubs would advance to the Final of this country's most historic competition.

Then, Austin FC saw a glimmer of promise. As the seconds ticked down, Los Verdes moved deep into the attacking third. Midfielder Jon Gallagher brought a ball down with his chest then, on a bounce, he lifted a cross into the box. Myrto Uzuni's initial header on the other end was brisk and forced Minnesota goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair to make an instinctive block. But the Minnesota defenders didn't account for the short rebound – nor CJ Fodrey lingering nearby inside the six-yard box, primed and ready to play the role of unlikely hero. Fodrey handled the rebound with a measured kick and slammed a shot into the back of the net.

The finish at the 119:51 mark was the latest goal in Austin FC history. And it's not the only game-winner that Fodrey has scored in his budding career. On Sept. 7, the 21-year-old forward decided another Austin match when he flicked in a header from an Owen Wolff corner kick. That day, Austin FC defeated Sporting Kansas City in MLS play, also 2-1.

In the span of just 10 days, Fodrey scored his first MLS goal and his first Open Cup goal.

“He's a great, great kid,” said Coach Estévez. “He works hard. He wants to improve. He wants to get better. He has that physicality, that speed. He also has the willingness to run into the box, to have a presence in the box and to score goals. He's been working really hard the whole year, and now every day of training is paying off for him.”

The date with Nashville SC on Oct. 1 will be the first major final for Austin FC. Since joining MLS five years ago, the club has not had many chances to compete for trophies. Three out of four times, the Austin side has failed to reach the MLS Cup Playoffs. Last season, they missed out on a Wild Card spot, finishing 10th in the Western Conference with an 11-14-9 record. The year before that, El Tree finished 12th.

“We're a very young team. Lately, we haven't had these experiences,” Estévez said. “We're coming from a difficult season also with ups and downs. To have the opportunity to play a final this year is huge.”

The group is determined to write a different story in 2025. Austin FC is steadily climbing the MLS standings. They entered Wednesday's contest ranked No. 7 in the conference, five spots below Minnesota at No. 2. Entering the final month of MLS' regular season, Austin has already equaled the club's win total from a year ago and will have a chance to stay competitive for a playoff spot down the stretch heading into Decision Day.

Before that, the club has a chance to win some silverware on home turf. The Semifinal win secured home field advantage over fellow Final Four winner Nashville SC, who took care of business against Philadelphia Union on Sept. 16.

As Austin looks to stymie Nashville's lethal goal scorer and MLS Golden Boot leader Sam Surridge, the club will do so in front of the Verde & Black faithful at Q2 Stadium.

While the Semifinal win is a special moment worth celebrating, it's not all fun and games for the Austin FC players. As goalkeeper Brad Stuver, a hero through this rare U.S. Open Cup Final run, reiterated leaving the locker at Allianz Field, there's more history to be made.

“The job is not finished,” he said.

When DAZN first emerged on the broadcasting scene, it was portrayed in some sections of the media as ‘Netflix for Sport'.

The comparisons were understandable. DAZN was hellbent on disrupting the archaic world of legacy pay-TV sports television in the same way that Netflix had done with entertainment by offering more affordable, flexible subscriptions on the viewers' device of choice on a global scale.

DAZN eventually distanced itself from such a characterisation, which ignored the fragmented nature of media rights, local preferences, and the technological challenge of delivering live video to millions of viewers around the world watching on multiple device types via varying quality of connections.

Indeed, DAZN is a very different company from what it was a decade ago. Its original vision and pricing structure has evolved significantly to reflect commercial realities and the need to recoup multibillion-dollar outlays on rights. The modern DAZN no longer sees itself as a pure subscription offering but rather a digital sports platform comprising multiple services of which live video is just a single component.

However, advances in connectivity, changing consumer preferences and huge investments in its infrastructure have enabled DAZN to achieve its goal of digitally transmitting live sport to every corner of the globe.

DAZN's international service comprises various properties such as combat sports, motorsports and women's soccer, along with a range of free ad-supported television (FAST) channels and third-party platforms.

While DAZN's premium, localised services in Germany, Italy and Spain are still primarily subscription driven, the platform now offers a wide range of free content in a bid to monetise users through other means and potentially convert them to paying customers in the future.

However, to date, the majority of DAZN's international portfolio has had regional or niche appeal. Which is why it ostensibly spent US$1 billion to acquire the global rights to the 2025 Fifa Club World Cup and promised to stream it around the world for free.

Many questioned the wisdom of paying so much for an unproven competition which had hitherto struggled to generate interest from fans, sponsors and other media organisations, especially when there would be no subscription revenue and the most attractive matches in some markets would be sublicensed to free-to-air (FTA) broadcasters.

Others pointed out that DAZN's expenditure was offset by an equivalent investment from SURJ Sports Investment, a subsidiary of 2034 Fifa World Cup host Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), shortly after.

However, the company clearly saw a rare opportunity to acquire the global rights to a major soccer tournament that would appeal to virtually every market in the world. With all respect to college football, electric powerboating and LIV Golf, none has the universal appeal of a tournament featuring Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Lionel Messi.

This was reflected in Fifa's official viewing figures, which claim the expanded tournament attracted a global audience of 2.7 billion. While detailed data has not been made public and many viewers watched the competition on linear television, the Club World Cup appears to have been a success for DAZN – and a major test for its infrastructure.

Like any other technology leader, DAZN's chief technology officer Sandeep Tiku would have liked more time to prepare for the tournament than the seven months he was given between the contract signing in December 2024 and the opening ceremony in June 2025.

However, he was confident that the highly capable, globally scalable broadcast and delivery platform he had helped build since joining the company in 2022 would be up to the task.

“Over the last three years we've undergone a massive transformation,” Tiku tells SportsPro. “By design, we've built a global platform. We have hundreds of live events every single weekend and throughout the week, so building, managing and maintaining a platform that can handle these peaks in demand at scale across the world is a challenge [that we've met].”

In many markets, including the UK, the Club World Cup was DAZN's coming out party – the moment where a previously niche service suddenly became as mainstream as it has ever been. The tournament was promoted on the sides of buses, through digital marketing campaigns and through its sublicensing deals.

The build-up to the tournament was spent ensuring DAZN's platform was resilient and reliable enough to handle multiple device and connection types and capable of coping with sudden peaks in demand.

“The Club World Cup was a completely different ball game,” Tiku explains. “We are a premium product so nearly all of our subscribers have a decent internet connection and a [capable] device because they pay a certain amount of dollars each month.

“But we were streaming the Club World Cup for free, so all of a sudden we were receiving huge amounts of traffic from 200 countries around the world, at a similar level to Germany or Japan [where DAZN has a fully-fledged local service].

“You have to acquire millions of these customers in hours or minutes because most people register just before the game they want to watch is starting. We knew that for millions of customers this was the first time they had ever used DAZN so we could not get it wrong,”

A post shared by DAZN Football (@daznfootball)

Despite DAZN's desire to use the Club World Cup as a revenue generation tool, it knew the importance of making a first impression and therefore prioritised a high quality, reliable stream over bells and whistles. 

DAZN streamed all 63 matches of the tournament in multiple languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish, with each match subject to more than 20 regional variants. Pictures were transmitted from stadium to the International Broadcast Centre in New York and sent to the DAZN Match Centre in Dallas, Texas, before they were transmitted around the world via DAZN's regional production facilities.

Tests conducted prior to the tournament with Amazon Web Services (AWS) determined DAZN's infrastructure could support 300 million concurrent users, while the company added multiple CDNs to support resiliency. In some locations, where existing CDNs weren't capable enough, DAZN launched its own.

Intelligent algorithms automatically moved viewers to the most appropriate CDN and disabled app features that might consume too much bandwidth.

“I don't think any other broadcaster has done this in the past,” Tiku says. “It's amazing scale. Millions registered before matches and then millions watched the stream. Our customer service team was sat there largely idle because there were only [a handful] of people requesting support.”

Tiku's arrival from Entain, a betting company, is indicative of the culture shift that has taken place at DAZN over the past few years. In addition to launching in-play betting, the company has partnered with Fanatics on ecommerce, acquired in-app sports ticketing marketplace Daimani, and introduced gamification and community features, encouraging fans to spend more time and money within its ecosystem and become active rather than passive consumers of sports content.

One example of this in action is how boxing fans score fights before the judges' decision is announced.

“DAZN has evolved from a traditional broadcast platform into an interactive sports platform,” Tiku explains. “Our fans are participating, they're interacting with the broadcast and being a part of it.

“We can see from our data that a significant percentage of our viewers watch the stream on the big screen but also use the app for Fanzone chat interactions and quizzes. We put the customer at the centre of the action.”

That's not to say DAZN hasn't invested in its core streaming capabilities – far from it. Paying subscribers to DAZN received an enhanced streaming experience during the Club World Cup, including high dynamic range (HDR) picture quality and Dolby 5.1 surround sound.

However, these technological capabilities and diversity of revenue streams mean the company is becoming less reliant on subscriptions and is less exposed to the volatility of the rights market.

The company still maintains large portfolios of premium rights to support its operations in key local markets, but its new ethos means it is happy having content on its platform regardless of whether it requires a subscription or even if it owns it directly. The key objective is to expand the user base as much as possible and by providing a premium offering alongside wide accessibility, DAZN is catering to multiple demographics.

DAZN has bolstered its free tier with new rights deals and has integrated several third-party DTC services, such as the National Football League's (NFL) Game Pass International and the National Hockey League's (NHL) NHL.TV, into its platform.

These properties receive many of the benefits that the Club World Cup has helped to illustrate – DAZN's global reach, its technological investments and its existing billing relationships. Essentially, DAZN takes away the burden and risk of managing a DTC platform whilst maximising its existing user base and billing relationship to, hopefully, expand the audience.

In exchange, DAZN gets more users in its ecosystem, while both benefit from a service layer of interactive features and revenue generating opportunities. The NFL has been the poster child for this type of relationship, with Game Pass growing by 30 per cent since the partnership started in 2023 and has since been replicated with others.

“We've built a highly scalable global platform which means the more we can do with it, our costs keep on reducing,” Tiku explains. “It's plug and play [for the third-party service].”

Immersive experiences are another area DAZN sees value. For the Club World Cup, it created an extended reality application for the US market, allowing fans to watch all 63 matches in a 3D tabletop format. For the latter stages of the tournament, DAZN offered a 180-degree viewing angle to help fans fully immerse themselves in the action by giving them a sideline perspective.

For Tiku, the product was about demonstrating how its platform can provide an entirely new way of watching sport, adding value for both fans and rights holders, as well as the possibility of creating new forms of content without the need to acquire broadcast rights.

For example, optical tracking data, which is widely captured by goal line technology (GLT) and semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) systems can be used to digitally recreate key moments from matches and power other types of data-rich immersive experience.

“We acquire a lot of content, but in some instances we don't [make an acquisition] because it's expensive,” Tiku says. “[Instead] we can acquire the data rights or get [data] from our partners and visualise it like this. Suddenly, there's this new product that doesn't have a massive cost.

“We still need to wait for industry to evolve from a device perspective but we're ready.”

Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is AI where Tiku sees the most potential. With AI models already used to optimise streaming distribution and customer service, the next step will see DAZN deploy intelligent algorithms to personalise the end user experience.

“We're working on personalisation for acquisition, retention and engagement,” Tiku says. “It's going to be massive. Our AI-enabled product will become so personalised that consumers will feel this product is just for them.”

An example of this is content. Tiku envisages a future where users can give DAZN a prompt, such as knockouts by Anthony Joshua, and the app will create a video in response. This, he says, not only ensures DAZN will be able to adjust to changing fan expectations but also give its content a longer shelf life than just the live broadcast.

“In ten or even five years' time, fans are not going to consume sport in the same way people watch sport today,” he says. “Some prefer shorter formats or TikTok style videos and it's easy to create a format like that, but getting the content in the right order so you binge it is the most important thing.

“AI makes it simple, it becomes an enabler, and this is why we're investing heavily.”

Lionel Messi is close to finalising a new multi-year contract with Inter Miami, with final details left to be agreed upon, according to ESPN.

The Argentina international is believed to be in the final stages of negotiations over a new contract, with the deal expected to be confirmed soon, subject to approval by Major League Soccer.

Messi's future in the United States was the subject of speculation recently, with previous reports linking the former Barcelona star to clubs in Saudi Arabia.

The 38-year-old forward is said to be focused on continuing his career with Miami, with talks now ongoing over extending his two-year stay at the MLS club.

Messi joined Inter Miami from Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer in July 2023, penning a two-and-a-half-year contract that runs until 31 December.

 Messi has made 75 appearances for Inter Miami to date, scoring 62 goals and providing 30 assists, and led the MLS side to two major trophies during his time in the United States.

The 38-year-old propelled Inter Miami to the inaugural Leagues Cup trophy in 2023, finishing as the tournament's best player and top scorer with 10 goals.

He also helped Inter Miami set the league record for most points in a single season last year with 74, and lifted the 2024 Supporters' Shield.

Messi has made 36 appearances for Inter Miami in 2025 so far, scoring 28 goals and providing 12 assists, including one goal at the Club World Cup, helping the MLS side reach the round of 16.

His arrival in Miami in 2023 saw several of his former Barcelona teammates follow him to the US, with Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba also joining.

This summer, Inter Miami made a statement move in the market as well, welcoming Atletico Madrid and Argentina midfielder Rodrigo De Paul on loan with an option to buy.

GIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Messi is Inter Miami's all-time leading scorer with 62 goals in 75 appearances to date.

Messi's new contract will see him extend with Inter Miami beyond the 2026 World Cup, which could be the 38-year-old's last major international tournament.

The Argentina icon has so far given no guarantee that he will captain La Albiceleste in next year's tournament, saying his fitness will likely determine whether he is able to take part.

Ricardo Pepi speaks about returning to PSV's starting XI after their 5-3 win over NEC Nijmegen. (2:09)

The September international window has now concluded, and as such, players from the U.S. men's national team have headed back to their clubs. Now the sprint to hit top form ahead of October's window can begin.

For some players, that means making the most of a change of clubs. For others, it's about solidifying their spots in the starting lineup. Then there are those who are on the outside looking in, trying to do anything they can to get steady playing time.

Regardless of which camp they fall into, the past week has proven eventful for several USMNT players.

Throughout the season, ESPN will be monitoring the progress of the U.S. player pool, delivering insights into those whose form or fitness has made them particularly intriguing. We call it the USMNT's countdown to the World Cup.

ESPN will count down to June 11 every week so that way, when the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise.

Welcome to the USMNT's countdown to the World Cup. Only 267 days to go.

- Carlisle: Zendejas' starring role has come at the right time for USMNT

It was a week of highs and lows for Pepi. On Saturday, he made his long-awaited return to the PSV starting lineup and made the most of his chance, scoring goals either side of halftime -- one with his right foot, another with his head -- to lead PSV to a 5-3 victory over NEC Nijmegen. On Tuesday against Union Saint-Gilloise in the UEFA Champions League, he conceded a penalty in a 3-1 defeat.

In terms of the bigger picture, at least Pepi is now reestablishing himself in the starting XI. That will need to continue given how the competition for the starting forward spot had heated up thanks to Folarin Balogun's performance during the September international window. The coming weeks will be about establishing consistency ahead of the October international window.

2025-26 minutes: 319
2025-26 FotMob rating: 6.9

Much of the buzz at the end of September window was about the performance of Alejandro Zendejas and how his goal against Japan had seen him make a play for more playing time, possibly at the expense of Weah. So what did Weah do? He merely went out and scored against Real Madrid, at the Estadio Bernabeu no less, with his clever run allowing teammate Mason Greenwood to put Weah in the clear and fire home past Thibaut Courtois.

It was Weah's first goal for his new club after arriving from Juventus over the summer, and while OM ultimately fell 2-1, Weah showed he's not going to give up his spot in the USMNT starting lineup without a fight.

Reyna made his official debut for Gladbach last weekend. For the team, it was a match to forget, as Werder Bremen handed the Foals a heavy 4-0 home defeat, one that cost manager Gerardo Seoane his job. For Reyna personally, his 74-minute stint had some positive vibes to it.

While he completed only 21 of 31 passes, he was involved in Gladbach's best moves and should have had an assist when he created an opening for Robin Hack, who missed the target from 12 yards. Reyna even had a team-high seven ball recoveries. Reyna will no doubt have preferred a better team performance, but for him it's a start, one that he'll be hoping to build on, even with a new manager in charge.

Among the storylines emerging from the international window for the USMNT was the deployment of the three-man backline. It's a formation that suits the personnel in a lot of ways.

Defensively, it provides a bit more cover for outside backs Sergiño Dest and Max Arfsten, the better for them to play to their strengths in the attacking half. There's less space for Ream to have to cover. Who takes the third center back spot is a coin flip at the moment between Mark McKenzie and Cameron Carter-Vickers. Do you take the player who plays in a top-five league, even though his form has faded a bit in recent weeks, or a player on the dominant team in Scotland? I'll go with McKenzie for now, given his ceiling is higher.

As such, this week's in-form XI uses that formation.

Arfsten's inclusion is down to two factors. One, he excelled in that role during the September window, assisting on Zendejas' goal, and he plays in that position for his club, the Columbus Crew. The other is that Antonee Robinson continues to be brought along slowly at Fulham. He was an unused substitute in last weekend's 1-0 win over Leeds United. There's little doubt that Robinson will reclaim his spot once his fitness improves. He certainly has the attacking chops in terms of delivery from the wing to excel as a wingback. Until then, though, Arfsten gets the nod.

The goalkeeper position continues to bear watching. Matt Turner's form has dipped a bit -- his goals prevented per 90 minutes has sunk to -0.2 -- following the New Club Bounce that occurred upon his return to the New England Revolution. And given Matt Freese's solid showing during the recent international window, as well as with New York City FC, he's in this week's in-form XI.

Probably the biggest question mark is who plays alongside Tyler Adams in the center of midfield. You can count Johnny Cardoso, Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris and Cristian Roldan among the candidates. Tessmann is getting the most playing time in a top-five league, so he keeps his place for now.

ESPN's USMNT Big Board 2.0 went live earlier this month, and each Big Board will provide the foundation for weekly player updates. Below are the minutes and player ratings for each of those 37 players.

Matt Turner, goalkeeper, New England Revolution: 540 minutes in 2025; 7.0 FotMob rating in 2025.

Matt Freese, goalkeeper, New York City FC: 2,520 minutes in 2025; 7.1 FotMob rating in 2025.

Zack Steffen, goalkeeper, Colorado Rapids: 2,070 minutes in 2025; 7.0 FotMob rating in 2025.

Patrick Schulte, goalkeeper, Columbus Crew: 2,250 minutes in 2025; 6.8 FotMob rating in 2025.

Chris Richards, center back, Crystal Palace: 569 minutes in 2025-26; 7.2 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Tim Ream, center back, Charlotte FC: 2,072 minutes in 2025; 6.6 FotMob rating in 2025.

Ream continues to turn back the clock with his performances for Charlotte. The Crown have won nine games in a row, conceding just four goals in that time, with Ream completing 93.1% of his passes and winning 60% of his duels in that span.

Mark McKenzie, center back, Toulouse: 360 minutes in 2025-26; 6.7 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Cameron Carter-Vickers, center back, Celtic: 570 minutes in 2025-26; 7.7 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Miles Robinson, center back, FC Cincinnati: 2,348 minutes in 2025; 6.9 FotMob rating in 2025.

Auston Trusty, center back, Celtic: 152 minutes in 2025-26; 6.4 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Tristan Blackmon, center back, Vancouver Whitecaps: 2,880 minutes in 2025; 7.2 FotMob rating in 2025.

Sergiño Dest, fullback, PSV Eindhoven: 622 minutes in 2025-26; 7.7 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Antonee Robinson, fullback, Fulham: 51 minutes in 2025-26; 6.2 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Joe Scally, fullback, Borussia Mönchengladbach: 265 minutes in 2025-26; 7.2 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Caleb Wiley, fullback, Watford: 0 minutes in 2025-26; 0.0 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

The on-loan Chelsea defender has reportedly been dealing with back and adductor injuries, but returned to partial training last week. The hope is that he can return to first-team action with Watford soon.

Max Arfsten, fullback, Columbus Crew: 2,502 minutes in 2025; 7.5 FotMob rating in 2025.

Alex Freeman, fullback, Orlando City SC: 2,712 minutes in 2025; 7.5 FotMob rating in 2025.

Tyler Adams, midfielder, AFC Bournemouth: 374 minutes in 2025-26; 7.0 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Weston McKennie, midfielder, Juventus: 141 minutes in 2025-26; 6.7 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Count McKennie as the latest USMNT player to log minutes as a wingback, joining the likes of Musah and Weah who have been deployed in that spot recently. It's not McKennie's preferred position, but it just might be the path forward for him to not only get consistent playing time with Juve, but also secure a call-up in October with the USMNT.

Johnny Cardoso, midfielder, Atlético Madrid: 185 minutes in 2025-26; 6.8 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Luca de la Torre, midfielder, San Diego FC: 2,237 minutes in 2025; 6.8 FotMob rating in 2025.

Tanner Tessmann, midfielder, Lyon: 360 minutes in 2025-26; 7.3 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Yunus Musah, midfielder, Atalanta: 203 minutes in 2025-26; 6.3 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Following Musah's late move to Atalanta, he made his debut in a 4-1 win over Lecce, not only logging 14 minutes, but also doing so in his preferred central midfield role. He went 75 minutes in the 4-0 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday.

Frank Leboeuf praises PSG's performance vs. Atalanta after an emphatic 4-0 win in the Champions League.

Sebastian Berhalter, midfielder, Vancouver Whitecaps: 2,650 minutes in 2025; 7.5 FotMob rating in 2025.

Cristian Roldan, midfielder, Seattle Sounders FC: 3,335 minutes in 2025; 7.5 FotMob rating in 2025.

Christian Pulisic, attacker, AC Milan: 194 minutes in 2025-26; 7.6 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Tim Weah, attacker, Marseille: 319 minutes in 2025-26; 6.9 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Malik Tillman, attacker, Bayer Leverkusen: 123 minutes in 2025-26; 7.4 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Diego Luna, attacker, Real Salt Lake: 2,167 minutes in 2025; 7.2 FotMob rating in 2025.

Alejandro Zendejas, attacker, América: 641 minutes in 2025-26; 7.3 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Giovanni Reyna, attacker, Borussia Mönchengladbach: 74 minutes in 2025-26; 7.0 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Folarin Balogun, forward, AS Monaco: 243 minutes in 2025-26; 7.2 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Ricardo Pepi, forward, PSV Eindhoven: 216 minutes in 2025-26; 7.2 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Josh Sargent, forward, Norwich City: 491 minutes in 2025-26; 7.7 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Patrick Agyemang, forward, Derby County: 21 minutes in 2025-26; 7.0 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Haji Wright, forward, Coventry City: 456 minutes in 2025-26; 7.7 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Wright's late equalizer against Norwich City didn't necessarily dazzle the eye, but his tap-in from two yards earned the Sky Blues a point, and saw the U.S. forward join Sargent atop the goal-scoring charts in the English Championship.

Damion Downs, forward, Southampton: 170 minutes in 2025-26; 6.4 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

FIFA have made a major announcement regarding Spain after the country threatened to boycott the World Cup in 2026.

The global governing body today released the updated world rankings for the men's national teams, with Spain rising to the top spot.

Luis de la Fuente's side impressed in recent World Cup qualifiers, beating Bulgaria, before thrashing Turkey 6-0. The EURO 2024 winners have been awarded with the recognition of currently being the best team in the world.

Argentina, who previously held the top sport, dropped to third following a recent defeat to Ecuador. Despite the setback, the World Cup winners have dominated South American qualifying, as they prepare for Lionel Messi's final international tournament next summer.

Advert

France have also climbed the rankings, moving from third to second and Didier Deschamps' side will once again be among the favourites for the tournament. England, who boast a perfect qualifying record after five games, remain the fourth in the rankings.

Spanish government officials warned they would pull out of next summer's World Cup if Israel qualify for the tournament.

Advert

Israel are currently third in their group with nine points from five games, behind Norway and Italy. With trips to both Norway and Italy in October, they still may finish second and potentially secure a play-off spot depending on results.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called for Israel to be excluded from sporting competitions.

He said: "Israel cannot continue to use any international platform to whitewash its image."

A recent UN commission of inquiry said there are grounds to believe that four of five genocidal acts under international law, have been carried out by Israel in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry responded by rejecting the report, describing it as 'distorted and false'.

Advert

More than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Many within the sporting world have called for Israel to face a ban from international football, in a similar manner to Russia.Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, both UEFA and FIFA suspended the national team and Russian clubs from competitions.

Advert

Russia appealed against the ban, but it was dismissed.

Their last appearance at a global competition was the 2018 World Cup, as they were barred from the 2022 World Cup and next summer's tournament. UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin has spoken about the ongoing ban, expressing sympathy for the athletes.

He said: "The ban for Russian teams is, I think, three and a half years. Did the war stop? It didn't. So for now, I don't know.

"I have to say that with the situation in Russia and Ukraine, there was a super strong political pressure.

"Now it's more a pressure of the civil society than politicians, because politicians are obviously, when it comes to wars and victims, very pragmatic.

"I cannot say what will happen. There are talks about everything, but me personally, I'm against kicking the athletes out."

FIFA has 211 participating nations in qualifiers, outside of Eritrea and Russia, which have been suspended since 2022 from international play. 

“This new approach means that any club that releases a player for a FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier will now be directly compensated,” FIFA said in a statement.

The $355 million allocation comes from a previous agreement with the European Club Association for the tournament, to be hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada. 

In the 2022 World Cup, the payout was $209 million, with Manchester City receiving the highest amount any at $4.6 million.

MLS received a payout of $7.2 million, which was spread out between 25 clubs. C.F. Montreal received a league-high payment of $1.04 million, with the Seattle Sounders next at $826,757. D.C. United received the lowest payment among MLS clubs at $31,000. The rounded per-day amount for players in the league was $10,900 - regardless of actual playing time. 

FIFA said 440 clubs across 51 member countries got payments from the 2022 structure.

FIFA earned a record $7.5 billion in revenue from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, a significant increase from previous tournaments. The tournament was the most profitable in FIFA's history, generating $1 billion more than the preceding World Cup cycle. 

Qualified World Cup teams will find out group stage assignments during the draw on Dec. 5 in Washington, D.C.

The Spanish National Team has today become the first in a decade to top the FIFA World Rankings in both the men's and women's game.

Not since 2015 has one country held the number one position in the senior men's and women's game. The respective Spanish national teams have both assumed pole position in the charts following the release of the latest charts.

The women's national team are the current world champions and holders of the UEFA Women's Nations League. This summer, they also reached the final of the UEFA Women's Euro but lost out to reigning European champions England in a dramatic penalty shoot-out.

Nonetheless, they remained unbeaten throughout the tournament in regulation time and these results, coupled with them finishing above England in the latest edition of the Nations League group stage, were sufficient for them to overhaul the reigning Olympic champions, the United States, at the top of the women's world rankings.

The Spanish men's team are the reigning European champions. Last summer, they became the first team in the competition's history to win seven successive matches at a single tournament as they swept aside three former world champions - Germany, France and England - to win a record-breaking fourth title in Berlin's Olympiastadion.

Those matches are part of a 27-match unbeaten streak under head coach Luis de la Fuente. Their last two results this month - emphatic World Cup qualification victories away to Bulgaria (0-3) and Turkey (0-6) - ensured they accumulated enough points to claim top spot in the men's world rankings ahead of the World champions, Argentina.

It is the first time that the Spanish men's team have topped the FIFA World Rankings since June 2014 when they were reigning world and double European champions at the end of a glittering six years of unprecedented success. However, they flopped in their defence of the FIFA World Cup that summer, going out after losing their first two games in Brazil.

The 2014 FIFA World Cup was eventually won by Germany, who claimed top spot from Spain in July went into 2015 as the number one ranked team in the men's game. There they were joined in December 2014 by the German women's team who had won the 2003 and 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup and six successive UEFA Women's Euro titles going back to 1997.

Before Spain, Germany were the first and only nation to previously hold the number one position in the men's and women's FIFA World Rankings. The only other two countries to top the FIFA Women's World Rankings since it was introduced in 2003 are the United States and Sweden, neither of whom have ever led the men's world rankings.

The Spanish men's team will aim to win a second world title next year in the United States and also chase their own national record of 35 unbeaten matches set between November 2006 and June 2009. They are also in sight of the men's world record of Italy who went undefeated for 37 games between October 2018 and September 2021.

Despite regaining their number one world ranking in August, the Spanish federation sacked their women's team head coach Montse Tomé immediately after the UEFA women's Euro. Unbeaten in their last eleven matches since losing to England at Wembley, they have set their sights on retaining their UEFA Women's Nations League title this winter. In the final four, they will play a two leg tie against Sweden in October with the winners due to take on either France or Germany in the final.

Following the convincing 3-1 win against Chelsea, the media has been full of praise for FC Bayern. fcbayern.com provides an overview of the press coverage from Germany and around the world.lt.

Süddeutsche Zeitung: "FC Bayern beat Club World Cup winners Chelsea 3-1 in their Champions League opener, comfortably dominating their opponents at times. The Munich side didn't even lose control when half of their defence had to be replaced."

Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: "The Munich side continue their winning run with a well-deserved 3-1 win over Club World Cup winners Chelsea. The German league leaders dominated the Londoners – all the goalscorers in Munich were English."

SportBild: "Tough test successfully passed! FC Bayern kick off their Champions league campaign with a 3-1 win against Chelsea to extend their remarkable winning streak. The Munich side haven't lost an opening match in Europe's premier club competition since 2002."

kicker: "Kane's brace leads Bayern to a prestigious victory: It was a deserved win and a very mature performance from this side, who refused to allow themselves to be rattled by Chelsea. FC Bayern have made an impressive return to Europe's elite."

Sport1: "Curious at first, then Harry Kane! FC Bayern laid down a marker at the start of the Champions League against Club World Cup winners Chelsea."

Der Spiegel: "Bayern send a strong message to Europe. FC Bayern and their fans had a great time against Chelsea. There's currently no end in sight to their excellent early form."

Daily Mirror (UK): "The England captain scored Bayern Munich's second and third goals in Munich to get the Germans off to a perfect start to the Champions League. Chelsea, on the other hand, will be scratching their heads despite some positive moments at the Allianz Arena."

BBC (UK): “The Blues were ultimately out-thought by a more streetwise and experienced Bayern side, who have won their opening Champions League match for the 22nd season in a row.“

The Sun (UK): "The ‘World Champions' were given a lesson on the stage that really matters as Harry Kane's double helped Bayern Munich brush them aside."

The Guardian (UK): "Bayern had Harry Kane ready to remind Premier League opposition of his ruthlessness in front of goal. Bayern simply had too much nous."

Here's what Bayern had to say about the match against Chelsea:

L‘Équipe (France): "On Wednesday evening, Bayern Munich held their nerve at the Allianz Arena and defeated the newly crowned 'World Champions' Chelsea 3-1. Michael Olise once again showed his class, and the consistently effective Harry Kane scored two goals."

Marca (Spain): "Bayern show Chelsea that the Champions League is not the Club World Cup."

AS (Spain): "Very serious warning from Bayern."

The U.S. men's national team dropped a spot in the latest FIFA rankings, which were released on Thursday morning.

The U.S. men's national team dropped a spot in the latest FIFA rankings, which were released on Thursday morning.

The 16th-place Americans remained in second place among Concacaf teams as Mexico, which fell to 14th, still leads the way.

As for the overall leader, with UEFA EURO 2024 winners Spain took over the top spot, a mark the team had not occupied in the men's game since June 2014. In the process, the Spaniards have dethroned long-standing leaders Argentina (3rd, down 2), who had occupied the position since April 2023.

Joining Spain in surpassing the current world champions are the team Argentina beat in the FIFA World Cup 2022™ final, France (2nd, up 1). Slightly further down, Portugal, Croatia and Italy have all edged up one spot, into 5th, 9th and 10th position, respectively, making the most of the setbacks suffered by Brazil (6th, down 1) and Germany (12th, down 3).

For Germany, the damage was done by their away defeat to Slovakia in their opening FIFA World Cup 26 qualifier, and they find themselves languishing outside the top 10 for the first time since October 2024. Morocco (11th, up 1) now lead the chasing pack outside the top 10, having triumphed in eight of their nine matches since the last edition of the ranking in July.

The biggest climbers overall are Slovakia (42nd, up 10), whose reward for kick-starting their World Cup qualifying campaign with two straight wins – including the aforementioned upset of Germany – is a place back among the top 50.

Having all shot at least five places up the standings, The Gambia (115th, up 8), Madagascar (108th, up 7), Paraguay (37th, up 6), Uganda (82nd, up 6), Libya (112th, up 5), Suriname (131st, up 5) and the Faroe Islands (136th, up 5) are the main other movers and shakers.

Two further standout storylines are served up by FIFA World Cup 26 co-hosts Canada (26th, up 2) and UEFA up-and-comers Kosovo (91st, up 4). Having already celebrated all-time highs in previous instalments of the ranking, both continue to break new ground.

The next edition of the men's world ranking will be published on Oct. 23.

Bundesliga

Within a few hours of Borussia Monchengladbach's 4-0 loss to Werder Bremen on Sunday, a compilation of Gio Reyna's debut at his new club was up on the internet and flying around the U.S. men's national team fan communities.

Never mind that the result got Gladbach's manager fired. Reyna was back on the field, played 74 minutes and created one chance in the game, with an outing that was … fine. Fans tweeted the video around, calling Reyna “levels above this team” and saying he was “still the most offensively creative midfielder in the pool.”

The reaction is indicative of the sentiment around a player many believed to be one of the most talented American prospects ever. Six years after debuting in the Bundesliga, across a World Cup controversy and numerous injuries that have mostly kept him on the sideline, there is still belief — hope — that Reyna will be what so many thought he would be when he broke out with four goals and five assists in 2020-21.

That hope lives in Reyna, too.

“I believe I'll be there (at the 2026 World Cup),” Reyna told BILD. “That was one of the reasons for my move. I'm in open contact with the coach. If I play well at Borussia, I'll definitely find my way back to the national team.”

Reyna is still just 22 now, hardly over the hill. But with a total of just 2,925 minutes across all competitions with his club team since 2021-22 — an average of 731.25 per season — Reyna faces a historically steep climb back into form and fitness after moving from Dortmund to Gladbach this summer.

In the last 15 seasons, just four players have had a season with nine or more combined goals and assists in Europe's top five leagues, then played four straight seasons in the top five leagues without reaching 1,000 minutes in any of them – and then had nine or more goals-plus-assists again in a top-five league, per TruMedia's Albert Larcada and Paul Carr.

Three of those players were at least 30 at the end of those stretches: Olivier Giroud, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Corentin Tolisso.

Just one, Kelechi Iheanacho, compares both statistically and age-wise. Iheanacho was, like Reyna, considered a top young prospect as an 18-year-old when he had eight goals and one assist for Manchester City in league play in 2015-16. He totaled 5,570 minutes over the next four seasons – almost double what Reyna managed in the past four campaigns – and had 25 goals and assists total in that time, before breaking out as a 24-year-old at Leicester City in 2020-21 with 14 combined goals and assists.

The road back may be even tougher for Reyna, in part because Iheanacho is not a perfect comparison.

The Nigerian striker did not suffer anywhere near the same sort of injury history that has limited Reyna. He missed just 10 days due to injury in those four seasons, per Transfermarkt, and was mostly the victim of circumstance. He came up playing in a powerful Manchester City side and then tried to fit into a Leicester team with Jamie Vardy. It wasn't until Iheanacho was moved into a second striker role that he started to thrive again in the Premier League.

Reyna, meanwhile, has been sidelined by multiple hamstring injuries and surgeries, as well as a fractured leg and groin injury. Per Transfermarkt, Reyna missed 492 days from 2021-22 through the end of last season due to various injuries and ailments.

So while Reyna remains an intriguing prospect — a player who can pick a pass and create a moment of brilliance during key moments in a game — he faces an uphill battle to get back to the type of form where he can show that on a weekly basis.

The concern is that Reyna's age doesn't tell the true story of his legs. Data backs that up. Reyna's max speed, measured by the fastest sprints averaged out across five games, ranked last among all qualified Bundesliga attacking midfielders and eighth-to-last among all outfield players last season, per ESPN. Reyna also sprinted fewer times than all but six central midfielders in the Bundesliga.

Reyna isn't a player dependent on his speed or athleticism, but the game still has certain demands on players. The question is whether Reyna's body will allow him to meet those demands. Over the past four years, the answer has been a resounding ‘no.'

“I'm a big fan of him, but his injuries have really hurt his progression and his ceiling and his potential of where he's going to go,” U.S. men's national team legend Clint Dempsey said during an event with Men in Blazers earlier this month. “You don't know if it's a situation where is it the fight, or is his body holding him back from winning that starting position and playing week-in and week-out? I would like to see him get fit. I would hope that this is a new chapter for him.”

Reyna's talent has kept him on the fringes of the national team pool, always lurking if he can get fit. But after he was summoned for the March Concacaf Nations League camp, U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino said Reyna wasn't “ready to play in the way that we expect from him, to perform.”

“The most important thing is how he is showing now in every single training session and spending time with us,” Pochettino said. “Because I think he's not maybe at his best, but he's here [for the staff] to try to know him and from here to help him to arrive at his best. That is the reality.”

What Pochettino has conceded, though, is exactly what fans wrote on social media after Reyna's Gladbach debut: Reyna has a skillset that is unique in the U.S. player pool. And if he can get right in time for the World Cup, that skillset should be enough to put him on the roster.

But the last four years have shown that it's a big ‘if.' And Reyna needs to prove that skillset is still at the level it was five years ago.

Reyna will get his next chance to show his progress this weekend, and he'll face off directly against the player who has stepped up in his absence. Malik Tillman was the standout of this summer's Gold Cup squad and is now the presumed starting central midfielder for the U.S. — whether the U.S. lines up in a 4-3-3, or in the 3-4-2-1 utilized by Pochettino in September's friendlies.

Tillman is actually six months older than Reyna, though his rise started slightly later. A former Bayern Munich youth talent, the German-American has built his career up over stops at Rangers and PSV before earning a $41 million move to Bayer Leverkusen.

Gladbach will travel to face Tillman and Leverkusen on Sunday — and they'll do so with a new coach.

Among the many X factors determining whether Reyna will fight back into the national team picture, an added challenge is that, after just one game starting in his new team, Gladbach fired coach Gerardo Seoane. American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo is reportedly among the potential candidates to take charge, and Reyna will hope he's a fit for the new manager that does arrive.

Everyone around the U.S. program — from staff to fans and media — will be watching to see how it unfolds, with some tracking every touch, sprint and pass along the way. With three windows left until the pre-World Cup camp, time is running thin for Reyna to be the latest exception to the rule.

By Sebastian Quiroz-Gutierrez – @SebastianQuir0z

When the San Diego Wave announced the retirement of Alex Morgan's No. 13 jersey, it marked another milestone for one of the most iconic players in U.S. women's soccer. Morgan joins a small but significant group of NWSL players who have been honored with jersey retirements — tributes that recognize their impact at the professional level. But before these stars became household names, they each built a foundation at the college level. College Soccer News takes a look back at their collegiate accomplishments — a reminder of how college soccer continues to shape the future of the game. 

At the University of California, Berkeley, Alex Morgan consistently delivered as the Golden Bears' top scorer, finishing her career tied for third all-time in goals (45) and third in points (107). A four-time All-Pac-10 selection, she earned First Team All-American honors in 2010, was a two-time Hermann Trophy semifinalist, and became the first Cal player to be named a top-three finalist. Morgan was also a Honda Award finalist, led the Bears in scoring each season, and guided them to the NCAA Tournament all four years. She graduated early with a degree in political economy while earning Pac-10 All-Academic honors. 

Few players made a quicker impression at the University of Portland than Megan Rapinoe, who helped the Pilots capture the 2005 NCAA Championship during her freshman season. She went on to record 30 goals and 28 assists in just 50 matches, earning recognition as the 2005 Soccer Times National Freshman of the Year, a two-time First Team All-American, and the 2008 WCC Player of the Year. 

Rapinoe was also a three-time All-Region pick and capped her career as the 2009 University of Portland Female Student-Athlete of the Year. 

At UCLA, Lauren Holiday (then Cheney) put together one of the most accomplished careers in program history. She remains the Bruins' all-time leader in goals (71) and points (173), earning four straight First Team All-America selections and four consecutive First Team All-Pac-10 honors. A two-time Hermann Trophy finalist and the 2007 U.S. Soccer Young Female Athlete of the Year, Holiday was instrumental in leading UCLA to four consecutive College Cup appearances, cementing her place among the elite in college soccer. 

Leslie Osborne was a standout player for the Santa Clara Broncos from 2001 to 2004, helping them secure the 2001 NCAA Championship as a freshman. She was a three-time All-American and the 2004 Honda Sports Award winner as the nation's top player. Osborne still ranks sixth in goals (44) and ninth in assists (33) on Santa Clara's career charts, and she twice earned WCC Player of the Year honors (2003 and 2004) while also being recognized as the league's Defender of the Year as a senior. 

At the University of North Carolina, Lori Chalupny developed into one of the most reliable midfielders of her era. She tallied 30 goals and 32 assists over her career, starting 82 of 89 matches. A two-time First Team NSCAA All-American and three-time First Team All-ACC pick, Chalupny was the 2005 ACC Tournament MVP and played a vital role in UNC's run to the 2003 NCAA Championship and a perfect 27-0-0 record. She closed her Tar Heel career by leading the program to a 23-1-1 finish in 2005, showcasing her consistency and leadership on the nation's biggest stage. 

Joanna Lohman distinguished herself at Penn State both on the field and in the classroom. A three-time NSCAA All-American and four-time First Team All-Big Ten selection, she was the 2000 Big Ten Freshman of the Year and the 2003 Big Ten Player of the Year. Lohman was a two-time finalist for both the Hermann Trophy and Honda Sports Award, underscoring her place among the nation's elite. She also excelled academically, earning First Team Academic All-America honors and graduating with a 3.98 GPA, while helping Penn State capture four straight Big Ten titles. 

From Berkeley to Portland, UCLA to Penn State, the accomplishments of Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Lauren Holiday, Leslie Osborne, Lori Chalupny, and Joanna Lohman underscore the pivotal role college soccer plays in developing the stars of the professional game. Their jersey retirements in the NWSL celebrate careers that inspired countless fans, but each of those journeys was rooted in the college game. It's a reminder that the college pathway remains a vital bridge to professional women's soccer.

Great Britain advances to the Billie Jean King Cup semifinal by defeating Japan 2-0. Kartal wins opener against Shibahara, while Boulter secures victory over Uchijima. Britain will face United States in semis, Italy vs Ukraine in the other semifinal.

Great Britain reached the Billie Jean King Cup semifinals for the second year in a row, defeating Japan 2-0 in Thursday's quarterfinals.

Even without top-ranked Emma Raducanu, Britain sealed the tie by winning both singles matches in straight sets. The four-time finalists will face the United States next, the event's most successful nation.

Kartal gives Britain the perfect start

Britain's Sonay Kartal opened the tie with a strong start, racing to a 4-0 lead against Japan's Ena Shibahara before closing out the first set 6-3.

The second set was tighter, with both players unable to break the other's serve, forcing a tiebreak. Shibahara jumped to a 3-1 lead before Kartal rallied to earn triple-match point. The 23-year-old Brit, ranked No. 82, sealed a 6-3, 7-6 (4) win on her second opportunity. Kartal had also won both her matches on her Billie Jean King Cup debut in April.

Boulter seals the victory with easy win 

Britain's Katie Boulter, ranked No. 55, then dominated Japan's Moyuka Uchijima 6-1, 6-2 in the second singles to secure her nation's place in the last four. Uchijima, ranked No. 92, struggled to find rhythm as Boulter's solid baseline play proved too strong.

Semifinal lineup set

Great Britain will face the United States in Saturday's semifinal. Earlier Thursday, Jessica Pegula and Taylor Townsend clinched the deciding doubles match to give the U.S. a 2-1 victory over Kazakhstan. On Friday, in the first semifinal, five-time champion Italy will face Ukraine, which, like Britain, is still chasing its first Billie Jean King Cup title.

Italy scored a 2-0 win over China, while Ukraine overcame Spain by an identical score in the quarterfinals earlier in the week.

Top seed Iga Swiatek stayed perfect against Sorana Cirstea to reach the Korea Open 2025 presented by Motiva quarterfinals on her tournament debut, while Ella Seidel dethroned defending champion Beatriz Haddad Maia in the third-longest match of 2025 so far.

No. 1 seed Iga Swiatek made a victorious debut at the Korea Open 2025 presented by Motiva on Thursday, defeating Sorana Cirstea 6-3, 6-2 to post her sixth win in six meetings with the Romanian -- and afterwards, she revealed the family connection that made it extra special.

Seoul: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Swiatek's father, Tomasz, was a rower who competed in the men's quadruple sculls event at one Olympic Games -- Seoul 1988. This may be his daughter's first time in the city, but she's been hearing about it for all of her life.

"The Olympics in 1988 were the highlight of his career, and he's been telling us stories about it since me and my sister were kids," Swiatek said in her on-court interview. "So I'm happy to explore this city -- he's been talking about being here as a great adventure. I play a different sport, but still we're at the Olympic venue and I'm surprised by how the whole city is still appreciating the Olympic tradition. It's great, because this event is the best the world has in any area. Playing here for sure is an honor, and maybe next year my dad will come!"

Playing her first match since losing in the US Open quarterfinals to Amanda Anisimova, Swiatek got off to a fast start against an opponent to whom she has only ever dropped one set -- the first set of their first meeting back at the 2022 Australian Open. She hammered a pair of forehand winners en route to breaking Cirstea in the first game, and swiftly built a 5-1 lead.

Cirstea still battled hard, saving the first five points against her with fine serving and getting one of the breaks back as Swiatek lapsed into error -- but another forehand winner from the Pole sealed her sixth set point. In the second set, Swiatek still had to navigate a few untidy moments -- she tallied 19 winners to 21 unforced errors overall -- but nonetheless saved all three break points against her, and converted her first match point as Cirstea sent a forehand long.

Swiatek advanced to her 13th quarterfinal in 15 tournaments this year (excluding team competitions). She will next face a fellow major champion -- either No. 8 seed Emma Raducanu or Barbora Krejcikova.

Seidel dethrones Haddad Maia in third-longest match of 2025: Qualifier Ella Seidel came through a 3-hour, 28-minute barnburner to dethrone defending champion and No. 6 seed Beatriz Haddad Maia 6-7(4), 7-6(3), 7-5 in the third-longest tour-level match of 2025 so far.

The No. 105-ranked German trailed by 5-2 and one match point in the third set, but surged through the next five games in a row in a blitz of heavy forehand winners mixed up with smartly-timed drop shots. Seidel, 20, has been surging in recent months. This result was her third career Top 30 win, all of which have come since June -- the 20-year-old also defeated Anna Kalinskaya in Berlin qualifying and Emma Navarro in Cincinnati en route to the last 16.

It's also not the first time this week that Seidel has battled back from the brink. She also saved five match points in her first qualifying match before overcoming Mai Hontama 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(7) in 2 hours and 26 minutes.

Haddad Maia, who took a medical time-out leading 5-4 in the third set, later withdrew from the doubles tournament due to a right knee injury.

Seidel advances to her fourth WTA quarterfinal, and first at WTA 500 level. She will next face No. 2 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova, the only former champion remaining in the draw, who came through 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 against Roland Garros semifinalist Lois Boisson.

Emma Navarro saved two match points, Elena Rybakina struck back for Kazakhstan, and Jessica Pegula teamed with Taylor Townsend to clinch the doubles and send the U.S. into the last four.

The United States, the most successful nation in Billie Jean King Cup history, advanced to the semifinals with a 2-1 win over Kazakhstan in Thursday's first quarterfinal.

After the singles were split, the tie was decided in doubles -- the first of this week's quarterfinals to hinge on the final rubber.

Navarro saves two match points in thriller against Putintseva

In the opening match, World No. 18 Emma Navarro took on No. 61 Yulia Putintseva. The American dropped an early break but recovered to claim the first set 7-5. Putintseva answered with her trademark variety, unsettling Navarro to take the second set 6-2, then broke early for a 2-0 lead in the third.

Navarro fought back to level the decider and forced a tiebreak. At 6-4, Putintseva held two match points, but the 24-year-old American held her nerve, reeling off four straight points to close out a 7-5, 2-6, 7-6 (6) win in 2 hours, 31 minutes and give the U.S. a 1-0 lead.

Rybakina levels tie with dominant win over Pegula

With Kazakhstan needing a response, former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina faced US Open semifinalist Jessica Pegula in a Top 10 showdown.

Rybakina built a 4-1 lead before Pegula steadied to reach 4-4 in the first set. From there, the Kazakh took control, winning eight of the next nine games to close out a 6-4, 6-1 victory in just over an hour and level the tie at 1-1.

Pegula/ Townsend clinch doubles to seal semifinal spot

In the winner-takes-all doubles, the United States paired Pegula with World No. 1 Taylor Townsend, while Kazakhstan fielded Rybakina and Putintseva.

The Americans started fast, taking the opening set 6-2. The Kazakh duo surged ahead 4-1 in the second, but Pegula and Townsend fought back to 4-4, then saved two set points in the 12th game to force a tiebreak. They dominated the tiebreak to close out a 6-2, 7-6 (1) win and secure the United States' place in the semifinals.

U.S. to face winner of Great Britain-Japan tie

The Americans, chasing their first title since 2017, will meet the winner of the Great Britain–Japan quarterfinal, scheduled later on Thursday. Both nations are chasing their first BJK Cup title and are without their top-ranked stars, with Emma Raducanu (Britain) and Naomi Osaka (Japan) unavailable. Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal lead Britain, while Moyuka Uchijima and Ena Shibahara front the Japanese team.

Earlier in the week, five-time champion Italy and Ukraine -- seeking its first title -- advanced to Friday's semifinal with 2-0 wins over China and Spain, respectively. 

Emma Navarro saved two match points, Elena Rybakina struck back for Kazakhstan, and Jessica Pegula teamed with Taylor Townsend to clinch the doubles and send the U.S. into the last four.

Gael Monfils cut a dejected figure on Thursday after suffering a painful fall that forced him to retire from his opening match against Alexander Shevchenko at the Chengdu Open.

The 39-year-old Frenchman, who had taken the first set, rolled his ankle late in the second and grew visibly emotional once it became clear he could not continue. After Shevchenko leveled the contest, Monfils retired at 7-6(3), 3-6, 0-1.

Watch the moment that led Monfils to retire: 

“I loved every second of the match, and I really didn't want to end it like this,” said Shevchenko, who helped Monfils up after he fell. “He's my childhood hero, I enjoy watching him so much and I wish him a fast recovery. He's incredible, there are so many people looking up to him.”

Monfils won his 13th ATP Tour title in Auckland in January and backed it up with a fourth-round run at the Australian. But the World No. 52 has now slipped to five consecutive defeats and owns an 18-15 record in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Making his debut at the Chinese ATP 250 event, Shevchenko next plays big-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, who did not face a break point across the second and third sets of his 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 win over Filip Misolic.

Earlier, #NextGenATP star Dino Prizmic moved past Terence Atmane 6-4, 6-3 in the Frenchman's first appearance since his breakthrough run to the Cincinnati semi-finals last month. The 20-year-old Prizmic, who is fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, is competing in Chengdu through the Next Gen Accelerator, which offers players aged 20 and under increased opportunity to compete on the ATP Tour.



Prizmic set a second-round meeting with top seed and last year's runner-up Lorenzo Musetti, who is eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and aiming to strengthen his push for a Nitto ATP Finals qualification.

Other winners on Day 2 in Chengdu include eighth seed Lorenzo Sonego and qualifier Mackenzie McDonald, who both earned deciding-set victories. Sonego rallied past Juan Manuel Cerundolo 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, while McDonald held firm for a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 victory over Botic van de Zandschulp to improve to 2-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Dalibor Svrcina delivered the biggest win of his ATP Tour career on Thursday at the Lynk & Co Hangzhou Open, where he dismissed Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 6-3 in the Italian's comeback from injury.

Making his first appearance since his first-round Wimbledon exit, Berrettini was unable to withstand the 22-year-old Czech's fearless ball-striking at the Chinese ATP 250 event. Despite losing in the second round of qualifying just a day earlier, Svrcina grabbed his chance as a lucky loser and has risen 10 spots to a career-high No. 89 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

“Obviously I wasn't the favourite coming into this match, so I just wanted to come here, enjoy and play freely,” said Svrcina. “Yesterday I lost in the qualies, so I'm happy I got the chance to play again and I think I made the most out of it.

“Matteo is an incredible player, he's coming [back] from injury… Obviously he's not where he wants to be, but I'm very happy with the win today and it's the biggest of my career so far.”

Backed by rock-solid defence and quick court coverage, Svrcina struck 17 winners to Berrettini's 11 and saved the only break point he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, during their 85-minute battle. His reward: a second-round clash with Buyunchaokete or Zhang Zhizhen.

Berrettini, who had reached quarter-finals in Miami, Dubai and Doha earlier this year — including his first win over Novak Djokovic — showed signs of rust after a two-and-a-half month layoff, tallying 15 unforced errors in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head match with Svrcina.



In other Day 2 action in Hangzhou, Tomas Martin Etcheverry eased past Damir Dzumhur 6-2, 6-4 to notch his 20th tour-level victory of the season, becoming the second Argentine to do so after Francisco Cerundolo (33). Etcheverry awaits qualifier Rinky Hijikata or fifth seed Camilo Ugo Carabelli.

Qualifier Nishesh Basavareddy booked his spot in the second round by rallying past defending champion Marin Cilic 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. The 20-year-old, who made his debut at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF last year, is up one spot to sixth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah and will next play second seed Daniil Medvedev.

A post shared by Tennis (@tennischannel)

Alexander Zverev: We talked about it. He texted me and sent me a picture before I saw it live. Look, a new haircut, apparently it works. Every time he has one, he wins the tournament, so hopefully it's going to go the same way for Laver Cup.Flavio Cobolli: I said that it's really nice because I really like him blonde. So, I really love it.Casper Ruud: We have an ongoing discussion of what the nickname should be for him. “Silver Fox” is pretty good. You know, his hair grows so fast. It was blonde two days ago and now it's already turning silver.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

McLaren's Norris 'reasonably confident' of 'another good weekend' as constructors' title beckons

IndyCar winner and F1 TV analyst James Hinchcliffe explains what Herta will bring to the new Cadillac team – and why he's given up a front-running seat in IndyCar to chase his F1 dream.

If you are even a remote Formula 1 fan you've no doubt heard the recent news about IndyCar star Colton Herta forfeiting his place as a front runner in the American championship to take on a role as Cadillac F1's new test and development driver.

His role with Cadillac will be dovetailed with a season racing in F2, with the aim of getting a better grasp of the circuits, the cadence of F1 weekends and the very particular traits of Pirelli racing rubber. Herta's ultimate goal is a race seat in F1 with the General Motors-backed outfit.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

McLaren's Norris 'reasonably confident' of 'another good weekend' as constructors' title beckons

In this week's Beyond The Grid podcast, Graeme tells host Tom Clarkson how his experience led to a job with Cadillac, how the team won its place in F1, and the incredible preparation work happening as the clock ticks towards the new team's debut at the 2026 Australian Grand Prix.

Six months before their first race, the new Cadillac Formula 1 Team is already moving fast. The drivers have been signed, the car is being developed on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and engineers are running simulations to prepare for Grand Prix racing.

Leading Cadillac to the Formula 1 grid is Team Principal Graeme Lowdon, who knows how to launch a brand-new team. He did it in 2010 with Virgin Racing, which raced at the back of the grid and was graced by the talent of the late Jules Bianchi.

And in this week's Beyond The Grid podcast, Graeme tells pod host Tom Clarkson how his experience led to a job with Cadillac, how the team won its place in F1, and the incredible preparation work happening as the clock ticks towards the new team's debut at the 2026 Australian Grand Prix.

He explains why Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez are the perfect drivers for the team, and why he admires Cadillac reserve driver Colton Herta for swapping IndyCar for a shot at racing in F1.

The FCC chair's latest comments come after he condemned 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' for remarks made about the Charlie Kirk shooter. Jimmy Kimmel's show was later "indefinitely" suspended by ABC.



		By Carly Thomas, Alex Weprin 

	September 18, 2025 1:14pm	




Brendan Carr, the Federal Communications Commission chair, is now turning his attention to The View.


	This comes after he threatened Jimmy Kimmel Live! for the host's remarks about the Charlie Kirk shooter on Monday night's show, which ultimately led to Jimmy Kimmel's show being “indefinitely” suspended by ABC.




	Carr went on The Scott Jennings Radio Show on Thursday, where he suggested that he may look into The View.

	While The View was created by the legendary journalist Barbara Walters, it is primarily a panel talk show, albeit one that tackles current events.

					'The View' Panel Oddly Silent About 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' Being Pulled by ABC		
			









	“When you look at these other TV shows, what's interesting is the FCC does have a rule called the equal opportunity rule,” he said. “But there's an exception to that rule called the bona fide news exception, which means if you are a bona fide news program, you don't have to abide by the equal opportunity rule.”


	Carr continued, “And over the years, the FCC has developed a body of case law on that and has suggested that most of these late night shows, other than SNL, are bona fide news programs. And potentially I would assume you can make the argument that The View is a bona fide news show, but I'm not so sure about that, and I think it's worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether The View and some of the programs that you have still qualify as bona fide news programs and therefore exempt from the equal opportunity regime that Congress has put in place.”

	











	At issue is whether The View, which is produced by ABC News, qualifies as a bona fide news program and is thus exempt from certain FCC rules, including the equal opportunity or equal time rule.


	If a candidate for office receives time on a broadcast that is deemed to be applicable to the rule, the network must give their opponents the opportunity to appear on the network for a similar amount of time. It is worth noting that the rule “does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate,” per FCC regulations, but rather comparable time and placement.


	Last year, for example, Vice President Kamala Harris appeared in a sketch on Saturday Night Live. She was only on air for 90 seconds, but NBC proactively reached out to the Trump campaign and gave him a similar amount of time during a NASCAR race and an NFL game.


	Carr had called out the appearance as a potential violation of the rule.


	While The View has frequently hosted guests of all political persuasions over the years, it was a favored stop by former President Biden. It was his first TV interview after leaving office.


	If the FCC does determine that The View or late night talk shows are not exempt under FCC equal time rules, the networks would need to provide equal time for all political candidates during elections, which could prove onerous.

Executive Editor, Television


David Letterman has come out swinging.


	The “great grandfather” of late-night television reacted to the news that Jimmy Kimmel Live! was put on pause by ABC after FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened the network over Kimmel's comments about the alleged killer of Charlie Kirk.


	Letterman, speaking Thursday at The Atlantic Festival, called the move “misery.” “It's ridiculous. You can't go around firing somebody because you're fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian criminal administration in the Oval Office, that's just not how this works.”


	The former host of The Late Show said that he had been texting with Kimmel after the move. “He's sitting up in bed taking nourishment, he's going to be fine.”

	Letterman joked that he was doing the same thing for 30 years. “We all see where this going. It's managed media and it's no good,” he said.


	He pointed out that he made jokes about six Presidents from Jimmy Carter through to Barack Obama, although he laughed that “not so much” about Carter, he was a “sweet guy.”


	“The point is beating up on these people, rightly or wrongly, accurately or perhaps inaccurately in the name of comedy, not once were we squeezed by anyone from any governmental agency, let alone the dreaded FCC,” he said.


	Letterman also called out Carr. “This guy [at] the FCC said, ‘We can do things the easy way. We can do things the hard way.' Who is hiring these goons? Mario Puzo?” he joked.


	It comes two months after Letterman also shared his views on the cancelation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. “I don't think it was money,” Letterman said on a video on the Letterman YouTube channel. “This is pure cowardice.”

People are like, if you don't like America then leave.

Well, if you don't like Kimmel then don't watch.

He has been losing viewers for a long time now.  And only the liberals are blaming the Trump administration.

Thank you, Dave!

Why does nobody mention what happened to Bill Maher in 2001?  Same exact thing and also on ABC.  This is not some new thing. People's obsession with Trump has clouded their rationale.

It's been mentioned several times in various publications over last couple days including the LA Times.

No, that was not the “same exact thing”. JFC!

He got fired for purposefully lying about the ideology of an assassin. Wtf is this guy talking about?

Every word out of Trumps mouth is a lie. To bad we can't fire him.

He's talking about the FCC strong arming networks into shutting up people that criticize Trump. Trump himself said that Kimmel would be next on the chopping block two months ago when Colbert was fired. You have to be a cult member or just absent in the mind to take what they say at face value. Especially when you can read/see Kimmel's own words and realize he made no insinuation that Robinson was rightwing, but that MAGA was doing everything they could to prove the killer wasn't one of them. Those were his words. But let you all tell it, Kimmel said “I KNEW IT ROBINSON IS MAGA AND ALWAYS WAS”. Same ole “believe what I tell you is true, not what you see or hear.”

Incredibly terrible take on what was actually said on your part.  If there was any more spin doctoring going on, there'd be a tornado warning.

So Jimmy Kimmel did not lie about the political ideology of the shooter? FBI, DA, Governor, bullet casings, texts, online search history, family statements are all fake? Dude, grow up.

he didn't lie. do you know anyone on the left who listens to nick fuentes? i sure don't, the left hates that guy.

EXCLUSIVE: Sundance prize-winning animator-director Jeron Braxton has brought an A-list cast around Scott “Kid Cudi” Mescudi for Slime, the animated feature marking his feature debut, on which we first reported in 2023. Newcomers to the ensemble will include Willow Smith (I Am Legend), One Battle After Another breakout Teyana Taylor, Emmy and Golden Globe winner Anna Sawai (Shōgun), John Cho (Tempest) and BAFTA winner John Boyega (The Woman King), sources tell Deadline.


	We're told Smith is set to play the lead role of Muna, with voice work starting next month. Character details for the others are under wraps.

	Set in a too-near future, Slime follows Muna (Smith), an optimistic but broke young woman who signs up for a paid clinical trial, only to be injected with a mysterious creature's slime that unleashes destructive powers she can't control. On the run, she kidnaps Glenn (Mescudi), the lab worker who injected her, and the two set out on a perilous odyssey through a crumbling dystopian world in search of refuge and a cure. But as the clock runs out, is Muna transforming into humanity's worst nightmare or its last, unlikely savior?


	Set to feature an original soundtrack and score by Kid Cudi, the film is described as an anime-inspired pre-apocalyptic sci-fi monster flick with retro video-game aesthetics. Hammerstone Studios is financing the project with Script 2 Screen and producing alongside Mad Solar and Capstone Pictures. Producers include Alex Lebovici, Mescudi, Karina Manashil, Smith, and Aaron Bergman. Ibrahim Mohammed, Chase Vergari, Craig Peck, Dennis Cummings, Brian Ash, Michael Learner, Jon Oakes, Christian Mercuri, Courtney Chenn, Waylen Lin and Alex Kaplunov are serving as exec producers.

Political Editor


	In the wake of ABC's decision to sideline Jimmy Kimmel following a threat from the FCC, Donald Trump suggested that the agency should weigh late-night criticism as broadcasters seek licensing renewals.


	As he talked to reporters on Air Force One on his return to the U.S. from Great Britain, Trump said that the late-night hosts' biting humor at his expense is “something that should be talked about for licensing.”


	Trump told reporters, “When you have a network, and they have evening shows, and all they do is hit Trump. If you go back — I guess they haven't had a conservative on in years or something — all they do is hit Trump. They're licensed. They're not allowed to do that. They're an arm of the Democrat party.”

					'The View' Hosts Don't Address ABC's Suspension Of Jimmy Kimmel Following FCC Chairman's Threat		
			








	The president seemed to be suggesting a return to the Fairness Doctrine. That required that broadcasters provide a mix of points of view on issues of major importance. But that requirement was abandoned by the FCC in 1987, during the Reagan administration. 


	The lifting of the Fairness Doctrine was credited with ushering in a new era of partisan talk radio, led by conservative host Rush Limbaugh, as broadcasters no longer had to meet the obligation of providing a diversity of viewpoints.


	It's very rare for the FCC to revoke a broadcast license. The next round of TV station license renewals don't start until 2028, when Trump's term will be in its final year.


	On Wednesday, Trump's FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, threatened to take action against ABC and its stations over a remark that Kimmel made in his monologue on Monday.


	Kimmel said, “We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.”


	Carr said on Benny Johnson's podcast, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”

	











	Hours later, Nexstar, the largest station group in the country, said that it was dropping Kimmel's show from is ABC affiliates for the “foreseeable future.” Sinclair Broadcast Group followed later. Shortly after Nexstar's announcement, ABC said that it was pulling Kimmel's show indefinitely.


	In interviews, Carr has noted that broadcasters have an obligation to operate in the public interest.


	On Hannity on Thursday, he said, “We at the FCC are going to enforce the public interest obligation. If there's broadcasters out there that don't like it, they can turn their license into the FCC. But that's our job. And again, we're making some progress now.”


	But the FCC says that it has limited authority over program content, and Carr himself has decried government efforts to censor speech based on the “public interest” standard. He wrote on Twitter in 2019, “The FCC does not have a roving mandate to police speech in the name of the ‘public interest.'”


	Anna Gomez, the sole Democrat on the FCC, suggested in a statement on Thursday that Carr was using the threat of FCC action to extract concessions, even though he does not have legal standing to sanction broadcasters on what Kimmel said.


	Gomez said, “This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes. If it were to take the unprecedented step of trying to revoke broadcast licenses, which are held by local stations rather than national networks, it would run headlong into the First Amendment and fail in court on both the facts and the law. But even the threat to revoke a license is no small matter. It poses an existential risk to a broadcaster, which by definition cannot exist without its license. That makes billion-dollar companies with pending business before the agency all the more vulnerable to pressure to bend to the government's ideological demands.”


	Earlier on Thursday, at a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump was asked about Kimmel. “Kimmel is not a talented person, he has very bad ratings more than anything else and they should have fired him a long time ago. You can call that free speech or not, he was fired for lack of talent.” 


	Kimmel was not fired, but suspended, and there is no word on if or when he will return.

If only a person's constant spreading of lies, committing corrupt and criminal acts, trying to overturn an election and inciting an attack on our nation's capitol posed a threat to that person‘s ability to get back into elected office.

The guy can't take a joke like legalize comedy

So small and sad and insecure. That's the president.

POTUS is a child

	A little after noon on Sept. 8, Los Angeles police responded to a call from a tow yard in Hollywood about a “foul odor” coming from an impounded Tesla. When the car's front trunk was opened, detectives discovered decomposing human remains.


	The victim's body had deteriorated to such a degree, it took medical examiners a full week to identify her as Celeste Rivas, a teenager reported missing by her family in February and April of last year. But what was confirmed at the time the body was discovered was that the 2023 Tesla Model Y with Texas license plates was registered to David Anthony Burke, the real name of the up-and-coming singer D4vd. 


	Burke was on tour when the body was discovered, and a representative said he was “cooperating” with authorities. Police have yet to name a suspect, or even a person of interest, in the case, nor have any arrests been made. 


	As police continue their investigation, here's everything we know about the shocking case so far. 

	











	After detectives discovered Rivas' body, a report from the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner described her as a female with wavy black hair wearing a tube top and black leggings, size small, as well as yellow metal-stud earrings and a yellow metal-chain bracelet. Her height was listed as five foot two. But Rivas' body was so “severely decomposed” that examiners were unable to determine her eye color, age, or race/ethnicity. 


	One of the only potential identifying details they were able to share was a tattoo on the right index finger that read “Shhh …” 

	











	Just over a week after the body was discovered, on Sept. 16, authorities finally identified Celeste Rivas Hernandez, a 15-year-old from Lake Elsinore, California, who was reported missing by her family last year. A GoFundMe has been set up to help her family cover the cost of funeral arrangements. 


	After Rivas was identified, reporters quickly swarmed the family's home. While the family declined to speak with them, TMZ reported that Rivas' mother said her daughter had been dating someone named “David” before her death.

	A friend, Rubi Alonso, who was visiting the house, described Rivas as sweet and “studious” to Rolling Stone, adding, “It's so sad. She was very beautiful.” 


	Despite identifying Rivas, there's still much authorities do not know, including a cause of death. A report on the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner website still listed her cause of death as “deferred.”


	Much of the information that's trickled out about the investigation has centered around the impounded Tesla. The car was towed from the tony Bird Streets neighborhood in the Hollywood Hills, and it was sitting in the tow yard for three days before the police were called about the smell.


	Residents told Rolling Stone that the car was spotted in various places around the neighborhood in the preceding months, as far back as the end of May. The city finally towed the sedan after a citizen complained that the car had been abandoned for more than 72 hours. Neighborhood sources said the sedan had been sitting in its final spot, on Bluebird Avenue, for at least three weeks. 


	“It moved around,” one resident told Rolling Stone. “It's chilling.”


	The investigation ramped up Wednesday night after Rivas' body was identified. Per ABC 7 in Los Angeles, investigators searched a house on Doheny Place, close to where the car was abandoned. After several hours at the home, police left with a computer and other items.

	Beyond the initial statement confirming that he was “cooperating” with authorities, reps for Burke have yet to make any public comments. The musician has continued to tour and play shows in support of his debut album, Withered, which arrived in April. At a concert on Sept. 9 — the day after the body was discovered — D4vd performed in Minneapolis, where he was seen tossing Labubus into the crowd and hyping his hit song “Crashing,” with singer Kali Uchis. (“Not my friend i did a song with him which is currently in the process of being taken down given today's disturbing news,” she wrote on social media following the body's discovery.)

	











	D4vd has enjoyed an impressive rise over the past few years. He broke through in 2022 with his singles “Romantic Homicide” and “Here With Me,” both of which garnered significant traction on TikTok. He released his debut EP, Petals to Thorns, in May 2023, then followed it up a few months later with The Lost Petals.


	While Burke has largely appeared unfazed by the investigation, the initial discovery of the corpse in the car did prompt the fashion companies Crocs and Hollister to pull back on a campaign that was set to feature D4vd. “We are aware of this developing story,” the brands said in a joint statement. “With respect to the current situation, we have removed campaign content featuring D4vd while the investigation continues.”

	On Wednesday, as news of Rivas' identification spread, D4vd also had his first show canceled (a gig at the Showbox SoDo in Seattle). As it stands, D4vd's next two shows are still set to go ahead as planned: A Sept. 18 gig at the Warfield in San Francisco, followed by a show at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on Sept. 20. 


	The identification of Rivas set off a wave of speculation and rumor, especially regarding her possible ties to Burke. (As of press time, Burke has not been accused of any crimes.) TMZ in particular has surfaced several alleged links, including a photo of Burke that appears to show him with a “Shhh …” tattoo on his finger similar to the one Rivas had. The tabloid also uncovered a photo of Burke in Lake Elsinore, close to where Rivas lived before her disappearance. (It's unclear when the photo was taken.) An allegedly leaked and unreleased D4vd song has also started floating around the web, called “Celeste.”

The Billboard interview comes as "Golden" spends its fifth week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	It's fair to say that the world has never seen anything quite like KPop Demon Hunters, which has absolutely captivated audiences — to the point that fictional band HUNTR/X is now making very real moves in the music industry. Its single “Golden,” for instance, has spent five weeks so far at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the first female K-pop group to reach the chart's summit.

	











	That said, the imaginary trio also has some very real musical influences that informed its look and sound — and in a conversation with Billboard over noodles, the singing voices behind HUNTR/X spoke about some of their personal favorite K-pop acts. EJAE, who portrays Rumi in the KPop Demon Hunters musical numbers, begins, “I like the OG generation, so, like, G.O.D, shout-out.”


	“H.O.T, S.E.S, like, they are the reasons why I fell in love with K-pop,” she continues. “And like, aespa, BLACKPINK, BTS, TWICE.”


	“I'm a big 2010s era [fan], like, I fainted at a Big Bang concert when I was like 12,” Audrey Nuna, who sings for Mira, says. “2NE1 was hugely inspirational, because I feel like they were just so cool. Obviously they're amazingly beautiful as well, but I think for me, it was like they led with their coolness, and they led with their kind of self empowerment. That was huge to see, like, an Asian female face who was owning their stuff to that degree.”

	











	REI AMI, who voices Zoey, agrees. “They weren't doing like the traditional girl group, aesthetic approach, of, like, very good, frilly, girly,” she says of 2NE1. “No, they were hard, in your face, full of attitude. And I think us being raised in the West, there was a part of us that we saw in them. Because, you know, we are Korean-American. There's a whole Western side to us, and it shows in our music and our artistry.”


	The ladies' outing with Billboard comes as KPop Demon Hunters is dominating on the charts following the film's premiere on Netflix in June. In addition to the mini-residency “Golden” has taken up on the Hot 100, the project's soundtrack recently reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	And while HUNTR/X is the first female K-pop group to top the Hot 100, they're also the first all-female group, period, to rule the chart since Destiny's Child did it with “Bootylicious” in 2001.


	“It is really cool, because I feel like they were so trailblazing in their own way as well,” says Nuna of the iconic R&B trio comprised of Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. “It feels like a similar narrative, in the sense of three women of color just –.”


	“Dominating,” REI AMI jumps in.


	With all the success Demon Hunters is seeing, fans have been clamoring for another installment. A part two is reportedly in talks, but as REI AMI reminds Billboard, “The sequel has not been confirmed.”


	“We are, you know, looking forward, and we will know once we get that email,” she continues.


	So what do the voices of HUNTR/X intend to do in the meantime? “We should start, like, a tap-dancing group or something,” says Nuna as REI AMI and EJAE laugh. “Or a whistle chorus. An a cappella group.”

	











	Check out the trio's full interview with Billboard above.

Natasha Lyonne and Matt Berry are co-creating and starring in a new series called Force & Majeure, which has nothing to do with avalanches, cowardly dads, or the Ruben Östlund film with a very similar name. In fact, it seems like Lyonne and Berry's character will do quite the opposite of sprinting away from trouble. (They'll probably scream about it in a silly voice, though, if their respective histories are anything to go by.) “Force & Majeure follows a British art expert, Thomas Force (Berry) and American mercenary Jennifer Majeure (Lyonne),” Deadline‘s description reads. The conveniently-named duo are “recruited by an eccentric, justice-obsessed billionaire named Amanda Daventry and find themselves tasked with defeating the evil plans of international villains operating in locations across Europe,” it continues. “But as Force & Majeure team up to defeat the forces of evil, they must also work together to escape the clutches of Amanda, who may not be telling them the whole story.” Casting for Amanda and all those evil international villains has not yet been announced, nor has a release date for the series. 

Natasha Lyonne is also busy right now with her directorial debut, an AI “hybrid” film called Uncanny Valley. She launched an “ethical” AI production company called Asteria Studios in connection with that project, but at least as of this writing, Force & Majeure won't incorporate the technology. Matt Berry also hitched his name to a controversial project recently. He'll be voicing Sir Cadogan, a moving portrait, in Audible's full-cast Harry Potter audiobook series. The What We Do In The Shadows actor's other recent credits include The Wild Robot, A Minecraft Movie, and the upcoming animated Cat In The Hat film.

Force & Majeure will reunite Lyonne with Russian Doll writer Cirocco Dunlap. Other writers include What We Do In The Shadows‘ Tom Scharpling, who co-created the series along with Lyonne and Berry, and The Inbetweeners‘ Iain Morris. Force & Majeure will air on U.K. broadcaster Sky. The trade reports that Sky is expected to take the project to U.S. buyers “shortly.”

MJ Lenderman, King Krule, Arca, Massive Attack, MIKE, and Yaeji are among more than 400 artists and labels who have signed up to a campaign asking distributors to block their music from streaming in Israel. A statement from No Music for Genocide rallies more artists and labels to join the cultural embargo, in protest of “Israel's genocide in Gaza; ethnic cleansing of the Occupied West Bank; apartheid within Israel,” and the repression of pro-Palestine activism, as well as the music industry's own links to military tools. In a separate statement, Massive Attack announced they would remove their music from Spotify globally.

Other artists to sign up to No Music for Genocide include Fontaines D.C., Oklou, Wednesday, Kelela, Faye Webster, Japanese Breakfast, Rina Sawayama, Aminé, Erika de Casier, Kneecap, Primal Scream, Eartheater, Aja Monet, Maryam Saleh, Ana Tijoux, Annahstasia, Amyl and the Sniffers, Nadah El Shazly, Ben Howard, Fat Tony, Mannequin Pussy, Liv.e, Mø, Mechatok, Redveil, Horsegiirl, Chanel Beads, Nick León, Escho, Saul Williams, and Verraco. Bayonet, 10k, and Pan are among the labels joining the embargo.

According to the campaign, all three major labels geo-blocked their catalogs from streaming services in Russia within a month of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Those labels did close offices and suspend operations in Russia, and Spotify shut down in Russia altogether. But Russians could still stream the labels' music on platforms, like Apple Music, that remained in operation. In late 2022, Sony Music Entertainment eventually pulled its catalog from all streaming services in Russia.

A statement from No Music for Genocide reads, in part, “Culture can't stop bombs on its own, but it can help reject political repression, shift public opinion toward justice, and refuse the art-washing and normalization of any company or nation that commits crimes against humanity. This initiative is one part of a worldwide movement to erode the support Israel needs to continue its genocide. We're inspired by the escalating efforts in pursuit of that goal, from the recent Film Workers for Palestine pledge to Spain's ban of Israel-bound ships and planes to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition to Demilitarize Brooklyn Navy Yard to dockworkers in Morocco who've refused to load weapons onto vessels ordered by Tel Aviv.”

Following similar efforts made in the film community, a group of independent artists and labels have launched a boycott to prevent their music from being streamed in Israel. The coalition, called No Music For Genocide, encourages artists and rights-holders to request their music be geo-blocked as “in response to the genocide in Gaza; ethnic cleansing of the Occupied West Bank; apartheid within Israel; and political repression of Pro-Palestine efforts wherever we live.” The pledge has so far been signed by more than 400 labels and artists, including Nourished By Time, MJ Lenderman, Massive Attack, Rina Sawayama, Oklou, Mannequin Pussy, Kneecap, Jockstrap, Japanese Breakfast, Grizzly Bear, Fontaines D.C., Faye Webster, Deerhoof, Ben Howard, Arca, Amyl and The Sniffers, Aminé, MØ, and Soccer Mommy. 

According to a press release, the action is inspired by “the successful cultural boycott of apartheid South Africa in the 1980s,” adapted for the streaming era. No Music For Genocide points out that major labels removed their catalogues and closed operations in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, but have stopped short of taking the same measures in Israel. Major label acts who have signed the pledge are also urging Sony, UMG, and Warner to follow suit.

“Culture can't stop bombs on its own, but it can help reject political repression, shift public opinion toward justice, and refuse the art-washing and normalization of any company or nation that commits crimes against humanity. This initiative is one part of a worldwide movement to erode the support Israel needs to continue its genocide. We're inspired by the escalating efforts in pursuit of that goal, from the recent Film Workers For Palestine pledge to Spain's ban of Israel-bound ships and planes to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition to Demilitarize Brooklyn Navy Yard to dockworkers in Morocco who've refused to load weapons onto vessels ordered by Tel Aviv,” No Music For Genocide said in a statement. “Many of our peers have felt, like ourselves, unsure how to use music in this moment. Our first goal with No Music For Genocide is to inspire others to reclaim their agency and direct their influence toward a tangible act. We are so grateful for all of the artists, managers and labels who have already committed to this first step, and we're excited to expand this together. The more of us there are, the stronger we will be. This is just the beginning.”

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: AFA, the production company and talent incubator of Kenan Thompson and Johnny Ryan Jr., has acquired remake rights to Sleepaway Camp, the cult classic '80s slasher from writer-director Robert Hiltzik.


	Specifics as to AFA's take on the material are under wraps for now. But AFA has placed Hiltzik back at the helm to direct from his own script. While for decades, Hiltzik and his wife have been approached for rights to the franchise, they've held out in hopes of a scenario where they can be involved in revitalizing the franchise. To Thompson and Ryan Jr., whose AFA places an emphasis on keeping creative control and ownership with the artist, keeping the original architects of the franchise at the forefront of its evolution is a given.

	Released in 1983, Sleepaway Camp is a low-budget summer-camp slasher in which a shy teen's summer at Camp Arawak turns deadly as campers are murdered one by one. The film plays like a whodunit in the Friday the 13th mold and is famous for an iconic twisty finale. Hiltzik shot it at Camp Algonquin in Argyle, New York, which he attended as a kid. Made for roughly $350,000, with a cast of unknowns, the film grossed around $11 million and has endured as a cult favorite, spurring a number of sequels spanning decades. Michael A. Simpson took the reins on sequels Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers (1988) and Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland (1989), which starred Pamela Springsteen (yes, Bruce's sister). Hiltzik returned for 2008's Return to Sleepaway Camp, with Jim Markovic helming 2012's Sleepaway Camp IV: The Survivor.




			Watch on Deadline		







	No stranger to summer camp, having starred opposite Ben Stiller in the Steven Brill & Judd Apatow-penned kids' classic Heavyweights at the start of his career, Thompson will produce the reimagining for AFA alongside Ryan Jr., with Robinson Velasco, Monica Weber, Cory Litwin, and Boris Shvarts exec producing. Development on the script is underway now, with the project marking AFA's first since exiting their three-year overall deal at Universal. Development is made possible by a new strategic partnership and investment from Shvarts, in a deal negotiated by Cory Litwin of Range Media Partners, which reps AFA. Range Select will handle sales on the project.

	











	In a statement to Deadline, Hiltzik said, “I am both thrilled and humbled to be working with AFA on the reimagined Sleepaway Camp. Though I have been approached by several companies regarding the remake of Sleepaway Camp, only AFA has shared my vision and is excited to have me helm the film, therefore preserving the integrity of the original film for the fans, as well as introducing Sleepaway Camp to a whole new generation. Be prepared for a new member of the Sleepaway Camp family.”


	Thompson told us, “Excited to work with the original genius Robert and bring back to life a camp classic!!!”


	Ryan Jr., meanwhile, teased, “This is only the beginning. Kenan and I always say we're fans first and this couldn't be more on brand for us.”


	Thompson's partner added, ‘I've been obsessed with the Sleepaway Camp franchise since I was a kid. We've wanted this title for 20 years and we're over the moon Robert came back to write it. We're staying true to the OG story while Robert adding in some insane new twists, we're going crazy with the merch too!”


	Founded in 2021, AFA was Emmy-nominated for Olympic Highlights with Kevin Hart and Kenan Thompson, and won a Kids Choice Award for Fan Film of the Year on Good Burger 2. Thompson, a six-time Emmy nominee and the longest-tenured cast member of Saturday Night Live, continues to balance comedy and producing efforts through AFA, alongside veteran manager and producer Ryan Jr.


	On his work with AFA, Range's Litwin told us, “Johnny and Kenan are beyond impressive in their talent, character, and hustle. We've been looking for the right people to team up as we launch and expand our careers as producers and investors in the film space. What they've built with AFA and their entire slate of projects, including Sleepaway Camp, is incredible. Boris and I couldn't be more excited to partner with them. Stay tuned!”

When the rise of television threatened movie attendance in the 1950s, Hollywood responded by introducing several new exhibition formats designed to bring people back to theaters with the promise of widescreen images and stereophonic sound. CinemaScope, Cinerama, and VistaVision were just a few of these processes, which dazzled audiences and yielded films like “The Robe,” “The Bridge on the River Kwai,” and “Around the World in 80 Days,” attracting customers in droves.

Now, as exhibitors struggle with the rise of streaming and declining theater attendance, one of America's greatest living filmmakers has revived one of the greatest of all widescreen formats, giving today's audiences the same reason to get off their couches that Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Curtiz, and other premier directors of their era gave in the 1950s. The glorious return of VistaVision began last year when Brady Corbet shot “The Brutalist” in the format and exhibited the film in several venues in 70mm, a gauge that approximates VistaVision's high resolution — but that was only the beginning.

Now, director Paul Thomas Anderson has not only filmed but is releasing “One Battle After Another” in VistaVision, with a handful of venues projecting the movie in a format that hasn't been seen by audiences of a new release film since Marlon Brando's “One-Eyed Jacks” in 1961. (Lucky viewers at this year's TCM Film Festival did get to see revivals of “We're No Angels” and “Gunfight at the O.K. Corral” in true VistaVision.)

 










Why is that important? And what does it mean for audiences, filmmakers, and projectionists? Let's break it down.

What made VistaVision special compared to rival formats like CinemaScope was its larger negative — around twice the size of a typical 35mm film frame, as the film was run through the camera horizontally rather than vertically. As Margaret Bodde, who works with Martin Scorsese's Film Foundation, told IndieWire, “With CinemaScope, you have a four-perf negative. VistaVision is eight-perf, so you're doubling the size of the image. It just has a superior image quality.” 

In spite of that superior quality, VistaVision ultimately became more or less obsolete for feature film production, though it continued to be used extensively for special effects work on blockbusters like the original “Star Wars,” “Back to the Future,” and “Jurassic Park.” “One Battle After Another” was shot using a combination of VistaVision and Super 35, and will be released in no fewer than seven formats. This has led to intense excitement among cinephiles — and no small amount of misinformation.

In one example, a fan-created graphic recently took off on social media and led to widespread confusion over aspect ratios of the various exhibition formats. (Among other things, it incorrectly stated that the movie would be released in a 2.20:1 aspect ratio in 70mm.) To clarify what formats “One Battle After Another” will be presented in, their technical specs, and where to see them, IndieWire reached out to the source: Paul Thomas Anderson.

 










Anderson referred us to three members of his post-production team: editor Andy Jurgensen, post-production supervisor Erica Frauman, and associate editor Jay Trautman, all of whom dealt with the complexities of VistaVision and the movie's varied release prints throughout the post-production process. Together, they addressed several important questions related to the different ways you can watch “One Battle After Another” when it opens in theaters on September 26.

The below interview condenses and combines responses from Jurgensen, Frauman, and Trautman on the specifics of formats for seeing “One Battle After Another.”

The film was shot using a combination of VistaVision (8-perf) and Super 35 (4-perf) formats. (“Perf” referring to the perforations that run alongside or — depending on the format — above and below the image so that the celluloid can be pulled through the projector.) Both offer a tall enough negative to accommodate the full IMAX 1.43:1 aspect ratio, though the image can be cropped top and bottom to fit the 1.90:1 IMAX or standard 1.85:1 aspect ratios. Camera operator Colin Anderson used ground glass marked with framelines for both 1.85:1 and 1.43:1 compositions to ensure flexibility in framing.

 










When the opportunity for special VistaVision screenings arose, Paul Thomas Anderson chose to present the film in the full 1.50:1 VistaVision frame, an aspect ratio very close to IMAX's 1.43:1. The 5-perf 70mm version is presented in 1.85:1, pillarboxed within a 2.20:1 frame, while standard DCPs are also formatted in 1.85:1.

We often say that each release format offers its own unique experience of the film. In the photochemical world, it's impossible to make all formats look exactly the same!

Because the film was shot with both VistaVision and Super 35mm cameras, we had to navigate not only multiple release formats but also multiple capture formats. If we were using the digital intermediate process that nearly every modern film uses, we would just scan all of the negative and resize it in a computer. However, we cut and splice the camera negative and print photochemically. This means that we had to figure out how to create the VistaVision negative from our Super 35mm shots and our digital visual effects. We started testing these processes over two years ago. In the end, FotoKem configured both an optical printer and a digital film recorder specifically for VistaVision, allowing us to create all the necessary elements to assemble a complete VistaVision negative and produce a VistaVision release print.

 










Paul has noted that the VistaVision presentation is the closest to the film's intended look, as it's struck directly from the VistaVision cut negative. There are only four of these special screening venues currently scheduled — in Los Angeles, New York, Boston, and London.

That said, we always knew there would be an IMAX release, so from the beginning, the 1.43:1 and 1.90:1 IMAX presentations (both film and digital) were intended to be the most immersive. This is the first narrative feature film to be presented entirely in IMAX's 1.43:1 aspect ratio (with no jumping between aspect ratios). The 70mm (5-perf) version is an optical blow-up from the VistaVision-cut negative. It has slightly more grain and contrast, and its 1.85:1 aspect ratio matches the non-IMAX DCP presentations.

Unlike traditional 35mm film, which runs vertically through the camera gate, VistaVision uses a horizontal feed. This allows the image to be recorded on a frame that is twice the size of a standard 4-perf 35mm frame, resulting in a finer-grained negative with improved image quality.

Just like the cameras, VistaVision projectors must also run the film horizontally. Very few of these projectors still exist today. According to VistaVision expert Charlotte Barker, “It's been exactly 70 years since VistaVision projectors were first installed for commercial use, debuting with Paramount's ‘Strategic Air Command' in 1955. Back then, seven U.S. theaters were outfitted with VistaVision projectors, custom 2-foot-deep curvilinear screens, and special aperture plates. ‘One Battle After Another' will echo this historic rollout next week at The Vista in Los Angeles, Regal Union Square 17 in New York, Coolidge Corner Theater in Boston, and Odeon Leicester Square in London.”

 










Warner Bros. refurbished two Ballantyne VistaVision projectors for use in Los Angeles and New York; Barry Wright (Bell Theatre Services) refreshed their VistaVision projector in London. Boston Light & Sound had previously refurbished two projectors supplied by the George Eastman Museum for the TCM Festival in April of 2025; these will be used in Boston. Each Ballantyne projector is equipped with DTS readers to synchronize audio and fitted with custom-built platters capable of running the entire two-hour, 40-minute film on a single reel. The Boston location will utilize two projectors and play reel-to-reel. Projectionists at each location are receiving specialized training to operate the equipment.

Projecting in VistaVision allows prints made directly from the original cut negative to be shown to an audience. This hasn't been possible for over 60 years. Historically, footage shot on VistaVision had to be converted to another format for exhibition. As far as we know, this is the first new release feature film to be projected from true VistaVision prints since “One-Eyed Jacks” in 1961.

EXCLUSIVE: Lionsgate will be reducing 5% of its companywide staff, Deadline has learned. 


	Approximately 50 staff overall will exit in a move that adds to a previous trim. The earlier layoff constituted 8% of staff, which will mean Lionsgate will have lightened its head count by 13% when this round of downsizing is done.


	The purpose of the headcount reduction is corporate belt-tightening, as all companies in the industry are doing, including the ongoing attrition at Paramount Global after its acquisition by David Ellison's Skydance. Co


	This will be it for Lionsgate, making it more efficient as it positions the company for the future growth, sources said.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Lionsgate chief Jon Feltheimer has just sent an internal memo that Deadline got hold of. Here it is:

Dear Colleagues:We continue to operate in an industry environment characterized by unprecedented change and disruption, and we are continuing to adapt our organization to these changes in order to compete successfully. As part of this process, we separated Lionsgate and STARZ into independent standalone companies earlier this year, and we are continuing to monetize non-core assets, re-allocate our resources to growth areas of the business and reduce costs.We have already reduced our studio headcount by approximately 8% this year and today we are notifying an additional 5% of our employees that their positions will soon be eliminated. These are difficult decisions impacting colleagues with whom we have collaborated for years and who have made valuable contributions to Lionsgate's success, and we will make their transitions as smooth as possible. Our Human Resources team will follow up with additional information later this morning. Though we may continue to fine-tune the organizational structure of individual departments from time to time, today's headcount reduction will substantially complete our year-long process of repositioning the company for growth.Our core strengths remain intact: one of the largest and most valuable film & television libraries in the world, a portfolio of premium franchises, deep content pipelines and a talented and entrepreneurial workforce second to none. Working together, I am confident that we will continue to position ourselves for solid and significant growth in the years ahead.Sincerely,Jon

The pop icon has re-signed with her original label after two decades. 


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Madonna is going back to the start. Warner Records announced on Thursday (Sept. 18) that the pop icon is returning to her original label home after nearly two decades away. The best-selling female artist of all time has signed with Warner for what the label called her “highly anticipated, upcoming new dance album.”

	











	Madonna celebrated the return in an Instagram post in which she wrote, “Almost 2 decades later — And it feels like home with Warner Records! Back to music, Back to the Dance Floor, Back to where it all began! COADF – Pt. 2 2026.” The post included a series of pictures of the 67-year-old superstar seated on mattress on the floor in a gauzy light pink nightgown staring at the camera with an old-fashioned typewriter at her feet, striking the kinds of sultry looks that have been her signature for more nearly half a century.


	The final slide consisted of a snap of a pair of gold heels and what looked like a black purse with the message “P–sy Power” in rhinestones across the front.

	Warner Records was Madonna's home for the first 25 years of her career, starting in 1982, when she signed with the Seymour Stein-run label subsidiary Sire Records. She released her self-titled debut on the label in 1983, which spawned a series of indelible early dance pop hits, including “Everybody,” “Burning Up,” “Holiday,” “Lucky Star” and “Borderline.”

	











	”From being a struggling artist in New York City to signing a record deal to release just three singles it seemed at the time my world would never be the same again and in fact that couldn't have been truer,” Madonna said in a statement announcing the deal. “Since the beginning Warner Records has been a real partner with me. I am happy to be reunited and look forward to the future, making music, doing the unexpected while perhaps provoking a few needed conversations.”


	The deal will bear immediate fruit with a new album due out in 2026, marking the singer's first full-length collection of new songs since 2019's Madame X. According to the release, the untitled new album will find Madonna re-teaming with producer/songwriter Stuart Price for the sequel to her Confessions on a Dance Floor LP, which featured the hits “Hung Up” and “Sorry.”


	”We are honored to welcome Madonna back home to Warner Records. Madonna isn't just an artist — she's the blueprint, the rule-breaker, the ultimate cultural juggernaut. For decades, she has not only defined the sound of global pop music but also reshaped culture itself with her vision, innovation, and fearless artistry,” said Warner Records co-chairmen Tom Carson and Aaron Bay-Schuck in a statement. “This signing represents a historic, full circle moment, one that brings her back to the label where it all began and reaffirms her unparalleled influence, setting the stage for an exciting new era of creativity and impact.”


	She remained on Warner through her record-setting run in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, during which time she released such iconic LPs as Like A Virgin (1984), True Blue (1986), Like a Prayer (1989), Erotica (1992), Bedtime Stories (1994), Ray of Light (1998), Music (2000), American Life (2003), the original Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005) and Hard Candy (2008). She hopped to Interscope Records in 2012 for her MDNA LP.

	











	At press time no release date has been announced for the upcoming album.


	In July, Madonna released her long-rumored Veronica Electronica album, a collection of eight rare and unreleased remixes of songs from her beloved 1998 Ray of Light album.

The Gen V writers room had to go back to the drawing board after the “incredibly unimaginable” death of Chance Perdomo, who died in a motorcycle accident last year at the age of 27. Perdomo played Andre, a supe with magnetism powers, in season one of the college-set The Boys spin-off. While some other series may have found another actor to play the major character, co-showrunner Michele Fazekas shared that “literally no one was saying recast” in a recent interview with Deadline. “Studio, network and everybody was kind of like, ‘No, of course not,'” she continued. “So, we knew that we had to treat this like this character, as much as people have lost the real Chance, our people have lost Andre. And what does that look like in a world where it's superheroes in college and a lot of ridiculous gore and funny?”

That decision added some extra work for the team, as Fazekas shared they had already written “like five episodes of Andre's story” before Perdomo's death. “We're like, ‘OK, all of that is obviously gone,'” she recalled. In the end, however, Fazekas was “proud” of how the show handled the profound loss. “We just sort of made it like we wanted the season to certainly honor him, and then at the end, we realized the season is about him, everything, and all of the drive comes from him.”

In his review of the first three episodes of season two, which are currently streaming on Prime Video, Manuel Betancourt wrote that while Perdomo's absence is “very much front and center… you can see the places where Andre/Chance's death has been stitched into the show's otherwise quite intricately plotted season ahead.” That being said, he also wrote that the way the characters themselves process Andre's death was “an admirable way of honoring Chance even as the Marie (Jaz Sinclair) escape of it all feels like a forced reset for what the season cliffhanger had first teased.”

Fazekas also spoke of the strange experience of mourning the character of Andre along with the actor who played him. “It is a weird thing to grieve a fictitious character, but we did,” she said. “We definitely did actually talked [sic] about it like, I think it's OK to actually grieve something, cause you grow to love these characters as much as you love the people who are portraying them. And in some ways, we knew Andre better than we knew Chance. Chance was in Toronto. We spent more time with Andre in a way, and it was like, losing Chance is incredibly unimaginable in a way, but we all were like, ‘Oh, we also lost this Andre guy we really liked.' So, at the end, I was like, ‘Oh, this was about Andre,' and it was about Chance, the season was. I'm very proud of that.”

	Dozens of Americans across a variety of professional fields have been fired or put on leave from their jobs after conservatives contacted their employers over social media comments they made about right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last week, following his assassination. Others have been punished for small acts of defiance — everyone from an Office Depot worker in Michigan who was sacked for refusing to print tribute flyers with Kirk's face on them, to late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, who ABC suspended after he seemed to criticize how MAGA supporters responded to Kirk's death. Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a backlash even within the Trump base for saying the administration would crack down on “hate speech,” suggesting the Justice Department could prosecute businesses and individuals on those grounds. But Vice President J.D. Vance has endorsed the idea of calling the employers of anyone seen as dancing on Kirk's grave.


	Kirk, for the record, wrote on X last year: “Hate speech does not exist legally in America. There's ugly speech. There's gross speech. There's evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment.” In practice, though, he and Turning Point USA, the non-profit he co-founded and led, could be openly retaliatory against those they disagreed with — the organization has long maintained, for example, a “Professor Watchlist” of educators they claim push liberal propaganda and discriminate against conservative students in the classroom. College faculty members have called it an attempt to intimidate and inspire harassment.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	It's no great shock, then, that Kirk's allies and admirers took it upon themselves to surveil public reactions to his death, singling out those who expressed a lack of sympathy or outright contempt for the activist — or simply quoted his most inflammatory statements. Right-wing influencers have relentlessly campaigned for these people to lose their jobs, tagging their employers' online accounts and inundating their places of work with aggrieved emails and phone calls. But the most concerted effort on this front came in the form of a website initially called CharliesMurderers.com, which was accessible as of last Thursday, the day after Kirk was assassinated. Billed by its anonymous organizers as “a searchable database of 20,000 people celebrating Charlie Kirk's murder,” the page provided, along with names and photos, personal information such as an individual's social media handles, employer, city of residence, and email address.

	Rachel Gilmore, a Canadian journalist and podcaster, appeared at the very top of the list, merely for theorizing on the day Kirk was shot that this violence would result in more of the same. “Terrified to think of how far-right fans of Kirk, aching for more violence, could very well turn this into an even more radicalizing moment,” she posted on X. “Will they now believe their fears have been proven right and feel they have a right to ‘retaliate,' regardless of who actually was behind the initial shooting?” 


	For Gilmore, the effect of being put on blast by CharliesMurderers.com over this measured comment was swift and frightening. “I was getting death threats, rape threats, and people claimed to know where I live,” Gilmore tells Rolling Stone. “Luckily, none of them provided an address, so I'm hoping it was all bluster — but there's no way to know for sure.” She's concerned she could wind up banned from the U.S., “despite the fact that I never celebrated anything,” calling the possibility “surreal.” She reported the incident to police.


Rolling Stone reached out to a dozen other people targeted on the website for what they said or shared about Kirk, but most did not respond. All had deleted at least one or more of their social media profiles, including X, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn accounts, presumably due to a torrent of harassment like the one Gilmore has endured.


	Hannah Molitor, another woman listed on CharliesMurderers.com, was subsequently fired from her job at Next Door, a Milwaukee childcare organization. Her entry included a screenshot of a post on her Facebook page, which began: “What happened to Charlie Kirk is horrible and no person should ever lose their life to gun violence.” She went on to point out, however, that Kirk's political movement had actively worked against attempts to reduce unnecessary gun deaths, adding, “If all you do is spew hate, you're bound to get some in return.”

	“It is really important to me that people realize both in my post and in my own personal opinion that I would never wish death upon anyone or celebrate anyone's death, especially victims of gun violence,” Molitor tells Rolling Stone. “I may have disagreed with Charlie Kirk politically, but no one deserves to be killed, especially in such a horrific and visible way.” She says far-right extremists distorted her comment and “spread misinformation about me all over the internet.” After her post was shared on the anti-LGBTQ hate account LibsOfTikTok the night of the shooting, she says, her email inbox filled up with “hundreds of vile messages telling me to either kill myself or that they wished I would die a horrible death.” Her phone number and home address were leaked. Molitor was also “receiving pictures of guns,” with people threatening to show up at her home or workplace.

	











	“I know I am not the monster these people want to paint me out to be,” Molitor says. “I refuse to let the bully win, and I know these people just want to scare me, and I will not give them the satisfaction.” She started a GoFundMe campaign called “Support Hannah's Fight Against Online Defamation” to cover living expenses after her firing — as well as the costs of potentially taking legal action — and has so far raised more than $2,000.


	Indeed, many observers speculated that those anonymously smearing random social media commenters as Kirk's “murderers” (while an actual suspect in the slaying, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, had been arrested and charged) could face lawsuits from the individuals who had their personal information shared on the site. A number of lawyers publicly volunteered their services, including civil rights attorney J. Alejandro Barrientos.


	“Many of the people listed on the ‘Charlie's murderers' website may have viable defamation claims,” Barrientos tells Rolling Stone, noting that “many of the posts contained statements that could not be reasonably interpreted as supporting political violence” while others “only quoted Kirk's own words.” He adds that the site, by collating personal data, “may have also violated anti-doxing laws that some states began enacting in recent years.”


	Nora Benavidez, another civil rights attorney and senior counsel at the watchdog group Free Press, called the site “dangerous” in a post on X, and agrees that it may have violated anti-doxing laws. She says that “alongside employment law remedies, people on the list may have a legal case in those instances,” but cautions that under the lawless Trump administration, “these avenues for relief offer little comfort.”


	“We are witnessing a chilling attempt to silence free speech,” Benavidez says. “This list was created to intimidate, harass and exact economic consequences. And now, the president and the vice president are promising fascistic revenge to classify people and organizations as terrorists if they exercise their own First Amendment rights criticizing Kirk.” She adds that MAGA world's hypocritical and “selective support” for Constitutional rights is nothing new, and has corroded discourse in the public square. “The ‘free speech for me but not for thee' attitude Trump embodies is dangerous, divisive, and helps create, not quell, the conditions for political violence,” she says.


	Late on Sunday night, the person or group behind CharliesMurderers.com announced on X that they were “rebranding” as the “Charlie Kirk Data Foundation,” switching over to the web domain CharlieKirkData.org. The new site included a jumbled disclaimer saying that it “lawfully” collected “publicly available data” on “support for political violence,” but was “not a doxxing website” and did not identify individuals. There was no accessible list of people supposedly celebrating Kirk's murder, and a submissions portal for offending posts about him remained inactive. As of Wednesday, this page had also been taken fully offline. 

	











	While it's not clear why the two successive websites went dark — there were unsubstantiated claims that the original was hacked — Barrientos says “the change towards less inflammatory language” on CharlieKirkData.org “suggests a concern for liability,” observing that the organizers “should have thought about that more seriously” before creating CharliesMurderers.com. “I have already had one person reach out to me about harassment they've received over a post about Kirk,” he says.

	Molitor does intend to pursue legal action, per her crowdfunding page. Gilmore, for her part, has not taken a step in that direction just yet. “That said, I haven't ruled anything out,” she says. “You can't just paint people as a murderer, inciting the hell I've lived through in the last few days, and have zero accountability. It doesn't seem right.” And while both women say the threats and harassment have fallen off since CharliesMurderers.com went down, the fact remains that they could be on the radar of extremists looking to avenge Kirk. The seeming retreat of the site's author(s) in the face of potential defamation claims has not undone the damage wrought by their overreach. 


	“Could someone still be planning retribution?” says Gilmore. “That's the thought that keeps me up at night.”

EXCLUSIVE: The Golden Globes is getting a companion TV special. Titled Golden Eve, the first annual CBS primetime special, honoring recipients of the Cecil B. DeMille Award and Carol Burnett Award, will air at 8 PM on Thursday, Jan. 8, three days before the Golden Globes ceremony on the network (and streaming on Paramount+). It is part of an expanded Golden Globes partnership between CBS and Dick Clark Productions to launch Golden Week. 


Golden Eve will be the cornerstone of the new week-long initiative, which includes special programming across Paramount platforms and kick-off events leading to the 83rd Annual Golden Globes, airing live on Jan. 11, 2026 with comedian Nikki Glaser returning as host.

	Like this year's inaugural Golden Gala, which honored Cecil B. DeMille Award recipient Viola Davis and Carol Burnett Award recipient Ted Danson, the 2026 honorees will be presented with the awards at a ceremony earlier in the Golden Week. It will be taped and turned into the Golden Eve special, which will also feature curated career retrospectives, never-before-seen footage, and in-depth conversations with the award recipients.

	“We are so excited to expand our partnership with CBS and bring the Golden Globes to an even wider audience across the Paramount portfolio,” said Jay Penske, CEO of Dick Clark Productions, which is co-owned by Deadline parent PMC. With Golden Eve, we will celebrate the industry's most talented and influential figures, recognizing the recipients of the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award and Carol Burnett Award. This is a chance to properly honor those who have so profoundly shaped our culture with more than a 2-minute awards moment. This event and special will occur during ‘Golden Week', a premier cross-platform initiative with CBS that transforms the Globes into a multi-day cultural event, making it a cornerstone of the awards season.”


	This marks an evolution from this year's Golden Gala, which was not televised, with Davis' acceptance speech, which you can watch below, going viral after being released on YouTube by the Golden Globes. (The Academy's Governors Awards, where Honorary Oscar are handed out, also is not televised.)

	











	“CBS has long championed excellence in arts and entertainment and that will continue in 2026,” said Amy Reisenbach, President, CBS Entertainment. “With Golden Eve and Golden Week, we'll celebrate the Golden Globes across CBS and Paramount, creating an immersive experience that brings viewers closer to one of Hollywood's most iconic events.”


	First created in 1952 and honoring the eponymous director, the film-focused Cecil B. DeMille Award has had 69 recipients to date, including Walt Disney, Audrey Hepburn, Sidney Poitier, Judy Garland, Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Redford, Barbra Streisand, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey. The TV counterpart, the Carol Burnett Award, was created in 2019 and initially awarded to its namesake.


	“The Golden Globes has always honored the achievements of remarkable talents. With Golden Eve, we'll give viewers a more intimate look at our honorees' legacies and bring audiences closer to these icons,” said Helen Hoehne, President, Golden Globes. “We're excited to create an unforgettable night of award television with CBS and Paramount as we celebrate these legends.”


	DCP plans, hosts and produces the Golden Globes, which has been viewed in more than 185 countries and territories worldwide.

Pavement have just released Hecklers Choice: Big Gums and Heavy Lifters, their new best-of compilation; physical editions will follow on November 14 via Matador. What's more, the band has also announced that vinyl and CD versions of the soundtrack to their oddball movie Pavements—a blend of documentary, biopic, and mockumentary, all directed by Alex Ross Perry—will arrive on November 14, too. Stream their new compilation album, and check out a live video of “Grounded,” filmed at the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, below.

Hecklers Choice is the second best-of compilation of Pavement's career, arriving 15 years after their 2010 collection Quarantine the Past. The updated tracklist includes songs that have since become modern classics of the band's career, including the Spotify algorithm favorite–turned–TikTok hit “Harness Your Hopes.” Pre-orders for vinyl and CD versions of Hecklers Choice are currently ongoing.

Pavements (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is also currently available to order. Compiled by the band and Robert Greene, the movie's producer and editor, Pavements' official soundtrack combines live and rehearsal recordings from the band's 2021 reunion tour, dialogue snippets from the movie, scenes from the fake Oscar-bait biopic Range Life, and cast recordings from the Slanted! Enchanted! jukebox musical.

"Knowing all of my music is in the hands of my long-time label team makes this a full-circle moment," the country star says.

Country superstar Jason Aldean is feeling right at home at BMG. The company announced on Thursday that it has acquired the recorded music catalog encompassing Aldean's first big batch of chart-topping albums, along with publishing and recorded rights from a diverse group of nearly two dozen other artists and songwriters, totaling over 1,000 songs across multiple genres.


	The deal brings Aldean's full discography back under BMG's umbrella, following its 2017 acquisition of BBR Music Group, which originally released Aldean's music through its Broken Bow Records imprint. This acquisition spans nine studio albums, from Aldean's platinum-certified self-titled debut in 2005 to 2019's aptly-titled 9, four of which reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200. BMG continued to release Aldean's subsequent albums, including Macon, Georgia (2021–2022) and Highway Desperado (2023), which featured the Hot 100-topping hit “Try That In a Small Town.” In April, Aldean celebrated his 40th top 10 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart with “Whiskey Drink.”


	Aldean had previously signed a distribution and marketing deal with BMG in 2019, expanding the company's rights beyond the U.S. and Canada. This new acquisition ensures BMG controls the full scope of Aldean's recorded output and neighboring rights (the public performance rights associated with a sound recording).




			Trending on Billboard		







	BMG said the multi-layered acquisition is its largest catalog investment to date and part of broader investment strategy under parent company Bertelsmann's Boost program, which has surpassed $1.5 billion in music rights investments since 2021. Financial details and the seller were not disclosed.


	BMG CEO Thomas Coesfeld called the deal a “landmark” moment that “sets a new level of catalog acquisitions” at the company. “By bringing together the iconic catalog of Jason Aldean, we are strengthening our footprint in country music while expanding across genres and deepening our investment in the U.S.,” he said. “This move highlights our ability to maximize the value of music rights and represents a powerful step in BMG's strategy to be the most effective, artist-first music company in the world.”


	Aldean said he was proud of the deal, noting the long-standing support from BBR and BMG. “Knowing all of my music is in the hands of my long-time label team makes this a full-circle moment,” he said.


Jon Loba, president of Frontline Recordings in the Americas, praised Aldean's impact on country music, crediting his debut album with helping define the genre's sound and adding that “while his signature style has remained a common thread across every release, Jason has consistently pushed the envelope both sonically and lyrically.”

Backed by Sherrese Clarke's HarbourView Equity Partners, the new management firm promises to "fiercely protect artists and fight to make things happen for them."

Michelle Jubelirer and Arjun Pulijal, former top executives at Capitol Music Group, have officially launched Soft Shock, a new management and media collective designed to reshape how talent is developed and supported across entertainment. Positioned “at the edge of boutique,” Soft Shock said in its launch announcement that it will offer a wide range of services including talent management, creative marketing, brand development and content production/distribution across all media formats.


	Soft Shock is backed by a strategic investment from HarbourView Equity Partners, a four-year-old firm founded by Sherrese Clarke. HarbourView, based in Newark, NJ, has amassed nearly $3 billion in music and entertainment assets — including a mix of active and passive publishing rights and master royalty holdings — with a catalog that includes stakes in works by Kelly Clarkson, Wiz Khalifa, George Benson, Fleetwood Mac and others.

	Focused on authenticity and direct fan engagement, the company describes its mission as championing artists and driving cultural impact, adding it is committed to building a diverse roster of talent and leaning more on trust-based partnerships. Beyond music, Soft Shock will also represent a broad range of creatives — comedians, filmmakers, actors, athletes, designers, chefs and others.


	“The name Soft Shock exemplifies our approach to everything. We are humanistic and empathetic first… but we are going to fiercely protect artists and fight to make things happen for them,” said Jubelirer. “It's a volatile time for the creative psyche – that applies to talent as well as those on the business side trying to build careers –  these are people's lives. We believe creative intention, personal fulfillment, and commercial success can all co-exist. It just takes curation and bravery, or as we say, ‘a soft touch with the courage to shock.'” 


	Jubelirer, who made history as the first female chair and CEO of Capitol in its 80-plus year history, brings a wealth of experience from both the legal and music industries. Her career includes roles at Sony Music, the law firm King, Holmes, Paterno & Berliner, and Capitol, where she helped guide the careers of artists like Tyler the Creator, Frank Ocean, and M.I.A. She exited CMG in early 2024 following a restructuring at CMG parent Universal Music Group, and that same year was named Billboard‘s Women In Music executive of the year.


	Pulijal, who served as president of CMG before departing a month after Jubelirer, previously led marketing efforts for the label, crafting acclaimed campaigns for artists such as Paul McCartney, Halsey, and Maggie Rogers. He joined Capitol in 2013 after seven years at Epic Records. Together, Jubelirer and Pulijal bring over 50 years of combined experience and a track record of commercial and creative success. During their tenure at CMG, they oversaw major milestones including the rise of Ice Spice, Sam Smith and the release of the Beatles' final single “Now & Then.”


	“It may not always feel like it, but artists have the power now and it's never going back,” said Pulijal. “Telling talent ‘go viral and then we'll care' is a race to the bottom. We combat that by building scale on the side of talent through a diverse network that offers thought partnership and collaboration. All artists are creators and Soft Shock is ready to provide them with the tools, resources, and creative freedom they need to build sustainable, multi-faceted careers.”


	With Soft Shock, Jubelirer and Pulijal aim to create a top spot for talent seeking authentic collaboration, supported by HarbourView's portfolio. HarbourView CEO Sherrese Clarke cited the founders' “vision and conviction” as leaders. “I've watched Michelle fight for artists with the same courage she brings to every table we've shared, including our shared passion for the most vulnerable, and Arjun is equally relentless in reimagining what's possible,” said Clarke. “At HarbourView, we look for partners who not only shift culture but expand it – with Soft Shock's focus on artistry, equity, and impact in entertainment, they perfectly embody that.”

Marc Maron and Wanda Sykes were among the many to raise serious concerns about the threat to free speech after ABC's decision to indefinitely pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! following pressure from the Trump administration.


	Sykes was set to be a guest on Kimmel on Wednesday night, but ABC made its decision before the show was taped. “He didn't end the Ukraine war, or solve Gaza, within his first week,” Sykes said of Trump in a video on Instagram. “But he did end freedom of speech within his first year. Hey, for those of you who pray, now's the time to do it. Love you, Jimmy.”


	Maron, who's become an increasingly vocal critic of comedians who inadvertently, or outwardly, cater to the right, shared a particularly blunt video on TikTok that was at once a dire warning and a call to action. “This is government censorship. This is the Trump administration coming after people who speak out against him,” he said. “This is the end of it. If you have any concern or belief in real freedom or the Constitution and free speech — this is it. This is the deciding moment. This is what authoritarianism looks like right now in this country. It's happening.”

	











	Maron also put ABC's decision in the context of the free-speech debates that have been swirling around the comedy world the past few years, and urged those ostensible “free-speech warriors” to take note. “This isn't about saying the r-word or the t-word or any of that,” he said. “This is government censorship. This isn't fucking Twitter. This isn't people getting canceled because of a cultural pile-on. This is the United States government silencing voices that they disagree with.… Look, if they can come for Kimmel, they can come for anybody. This is happening. It's time to act, figure it out, find a way, come together. Push back. Because if this goes, it's over.”

	











	Emmy-winning Hacks star Jean Smart shared a photo on Instagram of herself and Kimmel, writing that she was “horrified” with ABC's decision. “What Jimmy said was FREE speech, not hate speech,” she said. “People seem to only want to protect free speech when it suits THEIR agenda. Though I didn't agree at ALL with Charlie Kirk; his shooting death sickened me; and should have sickened any decent human being. What is happening to our country?”

	Others to express their shock and dismay online include Ben Stiller, who simply tweeted, “This isn't right.” Mike Birbiglia, echoing Maron's sentiment about the free-speech debates in comedy, added, “I've spent a lot of time in public and private defending comedians I don't agree with. If you're a comedian and you don't call out the insanity of pulling Kimmel off the air — don't bother spouting off about free speech anymore.” 


	California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the Republican Party “does not believe in free speech,” adding, “Buying and controlling media platforms. Firing commentators. Canceling shows. These aren't coincidences. Its's coordinated. And it's dangerous.… They are censoring you in real time.” 


	Barack Obama echoed this sentiment, saying, “After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like.”


	He added, “This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it.”

	In a video posted to social media, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said, “If you don't raise your voices right now about the assault on free speech, about Donald Trump's decision to, disgustingly, exploit the murder of Charlie Kirk so as to try to permanently render powerless and impotent those who politically oppose him, there may be no democracy to save a year from now.”


	The decision to pull Kimmel came after conservative outcry over a joke the host made during a recent monologue about the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk. Among those criticizing Kimmel was Trump's Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, who called on licensed broadcasters to stop airing Kimmel's show. Not long after, Nexstar and Sinclair — two giant media conglomerates that own myriad ABC affiliates around the country — announced their decision to preempt Kimmel. ABC made its decision to pull the show soon after.

Influencer Keeley Whitcomb is mourning the heartbreaking loss of her two children after a car crash on September 15 near Hastings, Nebraska. Her husband, Blake Whitcomb, remains in intensive care following the accident. Whitcomb, who often posted Disney-themed content and worked as a travel agent for Dreams Travel Consulting, shared the devastating news with followers on TikTok. 

“To my friends who follow me: yesterday was the worst day of my life. An accident has taken my two children from me and put my husband in the intensive care unit. Consider me out of the Disney office,” she wrote.

According to local outlets NTV News and KLKN-TV, the Adams County Sheriff's Department responded to a two-vehicle crash at an uncontrolled rural intersection. Blake, 33, was driving a pickup truck that collided with a farm silage truck driven by 66-year-old Dale Feik.

Both drivers were transported to Mary Lanning Memorial Hospital. The couple's children, aged 7 and 10, were passengers in the pickup truck and were pronounced dead at the scene.

In the days after the accident, Keeley shared emotional tributes to her children on TikTok. Honoring her 10-year-old daughter, Laynee Rae, she wrote, “10 years was not long enough for me. Forever on my mind, my Laynee Rae. 9/15/2025.”

Being a step-parent is a whole different kind of love. 9/15/2025

She also remembered her stepson, Ryder, in a heartfelt post. “Once upon a time, I met a boy. I fell in love with him the moment I met him. Though I didn't know him all his life, I got to know him for 3 years. Being a step-parent is a whole different kind of love. 9/15/2025.”

The family's heartbreak has been felt across their community and online. Ryder's grandmother, Cheryl Gardner, shared her own tribute on Facebook: 

“Yesterday, Heaven got a new angel. Fly high Ryder and thank you for blessing me, if only for a short time. God has bigger plans for you my little buddy.”

Fans and friends have filled Keeley's social media posts with messages of love and support as she navigates unimaginable grief. Another comment read: We are crying with you. We have no words.” 

“I just watched all 3 videos. This is the first time you've ever been on my FYP, but as a mom, I cried for you. I'm so, so sorry.”

Another comment read: “praying for your sweet family, you have angels watching over you ❤”

	As music memoirs go, Yusuf/Cat Stevens' Cat on the Road to Findout couldn't have been more aptly titled. Over the last nearly 60 years, few in pop have traveled such a twisty path, as the bearded pop troubadour went from Cat Stevens, teen idol, to Cat Stevens, becalmed balladeer, to Yusuf Islam, man of religion and occasional music. Along the way, he battled tuberculosis, almost drowned, had a fling with Carly Simon, and became one of the first major pop stars to be canceled after he weighed in (in ways he felt were misunderstood, mishandled, or misinterpreted) on the Ayatollah Khomeini declaring a fatwah against writer Salman Rushdie in 1989.


	That tale is laid out in the book, published Thursday in the U.K. and Oct. 7 in this country. Below, some tea from the tillerman.


	How did Steven Georgiou become Cat Stevens in 1965? As he writes, part of the inspiration came from then-current film titles like Cat Ballou and What's New Pussycat? and partly from a hit at the time called “Walkin' My Cat Named Dog.” A girlfriend also told him he looked like a cat when she saw him reclining on a couch. As he says, “All I did was add ‘Cat'  to my first name, shifting Steven from head to tail: Hey-ho! ‘Cat Stevens' was born.” That girlfriend — Christine, whom he calls his first “real love” — would also inspire the decidedly non-catty classic “The First Cut Is the Deepest.”












	In 1966, Yusuf scored his first hit with the whimsical symphonic pop of “I Love My Dog.” There was only one problem: He didn't own such an animal. “Journalists were certain to pounce on me with probing questions about my own fluffy, beloved friend,” Yusuf writes. Luckily, he was walking the streets of London's Soho district one night and came upon a stray black dachshund tied to a street post. Yusuf quickly adopted the dog, whom he named Willemina, and now had an actual pet he could talk about while promoting the record.

	In 1971, Yusuf met Carly Simon, who was booked to open his show at the Troubadour club in L.A. “Touring puts you in sensitive, close contact with those journeying with you,” he writes, adding, “It was difficult to keep away from Carly,” and the two “got to know each other extremely well.” In her own memoir, Simon confirmed that “Anticipation” arose from the time she was waiting for him to show up at her place for a date. She's never revealed the inspiration behind “You're So Vain” (only to a TV executive who paid $50,000 to charity to find out), but Yusuf, jokingly or not, thinks he knows. “I never understood the endless hide-and-seek of finding out who ‘You're So Vain' was about, bro! Naturally, I knew it was me!” (Bonus info: We also learn from his book that Yusuf is not immune to using the term “bro.”)


	As Cat Stevens, Yusuf came to embody the peace-loving, soul-searching stereotype of the Seventies troubadour. But as a child, he writes, he admits he “gravitated toward any danger-filled subjects of a magnetic, action-driven nature involving as much violence, destruction, and death as possible,” like horror films. After seeing the film version of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities, set during the French Revolution, Yusuf recalls building miniature balsa-wood guillotines as a hobby. (They could have come in handy for hard-headed women … and men.) This odd pastime did also serve to bond him with music, though: He says he would listen to his sister's LP collection while making them.


	After he finished Tea for the Tillerman, the album that installed him in the soft-rock pantheon along with Simon, James Taylor, and a select few others, Yusuf was informed by label head Chris Blackwell that “Wild World” was an obvious hit. But Yusuf says he felt the song was too “verse and chorus,” and thought someone else, namely reggae artist Jimmy Cliff, should record it instead, with Yusuf himself as producer. Cliff was up for it, but apparently nothing more came of the idea, and Yusuf's original version of the song wound up going top 20.

	Yusuf writes that he was approached by director Hal Ashby about contributing songs to his 1971 movie about the bond between a young guy obsessed with death and a quirky elderly woman who loved life. Yusuf says that in addition to hearing some of his songs in a rough edit of the film, he was asked to write new ones and dashed off demos of two semi-competed tunes — “If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out” and “Don't Be Shy” — with the idea of finishing them later. Instead, Ashby loved the raw takes and used those instead.

	











	Why didn't a soundtrack with all his songs appear until 2022, more than 50 years later? As Yusuf writes, he wasn't thrilled with the idea of a premature hits package, so he and his lawyers decided not to give the go-ahead for a companion album. (As far as lead actress Ruth Gordon singing “Sing Out” and playing piano, he writes, “She sounded dreadfully out of tune, but that was the way Hal wanted. So be it.”)


	To support his mathematically baffling concept album Numbers, Stevens, then at the peak of his pop moment, went on the road with an elaborate set that included what he calls a “white sail backdrop,” a “sparkly red-top piano and automatic pop-up stool.” The concerts would open with Stevens popping out of four colored boxes. He hired magicians to open the shows (whose tricks, he says, included “sawing a luscious blonde lady in half”). The final touring troupe included not just musicians, crew, and magicians but “countless doves and rabbits.” And let's not forget about the tiger that would “dramatically appear” in a cage on the stage.


	Following a near-drowning incident in Malibu in 1975, Yusuf began his road to a new faith, which, as he writes, involved adjustments for everyone. His name change to Yusuf Islam wasn't too difficult: “That would be easy for my family and English-speaking friends to pronounce,” he writes. But his on-the-road rock & roll lifestyle took a hit: “There was no more room for ‘Freelove & Goodbye' relationships, that sort of idea was not allowed in Islam.” While making Back to Earth, his last “Cat Stevens” album, he would take prayer breaks, which was “quite tough, especially if something was really cooking, musically.”


	For that album cover, he also decided to announce his conversion by way of using a “decorative gold Arabic calligraphy” for the credits. But, as he writes, the government of Malaysia was not thrilled with seeing “Allah” in calligraphy on the cover and asked for it to be removed. At his urging, Yusuf's record company slapped a sticker over that part of the cover and removed it from later pressings. Collector's item alert!


	According to Yusuf, he was invited to participate in the 1985 all-star charity concert, in London. By then. he had given away his musical instruments, hadn't performed live in years, and admits he was “scared witless” when he arrived at Wembley. Still, he prepped a new song, “In the End,” that he would perform a cappella. As the day dragged on, he was told that John's set was running longer than anyone had expected, and Yusuf's song was cut from the lineup. As he writes, “My heart sank like a rock.” When he arrived back home and watched the end of the broadcast thanks to a time delay, he saw his name listed in the closing credits.

	











	The incident that Yusuf writes would be a “blistering asteroid” in his life started with an Islamic scholar who shared portions of Rushdie's book, which the singer found to be “unbelievably rude and offensive.” Yusuf writes that he contacted the book's publisher, asking for it be pulled from circulation and also spoke with Islamic scholars, who told him that any retribution would not involve vigilantism.

	During a subsequent public talk about this conversation, he writes that an “undercover journalist” from a tabloid asked him if thought Rushdie should be put to death for his book. Yusuf writes that he addressed the question “as openly as possible” but “forgot to mention the questionability of the dreaded fatwah.” In the book, Yusuf feels a public apology he wrote was largely ignored and that the press went with its take that he was “an unrepentant supporter of the ayatollah and his fatwah.… Alas, I was not knowledgeable or eloquent enough to explain my stance on the matter as clearly at the time.”  


	According to his memoir, what he calls a “shadow banning” by some journalists simply pushed him into even greater devotion to his faith and studying “the status of fatwahs.” But Yusuf still looks back at that incident as “an onslaught of misunderstanding and hatred like nothing I'd ever experienced — before or since that day.”

When it works well, film marketing can feel something like a magic trick. Maybe even a superpower?

Macon Blair's “The Toxic Avenger” recently made headlines with a marketing move that saw several outlets reporting the film had relieved at least $5 million in medical debt through a hefty donation from Cineverse that the film's ticket sales would supplement. For every additional $1 million “The Toxic Avenger” made in theaters, another million in medical bills would also disappear. The patients the campaign would help came from a wide pool of people in need — with debt resold at a fire-sale price.

 










That story — about a scrappy indie movie sticking it to America's broken healthcare system through a triumphant rush on the box office — is true, mostly. After three weeks, Cineverse has erased at least $7 million in medical debt, thanks to “The Toxic Avenger.” The activation lines up well with the themes of Macon Blair's mutant movie, starring Peter Dinklage as a new embodiment of the cult-classic hero.

“Medial debt is crippling for American families,” said Lauren McCarthy, senior vice president of marketing at Cineverse. “We've all experienced it, and we all know someone who's experienced it.”  

The final amount of medical debt forgiven by the studio could land closer to $8 million, if it makes much more in theaters, and if you account for other donations made directly. The “Toxic Avenger” activation cost just $70,000 for the studio to pull off, and plenty of other low-budget releases could be doing this, too.

“One dollar, on average, erases around a hundred dollars or more of medical debt,” explained Daniel Lempert, vice president of communications and marketing at the nonprofit Undue Medical Debt.

“It took us a while to wrap our heads around that math,” said McCarthy. “But it was one of the most exciting parts of the process [promoting this film], hearing that all this was possible.” 

“Medical debt tends to be the cheapest of the debts,” said Lempert. That's “because the demands on people, to pay for healthcare through a copayment or a deductible, are increasing.” 

Unpaid medical debt is exceedingly common in the United States. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading source for healthcare data, estimates that more than 100 million people are struggling with medical debt today. That puts the total at a staggering $220 billion or more — a number that shows just how overwhelming and urgent the crisis has become.

 










“It's very likely that figure is an undercount because this is a crisis that's very hard to track,” Lempert continued. “A lot of people will borrow from friends and family, and the number one reason people will do a GoFundMe campaign tends to be around healthcare debt.”

Facing its own challenges in a finicky market, “The Toxic Avenger” initially had trouble finding a home. Rumors that it was “unmarketable,” possibly for gratuitous violence, swirled after it premiered at Fantastic Fest in 2023. When Cineverse rescued it last year, their recent triumph with the extremely graphic “Terrifier 3” only made speculation about its content gorier.

Partnering with Undue Medical Debt was a smart course correction that played on the film's heart. “At its core, [‘The Toxic Avenger' is about] activism and optimism that makes the movie so charming,” said McCarthy. “That's why it's had this consistent fandom that's so highly engaged.” 

McCarthy said “The Toxic Avenger” cost the studio less than $5 million combined to acquire and market. By comparison, Cineverse spent $500,000 marketing “Terrifier 3,” which could have theoretically paid for $50 million in medical debt when the resale rate is $1 to every $100.

“I got an initial quote for a [another stunt] that could have been an option,” said McCarthy, who described a flash mob spectacle that would've cost $50,000 at least. “When you think about the frivolity of what that money could do, and what we are doing instead, it puts things in perspective. … We do a lot of stunts because we certainly don't put anywhere near the budget into paid media than any other studio does. We do things that activate the community online that they really respond to. There's been a lot of stunts. Then we rely on organic digital pickup and we amplify a bit, but we are relying on people to see the stunt, get excited by the stunt, think it's funny, and share it with their friends, and that makes the community bigger.” 

 










Lempert broke down “The Toxic Avenger” math as a case study for the activation strategy, examining ticket sales from opening day on August 29 to the present. The effort has been widely praised on social media, and discussing the initiative on Reddit, several fans joked about the amount of debt forgiveness that could be achieved with the amount of money Hollywood spends on big-budget films.

“People are finding catharsis in narratives about the healthcare system and inability to pay and who deserves access to care that helps keep them and their family alive,” said Lempert. You may have heard of Undue Medical Debt before now for their 2016 stunt on “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.” The gag for the political talk show was touted as one-upping Oprah for the biggest charity giveaway in television history, and it tested an important concept for Undue.

“The model is very compelling,” said Lempert. Undue has promoted two other films, including 2019's “Buffaloed” with Zoey Deutch and last year's “Ordinary Angels” with Hilary Swank.

“It speaks to how pervasive this crisis is that we have such an eclectic roster of partners,” he said. The team at Undue will work with “The Toxic Avenger” PR team to personalize literature that will be sent out to patients with forgiven debt, thanks to the film, later this year.  

 










“We're slightly slammed, so we haven't fully gotten there, but I'm hoping that it can be as delightful and surprising to the people receiving the letters as possible,” said McCarthy around the film's opening weekend. “We're going to try to cook up something that is charming enough for them to want to talk about it.”

“The Toxic Avenger” has so far made a self-reported $2.9 million for Cineverse (although lower insider estimates place it closer to $2.3 million), and Blair's mutant movie doesn't seem to have been substantively aided by the Undue partnership. 

Still, it's a clever bang-for-your-buck PR purchase from Cineverse — which continues to face blowback for the political reputation of “Terrifier 3” — and a super-charged victory for the nonprofit. 

Working with Undue Medical Debt is an opportunity for your film to become an “empathetic outlet,” Lempert said. The organizers are easy to reach through their website, and no matter what happens at the box office, discussing Americans' everyday battles with the healthcare system can “destigmatize an issue that is certainly no fault of any patients,” he said. 

“The Toxic Avenger” is coming to digital release on September 30.

"Sony Music Group and Spotify have long been mutually committed to advancing music streaming and growing the marketplace for all," Sony Music Group chairman Rob Stringer said.

Spotify and Sony Music Group have reached an agreement for new multiyear global licensing deals in recorded music and publishing, the companies announced Wednesday.


	The companies didn't disclose specifics on the deals but said the agreements means “songwriters share more directly in the growth of streaming.”




	“Sony Music Group and Spotify have long been mutually committed to advancing music streaming and growing the marketplace for all,” Sony Music Group chairman Rob Stringer said in a statement. “This is further reflected in our new agreements where we're working to develop futuristic approaches that ensure our artists and songwriters remain appropriately compensated for their work, and audiences are getting a high-quality experience that's ever evolving.”

	With Sony secured, Spotify has officially reached new agreements with all three of the major music companies, after announcing new deals with Universal Music Group back in January and Warner Music Group a month later.

	For the first time, Spotify now holds direct licensing agreements with all three major music publishers, a notable development after the streaming company caught major heat in the industry last year over Spotify's controversial audiobook bundling strategy that led to lower payments to publishers and songwriters. The Mechanical Licensing Collective sued over that move, though Spotify won as the suit was dismissed earlier this year. 

	











	“Our partnership with Sony is built on a shared drive to shape the future of music,” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said in a statement. “Together, we're accelerating the pace of innovation to create powerful new opportunities and increasing revenue for artists and songwriters. These agreements aren't just a milestone; they're a catalyst for building a more dynamic and prosperous music ecosystem for everyone.”

	President Donald Trump and his family are building a multinational cryptocurrency, real estate, and licensing empire on the back of his presidency, catapulting his estimated worth by billions. 


	The net worths of individual members of Congress are estimated to range between the tens of thousands of dollars and more than half a billion. The justices of the Supreme Court are estimated to hold a collective net worth of over $64 million. 


	Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.) is introducing legislation to try and combat the culture of political profiteering that has become endemic to virtually every corner of the federal government — and supercharged under the second Trump administration. “If you have egotistical, narcissistic, corrupt people in government, you will have an egotistical, narcissistic, and corrupt government,” Kim says. “But if you have people who are dedicated to public service, people who are honest, you can have an altogether different kind of government. I want the American people to see the choice.”

	











	On Thursday, Kim unveiled “The Restoring Trust in Public Servants Act,” which would prevent America's most powerful elected and appointed officials across all three branches of government from enriching themselves off their offices. The bill would prevent members of Congress (as well as their families and employees), the president, vice president, Senate-confirmed political appointees, and judicial officers — including members of the Supreme Court — from trading stocks and participating in a host of financial activities that could present conflicts of interest. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	During the second Trump administration, profiteering off one's elected office is no longer viewed as an impropriety, but the standard of conduct set by the president himself. Sources close to Trump told Rolling Stone in May that the president has privately complained that it was “stupid” not to cash in harder during his first term, and is making up for lost time. Already this term we've seen the Trump family build out a blossoming crypto empire, launch all manner of licensing deals, and announce new international real estate investments.

	The new bill is similar to anti-corruption legislation Kim introduced during his time in the House, but the new measure expands the category of covered assets to include crypto and other “digital assets,” as well as the scope of public officials subject to the ban. 


	In addition, the act would prevent members of Congress from accepting outside earned income and from serving on the board of an association or corporation, with limited exceptions for nonprofit work. The congressional lobbying ban would be expanded to cover the entirety of a former lawmaker's life. 


	“I know people in Congress where if you're a corporation, you can't get a meeting with that person unless you donate from your corporate PAC to them. I find that to be wholly unacceptable,” Kim tells Rolling Stone. 


	“We should just have a single standard,” Kim says. “Everyone's a public servant. Everyone swears the oath in exactly the same way, everyone's trying to protect and defend the Constitution by virtue of our jobs and our oath. We should also just have a single standard when it comes to ethics, when it comes to our behavior and our role here.” 


	Kim was elected to the Senate to fill the seat vacated by disgraced former Sen. Bob Menendez — who is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence after being convicted on federal corruption charges. Among his peers, Kim has perhaps the best vantage point of the chaos and distrust that the financial abuse conducted by those in power can sow among a community.

	Menendez was caught with literal bars of gold in his closet, but the investigations into his foreign dealings revealed a history of leveraging his position in the Senate to secure bribes and other boons. While Menendez ran afoul of federal law, his actions are only a few degrees removed from the open graft being normalized in the White House. As the president openly flaunts his business dealings abroad and at home — even hosting a pay-for-access dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort for investors in his cryptocurrency schemes — it's clear that existing legislation and enforcement mechanisms are grossly insufficient. 

	











	“It shows just how limited our system of checks and balances really is,” Kim says. “So much of our checks and balances as a country really rested on norms of behavior. When you're dealing with someone like the president who just doesn't abide by that, you see how the system really falls short to be able to address that.” 


	The lack of established, universal, and widely enforceable rules restricting public officials ability to profit off investments and other speculative activities both during their time in office and after has long been an issue — see the stock indexes tracking the stock trading activities of House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her husband. Past attempts to enact trading bans have stalled, been amended into effective uselessness, or devolved into performative political bickering aimed at individual members. In the second Trump era, billionaires are seemingly able to directly purchase favor and influence at the White House, and graft is the name of the game.


	In Kim's view, the heart of public service has been lost in the dysfunction. 


	“I am trying to counter that kind of broader attack and assault on public service that I feel is going to be damaging for generations,” he says. “I'm simultaneously trying to encourage people in public service while trying to clean up and restore trust in what it means to be a public.”

	Kim recounts a former boss at the State Department, where he worked in his early career, who told him that “you don't have good government unless you have good people working in government.”


	“I love this job so much, I could do this for free,” he adds. “We only need 535 people in Congress out of a country of 340 million people. Surely we can find 435 in the House and 100 in the Senate that are willing to say, ‘I am so honored to do this job, I am happy to divest and assure the American people that I'm doing this in the right way.'”

Lori Harvey, the daughter of entertainment icon Steve Harvey, is bravely opening up about her health and a painful condition she has been suffering with since she was a teenager. 

In an interview on the “SheMD” podcast with Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi and Mary Alice Haney on Tuesday, September 16, Harvey discussed how receiving polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis diagnoses ended years of not knowing what she was struggling with and being dismissed by medical professionals. 

“I've been so frustrated. I've been going to my gynecologist because I've just been feeling like something's off in my body,” she said, People reports. “But every time I go to her, she's like, ‘You're fine, you're fine, you're fine. Nothing's wrong.' And I was like, ‘But I don't feel fine. I feel like something is just off.'”

A visit to Los Angeles-based OB-GYN Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi gave her a diagnosis of a condition Harvey had been experiencing since she was 16. “I was like, what's happening?” she said of her body before learning of her diagnosis. “I'm like, okay, something is not adding up here. My body's trying to tell me something, but I'm not getting the answers that I need.”

Before learning of her diagnosis, Harvey felt “sad” and described the experience as “disheartening.” She continued, “I used to have the most excruciating periods of my life, every single time I felt like I needed to go to the hospital, just crazy cramps. I'm taking 800 milligrams of Ibuprofen. Nothing is working, it's just debilitating. “They'd be like, ‘Oh, just take some Tylenol, you'll be fine.' And I'm like, ‘There's no way this is normal.' And [Aliabadi] told me, ‘Yeah, babe, you're right. It was not normal, and I'm so sorry that you've just been living with this.' So she literally changed my life.”

A post shared by SHE MD Podcast (@shemdpodcast)

Speaking out about her diagnosis and how she continued to push for answers can help raise awareness for endometriosis and help other women who find themselves experiencing similar symptoms. 

A clip from Harvey's interview was shared on the “SheMD” Instagram page on September 17, and fans used it as a way to show their support for the actress. “Thank you for sharing and helping to raise awareness about PCOS and Endometriosis,” a comment reads.

“It's so frustrating how so many women's symptoms just get brushed aside as'“normal' you are your best advocate. So glad she kept pushing for more!” another person shared. 

“Omg… she literally explained it to the tee!” a third person wrote. “Explaining to different doctors and the making you feel like its just mundane and like I was making it a big deal.”

Ray3, the companies hope, can become a staple to rival Google


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	The race to bring cinematic-level video to studios and filmmakers took another turn Thursday as AI video company Luma AI announced it was partnering with Adobe to release its new Ray3 model. 


	Starting today, the AI video company is making Ray3 available to customers of Adobe's generative-AI app Adobe Firefly.  Paid Firefly customers will get unlimited AI-assisted video over the next two weeks, with a cost structure kicking in after that. Other clients, such as Hollywood studios and streamers, can order the tool separately for their filmmakers. With the deal, Luma hopes its tech tool will become a staple for the industry.

	Backed by Amazon, a16z and others, Luma AI's tech aims to make AI-generated cinematic video more realistic. The company is in an arms race with Runway AI, Google Veo and others. Hollywood studios and filmmakers, the companies hope, will use the tools to generate video in-screen without requiring shoots, cutting down on costs. The quality of the AI-generated videos will be a key determining factor in the update of the new technology. To what extent AI video can, or should, replace physical production remains an open question.


	Luma has been releasing a steady stream of models since it came on the scene in early 2024 with Dream Machine. The tool was a quantum leap forward in what short-form video could do with basic text prompts. Ray3 continues the trend of short 10-second videos without dialogue but with a higher level of realism.


	In a call with THR, Luma AI CEO called Ray3 “the most intelligent video model on the market.” He touted its ability to “reason,” an at-times squishy AI term that essentially means the model can interrogate itself to improve on an existing task instead of requiring users to keep refining their prompts.

	











	“If coders get intelligent models, why shouldn't creators get intelligent models?” Jain said. In a demonstration, he showed a complex prompt that asks for the model to have characters turning to a light while it changes colors, followed by an explosion. The six-part sequence, he said, could not be handled by most models.


	Ray3 also provides the ability to doodle on an image, drawing out the trajectory of a character on screen, with the tool then generating a video of the movement.


	“With Ray3 now available in the Firefly app, Adobe customers are among the first to gain access to a powerful new video model that amplifies imagination and transforms workflows,” Adobe's v-p of new GenAI business ventures Hannah Elsakr said in a statement. “We can't wait to see how they use it to bring their ideas to life.”


	Veo 3 remains a leader thanks to Google's reach, tech and ability to train on millions of YouTube videos.

If your definition of a comedy is “Barbie,” “Deadpool vs. Wolverine,” or “A Minecraft Movie,” the studio comedy is doing brilliantly. But if you're thinking Gen Z doesn't have its own “Bridesmaids,” “The Hangover,” or “Anchorman,” you're not alone in wondering what happened to this genre? 

Is this a joke? Perhaps not a funny one. 

At the start of July, IndieWire's chief film critic David Ehrlich declared “The Naked Gun” the most important movie of the summer. That's because it's a no-doubt-about-it studio comedy and spoof film. It's not comedy packaged with superheroes or toy and video game sales, and though it's a continuation of a popular series, it doesn't feel like a sequel cash grab. Movies like it are becoming rarer, especially at the box office. And when you have a lack of diverse options in theaters, fewer people start showing up. Theaters need movies that are monumentally dumb on purpose like “The Naked Gun” as much as they need the mega blockbusters that are monumentally dumb on accident.

So did Liam Neeson and director Akiva Schaffer save America? “The Naked Gun” has just surpassed $100 million worldwide, but only about half of that came from domestic dollars. That's a respectable number that should likely turn a profit for the studio, but it's not a mega culture-defining hit that would singlehandedly bring studio comedies off streamers and into theaters (I predict now that “The Naked Gun” will do gangbusters once it hits PVOD or Paramount+). It may also be the most successful “traditional studio comedy” in years.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






In the five years before the COVID-19 pandemic, at least six different sure-fire studio comedies surpassed $100 million at the domestic box office. That's when you filter out the animated movies, sequels, the family comedies, and some of the sequels like “Pitch Perfect” that might be better defined as musicals. 

But that half-decade produced hits like “Trainwreck,” “Girls Trip,” “Bad Moms,” “Daddy's Home” and its sequel, and “Spy.” None of those can be confused with anything other than a studio comedy in the truest sense. If we're being generous to the comedy definition, “Central Intelligence,” “Sausage Party,” and “Crazy Rich Asians” all help the case that people once came to the theater to laugh.

Post-COVID, the most successful original comedy of the last five years is the adventure/romance/comedy “The Lost City” with Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum. It's the only bona fide comedy to surpass $100 million domestic. The next biggest hits, including “Anyone but You,” “The Naked Gun,” “Ticket to Paradise,” “Cocaine Bear,” “No Hard Feelings,” and “One of Them Days,” were all in the $50-90 million range domestic (according to data via Comscore).

“There's a real drop-off in performance of comedies that were well-reviewed and well-received by audiences,” one studio distribution chief told IndieWire. “So you've got to start with, OK, what happened? How did this genre go away?”

 










The distro chief said that, while comedies started declining before COVID, the pandemic really accelerated things. The first culprit is the amount of “free comedy” available on streaming. Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max are loaded with stand-up comedy specials that don't require the same barrier to entry as the act of driving to a theater and buying a ticket.

When we raised the point to other distribution chiefs that studio comedy films have all moved to streaming, they challenged with “which ones?” “Happy Gilmore 2” is a great example of a comedy that has broken through on streaming and could have been a box office hit had it gotten the chance, though it may be the only good example.

But streamers are also littered with B-comedies that, in another era, might have done modest but forgettable business in theaters. We're looking at you, “The Pickup,” “Heads of State,” “Back in Action,” “Kinda Pregnant,” and “Summer of 69,” all of which were released this year. Those movies are reserved for streaming these days, likely for good reason.

Another distribution chief argued that the so-called “four-quadrant studio comedy” just doesn't work anymore. Today's audiences don't want just Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn paired up, they want genre films with more nuance or niche comedies like “Friendship” that can find a very targeted and passionate audience. 

 










But certain studios seem to be staying away entirely. Sony and Paramount have a few of those aforementioned hits, but Warner Bros., Disney, and Universal have been moving away from the genre and toward more IP. Studios are also staying away from a title like “Happy Gilmore 2” because of its budget. The first distribution chief speculates the Adam Sandler sequel likely cost Netflix a fortune of between $120-150 million to accommodate all the cameos, back-end deals, and special effect-driven gags. 

With the box office as depressed as it is, would that movie still be seen as a hit in theaters?

“If your budgets are reasonable, you can afford to hit singles and doubles. That's a good business. But what you can't do with a challenge genre like comedies is swing for the fences,” the first distributor said. “I wouldn't want to have that risk. If you make that movie for $75 million, maybe I'd take that risk.”

One idea floated by that distributor is to simply lengthen theatrical windows. It's the same challenge for other tentpole movies, but for comedies, the gap between theaters to streaming can be exceptionally short, and audiences are just fine waiting for them. Another potential solution: don't charge for “The Naked Gun” as much as it costs to see “Jurassic World.” That, however, would require a big shift in how exhibitors do business.

 










But if there's something that gave the distributors we spoke to hope, it's that the best comedies have phenomenal word of mouth. Look at movies like “The Hangover” or “Bridesmaids,” movies that did not open huge in their first weekend, but then saw domestic total multiples of at least six times what they first opened to. These movies were slow burn hits that people had to talk about and see, and those movies stayed successful in theaters for weeks on end.

For as hilarious as “The Naked Gun” is, it did only a respectable multiple of just over 3, as did movies like “No Hard Feelings” and “Freakier Friday.” But the poster-child of a late-blooming success story in the post-COVID era is “Anyone but You,” which has a staggering 14.72 multiple after opening to just $6 million and looking like a flop. Stars Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell famously manufactured a phony real-life romance — all while Sweeney was still engaged — that got internet sleuths buzzing and bolstered audience interest to see what chemistry might be on screen.

Another studio distribution chief said that, while comedy hasn't quite recovered from the pandemic or strikes, it's heating up. What's more, this is a “copycat business,” and the moment the next studio comedy hits it big, everyone else in town will have three similar ones in the pipeline.

 










“A movie can still open to $6 [million] and do $90 [million],” the executive said. “That to me, there's a lot of hope, because if the movie is funny, you can have a 15 multiple. If it delivers, the numbers are there, there absolutely can be another ‘Hangover.”

Another New York Fashion Week has come and gone, and if you were lucky, you got to see some of music's biggest stars play sets in some tiny rooms — or at the very least, stand next to them at the open bar. Plus, there's the fashion! Off-White came to New York for a second year in a row, Ralph Lauren went in-office (er, studio), Coach paid homage to the concrete jungle and more. From the runway to the afters and everything in between, here's all that Rolling Stone saw during this iteration of fashion's biggest week in New York City.

After heading out to Bridgehampton last year, Ralph Lauren's Spring 2026 women's show was a homecoming of sorts, with the brand returning to the designer's private studio on Madison Avenue. The show featured big hats, sharp tailoring, and looks that made us upset that we're coming out of summer and not going into it.

A party at Jean's celebrating jeans. Do you guys get it? Re/Done cleared all of the tables of one of the city's most if-you-know-you-know spots for a celebration of its FW25 campaign. At one point, New York-based band Arsun played a set that you could have sworn was about to start a mosh pit in one of the city's coolest dining rooms. Then, Dutch Faro and Earl Cave from The Gash hopped on for an impromptu set.

This one wasn't for the folks with a regular sleep schedule. Red Bull's big takeover of Square Diner kicked off at midnight on Sunday and went for 24 hours, playing host to runway regulars with some serious stamina or jet lag, or both. French house-music duo Polo & Pan kept the vibes up, and folks didn't seem to mind (or know) the time. Red Bull gives you wings — or, at the very least, chicken-tender baskets.

One thing about Usher, he's going to stay booked and busy. After popping out at Ralph Lauren's show in Bridgehampton last year, the star is back with the brand's fragrance arm as its new global brand ambassador. The eight-time Grammy winner presided over a packed room of champagne flutes and sharp tailoring, answering the question: What if Jay Gatsby had thrown his parties in FiDi instead?

It's not every night there's some kind of special edition Fiat 500e designed by Giorgio Armani right next to some late-night Hostess snacks. We call that range. Nearby, Sofi Tukker played one of the best sets of the week as Nylon celebrated fashion week at the Classic Car Club at Pier 76.

Saks Fifth Avenue has made quite a reputation for throwing a must-attend fete to kick off fashion's biggest week in New York. While this year's party was scaled back in some ways — it's tough to beat Caroline Polachek's set back in February — it did have everything a good party needs: a champagne tower, passed French dip, and Thom Browne (pictured — and who we'll forgive for showing in Paris this season).

J.Crew's been doing New York Fashion Week big the past couple of years: Either it's an indie-sleaze moment with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs or it's a full-on concert with the Strokes at Pier 17. This year, the brand took over the old Germania Bank building at 190 Bowery to preview a short pop-up at the location, complete with the Dare (pictured) in attendance. 

Pandora kicked off its New York Fashion Week with an immersive experience, complete with a sound chamber and tattoo stations, all serenaded by the sounds of FKA Twigs (pictured). Katseye came through (a couple days before their big VMAs win), Tyla and Ciara ran into each other, and attendees took turns taking in a light-and-shadow photography experience.

Turns out it's not just how you look, it's also about how you smell. Miu Miu Beauty's soiree to celebrate the brand's new fragrance served as an amuse-bouche to the New York Fashion Week celebrations. Emma Chamberlain sat at an elaborate Scrabble setup, Lola Tung took a break from hearing The Summer I Turned Pretty takes, and Maggie Rogers (pictured) performed a short set, including a beautiful even-more-stripped down rendition of “Alaska.”

Inspired by the streets of New York, the collection featured treated leathers, oversize pants, and rub-off foil elements. “I thought about a delicate balance of polish and shine with grit … the beauty of how the city comes back to life every morning,” creative director Stuart Vevers said.

For Tory Burch‘s Spring/Summer 2026 collection, the brand found an old bank in Brooklyn adorned with giant columns and marble floors. Model and actress Emily Ratajkowski walked in the show while a star-studded (Emma Roberts, Jessica Alba) front row looked on.

If you were outside this fashion week, it was hard to miss Olandria Carthen and Nic Vansteenberghe (“Nicolandria” to the Love Island fans) hitting up shows and attending parties. On Friday, the pair posted up at Boom, in the Meatpacking District, at Off-White's afterparty following the brand showing in New York for the second year in a row.

Todd Snyder‘s Spring/Summer 2026 show turned into a father-son outing for Brendan Fraser and his son, Holden.

A rock-brained football horror movie that's as subtle as being sacked by a 300 lb. defensive lineman and somehow only half as much fun, Justin Tipping's “Him” is a single idea stretched out for half the length of an NFL broadcast (spoiler alert: half of an eternity is still an eternity). That idea: What if football was literally a religion? Holy shit. But wait, there's more. What if the sport's chosen one narratives, hyper-zealous fandoms, and national Sunday worship services weren't an extension of Christianity, but rather a demonic inversion of it? What if becoming a god meant signing a contract with the devil, and getting there required otherwise good men to sacrifice a lot more than just their free time? That would be so crazy.

Self-evident as that concept might be to anyone who's ever heard of America, there's no denying the potential of a bold genre film that dared to confront the dehumanizing barbarity of our country's most profitable sports league; the pronounced indifference it has for the health of its players, the structural racism that continues to undergird the entire apparatus, the short-term riches it offers in order to offset the true cost of pursuing immortality. “Him” is not that film. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Less “‘The Devil's Advocate' meets ‘Any Given Sunday'” than a “Black Mirror” episode with advanced CTE, this dull look at the dark underbelly of an organization that's plainly evil on its surface wants all the glory of a championship season without so much as breaking a sweat. Its characters are constantly nattering on about the price of greatness, but the self-satisfied movie around them seems content with mediocrity from the moment it starts — every setpiece a punt that Tipping, Zack Akers, and Skip Bronkie's see-through script celebrates like a touchdown. By the time “Him” finally lets loose during a final sequence that's staged like a Super Bowl halftime show (a full surrender to post-ironic kitsch at the end of an airless film that spends 90 percent of its story on a series of training exercises), I struggled to remember what it was supposedly playing for in the first place. 

Who is Him? Will, that's a loaded question. For the last 20 years or so, legendary San Antonio Saviors (lol) quarterback and eight-time champion Isaiah White was unambiguously He. But time makes goons of us all, and while injuries have never done much to slow Isaiah down — not even the one where a bone pierced right through his leg on national TV — the fact that he's played by a 53-year-old Marlon Wayans is finally catching up with him (Wayans is always exceptional as a dramatic actor, and the shark-eyed intensity he brings to this movie is the only thing that holds it together). There are even rumors that he might be retiring at the end of the next season, and, I don't know, becoming the world's most hardcore canasta player or something. 

 










How do you replace a GOAT? Well, farmers tend to find it pretty easy, actually, but the football community turns its attention to star prospect and presumptive first draft pick Cameron Cade (“I Know What You Did Last Summer” actor, former college wide-receiver, and Pro Bowl-worthy hot person Tyriq Withers). Could he be Him?? Or “Him Kardashian,” as his agent — a delightfully shit-eating but sorely overqualified Tim Heidecker — suggests? “Himothée Chalamet??” Him Cameron? Him Wenders? Him Jong Il? Sorry, this was by far my favorite part of the movie and I'm trying to pad this thing out as much as I can. 

Cameron's dead dad certainly thought his son had greatness in Him, and Cameron has grown up hellbent on proving him right. Alas, just a few days before the combine, the generational talent is conked in the head by a giant samurai(?) who appears out of nowhere on the practice field one night, which gives Tipping the first of his many opportunities to exalt in his movie's signature Concuss-o-Vision, which harkens back to the glory days of “Romeo Must Die” by offering a kind of real-time MRI that allows us to see Cameron's brain jostle and swell every time he gets hit. His once-assured career already on the rocks now that he isn't able to show off his skills for the league's owners, Cameron is suddenly redeemed by the call of calls: Isaiah White — Him himself — has invited him to come train at his super-remote, not-at-all-evil desert compound (played by an active NASA facility in New Mexico). You know, the one that looks like a Bond villain's secret lair, adorned with ancient symbols, and surrounded by cult-like fans who jump-scare anyone who dares to drive onto the premises. Rest assured that only very normal stuff happens there.

 










From that point forward, the movie is dedicated to the week-long program that Isaiah cooks up for Cameron in his brutalist football dungeon, with each day growing more sinister than the last. Cameron doesn't have much of a personality (it must have been one of the sacrifices he made in order to be so good at football), but even a more extroverted prospect would probably default to the same deferential posture that he does at first. 

It's not particularly interesting to watch him murmur some version of “Ohhhkaaayyy…” whenever his host, idol, and mentor gives him a demented pep talk, or injects himself with his old blood, or insists that Cameron strip naked in the middle of the practice facility so that the resident sports doctor (Jim Jefferies) can give him a physical in front of the entire staff, but you can understand why the kid would be willing to chalk them up as the sort of  things that happen between episodes of “Hard Knocks.” He's barely even thrown by a run-in with Isaiah's influencer wife, who introduces herself by offering the young stud a jade green butt plug (she's played by an obviously demonic Julia Fox, whose bleached eyebrows and mirrored tops make it all too easy to imagine a Ryan Murphy-directed remake of “Rosemary's Baby”). 

 










There isn't a real flag on the play until Isaiah brings in a practice squad to run drills with Cameron, a scene that ends with one of the new guys volunteering to get hit in the face with a perfect spiral from a football throwing machine every time the prospect messes up. The self-annihilation is a bit too “It's all for you, Damien” to pass the smell test (Cameron never seems to question why Isaiah cares so much about the future of the Saviors franchise, to the point that he's willing to help the kid who's threatening to displace him as the team's starting quarterback), but maybe that's part of its appeal. People are desperate for something to believe in, especially when they have to forsake everything else before their faith can be rewarded. 

That should be a scary prospect for a kid like Cameron, who's extremely close with his mother and brother, and remains in a ride-or-die relationship with his high school sweetheart despite his newfound fame. But nothing in “Him” is scary, emotionally or otherwise. Tipping is so eager for sizzle and flash that he fumbles any tension or terror out of the face-destroying football drill, which is rendered incoherent by aggressive cuts and hyper-stylized close-ups. Later setpieces similarly try to squeeze genre thrills out of sports culture — precious few of them succeed. A visit to the hyperbaric chamber teases some “Final Destination”-like fun, but nothing comes to pass. A soak in the sauna ends with a mild shock, but the movie is too satisfied with its empty symbolism and routine hagsploitation to feel like it has any skin in the game. Much as Wayans does what he can to will the movie toward some kind of integrity or internal logic, it's hard to score any points against a broken culture in a movie that can't think of anything more ominous than the sight of a football rolling down an empty hallway.

 










At least that last bit is good for a laugh, if only unintentionally. “Him” knows that it's silly as hell, but it has no idea how to balance that against the ostensible seriousness of its social critique, which is how you wind up with leaden dialogue — “If you were starving to death in jail and offered food or freedom,” Isaiah says to Cameron, “do you really have a choice?” — sandwiched between moments of broad satire in a film where both parts of that equation have been sanded down to the nub. “Him” asks its characters ad nauseam how far they would go to be great, but this dreadfully compromised movie never even risks enough to be good. 

Universal Pictures will release “Him” in theaters on Friday, September 19.

This marks the third and final major to make deals with Spotify after the service upset the music industry by cutting premium royalty rates for songwriters.


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


Spotify has announced a new multi-year global partnership with Sony Music, the third and final major to sign new deals with Spotify this year. The deals encompass both the recorded music and publishing sides of Sony's business, and according to Spotify, its “new direct licensing arrangement in the U.S.” will result in higher royalties for songwriters.


	It's a notable part of the pacts, given Spotify came under fire from music publishers last spring when it started paying a reduced royalty rate to songwriters and publishers in the U.S., resulting in what the National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA) says was a loss of $230 million in royalties in the first year.


	This is because Spotify found that by adding audiobooks into its premium subscriptions, it could reclassify those popular subscriptions as “bundles,” a type of plan that qualifies for a discounted rate on U.S. mechanical royalties given that multiple products are offered under one price tag. The move caught publishers off guard and reignited longstanding tensions between publishers and Spotify about what royalties songwriters should earn.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Sony follows Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group and Kobalt in making these direct deals to, in part, improve remuneration for songwriters post-bundling. It's unclear if these deals bring these companies' royalty rates back to the level they were before bundling or not. 


	In a press release about the deals, limited information is given about the nature of this expanded partnership. According to a press release about the deals, “the companies will work together to keep improving the listening experience while creating more opportunities for artists and songwriters to reach audiences everywhere. These initiatives will launch new product offerings including enhanced audio and visual formats that enable deeper connections with fans.”


	Recently, Spotify has been focused on expanding its offerings. The Stockholm-based company has announced it will now allow for direct messaging, a new DJ feature for playlists and high-fidelity listening — all as part of premium. Late last year, it also rolled out music videos for 97 countries, excluding users in the U.S. and Canada. 


	“Our partnership with Sony is built on a shared drive to shape the future of music. Together, we're accelerating the pace of innovation to create powerful new opportunities and increasing revenue for artists and songwriters,” says Daniel Ek, Spotify's founder and CEO. “These agreements aren't just a milestone; they're a catalyst for building a more dynamic and prosperous music ecosystem for everyone.”


Rob Stringer, chairman of Sony Music Group, says: “Sony Music Group and Spotify have long been mutually committed to advancing music streaming and growing the marketplace for all. This is further reflected in our new agreements where we're working to develop futuristic approaches that ensure our artists and songwriters remain appropriately compensated for their work, and audiences are getting a high-quality experience that's ever evolving.”


	“These deals with Sony Music Group are built to better support artists and songwriters by unlocking new formats and forging deeper connections with fans,” says Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer at Spotify. “This alignment creates space for new opportunities and long-term growth for everyone involved.”

ABC pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from the air indefinitely, and celebrities are coming to the talk show host's defense online. On September 17, 2025, an ABC spokesperson told Rolling Stone that the recently-Emmy nominated late-night show “will be pre-empted indefinitely.”

ABC announced on Wednesday evening that it was pulling Jimmy Kimmel's late night show “indefinitely” after criticism of comments he made on Monday about the motives of the man who is accused of fatally shooting the conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week. #jimmykimmel #maga #breakingnews #learnontiktok #charliekirk 

Earlier in the day, Nextstar Media Group announced that their “owned and partner television stations affiliated with the ABC Television Network will preempt ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight's show.”

According to Nextstar Media Group's statement, the decision was due to Kimmel's joke about Charlie Kirk's recent passing. Kimmel actually said the following on the Monday night taping of his show:

“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

This announcement comes exactly two months after CBS canceled “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” Kimmel was a vocal supporter of Colbert, even voting for “The Late Show” to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show, a category Kimmel was also nominated in. The day after the Emmy Awards, Kimmel celebrated Colbert's win with John Oliver.

Margaret Cho used colorful language when commenting on Variety's Instagram post, asking, “What the actual f.” Fellow comedian Atsuko Okatsuka also expressed dismay, writing “WHAT” in all caps in the comments section.

Kathy Griffin went to Bluesky to urge her followers to vocally support Kimmel. Griffin herself experienced backlash when she posted a “photo of herself holding up a Donald Trump mask made to look like a severed head” in 2017, according to NPR.

Wanda Sykes, who was supposed to be Kimmel's guest on tonight's episode, took to Instagram to express her disappointment with ABC's decision and to ask for prayers. She also mentioned the First Amendment concept of freedom of speech, as did MSNBC host Chris Hayes when he wrote on the Elon Musk-owned website X (formerly known as Twitter).

Hayes called Kimmel's forced hiatus “the most straightforward attack on free speech from state actors I've ever seen in my life.”

This is the most straightforward attack on free speech from state actors I've ever seen in my life and it's not even close. https://t.co/uMjEZkIpat

Ben Stiller also used X to explain his thoughts, writing, “This isn't right.”

This isn't right. https://t.co/mVJ8308w1k

Comedian Mike Birbiglia posted a picture of a handwritten note on Instagram, on which he wrote about defending people even if you don't agree with them. He also called for fellow comedians to make statements in support of Kimmel.

“Freaky Friday” actress Jamie Lee Curtis, who recently broke down in tears over Kirk's passing, reposted a Kimmel quote on her Instagram story. The quote read, “I don't think anyone should be canceled. I really don't.” Kimmel said this quote in April 2025.

“I am horrified at the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel Live,” wrote actress Jean Smart. “What Jimmy said was FREE speech, not hate speech.”

A post shared by Jean Smart (@realjeansmart)

“And our right to free speech is being eliminated,” actor and comedian Steve Martin wrote, captioning a quote from the “Diary of Anne Frank” from 1943.

Although Kimmel's show is not currently airing, and there's no word on when it will return, if ever, he clearly has a lot of support from fans and celebrities alike.

Giant local TV conglomerate Nexstar might have been both the first, and the biggest, of America's various station-owning overlords to make a public stink about Jimmy Kimmel this week, calling comments the ABC host made addressing Republicans “working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk” both “offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse.” But Nexstar could wind up tragically losing the race to be the most performatively angry about the talk show host's statements: Sinclair Broadcast Group has now entered the contest, and nobody gets angrier, in more attention-seeking ways, than Sinclair.

The company—which owns the largest collection of ABC affiliate stations in the United States, and is notorious for forcing local newsrooms to run “must-run” segments typically espousing conservative views—issued its own statement on Wednesday night in response to news that ABC and Disney had yanked Kimmel from the airwaves out of apparent fear of affiliate revolt. (Presumably spurred on by FCC chair Brendan Carr, who gave a podcast interview earlier on Wednesday implying threats of license loss to any affiliate that didn't go after Kimmel.) But that mere capitulation wasn't enough for Sinclair, which issued a statement late on Wednesday stating that “Sinclair will not lift the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! on our stations until formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability.” The statement also all but begged for the FCC to “take immediate regulatory action to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.” Oh, and they want Kimmel to personally apologize to Kirk's family, and give a donation to his organization Turning Point USA, presumably for the gross crime of saying that right-wing political figures sure do seem eager to make political hay out of the commentator's murder.

But don't worry, ABC viewers in Sinclair-owned markets! (There are a lot of you, by the way; Sinclair owns roughly 40 ABC affiliates around the country, out of the 193 stations it owns overall.) The conglomerate will be providing something equally entertaining to watch in the slot previously reserved for Kimmel's Friday night episode: A tribute to Kirk, which will also be made available to ABC affiliates around the country. This will, of course, be very exciting for anyone who has not spent enough time over the past week being lambasted with media extolling the virtues of Kirk's very vocal approach to the American political experiment, and who would have just wasted all that time watching Kimmel's show by relaxing or laughing anyway.

You ever plan for your day to be about one thing, but then it turns out to be about something else? That's kind of how we imagine Disney's Wednesday has been going, as the company rolled out long-in-the-works plans to announce a 50th anniversary celebration of The Muppet Show today, and wound up feeding it straight into the maw of public vitriol currently consuming ABC and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Thus did headlines about the genuinely sweet-sounding Disney+ special—which is being produced by Seth Rogen and will feature appearances from Sabrina Carpenter, and take the Muppets back to their roots as a variety show—find themselves forced to share very close space with news about the streamer's parent company yanking one of its most famous celebrities off the schedule in response to right-wing outrage. A juxtaposition of various forms of pop culture puppetry that was entirely coincidental, and which we nevertheless can't stop ourselves from squinting at and going “Huh.”

The Muppets special, which is being billed as a pilot for a potential revival of the series, has actually been a semi-open secret for a while: A few weeks back, California released a quickly-redacted list of tax credits that included a reference to a “Muppets pilot,” so this has been brewing for at least a second. And we certainly can't fault the general zeitgeistiness of the pitch, even if it very specifically ran afoul of the news of the day today. Rogen and Carpenter are both natural fits for a revival of the old Muppet Show format: He's fresh off a bunch of Emmy wins for The Studio, and has maintained a reputation as being a genuinely human, funny guy despite mountains of success; she's one of the biggest young musical acts in the country. Just as importantly, both of them tend to work a little bit blue, tying neatly into the Muppets‘ subversive vibes; taken in a vacuum, it's a strong, on-brand billing. (Rogen is technically only on the hook right now as an executive producer, alongside his usual partner Evan Goldberg, but this feels like a pretty natural time for him to step in front of the camera.)

Per Deadline, the special is being written by veteran Jimmy Fallon writer Albertina Rizzo (no relation) and directed by frequent John Mulaney collaborator Alex Timbers. Set to air in 2026, the pilot “will feature Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and the gang as they return to the Muppet Theatre to produce a variety show.” Most of the current regular Muppets cast, including Dave Goelz—who's been with the franchise since the first episode of The Muppet Show in 1976—are set to reprise their parts.

Friends and fans are still reminiscing on the brilliant career of Robert Redford after his death on September 16, 2025. The actor's publicist, Cindi Berger, announced he passed away in his sleep at his Sundance, Utah home, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The 89-year-old's cause of death has not yet been announced. 

In the last years of his life, Redford stayed out of the spotlight. However, the prolific environmentalist did step out a final time where he was pictures at an event with his wife, 68-year-old Sibylle Szaggars. Read on to see the final photos.

The last photos of Robert Redford in public were taken at the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation's 2021 award ceremony. The event was held in October at Monaco's Grimaldi Forum. In the photos, Redford looks cheery with Sybille Szaggars, whom People says he married in 2009. 

In the shots, the couple elegantly rocks head-to-toe white. Redford is in a crisp suit while Szaggars dons a floor-length eyelet dress.

At one point in the evening, the couple was spotted wearing colorful facemasks as the world was still reeling from the COVID-19 shutdowns.

The mission statement of Prince Albert's foundation is “protecting and progressing planetary health,” according to its website, making it a poignantly fitting final event for the dedicated environmentalist. 

In a 2015 interview, the “Up Close & Personal” star spoke on climate change and said, “We need alternative energy. I think that's the future. I don't think oil is the future. This is gonna be an unpopular opinion, but I think it should stay in the ground.” He also revealed he worked in the Chevron oil fields as a kid.

The icon expressed concern for the future of Earth as he continued, “We're so close to polluting the planet beyond anything sustainable. He hopefully predicted a shifted focus to alternative energy would create an industry and jobs. 

When asked what he would say to people questioning why they should listen to a Hollywood actor about the environment, Redford replied, “I've been an activist since 1969. I've been involved in the environment from a standpoint of wanting to draw attention to what an alternative could be rather than what we've been having.”

Sometimes the machinery of the right-wing tattle machine can move with shocking swiftness. We were, for instance, just in the midst of writing up FCC chair Brendan Carr's threats against ABC and talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!—in which Carr, fresh off helping to bully Paramount and CBS News into submission, suggested ABC affiliates complain to parent company Disney about Kimmel's comments on the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk—when news broke that those threats had come to fruition. First, news broke that Nexstar, which owns a bit more than 10 percent of all the ABC affiliate stations in the U.S., was intending to preempt Kimmel's show in favor of other broadcasting. Then the big shoe dropped: ABC, per Deadline, has announced that Kimmel's show is being taken off the schedule “indefinitely.”

All of this, presumably, due to the monologue that Kimmel delivered on his show on Monday night, in which he noted that “many in MAGA-land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.” While making jokes about JD Vance and noting the Department Of Justice's recent removal of a study showing right-wing violence “outpaces” attacks from the left, Kimmel didn't mince words: “The MAGA Gang (is) desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

These comments and jokes provoked accusations of being “the sickest conduct possible” from Carr, who told podcaster Benny Johnson that “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take actions on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” Nexstar, meanwhile, was a bit vaguer, simply saying in a statement that it “Strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk and will replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets.” It added that it did not view broadcasting Kimmel as being in “the public interest”—a line also trotted out by Carr in his efforts to invoke legal authority against ABC for broadcasting Kimmel's show.

As for ABC, it's staying as quiet as it can, issuing a simple “Jimmy Kimmel Live! will be preempted indefinitely” in a statement to Deadline, and declining to share any further details.

News of Nexstar's principled stand on the issues comes just a month after the massive broadcast group announced it was acquiring rival station owner TEGNA, which owns or operates 68 American TV networks. The press release announcing the acquisition specifically thanked the Trump administration for initiatives enabling the purchase.

"Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done," the president wrote on social media.


							By

	It's safe to assume that Donald Trump is jumping with joy over Jimmy Kimmel Live! getting suspended by ABC over host Jimmy Kimmel's viral comments about Charlie Kirk.


	After attending a state dinner earlier in the evening, the president took to Truth Social at 1 a.m. in the U.K., writing, “Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT”

	Though Trump called the show canceled, ABC only suspended it “indefinitely.”

	Kimmel drew heat from Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr after he suspected Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson was a MAGA Republican during his opening monologue on Monday night's show. “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said at the time.


	On Wednesday, Carr condemned the late night host's comments and threatened to take action against ABC affiliates over Kimmel's comments. “[This] appears to be an action by Jimmy Kimmel to play into the narrative that this was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” Carr said on a podcast. “What people don't understand is that the broadcasters … have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest. When we see stuff like this, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”

	











	Nexstar, which owns 28 ABC affiliates across the country, was the first to preempt the series for the immediate future. Then an ABC network spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter that Jimmy Kimmel Live! would be “preempted indefinitely.”

Fox News host Mark Levin shares memories of his first conversations with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.'

In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, some critics of Israel have sought to drive a wedge between the conservative activist and the Jewish state, mischaracterizing his recent statements and making wild, unfounded accusations.

Within hours of Kirk's murder — and before a suspect was identified — unhinged conspiracies spread across social media. The Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism found thousands of posts containing the baseless claims. 

Seemingly aware of the effort to co-opt Kirk's legacy, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu eulogized him as a champion of "speaking truth and defending freedom. A lion-hearted friend of Israel, he fought the lies and stood tall for Judeo-Christian civilization."

WHAT I LEARNED FROM DEBATING CHARLIE KIRK, AND WHERE THE COUNTRY GOES FROM HERE

Mike Huckabee, Washington's ambassador to Israel, also took to X to condemn the misinformation. "It's painful to see people back in the US attempt to get clicks & make $$ by making up outrageous lies while exploiting the death of Charlie Kirk whose impact & character the propagandists will never have. @IsraeliPM sets the record straight."

Rabbi Pesach Wolicki, who spoke with Charlie Kirk via Zoom the night before his assassination, told Fox News Digital that while Kirk voiced criticism at times, he remained strongly supportive of Israel.

"The meeting was one he initiated," Wolicki said. "He was heading out on a campus tour the next day and knew he'd face many questions about Israel. He wanted to hear what I had to say on issues he expected to be asked about. Why would he do that if he had abandoned Israel? The very fact the meeting happened proves he had not."

Wolicki noted that only a month earlier, Kirk had been attacked by critics for being "too supportive" of Israel. Although they did not discuss the origins of his views, Wolicki pointed to Kirk's evangelical Christian beliefs, which he said aligned with the right of the Jewish nation to thrive.

"He said publicly many times that he believed the Land of Israel belongs to the Jewish people and that he supported Israel's war against Hamas," Wolicki added. "He was not soft on our enemies. He supported Israel, even when he was critical."

In a video of a May debate at Cambridge that went viral, Kirk staunchly defended the Jewish state.

"When you declare war on Israel, expect a firestorm in reaction," he declared. "On Shabbat, Hamas invaded Israel, deciding to go recklessly to music concerts, to homes, to kibbutzes and taking 200-plus hostages. They knew what they were doing ...

"A tragic truth of war is that civilians die. I don't like it, and you don't like it," he continued. "And they brought it upon themselves. The only operation and entity to blame is the leadership of Hamas, not the Israeli government, for fighting this defensive war. ... There is a good guy and there is a bad guy."

Last month, Charlie Kirk appeared on Megyn Kelly's podcast, describing himself as having a "bulletproof resume" when it comes to defending Israel on both college campuses and social media.

"I believe in the scriptural land rights given to Israel, I believe in the fulfillment of prophecy. I am not a theologian, but I'm a Christian. My life was changed in Israel—the spiritual energy there is so amazing. I want them to win, and I've said that repeatedly," Kirk said.

He added that he often has "less ability sometimes online to criticize the Israeli government without backlash than actual Israelis do."

"I want civilization to win. I want the West to win. I don't want the Islamo-fascist barbarians to storm the gates of Jerusalem. I want the holy sites protected. I believe in the Holy Land, I love that Jesus walked on water there and rose from the dead," he said.

Kirk stressed his personal bond with Israel but warned against hostile reactions to criticism saying the result could eventually be the "weakening and deflating of two of your strongest advocates if that continues."

HAMAS PLOTS INFILTRATION AT US-BACKED GAZA AID SITE, FORCES TEMPORARY SHUTDOWN

One of the Chief Rabbis of Israel, David Yosef, sent a letter to Kirk's family, expressing his "deep sorrow" over the assassination of "a clear and unwavering voice of truth."

Josh Nass, a former conservative youth commentator, met Kirk in 2012, when Kirk was just launching his organization, Turning Point USA.

"If you take Israel out of the picture, what Charlie dedicated his life to simply falls apart. He thought our value system was collapsing and was very passionate about the need to fight the culture war. His love for Israel was incredibly real and sincere. I know that because he told me so himself," Nass said.

Israel Ganz, head of the Yesha Council — the umbrella organization of local authorities in Judea and Samaria — reacted to Kirk's assassination, saying his community "bow[ed] their heads in mourning over the murder of a friend and lover of Israel."

In the spirit of coexistence that Kirk promoted, dozens of Christians and Jews gathered on Wednesday atop Jerusalem's Temple Mount to honor him. They prayed for peace for Kirk's widow and children, offering strength and solidarity in their time of grief.

   11:54 EDT 18 Sep 2025, updated  11:55 EDT 18 Sep 2025    By STACY LIBERATORE, US SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY EDITOR  

A nearly 22-minute video titled 'The Roswell Incident' has been quietly uploaded to the National Archives, reigniting interest in the infamous 1947 crash.

The footage combines still images and motion-control camera shots sourced from the published Roswell Report, as well as various magazines and books about UFOs. 

It opens with a shot of the book 'The Roswell Report: Fact Versus Fiction in the New Mexico Desert' and ends with a stark black-and-white image that appears to show a crash site, with debris scattered across a massive crater in the ground.

The video has flooded the internet, with users claiming the crater bears a striking resemblance to eyewitness reports, suggesting it could be 'the first pictures of the 1947 UFO crash site.'

Major Jesse Marcel, who recovered debris from the crash, described the scene as 'a large area heavily scattered with metallic debris from a single impact point that scarred the earth.' 

Some viewers have also pointed to a dark formation on the right side of the image, claiming it resembles an alien body. 

UFO expert Mark Lee told the Daily Mail that the crater image was likely included to add intrigue. 

'In my opinion, it's either a hoax,' he said. 'Just because it's been added to the National Archives doesn't give it scientific validation. If it came out as a release from the military or Congress, I would take it a lot more seriously.'

Lee also noted that the 'alien' in the photo is nothing more than a case of pareidolia, a psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimuli.

The newly uploaded video appears to focus on 'The Roswell Report: Fact Versus Fiction in the New Mexico Desert,' a 1995 book that attributes the crashed 'UFO' debris to Project Mogul.

Project Mogul was a top-secret US military program from 1947 to 1949 that used high-altitude balloons equipped with microphones to detect sound waves from Soviet atomic bomb tests. 

A 1994 military investigation concluded that the debris found at the Roswell site was likely pieces of a high-altitude balloon from Project Mogul, not an extraterrestrial spacecraft. 

Despite this official explanation, the newly uploaded video has sparked debate online, with viewers offering widely differing interpretations.

'National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has uploaded a video of the Roswell 1947 UAP Crash site,' one user shared.

Another user posted on X: 'Like noted UFO researcher Grant Cameron has stated plenty of times, sometimes the disclosure of the real deal is a purposefully placed needle in the haystack. Roswell: slow drip…drip, drip, drip.'

In addition to the debris spotted in the footage, one user shared: 'Grey alien in the official video from the Roswell crash site.'

However, some social media suggested the footage 'is B-roll for the Roswell Report, and the images being posted do not show the Roswell debris site, nor does it even claim it's the actual debris site.'

One user posted: 'It's clearly B-roll for that Roswell presentation the government put together in 1996. Someone must have found this and uploaded it in the last couple of days.'

Others have suggested a dead alien can be seen in the image, pointing to what Marcle said following the Roswell incident.

'I later found out that the pilot of the aircraft was a Captain Henderson, who apparently saw far more than just the debris from the impact site... he may in fact have seen the remains of a crew,' the now deceased major said. 

In July 1947, a rancher reported pieces of debris scattered over his land.

Authorities were called to the scene and, after investigating the wreckage, determined the pieces were from a flying saucer.

The local paper's front page story reported that the Roswell Army Field recovered a flying saucer on a New Mexico Ranch after metallic-looking, light but strong material was scattered across the land.

'The intelligence office of the 509th Bombardment Group at Roswell Army Air Field announced at noon today that the field has come into the possession of a Flying Saucer,' Roswell Daily Record reported on July 8, 1947.

The statement was given by Marcel, who was the first on the scene and led the investigation, which he determined were pieces from an extraterrestrial vehicle. 

He also said that the material spread out from this point into a triangular-shaped area 200 to 300 feet wide at the end of the field, and 3/4 of a mile long.

Shortly after the 'UFO' discovery made headlines, the War Department in Washington released a statement claiming the debris was the remains of a weather balloon.

The US Air Force stated the weather balloon was part of Project Mogul's airborne system invented by Columbia University, New York University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

It was designed to search the atmosphere for weak reverberations from nuclear-test blasts.

While the United States seems to be good at its job of proffering peace throughout the world and maintaining stability, its unique landscape is not seeing many scientific expeditions like its other sectors. Utah, a landlocked state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States, is the location for this Dome; something that has set the geological world into a state of delirium.

If you love to go out particularly in the states, there is no way you wouldn't have come across Utah's Canyonlands National Park. This is because of its high number of massive canyons that offer a lot of intrigue and mystery. The “upheaval dome” in question refers to a strange circle of deformed rock that spans more than three kilometers across and rises like a bull's eye from the desert floor .

Geologists and scientists have come together to attempt to precisely determine the origin and cause of the dome's formation. An important fact to note is that over time, there have been several theories aimed at explaining and unravelling the mystery behind this seemingly extra terrestrial life form. 

The first theory about the upheaval dome was first proposed in the early 20th century. It stipulates that thick layers of ancient salt lie beneath the Canyonlands which over time, pushed these salt layers upward through the rock above them in bulbous formations called diapirs.

Another intriguing theory about Utah's upheaval rock formation is the meteorite impact hypothesis. This theory existed in the 1990s, a period before scientists started thinking in the direction of the diapir hypothesis. The theory was based on the fact that the upheaval dome was caused by a meteorite crashing down into the region over 60 million years ago sending shockwaves through the sandstone and creating concentric rings of fractured rock. At the time, the meteorite theory seemed coherent and well thought out until the diapir hypothesis that was later put forward in the early 20th century, just like this recently solved ancient mystery.

Amidst all the research chaos, some geological elements were also discovered. The first example is the discovery of shocked quartz. Ever heard of it before? If you've heard of it, there is no question you're a geological guru/wizard. 

But if not, shocked quartz are tiny grains of sand whose crystal structures have been rearranged under immense, instantaneous pressure. But the unshakable reality is that these elements do not form under normal seismic and planetary processes. Their existence proves the impact of a meteorite crash down. 

In the early 2000s, geologists identified such grains in sandstone samples from the “Upheaval Dome”. The presence of shocked quartz dramatically strengthened the underlying hypothesis that explained that a celestial crash-down into our planet's crust was the only reason shocked quartz existed freely on the surface of our planet's lithosphere. 

Still, questions remain. Unlike many well-studied craters, Upheaval Dome lacks extensive melt rocks or a thick blanket of ejecta—debris blasted outward during impact. Some researchers argue this absence leaves the door open for the salt dome hypothesis. Others suggest that erosion over tens of millions of years may have erased these features, leaving only the deeper structural traces.

Who said the United States does not also have its own unique set of wonders? If you're still doubting, pick up your hiking boots and head over to any park. This doesn't necessarily have to be Utah's Canyonlands National Park, it could be any park but you'll become easily intrigued by some of our planet's hints at the supernatural forming behind the scenes, like this mysterious ghost inland.

Police say Akshay Vashisht made ‘false, malicious and superstitious' claims about Manohar airport

Police in India's popular coastal state of Goa have arrested a YouTuber after he posted a video claiming that the state's new international airport was haunted.

Akshay Vashisht, who runs a popular channel with more than 570,000 subscribers dedicated to horror stories and paranormal case studies, was detained in Delhi on Wednesday. 

His arrest followed a complaint by a police constable from Goa's social media monitoring cell, who alleged the video spread false information about the newly built Manohar International Airport at Mopa.

According to the police complaint, the video – shared on YouTube under the title Evil Haunted Goa Airport – alleged the airport had been built on a cremation ground. 

In the video, Mr Vashisht claimed that airline staff had reported “paranormal activities” and that pilots often refused to operate night flights due to ghostly sightings, including that of a mysterious woman in a red saree on the runway.

A version of the video remained viewable on Facebook but another on Mr Vashisht's main YouTube channel had been made private as of Thursday.

Police said the claims in the video were “false, malicious and superstitious” and designed to alarm the public while promoting the creator's channel. Authorities also accused him of narrating purported testimonies from his subscribers to lend credibility to the claims.

A team from Mopa Airport police station travelled to Delhi to arrest Vashisht from the Dwarka area. Officers seized his mobile phone, laptop and camera and brought him to the Mopa airport police station for further investigation.

He faces an initial chargesheet filed under sections of the Indian Penal Code covering public mischief and common intention – people gathering with the intent to commit a crime.

Police said they were also considering whether to pursue action against the administrator of the Facebook page that circulated the clip.

The £283m Manohar International Airport opened in December 2022 in Mopa and began operations a year later. As Goa's second airport, it has a goal of drawing 12 million passengers per year in the next five years in order to boost tourism and connectivity in one of India's most popular destinations for both domestic and international travel. 

Authorities said unfounded rumours could damage its reputation at a time when the facility is still building international credibility.

This isn't the first time officials have clashed with social media influencers over the state's image. Earlier this year, a spate of posts appeared claiming there was reduced footfall at Goa's beaches and resorts due to increased prices of hotels and restaurants. 

Goa's tourism minister Rohan Khaunte insisted in July that there had been no drop in tourist numbers and claimed, without evidence, that “paid” “so-called influencers” were deliberately perpetuating false narratives to harm the image of the state.

The Taiwanese series sees Shu Qi and Angelica Lee play a pair of vengeful mothers who seek justice via dark, fantastical means

Lead cast: Shu Qi, Angelica Lee Sinje

Asian superstars Shu Qi and Angelica Lee Sinje headline The Resurrected, Netflix's latest Taiwanese drama series, which premiered its first two episodes at the 30th Busan International Film Festival in South Korea on September 18, ahead of its October 9 release on the streamer.

Directed by Leste Chen Cheng-tao and Hsu Chao-jen, The Resurrected combines pressing social issues with outrageous supernatural horror, two of the most popular and ubiquitous genres in Taiwanese media right now.

A generous dose of melodrama is also added to the mix, as the narrative follows these two women in their struggle to process what happened to their children and the lengths to which they go to ensure justice is served.

Florida Tech astrophysicist Howard Chen is offering new insights to help aid NASA's search for life beyond Earth. His latest theoretical work investigates the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system, one of the most widely studied exoplanetary systems in the galaxy. It has captured scientists' attention for its potential to host water, and thus possibly life, on its planets. Now, he's offering an explanation for why telescopes have yet to find definitive signs of either.

The paper, "Born Dry or Born Wet? A Palette of Water Growth Histories in TRAPPIST-1 Analogs and Compact Planetary Systems," was authored by Chen, an assistant professor of space sciences, and researchers from NASA, Johns Hopkins University and Harvard University. It was published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters in September and explores the likelihood that TRAPPIST-1's three innermost exoplanets contained no water when they formed, despite existing in a zone where water is viable.

TRAPPIST-1 is a red dwarf star located about 40 light-years away from us. (One light year is about 6 trillion miles.) It is thought to be about 7.6 billion years old, or 3 billion years older than our sun.

Astronomers are captivated by the TRAPPIST-1 system because its seven known planets are rocky and Earth-like. They also fall within the star's habitable zone, which is the distance range from a star at which temperatures are not too hot or cold to support liquid water.

Researchers are searching for any evidence of water on these planets, but have yet to detect anything. Some think a lack of gas in the atmosphere is disrupting the light needed to pick up detailed visuals. Others predict water could have escaped the planets' atmospheres throughout their evolution.

Chen and his team, however, decided to research a different theory: that there was no water to begin with because there was no gas to contain it. He would test it not from an observational perspective, but with mathematical modeling of the planets' initial formation.

"You have astronomers who are using telescopes to see what's out there. I come from a different perspective," Chen said. "I'm both trying to explain what we're seeing while trying to make predictions about what we can't."

The researchers created models that examined the composition and growth of these planets starting when they were as small as 1 kilometer wide. They simulated how material aggregated during collisions with other celestial objects until they reached their final planetary formations.

There are several key factors in collision events that heavily influence a planet's final composition. Chen's models incorporated impact delivery, which is the transfer of materials like water and gases during a celestial collision; impact erosion, which refers to the removal of materials in a planet's atmosphere due to impact; and mantle-atmosphere exchange, which is the transfer of water and gases between a planet's atmosphere and mantle to maintain its conditions.

The team ran hundreds of collision simulations, which returned thousands of different possibilities for how TRAPPIST-1's planets might have formed. They varied several components, such as the amount of water available to the system, the profile of the initial planet formation environment, the planets' density profiles and the initial system conditions. For the inner worlds, specifically the first three planets, most of the simulations came back dry.

"Whatever we did, we couldn't get much water in these inner planets," Chen said.

He believes that the main reason the planets couldn't acquire water is due to the nature of the collision events. Compact planet collisions are higher velocity, so they are more aggressive and energetic, Chen said. This means that instead of acquiring material for a gaseous atmosphere, planets' atmospheres were completely cleared out by the power of the collisions. With no gas in the atmosphere to contain water, it's possible that any previously existing water escaped back into space during these collision events.

Understanding a planet's earliest characteristics, its water, air and carbon content, builds the foundation for how they evolve. That way, when researchers identify a planet that seems viable for life at the surface level, they can use Chen's model to simulate what these distant worlds might be like on the inside, on the surface and in the air.

Combining the theoretical context of a planet's formation with the state in which it was discovered can help researchers—and NASA—make informed, efficient decisions on which planets are worth investigating and when it's time to move on to the next.

Tyler Robinson's alleged texts to his partner have been met with scepticism across the ideological spectrum.

The deluge of conspiracy theories began almost the moment authorities revealed the text messages allegedly sent by the suspected assassin of right-wing American activist Charlie Kirk.

After prosecutors in the US state of Utah published alleged text exchanges between 22-year-old Tyler Robinson and his romantic partner on Tuesday, countless social media users, including numerous prominent influencers, cast doubt on their authenticity.

Some outright claimed that the texts, in which Robinson appears to confess to killing Kirk, had been fabricated by authorities.

Many of the posts suggested that the language and tone of the exchanges did not match someone of Robinson's age, and the account of the shooting was too forthcoming and detailed to be believable.

Notably, at a time of extreme political polarisation in the US, the conspiracy theorising united figures on the left and right.

Matt Walsh, a right-wing commentator and podcast host with millions of followers on X and YouTube, suggested the exchanges had been scripted to absolve Robinson's transgender partner of any involvement in the shooting.

“This feels like a strategy they cooked up from watching too much TV,” Walsh said on X.

Utah Governor Spencer Cox has said that the partner, described as a “male transitioning to female”, had no advance knowledge of the crime and has been cooperating fully with authorities.

Steve Bannon, US President Donald Trump's former adviser, said on his podcast that he was “not buying” the texts, describing them as “too stilted, too much like a script”.

On the other side of the political spectrum, Majid Padellan, a progressive influencer who goes by Brooklyn Dad Defiant on social media, said he did not believe for “one second” that the texts had been written by Robinson.

“I didn't know him personally, but I know that no 22 year old writes text messages like this,” Padellan said on X.

“This feels like that Steve Buscemi skateboard meme ‘How do you do, fellow kids?”'

Liberal commentator Joanne Carducci, who posts under the moniker JoJoFromJerz, noted that the official narrative around the assassination had prompted rare agreement across the ideological divide.

“No one is buying these text messages. No one on the left or the right,” Carducci said on X.

“We cannot agree on a damn thing anymore. But we agree on this. If that doesn't speak volumes, nothing does.”

The Utah County Attorney did not respond to a request for comment about the claims online.

Speculation and conspiracy theories have become a routine feature of the reaction to high-profile acts of violence in the US in the polarised and trigger-happy landscape of social media and online forums.

After a gunman shot dead a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband in June, right-wing conspiracy theorists claimed that the shooting had been perpetrated by a left-wing extremist or carried out on behalf of the state's Democratic governor, Tim Walz.

The alleged gunman, Vance Boelter, espoused staunchly conservative views on issues including abortion and LGBTQ rights.

The 2022 mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas; the 2018 high school shooting in Parkland, Florida; and the 2017 Las Vegas shooting all spawned right-wing conspiracy theories, including the claim that the attacks had been staged to give the US government a pretext to curtail gun rights.

While many conspiracy theories have been driven by a particular ideological faction, Kirk's assassination is the latest event to fuel unfounded claims with “cross-ideological appeal”, said Eric Oliver, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago who studies conspiracy theories.

Claims about Robinson fit the mould of theories about the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the pharmaceutical industry, which also cut across partisan and ideological lines, Oliver said.

“People are also really emotionally charged by this, both on the left and the right, and will often gravitate to stories that rationalise their fear, rage or feelings of powerlessness,” Oliver told Al Jazeera.

The “extraordinary circumstances” of Kirk's murder, including a relative lack of information about Robinson, had also left a vacuum that was being filled by people “already suspicious of anything either the government does or this administration does”, Oliver added.

The transcripts of Robinson's alleged texts released by prosecutors provided some of the clearest indications yet of a possible motive for assassinating Kirk, who was lauded by conservatives but seen as an inflammatory figure on the left for his right-wing stances on immigration, abortion and transgender rights, among other issues.

Robinson allegedly told his partner that he had “had enough” of Kirk's “hatred” and “some hate can't be negotiated out”.

Authorities previously announced that they recovered bullet casings inscribed with a number of politically-charged and internet subculture-influenced messages, including “Hey fascist! Catch!”

Prosecutors, who allege Kirk was targeted over his “political expression”, have charged Robinson with aggravated murder and six other charges.

Steven B Duke, an expert in criminal law at Yale Law School, offered a blunt assessment of the possibility that prosecutors had fabricated evidence as crucial as the suspect's text messages.

“There is nothing in those messages making it even plausible that they were written by law enforcement,” Duke told Al Jazeera.

“The conspiracy theorists are crazy, as is anyone who agrees with them.”

Nonetheless, that Robinson's alleged communications with his partner after Kirk's assassination have only further fuelled conspiracies is not surprising, experts suggest.

“Many people have a worldview in which conspiracies are going on all the time and explain our social and political circumstances – those people believe lots and lots of conspiracy theories and exist on both the right and left,” said Joseph Uscinski, a professor of political science at the University of Miami, whose research focuses on conspiracy theories.

And though conspiracy theorising has become rampant on social media, the platforms themselves are not the problem, Uscinski said.

“People have worldviews; some of those worldviews make conspiracy theories easy to believe, whether those people are on social media or not,” he told Al Jazeera.

“Conspiracy theories existed long before social media and may have been more prominent then. We have to remember that people seek out content on social media that they like; they are not necessarily persuaded by social media content as much as they are attracted to content that tells them what they already believe.”
