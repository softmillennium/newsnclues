                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Telegram trading bot Snorter Bot Token (SNORT) nears $4 million in presale funding, the project has also rolled out major ecosystem updates that strengthen its position as a serious competitor to existing Telegram bots. Snorter is Solana-native by design, which gives it faster speeds and lower transaction costs than Ethereum-based rivals that remain weighed down by that network's limitations, even as they expand multichain. The latest updates show pieces of the roadmap now becoming reality, with features like MEV protection, automated copy trading, and expanded DEX support already taking shape. It achieves this through dedicated RPC endpoints – essentially private data highways that connect directly to the blockchain – giving it faster visibility into the mempool, where pending transactions appear before reaching public order books. By tracking liquidity injections, wallet flows, and new contract deployments in real time, the bot identifies tokens showing breakout potential and executes sub-second swaps directly inside Telegram. This gives retail traders a rare chance to act before the wider market catches on. With this integration, Snorter can now plug directly into their smart contracts, scanning fresh pools and routing trades instantly. Copy-trading has been upgraded as well, with faster wallet mirroring that lets users reliably follow top traders without missing a move. Withdrawals are now in testing, with added security checks and fee calculations being refined to ensure smooth transfers of SOL and other tokens to third-party wallets. Copy-trading is also undergoing early testing, with the team refining mirror logic to ensure trades from tracked wallets are matched smoothly and accurately. At the same time, reliability upgrades are being implemented to strengthen failover systems and improve transaction handling, keeping the bot consistent even under heavy load. These refinements matter because they push Snorter beyond raw speed and early detection. In crypto – where retail often struggles with failed transactions, unreliable copy-trading, or clunky withdrawal processes – stability and security can make the difference between securing profits and losing them. Taken together, these updates show that Snorter is progressing from concept to a fully operational system tailored for retail traders. They lay the foundation for a bot built to give smaller players the same kind of edge whales have long enjoyed, packaged in a tool that runs accessibly inside Telegram. Balances from the presale display directly in-app, with claiming made easy. Holders also gain exclusive access to brand new project launches through its Upcoming Tokens section. Best Wallet is available for download on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, everything is currently locked behind one thing: the whitelist. The Milk Mocha $HUGS whitelist is filling fast, and without signing up, you'll miss early access to every perk. Later buyers will face higher prices, fewer rewards, and a long climb to catch up with leaderboard players and stakers who got in first. This closed-loop system means that $HUGS doesn't just sit idle; it circulates, rewards players, and constantly pushes demand upward. Whitelist participants have the advantage of gaining entry before the crowds, allowing them to secure first entry into tournaments and enjoy better access to reward pools. Unlike other systems that lock you down, $HUGS staking is designed to be both accessible and powerful. Additionally, leaderboards will recognize top stakers with exclusive NFT badges and bonus prizes. Early whitelist members who accumulate tokens first will naturally have a stronger staking position, securing higher returns long before the wider audience gets in. Those who wait risk buying at higher prices later and missing weeks of compounding rewards. Every NFT drop can only be purchased with $HUGS, meaning whitelist members have early access to limited collections. With each upgrade or merge, more $HUGS are permanently removed from circulation. The result is a constantly deflationary supply while providing holders with interactive and valuable assets. Whitelist members will be first in line for the rarest drops and upgrades, while non-whitelisted users will be forced to chase the leftovers at higher prices. Inside, participants unlock the opportunity to play mini-games with live reward pools, stake tokens at a 50% APY with daily payouts, and mint NFTs that serve as both collectibles and ecosystem tools. Each of these activities burns supply, drives demand, and rewards those who got in early. Those who skip the whitelist will pay more later, miss out on early staking compounding, and face competition that has already secured positions at the top of leaderboards. Missing it means falling behind before the game even starts. Sign up today and secure your place inside the story Milk & Mocha is building. No, whitelist entry is simple and open to everyone with just an email sign-up. Lower entry price, early staking rewards, NFT access, and better chances in mini-games. All stakers earn a fixed 50% APY, with rewards calculated daily and withdrawable anytime. Yes, they unlock events, discounts, and can be upgraded through token burns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plasma, a new blockchain built specifically for stablecoins, is set to flip the switch on its long-awaited mainnet beta next week, introducing the chain and its native token, XPL, on Sept. 25. According to a blog post from the team, the network will debut with more than $2 billion in stablecoin liquidity from over a hundred partners on day one — an aggressive attempt to position Plasma not as just another general-purpose chain, but as the backbone for stablecoin transfers. Ethereum and Solana already dominate stablecoin volumes, while newer chains continue to optimize for similar flows. Plasma's bet is that its architecture, dubbed PlasmaBFT, will give it an edge. The system is designed for fast, composable stablecoin transactions the team said, and from launch, users will be able to move USDT with zero fees through Plasma's dashboard — a feature the team hopes will stand out in a crowded DeFi landscape. Prior to launch, 10% of XPL was sold in a public offering. At launch, 25 million tokens will be allocated to the community, with another 2.5 million reserved for members of the so-called Stablecoin Collective. Backing the project are heavyweights from the crypto and venture worlds: the $24 million in seed and Series A funding was led by Framework Ventures, with participation from Bitfinex, Peter Thiel and Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, among others. “Plasma's mission is to become the foundation for global money movement.

As Bitcoin BTC/USD edges closer to $118,000, prominent analyst Trader Mayne says the long-awaited 25-basis points interest rate cut clears the macro overhang and sets up one last Bitcoin-led push before an altcoin finale. He expects the current range to resolve upward, which could "sucker more people into the market," followed by a cleaner buying opportunity on weakness. Structurally, Mayne still treats the higher time frame as bullish. That roadmap features Bitcoin leading one more surge, after which dominance stalls and extreme altcoin moves see Ethereum ETH/USD hitting up to $7,000, Solana SOL/USD surging above $400 and Dogecoin DOGE/USD pushing for a new all-time high.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Reform Party has dismissed CBDC as governmental overreach, while advocating for a thriving private stablecoin market. The United Kingdom's minority party Reform has formally rejected the Bank of England's proposal to cap stablecoin holdings and its broader plan to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Last week, the Bank of England proposed restricting stablecoin exposure for individuals and businesses. Under the draft proposal, citizens would be limited to holding between £10,000 and £20,000 in systemic stablecoins, while businesses would face a maximum cap of £10 million. They argued that limiting the use of stablecoins risks choking off demand for British government debt while strengthening the position of global rivals. According to the statement, dollar–pegged stablecoins like USDC and USDT funnel significant liquidity into US Treasuries, reinforcing the dollar's dominance in digital finance. By contrast, the UK lacks any mechanism equivalent to a backstop demand for gilts. Where is the pound-backed stablecoin with deep liquidity, one that global markets can trust, one that channels fresh demand into UK gilts? It doesn't exist, because policymakers here have been openly hostile to innovators. Instead of building the future, Britain's regulators have smothered it.” Considering this, Yusuf argued that “stablecoins are not a danger to financial stability.” Instead, he described the assets as: They are simply new wrappers around money – safer, faster, programmable money that can settle instantly across borders without costly intermediaries.” According to the party, a state-backed CBDC would hand the Bank of England “unprecedented control” over financial activity, stifling competition and discouraging private-sector innovation. Instead, they advocate for regulated, privately issued stablecoins that could drive growth without giving government entities direct control over citizens' wallets. To support that approach, the party said it would advance its proposed Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill to establish a transparent and proportionate regulatory framework. By creating rules that balance consumer protection with market freedom, Reform argues the UK could emerge as a leader in the global stablecoin race and generate new employment opportunities in fintech and digital finance. Earlier this year, it became one of the first political groups in the UK to accept donations in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Reform holds five parliamentary seats within the current government behind Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, SNP, and Sinn Féin. It has minimal sway in current UK legislation. However, a collapse in support for Labour has placed Reform at the top of YouGov polling for the over-50s around a hypothetical snap election. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. Disclaimer: Our writers' opinions are solely their own and do not reflect the opinion of CryptoSlate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NBA superstar Kevin Durant can't find the password to his Coinbase account, which holds bitcoin that he began buying in earnest when he was playing for the Golden State Warriors in 2016. Durant's predicament has "only benefited" the hoopster, agent Rich Kleiman said. "We've yet to be able to track down his Coinbase account info, so we've never sold anything, and this bitcoin is just through the roof," Kleiman said Tuesday at CNBC's Game Plan conference in Los Angeles. "It's just a process we haven't been able to figure out, but Bitcoin keeps going up … so, I mean, it's only benefited us," he said. Durant, who will play for the Houston Rockets this upcoming season, began snapping up bitcoin around 2016, after the U.S. Olympic team legend and Kleiman attended a dinner in which his then-teammates kept discussing the cryptocurrency. The agent did not say how much bitcoin Durant bought. Bitcoin sold for between about $360 and $1,000 back in 2016, according to CoinGecko. Durant has been unable to access his Coinbase account for "a few years" due to a "user error on our end," Kleiman told CNBC on Wednesday. "We've already been working directly with the Coinbase team on Kevin's account recovery, which is why it was easy for me to make a joke about it on stage," Kleiman said. Kleiman said he and Durant are also investors in Coinbase Global, and that the company "has been a valuable resource in growing our business." In 2021, the duo's Thirty Five Ventures struck a multiyear deal with Coinbase to promote the trading platform, which includes creating content about digital assets for Durant's sports and entertainment website, Boardroom. Coinbase, in a statement to CNBC, said its users can reset their passwords using self-service tools within the trading platform's app. The platform for buying, selling and storing cryptocurrencies also has an around-the-clock support team fielding account recovery requests and other inquiries, according to a spokesman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solana's price may jump 20% within weeks, mirroring BNB's breakout pattern that led to fresh record highs above $1,000. Solana is mirroring BNB's 2024–25 rally, eyeing a breakout above $295. Solana (SOL) appears to be following a nearly identical chart trajectory to BNB (BNB), suggesting it may be on the verge of its own breakout. A side-by-side comparison of SOL and BNB weekly charts shows striking similarities for more than a year, as highlighted by BitBull on Thursday. Both BNB and Solana have traced nearly identical market structures since early 2024. Each posted a sharp first-leg rally, followed by a multimonth reaccumulation phase between mid-2024 and early 2025, characterized by sideways consolidation and corrective pullbacks, before resuming their uptrends. For BNB, this setup matured in August 2025, when it reclaimed its previous all-time high of $794.30. The breakout quickly gathered momentum, and within weeks, BNB extended its rally to a new record peak above $1,000 on Thursday. Solana now appears to be entering the same breakout phase that fueled BNB's parabolic rise, eyeing a breakout over its current record high at around $295 within a month, up about 20% from current levels. The pattern underscores how investor behavior tends to rhyme across markets: Early rallies draw in momentum, consolidations shake out weak hands and renewed liquidity inflows help the uptrend resume. For instance, Ether (ETH) surged from ~$10 to ~$400 in the first half of 2017, entered a six-month reaccumulation phase, then broke out again to hit about $1,400 by January 2018. The structure looked almost identical to Bitcoin's (BTC) earlier 2013 cycle. A decisive close above this neckline could trigger the next leg higher, with a technical breakout target projected over $540, up 120% from current price levels, by the year's end or early 2026. SOL's weekly relative strength index (RSI) remains below the overbought threshold of 70 despite steady gains, further hinting that there's more room to climb.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the biggest questions that come up, however, is whether you need to hire someone who has crypto-native experience, or someone that can learn the industry? That means there are well-established practices you can draw on to find the right people with the right skill sets. That's what this guide is for: to help founders and recruiters determine where crypto experience is crucial, where other kinds of experience can have the biggest impact, and what challenges and considerations need to be addressed along the way. To keep things simple, think of it like this: There are definitely ways that crypto companies differ from traditional tech firms. But when it comes to the processes and best practices of finding, hiring, and onboarding talent, you're not building a crypto company per se — you're just building a tech company. High-stakes projects often operate under tight timelines, where every day counts. The roles where this is especially true involve foundational constructs of blockchain technology and its applications, where even the most skilled professionals may face a steep learning curve. These self-executing agreements, encoded directly on the blockchain, demand precision and an understanding of decentralized logic that's different from traditional programming. A single vulnerability in a smart contract can be catastrophic and result in millions of dollars in losses, making this a high-stakes discipline where it's important to know the rules of the road. Onboarding talent into an industry with such a steep learning curve can be a challenge, as the candidate may require time to acclimate to the nuances of blockchain technology — decentralized vs. centralized, more open source, and so on — and the crypto “ethos,” which includes everything from different cultural lingo to mindsets. But there are many areas in which talent from non-crypto companies can fuel crypto's growth, especially as a company begins to scale. For example, traditional professionals with backgrounds in software engineering or operations can bring versatility and a breadth of experience honed through their experiences at larger software companies. These professionals have often worn multiple hats and have had to manage vast amounts of internal bureaucracy and barriers to get things shipped. In crypto's quickly growing multidisciplinary teams, this kind of operational flexibility becomes a powerful asset. Traditional candidates have often worked on products used by millions, and they've confronted (and solved) the challenges that come with such success: Ensuring systems stay up under extreme infrastructure load, optimizing performance at scale, and preparing for unpredictable spikes in demand. Candidates that come from fintech firms, for example, may have significant relevant experience in payments technology or financial regulations that may be important in your world too. Well there's a world of talent that's been doing this for years at scale.Consider what experience overlaps and where you can ramp them on crypto specific tech to build your unicorn team in house. More broadly, candidates who have experience in design, user experience, scalability, security, and leadership can also help accelerate crypto innovation, as these skills often have domain expertise that transfers well and may even work better than someone who doesn't have this experience.. After you've identified the skills and people you need — including determining whether they really need to have crypto-native experience or not — the next step is to go out and recruit them. For some candidates coming from established companies, crypto industry volatility, recent regulatory uncertainty, insider jargon, and decentralized products will be too new or unappealing or both. Their reaction may tell you how they might have responded in a similar situation and at the very least, will let them know what's expected of anyone at your company when the next situation arises. A candidate might not know a ton about crypto when you first make contact, but natural curiosity and interest in the benefits of decentralization are key. A big signal over the recruitment process will be how much their knowledge and engagement deepens along the way: Are they researching things on their own? To differentiate between the two types of candidates — the crypto-wary and the crypto-curious — and to avoid wasting your time and money, seek to understand people's motivations as early as possible to make sure they and your company are moving in the same direction. Those same things are likely to be a critical part of their decision-making process this time around, too. Start learning the answers to those questions in your very first call with a candidate. By the end of the recruiting process, you want to be hiring someone who is aligned with your company's vision and excited about your product. And your team needs to be excited to work with the new hire, too; that will help you align whether the candidate fits your company or not regardless of degree of crypto experience. A useful thought experiment is to figure out how to talk about your product and company without talking about crypto. Why will the world be a better place because of it? Another good starting point is simply to ask, “What do you know about crypto?” Even if you get skeptical answers — stories from the news, the casino-culture narrative — it will give you an opening, and allow you to listen for what they are really scared about: external factors (policy), intrinsic ones (tech complexity), personal ones (risk tolerance), and so on. Historically, top talent has been reluctant to join early-stage companies for three reasons: (1) a grindfest culture, (2) bad work-life balance, and (3) lack of liquid compensation. Even if you solve for the first two, the third can eliminate a significant portion of your potential candidate pool. Compensation innovation, such as token-based structures, can provide both financial upside and liquidity at early-stage companies — compared to the rare liquidity events like an IPO or acquisition that you see in web2. Compensation is a complicated topic and is obviously top of mind for candidates, so make sure you're thoroughly prepared to talk about it. If you do these steps well, you'll have a solid chance of getting top talent from outside the industry interested in your company. For example, new hires may need help to see beyond the technicalities of blockchain and decentralized systems, so they understand the real-world problems they'll be solving and gain confidence in their roles. Regular knowledge-sharing session between new hires and veteran employees with deeper crypto experience will foster collaboration and allow team members to learn from one another's strengths. Mentorship programs can pair newcomers with experienced web3 professionals to provide invaluable hands-on learning. Even better, you can structure the program so that crypto “unicorn” talent (someone who has all the skills, knowledge, and background) is paired with newcomers who can develop over time into crypto unicorns of their own. Resources like blockchain-focused blogs, podcasts, and education courses -– in things like how to use a smart wallet, how to stake, tokenomics, smart contract design, or basic concepts around how blockchains are being leveraged in different use cases– offer a strong starting point for continual learning. Mentorship roles with established crypto organizations can provide practical experience, while thought leaders in the industry can offer insights through reports (including our own State of Crypto report). The key takeaway is, whatever your new hires need to excel, your job is to help them learn, find, or access it from day one. Regardless of whether you hire someone crypto-native or crypto-curious, your mantra should always be to: Hire smart people to build products that serve users. The transition to crypto isn't just about adopting new technology. It's about cultivating a shared vision that blends the best of both worlds. Experienced professionals bring critical expertise in scaling, usability, and strategic leadership, while crypto-native talent offers specialized knowledge of blockchain systems and decentralized principles. To succeed, your organization must invest in thoughtful onboarding, collaborative team structures, and continuous education to set them up for that collaboration and success.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI is central to a new technology partnership between the U.K. and the U.S., but cooperation on crypto policy isn't a top priority. As U.S. President Donald Trump visits the U.K. American Big Tech firms have announced billions of dollars of investment in the country. But while AI has taken center stage in the transatlantic partnership, it's business as usual for the U.K. crypto sector. We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you. The chipmaker announced a fresh £500 million investment from BlackRock in partnership with Digital Gravity Partners, which will be used to upgrade existing data centers with new Nvidia tech. Meanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang, who joined Donald Trump at Wednesday night's state banquet with the king, announced  that Nvidia would acquire a £500 million stake in NScale. The British AI infrastructure startup is a major beneficiary of the recent flurry of Big Tech investments, being a partner in Microsoft's supercomputer project and a joint venture with OpenAI and Nvidia announced on Tuesday. Against Microsoft's headline investment, other hyperscaler's U.K. data center plans paled in comparison. On Tuesday, Google committed  £5 billion over two years to support AI research and cloud infrastructure development in the country. Meanwhile, Coreweave will spend  an additional £1.5 billion boosting its data centre capacity in the U.K. Amid a whirlwind of announcements highlighting transatlantic collaboration on AI, crypto has so far been absent from the government's rhetoric. According to the Financial Times, British officials still hope to agree on closer U.S.-U.K alignment on the issue. But as of Thursday, no such deal had been announced. And regardless of whether they reach an agreement on crypto, it doesn't appear to be a top priority for Westminster. Where the White House has centered crypto in its economic and technological vision for America, Kier Starmer's government has been far more reserved. Lawmakers are focused on steady legislative progress rather than headline-grabbing initiatives and partisan battle lines. As it prepares for its expanded remit, the FCA has signalled  that it will exempt the sector from some of the strictest rules it imposes on traditional financial firms. “We want to develop a sustainable and competitive crypto sector – balancing innovation, market integrity and trust,” David Geale, the FCA's executive director of payments and digital finance, said on Wednesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, a team of stablecoin and blockchain-based real-world asset (RWA) pioneers is doing the same for tokenized assets. A new startup, STBL, emulates TradFi's zero-coupon strip structures by converting digital assets into a dollar-pegged stablecoin and yield-bearing non-fungible token (NFT). The product, currently in beta testing, goes beyond just packaging risk into different tranches. It's profitable business, Tether reported $4.9 billion net profit in the second quarter. “Our mission at STBL is to evolve stablecoins from corporate products into public infrastructure,” said STBL co-founder Reeve Collins, who was also a cofounder of Tether. When a yield-bearing on-chain asset — this could be any yield-bearing RWA, such as Franklin Templeton's BENJI, BlackRock's BUIDL or Ondo's USDY — is deposited and locked into the STBL protocol, it splits into a stablecoin (USST) that can circulate and serve as collateral or reserves in decentralized finance (DeFi) and a separate, yield-accruing non-fungible token (NFT) called YLD. “When a user who's already whitelisted with a Franklin Templeton or BlackRock fund locks that asset into STBL, they receive an NFT that controls the vault,” Sehra said in an interview. “You hold the NFT and accrue interest, while the stable asset can be used as collateral, as reserves, or to mint an ecosystem-specific stablecoin aligned with GENIUS Act requirements.” In the year or so before STBL started up, Sehra and Collins were looking at how RWAs or tokenized securities could be used in DeFi; asking how they worked as collateral; how money market funds became the reserves for minting stablecoins, and so on. To ensure the USST stablecoin component isn't viewed as a security required a mechanism to maintain the dollar peg. This is achieved by ensuring it is slightly over collateralized coupled with an incentive system related to mint fees and burn credits should deviation happen in a volatile market. Sehra referred to STBL's peg-maintenance system as “synthetic” rather than “algorithmic.” “As a result of this novel structure, eligible participants that hold permitted RWAs can mint and burn compliant stablecoins. The protocol's decentralized governance token, also called STBL, has been added to Binance Alpha, Binance Futures and Kraken Spot, and will list on other spot exchanges soon, Sehra said. The next steps involve a $100 million minting using Franklin Templeton's BENJI token, Sehra said, and also the announcement of several other partnerships, including with a U.S. based payments firm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Interest rate fluctuations are a primary driver for how institutions allocate capital towards risk on assets. Lower interest rates trigger higher investor risk appetite, as patterns indicate stronger inflows into digital assets. Notably, TOTAL3 has increased by 109.43% YoY, highlighting how altcoins often outperform Bitcoin as higher-beta assets during easing cycles. Bitcoin dominance is showing signs of reversal as the altcoins market jumped from below 35% to 41% in early September, while Bitcoin's dominance slid below 58% for the first time in 2025. The existing cycle shows a growing institutional interest across multiple crypto verticals. Binance Research (PDF) has highlighted stronger performance in sectors such as DeFi, stablecoins, and RWA. At the same time, research on institutional adoption of DeFi emphasises that 24% of institutions currently engage with crypto products, and this number is expected to triple in the next two years. As Bitcoin dominance falls below 57%, institutions are diversifying by capitalising on the regulatory tailwind, indicating that institutional interest is no longer confined to a single asset. Binance France President David Princay recently commented on a potential altcoin season, “If or when BTC prices plateau, institutions and corporations may look to diversify their crypto holdings further. It will be interesting to observe how an altcoin season unfolds in a more mature and regulated crypto market.” Rising DEX volumes are an early indicator of investors pivoting their strategy to increase altcoin exposure. With many new tokens initially unavailable on centralised exchanges, DEXs capture dislocated liquidity by offering listings ahead of traditional platforms. DEX volumes doubled over the past year, with spot reaching 23.1% and futures climbing to 9.3%. Additionally, DEX trading volumes reached a combined total of over $1.15 trillion in 2025. Similarly, Ethereum has reached an all-time high monthly DEX volume of $139.63 billion in August 2025, emphasising how investors seek DEXs as alternative trading infrastructures to access new assets. Fee reductions on Ethereum have supported increased activity and reduced costs for DeFi users. The network has also enabled higher on-chain trading volumes, which more than doubled in 2025 while centralised exchange activity declined. Growing on-chain metrics emphasise the structural shift toward decentralised infrastructure as a driver of market activity. On-chain data illustrate that DeFi protocols are continuing to grow in value. Total value locked (TVL) on lending increased by 65% to $79.8B for the first time, with investors identifying new opportunities to deploy capital towards on-chain lending. The SEC's announcement not to classify liquid staking as a security prompted positive institutional momentum. Such developments underline DeFi's role in evolving beyond deposit and towards active use cases. Stablecoin deposits on exchanges climbed to an all-time high of $68 billion, indicating available capital for potential deployment from retail and institutional investors towards digital assets. What was once seen as a speculative corner of crypto is now attracting serious institutional attention, reshaping portfolio strategies in the process. If the trend continues, altcoins may move beyond being seen as just “alternatives” to Bitcoin. Instead, they could become core pieces of diversified crypto strategies, signalling a shift in how investors approach the next phase of the digital economy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum is approaching a decisive phase that could carry it into five-figure territory, according to a multi-timeframe analysis from trader Cantonese Cat (@Cantonmeow). In a video published today, the analyst argues that ETH has cleared a cluster of late-cycle resistances and is now exhibiting a confluence of technical signals—on monthly, weekly, daily, and intraday charts—that “favor some of the higher targets to be met, maybe 1.272, 1.414, 1.618, anywhere around potentially five figures.” These Fib levels would put ETH at $7,752, $9,883 and $14,011 respectively. Simultaneously, the monthly Bollinger Bands are expanding while price “is impulsively going to the upside here along with the upper Bollinger Band,” a backdrop he describes as consistent with trend acceleration rather than mean reversion. “It does favor some of the higher targets to be met,” he said, while stressing sequencing: “We need to kind of break above the previous all-time high here first before we can actually talk about moving further up.” “When you have the Tenkan and Kijin fused together and price is riding up along with it, this fusion over here is called Katana,” he explained. Each prior cycle saw deviations above and below a governing trend line before a sustained move once the zone was recaptured. The lower timeframes, in his view, are already aligning with that outcome. On the daily chart, he highlights a developing “Adam and Eve continuation pattern” nested within a classic cup-and-handle, where “the handle… volume is not that great,” which he views as textbook, followed by “a pretty decent volume bullish engulfing candle.” Measured against log-scale retracements, price was rejected at 0.786, found support at 0.5, and is now “trying to break through 0.6… work our way back… to 0.786,” a rhythm he says “is being respected pretty decently.” He also points to a short-term bottoming sequence—“you can see something called a tweezer bottom… if you have anywhere around two or three of these kind of wick sticking down like that, that's usually a pretty decent bottom”—and a three-candle “morning star” reversal: “It's a reversal pattern and it could end up leading to a reversal here… seems to be working out pretty well.” “It does look like a reaccumulation type pattern… showing some strength… consolidating sideways… to reaccumulate before [a] bullish continuation,” he said, adding that after the prior vertical leg, digestion at elevated levels is constructive. On a monthly volatility basis, he adds, “the 20-month moving average was reclaimed… and we simply spent a month here back-testing” it—evidence that dominance could trend higher if the back-test holds. Breadth indicators outside of ETH also tilt risk-on in his framework. He emphasizes the distinction between log and linear retracements, noting a failed linear 0.886 breakout in a prior attempt: “If we were to break above the linear, as well as the log 0.886 here with style, then I think Others would end up performing extremely well and would end up following the footsteps of Ethereum.” His conclusion is unambiguous: “I am bullish on Ethereum. I'm bullish on the cryptocurrency market space in general.” CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.© 2025 TradingView, Inc.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CBDCs are tools of sovereignty in a world shifting eastward, edging away from dollar dominance We are living in a rapidly transforming financial landscape. It mandates full reserve backing in US dollars or short-term treasuries – a bid to make America the “crypto capital of the world”, funding deficits while reviving the dollar's long-cherished “exorbitant privilege”. Global cryptocurrency value has rocketed from just $5 billion in 2015 to more than $3 trillion by mid-2025, fuelled by technology, institutional adoption, exchange-traded funds and speculative fever. Yet crypto's story is one of boom and bust. Volatile prices, thin reserves and fragile pegs have repeatedly triggered bank-run dynamics. The digital economy already accounts for $16 trillion – 14 percent of global GDP – and it is being supercharged by artificial intelligence. Such a system demands infrastructure with security, trust and scale. Retail CBDCs extend digital cash to the public. Both can cut costs, enhance security and integrate seamlessly with tokenised assets. More strategically, they are becoming tools of sovereignty in a world shifting eastward, fragmenting and edging away from dollar dominance. For many states, CBDCs are no longer optional – they are defensive shields against US financial power and offensive tools for economic inclusion. Its planned digital dirham could be live by the end of 2025, supporting domestic payments, cross-border trade and e-commerce. It builds on the UAE's role as a crypto hub – home to Vara, the world's first independent virtual asset regulator and to pioneering tokenisation projects in real estate. Tokenised assets are moving from theory to practice. A digital dirham will make the payment system more efficient, facilitating transactions between individuals, businesses and governments, securely and at a lower cost. Millions of expatriate workers and small businesses in the Gulf remain excluded from formal finance. A state-backed digital currency can bring them into the fold securely, lowering remittance costs and expanding economic participation. Smart contracts will add automation, creating new efficiencies in trade and finance. The UAE, meanwhile, has conducted joint CBDC trials with Saudi Arabia and China through the Bank for International Settlements-backed mBridge project, and with Riyadh through Project Aber. These efforts hint at an alternative financial architecture – one not reliant on the dollar. Today, the greenback still accounts for nearly half of all international payments and dominates trade finance with an 82 percent share. But 98 percent of stablecoins are also pegged to the dollar, reinforcing its grip. Imagine a trade transaction flowing between China and the UAE, settled instantly in e-CNY and digital dirham without touching dollars or the Swift payments system. That is no longer hypothetical – it's already been tested. Such flows foreshadow a future in which cross-border transactions are faster, cheaper and less dollar-dependent. Decentralised finance usage in the country has grown 74 percent year on year, and the Dubai Land Department predicts tokenised real estate could reach $16 billion by 2033. Unless the UAE and other forward-leaning economies scale CBDCs quickly, they risk ceding ground to dollar-denominated stablecoins. The global financial system is being redesigned – and whoever controls it will shape trade, power and trust in the digital age.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Banking institutions that aim to get involved in activities related to virtual currencies should consider adopting blockchain analytics tools for additional risk management capabilities, New York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris said Wednesday (Sept. 17). Blockchain analytics tools can enhance banking institutions' compliance programs and prevent illegal activities, Harris said in a press release announcing new guidance on the use of the tools by New York State-regulated banking organizations that are considering or already conducting virtual currency-related activities. According to the release, blockchain analytics can be used to assess risk exposure through customer wallet screening and funds verification involving virtual asset service providers; conduct holistic monitoring for illicit activity exposure and risk management of third parties; augment due diligence controls to evaluate expected versus actual activity of customers engaged in virtual currency activity; and weigh the risks associated with virtual currency products or services. “As traditional banking institutions expand into virtual currency activities, their compliance functions must adapt, onboarding new tools and technologies to mitigate new and different risks,” Harris said in the release. In that guidance, Harris established the use of blockchain analytics tools as a best practice for these entities to prevent and manage financial risks and suspicious activities. Blockchain analytics has made it easy to conduct transaction monitoring and determine whether a transaction came from, for example, a regulated institution or a darknet market, Caitlin Barnett, director of regulation and compliance at Chainalysis, told PYMNTS in an interview posted in November 2022. PYMNTS reported in April that Washington's evolving regulatory stance is poised to potentially reshape how banks and custodians engage with digital assets.
