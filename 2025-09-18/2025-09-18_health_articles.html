                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A multidisciplinary team used advanced imaging and computational modeling to analyze the "crosstalk" between neurons and their supporting glial cells in the human brain. "By mapping these cell interactions at the molecular level, we identified key pathways that could be pivotal in both the onset and progression of neurodegeneration," said study co-author Oscar Harari, PhD, director of the Division of Neurogenetics and director of the Center for Neurobiology of Aging and Resiliency at The Ohio State University Neuroscience Research Institute. "This insight is critical for developing effective treatments, as 'cellular crosstalk' may serve as an attractive molecular target for drug development. Many of these cell-to-cell communication pathways include proteins at the cell membrane, which are often regarded as promising targets for therapeutic intervention," said Harari, who is also the Helen C. Kurtz Associate Professor of Neurology at Ohio State. He collaborated equally with study co-author Tae-Wan Kim, PhD, associate professor of Pathology and Cell Biology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. Our research shows that Alzheimer's is not only driven by plaques and tangles, but also by a breakdown in communication between brain cells. By uncovering the SEMA6D–TREM2 crosstalk pathway, we reveal a new way to enhance the amyloid-clearing functions of microglia and potentially slow Alzheimer's progression." Tae-Wan Kim, PhD, associate professor of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York The study included investigators from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, as well as collaborators from Australia, South Korea, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Indiana University School of Medicine, and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women suffering from long COVID have a greater risk of experiencing abnormal uterine bleeding. This bidirectional relationship between long COVID and menstrual disorders has been revealed by a French-British research team co-led by a CNRS researcher. An inflammatory reaction is suspected of being behind this connection, after the discovery of an immune cell cluster in the endometrium of the patients receiving treatment. No abnormalities were detected in relation to ovarian hormones. These conclusions, which were just published in Nature Communications, are based on a combination of three approaches: a study conducted among 12,187 British women; follow-up care for 54 women suffering from long COVID for three months; and analysis of blood and endometrial samples. As long COVID affects 3-7% of the world's population, and is twice as prevalent among women than men, this novel study paves the way for new therapeutic prospects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the second leading cause of death globally, cancer is a worldwide health crisis, particularly as life expectancies continue to increase. Metastasis accounts for a vast majority of cancer-related deaths, but the molecular machinery driving this behavior is still poorly understood. The cytoskeleton is a critical component of cancer cell migration and is broadly involved in cell structure and motility. Actin filaments can also be used as an indicator of cell necrosis, as the loss of membrane integrity causes F-actin to become exposed. Tumors in particular can be challenging targets for such approaches, as they are heterogeneous, and 2D cross-sectional visualization may not provide a complete picture of the cellular dynamics at play. Therefore, an accurate molecular understanding of the cytoskeleton's role in metastasis would necessitate imaging techniques that capture volumetric data. A recent study from the Vienna University of Technology, Austria, used light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) to examine cytoskeletal changes in spheroids composed of either colorectal cancer (CRC) or non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells in 3D. The 2D data measured with this technique were deconvoluted in NeuroDeblur (MBF Bioscience) and reconstructed into a 3D representation using Thermo Scientific Amira Software, which revealed intricate internal and external tissue structures. F-actin filaments in a colorectal cancer cell spheroid, captured with light sheet fluorescence microscopy. 70 images were captured through a 90-µm thick sample. Image Credit: Figure reproduced from Prado-López et al. under CC-BY 4.0. When this is done at discreet intervals throughout an entire sample volume, precise optical sectioning of the specimen becomes possible, producing a data series that can be deconvoluted and stacked into a 3D volume. Prado-López et al. used this approach to analyze cancer-cell spheroids produced from CRC and NSCLC specimens. In particular, F-actin structures could be clearly identified, along with quantification of their intensity in individual cells (see below). F-actin distribution (a) and quantification (b) in five colorectal cancer cells. Image Credit: Figure reproduced from Prado-López et al. under CC-BY 4.0. Quantitative analysis through Amira Software segmentation also allowed F-actin intensity to be correlated to CRC and NSCLC cell necrosis. Six distinct regions were identified and mapped to different cellular states, such as proliferation, senescence, and necrosis. Prado-López et al. found they could directly observe this F-actin behavior in a more physiologically relevant, 3D context. Subsequent segmentation in Amira Software provided a quantitative analysis of F-actin distribution. This approach is an exciting step forward in our ability to view cancer cell mobility and metastasis at a molecular level.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In focused ultrasound therapies, these devices enable instantaneous tracking to open the blood-brain barrier for safe and precise drug delivery. Moreover, their ultrafast data acquisition supports EEG, MEG, and brain-computer interface applications, delivering precise signal capture for diagnostics and therapeutic development. GaGe technology provides more detailed insights into both brain function and next-generation neurotherapies. A high-power focused ultrasound transducer aimed at the brain was employed to induce cavitation in microbubbles injected into the bloodstream. Tracking a Passive Cavitation Detector (PCD) in contact with the brain to generate spectrograms has been demonstrated to be a robust method to detect and characterize cavitation in mice brains. This study investigates usage of such a PCD to detect cavitation in monkey brains, where detection is more difficult due to their thicker skulls. This induction was achieved by aiming a high-power focused ultrasound transducer at the brain. How GaGe digitizers were used: The amplitude of the focused transducer's excitation was monitored by a Gage CompuScope digitizer. The resulting CompuScope data was used to estimate absolute ultrasonic pressure, enabling analysis of its effect on microbubble cavitation within mouse brains. Challenge: Neuroimmunomodulation is a drug-free treatment that uses high-power focused ultrasound to irradiate the brain. The treatment can be effective for neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's. This paper experimentally compared three separate proposed mechanisms in mice brains. The irradiating high-power focused ultrasonic transducer contained a smaller low-power transducer used to align the focused transducer and to track ultrasonic activity in the brain in some applications. How GaGe digitizers were used: Measurements of infrared light absorption and scattering can provide insight, for instance, on blood oxygenation and tissue composition. The Gage waveform data was subsequently utilized to determine final infrared absorption and scattering measurements. In medical and brain research, studying tissues at the molecular level without damaging the samples is critical. Conventional approaches can be rough and do not always provide a clear picture. Challenge: Examining brain tissue at the molecular level is crucial for advancing medical research, but conventional mass spectrometry approaches may damage fragile samples and lack the detailed images required for 3D analysis. How GaGe digitizers were used: Through the combination of high-speed laser pulses with an ultrafast GaGe Digitizer, the research team developed a robust, novel imaging method. This system gently eliminates and evaluates small layers of brain tissue, with precise, real-time signal capture, producing non-destructive, high-resolution 3D images that expose the structure and chemical makeup of brain samples. This approach lays the foundation for improved diagnostics and brain research. This study is related to developments in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a method utilized in neuroscience and neurology for non-invasive brain stimulation. Challenge: Conventional TMS coils, such as the figure-8 coil, have constraints in stimulating deep brain regions without causing undesired cortical stimulation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The acoustic startle response is an unconditional reflex manifested as a rapid contraction of facial and skeletal muscles in response to a sudden and intense startling stimulus. Translational research, in particular, benefits from the study of the acoustic startle response because this response is consistent across a range of different species. The acoustic startle response also uses neural circuitry, which is simple in nature while being sensitive to a range of experimental manipulations. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is an important phenomenon used to model sensorimotor gating. The acoustic startle response in rodents is extremely brief, making this difficult to assess. It may be possible to weaken this response via a preceding weaker stimulus (pre-pulse). PPI has been documented in a range of species, including mice and humans, affording researchers a useful means of operationally measuring sensorimotor gating and determining an animal's ability to successfully integrate and prevent sensory information. The SR-LAB acoustic startle response software controls a diverse array of tone, noise burst, light, foot shock, air puff, and background noise combinations. It can also support various test paradigms without requiring additional software. The SR-LAB system can easily accommodate the most prevalent test paradigms via a single software program, making it more cost-effective than similar systems. Users can design customized paradigms as required, and data is easily verifiable because each response allows users to confirm numeric data by reviewing the entire waveform. The SR-LABS's tubular enclosures allow animals to turn without constraint, removing the restraint stress that often significantly impacts acoustic startle response test results.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People with temporal lobe epilepsy in particular often wander around aimlessly and unconsciously after a seizure. Researchers at the University Hospital Bonn (UKB), the University of Bonn, and the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) have identified a neurobiological mechanism that could be responsible for this so-called post-ictal wandering and potentially other postictal symptoms. According to their hypothesis, epileptic seizures are not directly responsible for post-ictal symptoms, but rather seizure-associated depolarization waves, also known as spreading depolarization (SD). In everyday clinical practice, symptoms are regularly observed after epileptic seizures, known as "post-ictal symptoms", which, in contrast to the usually short duration of seizures, typically last several minutes to hours. Besides symptoms such as impaired speech and language comprehension, a state of disorientation may occur. This wandering about, known in technical terms as postictal wandering, can sometimes be life-threatening if, for example, the affected unconscious person runs onto the street. "Postictal symptoms are traditionally referred to the preceding epileptic seizure. However, it is unclear whether there is actually a direct neurobiological connection or whether the symptoms are based on another pathology," says corresponding author Prof. Michael Wenzel from the Dept. The Bonn research team initially wanted to better understand the development of epilepsy as a result of an initial acute disease-in this case, viral encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain caused by viruses. To do this, they used modern cellular-resolution fluorescence microscopy in combination with electrophysiology and optogenetics in a mouse model, which allows them to study network dynamics and the communication of different brain cell types in the living brain with high resolution over a period of months. "In doing so, we accidentally discovered a network phenomenon in the hippocampus-a structure relevant to epilepsy located inside the temporal lobe-that could explain postictal symptoms but, surprisingly, does not represent seizures themselves," says first author Bence Mitlasóczki, a doctoral student at the University of Bonn in Prof. Wenzel's research group at the UKB. The observed phenomenon consists of slow depolarization waves, which are mainly known from neurological disorders such as migraine or acute brain injuries. This could also explain why postictal symptoms are most commonly observed in temporal lobe epilepsy." "As a result, SDs have been 'invisible' in clinical EEGs for decades, which is an important reason why the strictly seizure-related concept of postictal symptoms persists, even though this may not be accurate," states Prof. Wenzel. To do this, they used a special feature of pre-surgical diagnostics at the UKB for people with difficult-to-treat epilepsy, which tests whether a local seizure focus can be surgically removed. "Our hypothesis is that local seizure-associated SD is a key factor in epilepsy that has been massively understudied to date," says co-author Prof. Heinz Beck from the UKB and DZNE. The results point to a possible general role of SD in a variety of different postictal disorders, which now need to be investigated further. "In addition, our results require a review of previous studies which, because SD was filtered out, related effects and effect sizes to epileptic seizures, even though this may not be the case," says Prof. Wenzel. "Finally, our study could stimulate a discussion on whether the international EEG standard needs to be expanded to make SD directly visible in clinical EEG as well." Mitlasóczki, B., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The treatment of obesity has been transformed in recent years by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists such as semaglutide, which reduce appetite, slow the release of food from the stomach and increase feelings of fullness. That's because obesity is driven by more than appetite alone – it also involves disrupted lipid and glucose metabolism, changes in adipose tissue and mitochondrial dysfunction, leaving plenty of room for new approaches, explains Riccardo Panella, co-founder and CEO of Turin-based biotech Resalis Therapeutics. The company's approach involves an antisense oligonucleotide – a small, lab-made fragment of genetic material designed to block a specific RNA in the body. miR22 is a "master controller" of many processes involved in obesity, including lipid metabolism (how the body breaks down and uses fats), the production and activity of mitochondria (the tiny structures that provide cells with energy) and adipose tissue remodeling (changes in how body fat is organized and how it functions), says Dr Panella, who is one of the authors of the new research. The hope is that by tackling all these factors simultaneously, RES-010, which is administered once a week as a subcutaneous injection, will reprogram the metabolism, producing long-lasting weight loss. Pre-clinical studies show that the compound can induce significant weight loss – and that the lost weight isn't regained when treatment stops. Riccardo Panella, Co-Founder and CEO, Resalis Therapeutics Experiments also showed that mice that had been treated with RES-010 did not regain weight after the drug was stopped. This is important because rapid weight loss when on a diet or taking GLP-1 drugs can lead to lean mass, which includes muscle and bone, being lost too. "Lean mass, especially skeletal muscle, is central to strength, stamina and blood sugar regulation, and so its loss is potentially harmful," says Dr Panella. They observed that while the NHPs given semaglutide alone regained weight after semaglutide was discontinued, the animals receiving the combination treatment did not regain weight after semaglutide was stopped and they remained on RES-010 alone. Moreover, no rebound occurred when RES-010 was also stopped a few weeks later. Tests on animals and non-human organoids have shown how the drug works. Dr Panella says: "RES-010 works by reprogramming how cells handle fat and energy "Rather than reducing appetite, it changes the way in which the body uses fats, boosts the production and activity of mitochondria, the 'batteries' that power cells, and helps convert white fat, which stores energy, into brown fat, which burns it. "Because it acts on these fundamental pathways, weight regain is less likely. "RES-010 is pioneering a new class of RNA medicines that reprogram the body's metabolism, with the aim of producing long-lasting weight loss and improved metabolic health by, for example, improving liver health." The randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, will involve up to 80 participants (including some with overweight or obesity) and assess the safety and side-effects of various doses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The therapy significantly reduced cancer activity and provided symptom relief, underscoring its potential as a viable treatment option. SFT is a rare type of soft tissue tumor with few treatment options available. Although most SFTs are classified as benign with minimal risk of recurrence, about 15 to 20 percent are malignant, and those considered benign have the potential for malignant transformation. In several sarcomas, particularly SFT, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is highly expressed on the surface of tumor cells and surrounding fibroblasts. Helena Lanzafame, MD, researcher, Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Essen, Germany The study included three patients who had already tried multiple standard therapies without success. Molecular analysis of their tumor tissues revealed remarkably high levels of the FAP protein, confirmed with advanced FAPI-46 PET imaging. In addition, no serious side effects were observed among the patients. "This is the first time we have seen such strong and deep responses in advanced SFT using this precision radiation approach," noted Rainer Hamacher, MD, lead oncologist in the Department of Medical Oncology, Sarcoma Center, West German Cancer Center at University Hospital Essen. "Our findings suggest that screening for FAP expression could help identify patients most likely to benefit from this novel therapy."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Getting out of bed in the morning without the risk of passing out is a game-changer for 32-year-old Cody Krebs. Since that time, Krebs requires the use of a wheelchair. He was vulnerable to blood pressure drops where he was at risk of losing consciousness, and spikes placing him at risk of a heart attack and stroke. However, an international clinical trial led by teams at the University of Calgary, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), and University of Lausanne (UNIL), in Switzerland, and Sint Maartenskliniek, Radboudumc, in the Netherlands has given him control again. "Before the accident, I had no idea how volatile blood pressure can be. "At other times during the day, my blood pressure would spike due to severe nerve pain, causing me to break out in a sweat and experience severe migraines." Krebs is part of ongoing research at the University of Calgary based on a major discovery to stabilize blood pressure for people with SCI. In a rare double publication in both Nature and Nature Medicine, a pair of landmark studies by Dr. Aaron Phillips, PhD, UCalgary, Dr. Grégoire Courtine, PhD, EPFL, and Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, MD, UNIL, describe the development of a targeted therapy to address blood pressure regulation in 14 participants across four clinical studies conducted at three separate medical centers in Canada, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The study participants and Krebs now have an implantable system on their spine consisting of a new class of electrode arrays. The result is a compact, adaptable system capable of restoring blood pressure stability through targeted neuromodulation that can be controlled through an app. The Nature Medicine study demonstrates several important factors. First, we show that low blood pressure after a spinal cord injury has serious medical consequences that must not be clinically ignored. Second, we show that our neuromodulation therapy for blood pressure instability after SCI can be deployed effectively in diverse clinical settings, at several centers in different countries with different medical protocols." We also showed that spinal cord stimulation can compete with this neuronal architecture to safely and precisely regulate blood pressure," says Courtine, director of NeuroRestore Center and professor at EPFL. The results were consistent in study participants across all sites: once activated, the system restored blood pressure to a functional range, often within minutes. "Based on our experiences with this novel treatment, participants report experiencing less brain fog, having more energy, being able to speak louder, and suffering less from a postprandial dip. In addition, once the surgery was performed by neurosurgeon Erkan Kurt at Radboudumc, this system proved relatively easy to use in their home environment," says Dr. Ilse van Nes, MD, PhD, who successfully deployed the system at the rehabilitation center Sint Maartenskliniek in Nijmegen, Netherlands. It's a key milestone toward making this technology widely available," says Bloch, neurosurgeon at Lausanne University Hospital. While much of the focus in SCI care has been on restoring movement, a majority of patients live with chronic hypotension, a condition that leaves them exhausted, cognitively dulled, prone to fainting, and predisposes to cardiovascular disease over the long-term. "Therefore, it's an easy transition to implant them for this novel indication. We've seen very impressive and immediate improvements in blood pressure that are evident as soon as the device is turned on intra-operatively." Also, there are fewer dangerous spikes in my blood pressure. I am very grateful for all the research being done." The implantable neurostimulation system evaluated in these studies was developed by ONWARD Medical. ONWARD Medical has recently received FDA approval to initiate a pivotal trial of this therapy, which is expected to involve approximately 20 leading neurorehabilitation and neurosurgical research centers across Canada, Europe and the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study led by UC San Francisco and UC Davis has concluded that radiation from medical imaging is associated with a higher risk of blood cancers in children. The researchers examined data from nearly 4 million children and estimated that 1 in 10 blood cancers - some 3,000 cancers in all - may be attributable to radiation exposure from medical imaging. Medical imaging saves lives by enabling timely diagnosis and effective treatment, but it also exposes patients to ionizing radiation, a known carcinogen, particularly through computed tomography (CT). The authors caution that doctors and parents should avoid excessive radiation doses and minimize exposure when clinically feasible. "While medical imaging can be lifesaving, our findings underscore the critical need to carefully evaluate and minimize radiation exposure during pediatric imaging to safeguard children's long-term health," said Smith-Bindman, who is also a member of the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies. "This involves ensuring that imaging is performed only when it provides essential information for the child's care and, in cases such as CT scans, using the lowest possible radiation doses." The study uses a retrospective cohort design, looking back at the complete imaging histories of 3.7 million children who were born between 1996 and 2016. Investigators found a significant relationship between cumulative radiation dose and the risk of a hematologic malignancy, which includes tumors affecting the blood, bone marrow, lymph, and lymphatic system. The risk of developing cancer varied significantly by imaging modality. CT, which is used to detect many abnormalities such as tumors, heart disease, and injuries of the spinal cord and brain, entails significant radiation exposure. But radiographs, which are used to diagnose both broken bones and pneumonia, expose children to much lower doses. For children who underwent a head CT, the researchers attributed about a quarter of the children's subsequent hematologic malignancies to radiation exposure. For those who had radiographs, by contrast, they estimated that only a small fraction of the children's subsequent cancers were associated with radiation exposure. Getting one or two head CTs was associated with a 1.8-fold increased risk of a cancer diagnosis, and this rose to 3.5 times for children who received more scans and were therefore exposed to more radiation. Altogether, 2,961 hematologic malignancies were diagnosed during the study period. The authors said that up to 10% of hematologic malignancies in children and adolescents could be prevented by reducing unnecessary imaging and optimizing radiation doses. In many cases, the authors said, substituting non-ionizing imaging modalities like ultrasound or MRI may be feasible without compromising diagnostic accuracy. The authors emphasized that while medical imaging remains an invaluable tool in pediatric care, their findings highlight the need to carefully balance its diagnostic benefits with potential long-term risks. "This study provides robust, directly observed evidence of a clear dose-response relationship between radiation from medical imaging and hematologic malignancy risk in children and adolescents," said Diana Miglioretti, PhD, UC Davis Health professor and chief of the Division of Biostatistics. "Our findings align with international research highlighting that children are especially radiosensitive," Miglioretti added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Swedish-led research team at Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital has shown in a new randomized clinical trial that a low dose of the well-known medicine aspirin halves the risk of recurrence after surgery in patients with colon and rectal cancer with a certain type of genetic alteration in the tumor. Every year, nearly two million people worldwide are diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Previous observational studies have suggested that aspirin may reduce the risk of certain cancers and possibly also the risk of recurrence after surgery in patients with colorectal cancer harboring mutations in genes within the PIK3 signaling pathway. These genes regulate key cellular processes such as growth and division. When mutated, these processes can become dysregulated, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer development. However, prior findings have been inconsistent and no randomized clinical trials had previously confirmed the association. To address this gap, the ALASCCA trial was initiated and has now been published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The current study included more than 3,500 patients with colon and rectal cancer from 33 hospitals in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. Patients whose tumors showed a specific genetic mutation in the PIK3 signaling pathway-a mutation found in approximately 40 percent of patients-were randomized to receive either 160 mg of aspirin daily or a placebo for three years after surgery. This is a clear example of how we can use genetic information to personalize treatment and at the same time save both resources and suffering," says first author Anna Martling, professor at the Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, and senior consultant surgeon at Karolinska University Hospital. The researchers believe that the effect is likely due to aspirin acting through several parallel mechanisms – it reduces inflammation, inhibits platelet function and tumor growth. This combination makes the environment less favorable for cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Alison Treichel and her team conducted a 15-year retrospective cohort study using data from the US TriNetX collaborative network. The study included 22,901 patients over the age of 55 with psoriasis and compared their outcomes with three propensity-matched control groups: individuals with melanocytic nevi (MN) to represent other dermatology patients; patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) to account for chronic disease and healthcare use; and patients who had undergone an ophthalmologic exam to ensure comparable opportunities for AMD diagnosis. Individuals with a prior diagnosis of AMD were excluded. In a separate analysis, psoriasis patients treated with biologics were compared to those treated with topical corticosteroids who had not received biologics before or during the follow-up period. Looking at the two main forms of AMD – exudative (wet) and non-exudative (dry) – psoriasis was associated with a 40% and 13% higher risk, respectively, compared with the MDD cohort. Because abnormal lipid deposition in the retina is a hallmark of age-related macular degeneration, particularly the dry form that causes progressive vision loss, it is biologically plausible that psoriasis could increase AMD risk. Our study is the first to demonstrate a novel association between psoriasis and non-exudative (dry) AMD and serves as a hypothesis generating observation for future studies" "Our findings support a connection between psoriasis and AMD, both exudative and non-exudative, which could be mediated by shared lipid dysregulation," Dr. Treichel explained. "They also suggest that biologic therapies could offer protective benefits beyond skin symptoms. "Patients with psoriasis should continue to follow standard eye exam guidelines and promptly report any changes in their vision to their healthcare providers. More research is needed before specific screening recommendations can be made." Looking ahead, the research team plans to build on these findings by analysing retinal imaging data from psoriasis patients to better characterise ocular abnormalities, define the prevalence of AMD, and evaluate the long-term effects of biologic therapy on disease progression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Psoriasis patients treated with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) face a 78% lower risk of death and a 44% lower risk of major cardiovascular events compared to those taking other diabetes or weight-loss medications, new research has shown. Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition affecting 2-3% of the population, linked not only to visible symptoms but also to higher risks of heart attack, stroke and psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety and increased alcohol or substance use. However, this emerging evidence suggests they may also offer important benefits for psoriasis patients.. Outcomes were compared for over 6,000 psoriasis patients with diabetes or obesity over a two-year period, including 3,048 who were treated with GLP-1RAs and 3,048 who received other anti-diabetic or anti-obesity drugs. Patients included in the retrospective cohort analysis were over 18 years old, had a confirmed diagnosis of psoriasis requiring systemic therapy, and had received continuous treatment with either a GLP-1RA or an alternative anti-diabetic or anti-obesity medication for at least 24 months. After matching for age, sex, and comorbidities, the benefits of GLP-1RAs were clear and consistent across all sensitivity analyses, using propensity score matching to control for potential confounders. Our findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists may offer benefits beyond their effects on weight and glucose control, particularly for cardiovascular and psychiatric outcomes in people with psoriasis. We hypothesise that GLP-1 receptor activation may inhibit proinflammatory mediators, which are elevated in people with psoriasis. These benefits appeared especially pronounced in psoriasis patients compared with matched controls, suggesting a possible synergy between systemic inflammation in psoriasis and the mechanisms of GLP-1RAs. Safety outcomes were consistent with those seen in the general population, with no significant increase in adverse effects such as hypoglycemia, nausea, or constipation. "Given their safety profile and the range of benefits observed, GLP-1RAs could become a preferred treatment for people with psoriasis who also require therapy for diabetes or weight management," Prof. Ludwig furthered. GLP-1RAs may offer a valuable dual benefit, improving both metabolic control and long-term health outcomes, representing an important step forward in holistic care for people living with psoriasis."
