                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KSHB 41 reporter Tod Palmer covers sports business and eastern Jackson County. When the Missouri legislature allocated $50 million toward FIFA World Cup 26 efforts in May 2023, the bulk — $42.5 million — was earmarked to help get GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium ready. With two of five phases now complete, KSHB 41 has obtained documents that detail the money has been spent so far — more than $19.6 million — and what work remains. RELATED | How seating changes at Arrowhead could make Chiefs games even louder The changes are necessary to accommodate the wider and perfectly leveled playing surface FIFA requires for next summer's six World Cup games, including two knockout games. Populous, a world-renowned Kansas City-based architecture firm, has received more than $1.73 million so far and serves as the construction administrator for renovation. But that leaves another $23.5 million earmarked for the final three phases. “We'll need enough time to do that, which means no concerts during next summer. Kansas City Stadium — as the unbranded Arrowhead will be known during the World Cup — also has to be stripped of current branding. “They are required to provide what FIFA calls a clean site,” KC2026 CEO Pam Kramer said. Kramer added, “How much signage is at Arrowhead, right? It's just one of the requirements that FIFA has for all host cities — not just Arrowhead, but all host cities — in delivering that stadium.” “That's a tight window for all the activity, because not not only do I have to prepare the pitch, you have to sort of unravel all of the FIFA elements that come through, but we're working with them and their subcontractors on that schedule,” Kenny said. FIFA is aware that the Chiefs and other NFL teams need to be able to host preseason games within a few weeks of the soccer tournament ending.</p>

The reigning champions are not only defending their domestic crown but also cemented their status as the latest UEFA Champions League winners, joining Olympique de Marseille as the only French clubs to conquer Europe's most prestigious trophy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spain and Lamine Yamal took top spot from Argentina and Lionel Messi in the FIFA men's rankings published on Thursday, and lead for the first time since being dethroned as world champion in June 2014. Spain's two-win start to a 2026 World Cup qualifying group this month — against Turkey and Bulgaria — lifted the European champion up from second place behind 2022 World Cup winner Argentina, which fell to third. Argentina's loss in a World Cup qualifier in Ecuador also let France rise one place to No. 4, and Portugal climbed one place to No. Both have already qualified for the World Cup. Mexico and the United States were Nos. 14 and 16 respectively as the World Cup co-hosts both fell one place. Canada, the third co-host next year, rose two to No. The rankings are updated in October and again in November when the standings are more significant. The November rankings should decide seedings for the 48-team World Cup tournament draw being held on Dec. 5 in Washington, plus draws for playoffs in Europe and the intercontinental brackets. The World Cup draw will have 42 confirmed entries and six placeholders for the eventual playoff winners. Those placeholders all must come from the lowest-ranked teams in seeding pot 4 and could include Italy. Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea suffered defeat in their opening Champions League game of the season to Bayern Munich, and one of their rivals from the recent Club World Cup success were keen to add to the misery. The Blues lost 3-1 in Germany despite Cole Palmer's brilliance, and will now have to look forward to a showdown with Jose Mourinho as their first chance to pick up three points in Europe this season. It was a display filled with uncharacteristic errors from some of Chelsea's key men, after Enzo Maresca named a very similar side to the one who faced PSG in the Club World Cup final. There was criticism sent the way of Enzo Fernandez for his display, with Blues supporters calling for Andrey Santos to start against Manchester United. Despite replicating the system that had decimated PSG in the Club World Cup, there was no luck for Chelsea this time around. During that competition, the Blues didn't make many friends, and actually formed a bit of an online rivalry  with Flamengo, after their fiercely-contested group stage game. That one ended 3-1 to the Brazilians, something their official Twitter account made sure they reminded Chelsea of after their defeat by the same scoreline on Wednesday night. Nicolas Jackson was subbed on during the game, however minutes later was sent off for the second time in four appearances for the Blues. This proved to be the last meaningful impact he had in a Chelsea shirt before being loaned out to Wednesday's opposition, Bayern. Despite there being no obligation in the loan to Germany, it looks as if his time at Stamford Bridge has now come to an end.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It might seem trite to quote actor, renowned Texan and Austin FC minority owner Matthew McConaughey when his club comes out on top, but the latest result for the Major League Soccer side was more than a win. Austin FC edged out Minnesota United FC 2-1 in dramatic fashion in the Semifinal of the 2025 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup at MNUFC's home stadium of Allianz Field in St. Paul on Wednesday night with a remarkable game-winning goal in the 120th minute. The victory continues the longest Open Cup run in Austin FC's five-year history and means Los Verdes will host the tournament's Final in two weeks on Oct. 1. “It's a special moment,” said Austin FC head coach Nico Estévez. With both teams briefly finding flashes in 30 minutes of extra time, a penalty kick shootout felt inevitable to determine which of the MLS Western Conference clubs would advance to the Final of this country's most historic competition. Then, Austin FC saw a glimmer of promise. Myrto Uzuni's initial header on the other end was brisk and forced Minnesota goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair to make an instinctive block. And it's not the only game-winner that Fodrey has scored in his budding career. On Sept. 7, the 21-year-old forward decided another Austin match when he flicked in a header from an Owen Wolff corner kick. That day, Austin FC defeated Sporting Kansas City in MLS play, also 2-1. In the span of just 10 days, Fodrey scored his first MLS goal and his first Open Cup goal. He's been working really hard the whole year, and now every day of training is paying off for him.” Since joining MLS five years ago, the club has not had many chances to compete for trophies. Three out of four times, the Austin side has failed to reach the MLS Cup Playoffs. Last season, they missed out on a Wild Card spot, finishing 10th in the Western Conference with an 11-14-9 record. The year before that, El Tree finished 12th. Lately, we haven't had these experiences,” Estévez said. “We're coming from a difficult season also with ups and downs. The group is determined to write a different story in 2025. Austin FC is steadily climbing the MLS standings. 7 in the conference, five spots below Minnesota at No. Entering the final month of MLS' regular season, Austin has already equaled the club's win total from a year ago and will have a chance to stay competitive for a playoff spot down the stretch heading into Decision Day. Before that, the club has a chance to win some silverware on home turf. The Semifinal win secured home field advantage over fellow Final Four winner Nashville SC, who took care of business against Philadelphia Union on Sept. 16. As Austin looks to stymie Nashville's lethal goal scorer and MLS Golden Boot leader Sam Surridge, the club will do so in front of the Verde & Black faithful at Q2 Stadium. While the Semifinal win is a special moment worth celebrating, it's not all fun and games for the Austin FC players. As goalkeeper Brad Stuver, a hero through this rare U.S. Open Cup Final run, reiterated leaving the locker at Allianz Field, there's more history to be made. “The job is not finished,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DAZN was hellbent on disrupting the archaic world of legacy pay-TV sports television in the same way that Netflix had done with entertainment by offering more affordable, flexible subscriptions on the viewers' device of choice on a global scale. Its original vision and pricing structure has evolved significantly to reflect commercial realities and the need to recoup multibillion-dollar outlays on rights. However, advances in connectivity, changing consumer preferences and huge investments in its infrastructure have enabled DAZN to achieve its goal of digitally transmitting live sport to every corner of the globe. DAZN's international service comprises various properties such as combat sports, motorsports and women's soccer, along with a range of free ad-supported television (FAST) channels and third-party platforms. While DAZN's premium, localised services in Germany, Italy and Spain are still primarily subscription driven, the platform now offers a wide range of free content in a bid to monetise users through other means and potentially convert them to paying customers in the future. DAZN assembled multiple broadcast teams to cover the Club World Cup in various languages (Image credit: Getty Images) However, to date, the majority of DAZN's international portfolio has had regional or niche appeal. Many questioned the wisdom of paying so much for an unproven competition which had hitherto struggled to generate interest from fans, sponsors and other media organisations, especially when there would be no subscription revenue and the most attractive matches in some markets would be sublicensed to free-to-air (FTA) broadcasters. With all respect to college football, electric powerboating and LIV Golf, none has the universal appeal of a tournament featuring Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Lionel Messi. This was reflected in Fifa's official viewing figures, which claim the expanded tournament attracted a global audience of 2.7 billion. While detailed data has not been made public and many viewers watched the competition on linear television, the Club World Cup appears to have been a success for DAZN – and a major test for its infrastructure. “Over the last three years we've undergone a massive transformation,” Tiku tells SportsPro. We have hundreds of live events every single weekend and throughout the week, so building, managing and maintaining a platform that can handle these peaks in demand at scale across the world is a challenge [that we've met].” “The Club World Cup was a completely different ball game,” Tiku explains. “But we were streaming the Club World Cup for free, so all of a sudden we were receiving huge amounts of traffic from 200 countries around the world, at a similar level to Germany or Japan [where DAZN has a fully-fledged local service]. “You have to acquire millions of these customers in hours or minutes because most people register just before the game they want to watch is starting. We knew that for millions of customers this was the first time they had ever used DAZN so we could not get it wrong,” Despite DAZN's desire to use the Club World Cup as a revenue generation tool, it knew the importance of making a first impression and therefore prioritised a high quality, reliable stream over bells and whistles. DAZN streamed all 63 matches of the tournament in multiple languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish, with each match subject to more than 20 regional variants. Pictures were transmitted from stadium to the International Broadcast Centre in New York and sent to the DAZN Match Centre in Dallas, Texas, before they were transmitted around the world via DAZN's regional production facilities. Tests conducted prior to the tournament with Amazon Web Services (AWS) determined DAZN's infrastructure could support 300 million concurrent users, while the company added multiple CDNs to support resiliency. In some locations, where existing CDNs weren't capable enough, DAZN launched its own. Intelligent algorithms automatically moved viewers to the most appropriate CDN and disabled app features that might consume too much bandwidth. “I don't think any other broadcaster has done this in the past,” Tiku says. Tiku's arrival from Entain, a betting company, is indicative of the culture shift that has taken place at DAZN over the past few years. “Our fans are participating, they're interacting with the broadcast and being a part of it. That's not to say DAZN hasn't invested in its core streaming capabilities – far from it. Paying subscribers to DAZN received an enhanced streaming experience during the Club World Cup, including high dynamic range (HDR) picture quality and Dolby 5.1 surround sound. The key objective is to expand the user base as much as possible and by providing a premium offering alongside wide accessibility, DAZN is catering to multiple demographics. DAZN has bolstered its free tier with new rights deals and has integrated several third-party DTC services, such as the National Football League's (NFL) Game Pass International and the National Hockey League's (NHL) NHL.TV, into its platform. These properties receive many of the benefits that the Club World Cup has helped to illustrate – DAZN's global reach, its technological investments and its existing billing relationships. Essentially, DAZN takes away the burden and risk of managing a DTC platform whilst maximising its existing user base and billing relationship to, hopefully, expand the audience. In exchange, DAZN gets more users in its ecosystem, while both benefit from a service layer of interactive features and revenue generating opportunities. “We've built a highly scalable global platform which means the more we can do with it, our costs keep on reducing,” Tiku explains. For the Club World Cup, it created an extended reality application for the US market, allowing fans to watch all 63 matches in a 3D tabletop format. For Tiku, the product was about demonstrating how its platform can provide an entirely new way of watching sport, adding value for both fans and rights holders, as well as the possibility of creating new forms of content without the need to acquire broadcast rights. For example, optical tracking data, which is widely captured by goal line technology (GLT) and semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) systems can be used to digitally recreate key moments from matches and power other types of data-rich immersive experience. Suddenly, there's this new product that doesn't have a massive cost. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is AI where Tiku sees the most potential. With AI models already used to optimise streaming distribution and customer service, the next step will see DAZN deploy intelligent algorithms to personalise the end user experience. “We're working on personalisation for acquisition, retention and engagement,” Tiku says. This, he says, not only ensures DAZN will be able to adjust to changing fan expectations but also give its content a longer shelf life than just the live broadcast. “In ten or even five years' time, fans are not going to consume sport in the same way people watch sport today,” he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 38-year-old forward is said to be focused on continuing his career with Miami, with talks now ongoing over extending his two-year stay at the MLS club. Messi joined Inter Miami from Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer in July 2023, penning a two-and-a-half-year contract that runs until 31 December. Messi has made 75 appearances for Inter Miami to date, scoring 62 goals and providing 30 assists, and led the MLS side to two major trophies during his time in the United States. He also helped Inter Miami set the league record for most points in a single season last year with 74, and lifted the 2024 Supporters' Shield. His arrival in Miami in 2023 saw several of his former Barcelona teammates follow him to the US, with Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba also joining. This summer, Inter Miami made a statement move in the market as well, welcoming Atletico Madrid and Argentina midfielder Rodrigo De Paul on loan with an option to buy. GIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Messi is Inter Miami's all-time leading scorer with 62 goals in 75 appearances to date. Messi's new contract will see him extend with Inter Miami beyond the 2026 World Cup, which could be the 38-year-old's last major international tournament. The Argentina icon has so far given no guarantee that he will captain La Albiceleste in next year's tournament, saying his fitness will likely determine whether he is able to take part.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ricardo Pepi speaks about returning to PSV's starting XI after their 5-3 win over NEC Nijmegen. The September international window has now concluded, and as such, players from the U.S. men's national team have headed back to their clubs. Now the sprint to hit top form ahead of October's window can begin. For some players, that means making the most of a change of clubs. For others, it's about solidifying their spots in the starting lineup. Then there are those who are on the outside looking in, trying to do anything they can to get steady playing time. Regardless of which camp they fall into, the past week has proven eventful for several USMNT players. Throughout the season, ESPN will be monitoring the progress of the U.S. player pool, delivering insights into those whose form or fitness has made them particularly intriguing. ESPN will count down to June 11 every week so that way, when the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise. - USMNT 2026 World Cup Big Board 2.0: Balogun, Zendejas rise - Carlisle: Zendejas' starring role has come at the right time for USMNT - O'Hanlon: Top 50 USMNT players, ranked by club form It was a week of highs and lows for Pepi. On Saturday, he made his long-awaited return to the PSV starting lineup and made the most of his chance, scoring goals either side of halftime -- one with his right foot, another with his head -- to lead PSV to a 5-3 victory over NEC Nijmegen. On Tuesday against Union Saint-Gilloise in the UEFA Champions League, he conceded a penalty in a 3-1 defeat. In terms of the bigger picture, at least Pepi is now reestablishing himself in the starting XI. That will need to continue given how the competition for the starting forward spot had heated up thanks to Folarin Balogun's performance during the September international window. The coming weeks will be about establishing consistency ahead of the October international window. Much of the buzz at the end of September window was about the performance of Alejandro Zendejas and how his goal against Japan had seen him make a play for more playing time, possibly at the expense of Weah. So what did Weah do? He merely went out and scored against Real Madrid, at the Estadio Bernabeu no less, with his clever run allowing teammate Mason Greenwood to put Weah in the clear and fire home past Thibaut Courtois. It was Weah's first goal for his new club after arriving from Juventus over the summer, and while OM ultimately fell 2-1, Weah showed he's not going to give up his spot in the USMNT starting lineup without a fight. Reyna made his official debut for Gladbach last weekend. For the team, it was a match to forget, as Werder Bremen handed the Foals a heavy 4-0 home defeat, one that cost manager Gerardo Seoane his job. For Reyna personally, his 74-minute stint had some positive vibes to it. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. While he completed only 21 of 31 passes, he was involved in Gladbach's best moves and should have had an assist when he created an opening for Robin Hack, who missed the target from 12 yards. Reyna even had a team-high seven ball recoveries. Reyna will no doubt have preferred a better team performance, but for him it's a start, one that he'll be hoping to build on, even with a new manager in charge. Defensively, it provides a bit more cover for outside backs Sergiño Dest and Max Arfsten, the better for them to play to their strengths in the attacking half. Who takes the third center back spot is a coin flip at the moment between Mark McKenzie and Cameron Carter-Vickers. Do you take the player who plays in a top-five league, even though his form has faded a bit in recent weeks, or a player on the dominant team in Scotland? I'll go with McKenzie for now, given his ceiling is higher. As such, this week's in-form XI uses that formation. Arfsten's inclusion is down to two factors. One, he excelled in that role during the September window, assisting on Zendejas' goal, and he plays in that position for his club, the Columbus Crew. The other is that Antonee Robinson continues to be brought along slowly at Fulham. He was an unused substitute in last weekend's 1-0 win over Leeds United. There's little doubt that Robinson will reclaim his spot once his fitness improves. He certainly has the attacking chops in terms of delivery from the wing to excel as a wingback. Until then, though, Arfsten gets the nod. The goalkeeper position continues to bear watching. Matt Turner's form has dipped a bit -- his goals prevented per 90 minutes has sunk to -0.2 -- following the New Club Bounce that occurred upon his return to the New England Revolution. And given Matt Freese's solid showing during the recent international window, as well as with New York City FC, he's in this week's in-form XI. Probably the biggest question mark is who plays alongside Tyler Adams in the center of midfield. You can count Johnny Cardoso, Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris and Cristian Roldan among the candidates. Tessmann is getting the most playing time in a top-five league, so he keeps his place for now. ESPN's USMNT Big Board 2.0 went live earlier this month, and each Big Board will provide the foundation for weekly player updates. Below are the minutes and player ratings for each of those 37 players. Matt Freese, goalkeeper, New York City FC: 2,520 minutes in 2025; 7.1 FotMob rating in 2025. Ream continues to turn back the clock with his performances for Charlotte. The Crown have won nine games in a row, conceding just four goals in that time, with Ream completing 93.1% of his passes and winning 60% of his duels in that span. Herculez Gomez and Cristina Alexander debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. The on-loan Chelsea defender has reportedly been dealing with back and adductor injuries, but returned to partial training last week. The hope is that he can return to first-team action with Watford soon. Count McKennie as the latest USMNT player to log minutes as a wingback, joining the likes of Musah and Weah who have been deployed in that spot recently. It's not McKennie's preferred position, but it just might be the path forward for him to not only get consistent playing time with Juve, but also secure a call-up in October with the USMNT. Luca de la Torre, midfielder, San Diego FC: 2,237 minutes in 2025; 6.8 FotMob rating in 2025. Following Musah's late move to Atalanta, he made his debut in a 4-1 win over Lecce, not only logging 14 minutes, but also doing so in his preferred central midfield role. He went 75 minutes in the 4-0 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday. Frank Leboeuf praises PSG's performance vs. Atalanta after an emphatic 4-0 win in the Champions League. Wright's late equalizer against Norwich City didn't necessarily dazzle the eye, but his tap-in from two yards earned the Sky Blues a point, and saw the U.S. forward join Sargent atop the goal-scoring charts in the English Championship.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>James is a sports journalist who specialises in football and Formula 1. He has written for publications such as The Times, MailSport, Sunday Express, Sunday Star and Manchester Evening News. Throughout his career, he has interviewed international footballers and rising Olympic stars. In his spare time, he has the misfortune of being a season ticket holder at Manchester United. Luis de la Fuente's side impressed in recent World Cup qualifiers, beating Bulgaria, before thrashing Turkey 6-0. Despite the setback, the World Cup winners have dominated South American qualifying, as they prepare for Lionel Messi's final international tournament next summer. Spanish government officials warned they would pull out of next summer's World Cup if Israel qualify for the tournament. Israel are currently third in their group with nine points from five games, behind Norway and Italy. With trips to both Norway and Italy in October, they still may finish second and potentially secure a play-off spot depending on results. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called for Israel to be excluded from sporting competitions. A recent UN commission of inquiry said there are grounds to believe that four of five genocidal acts under international law, have been carried out by Israel in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry responded by rejecting the report, describing it as 'distorted and false'. Many within the sporting world have called for Israel to face a ban from international football, in a similar manner to Russia.Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, both UEFA and FIFA suspended the national team and Russian clubs from competitions. Russia appealed against the ban, but it was dismissed. Their last appearance at a global competition was the 2018 World Cup, as they were barred from the 2022 World Cup and next summer's tournament. He said: "The ban for Russian teams is, I think, three and a half years. "I have to say that with the situation in Russia and Ukraine, there was a super strong political pressure. "Now it's more a pressure of the civil society than politicians, because politicians are obviously, when it comes to wars and victims, very pragmatic. There are talks about everything, but me personally, I'm against kicking the athletes out."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not since 2015 has one country held the number one position in the senior men's and women's game. This summer, they also reached the final of the UEFA Women's Euro but lost out to reigning European champions England in a dramatic penalty shoot-out. Last summer, they became the first team in the competition's history to win seven successive matches at a single tournament as they swept aside three former world champions - Germany, France and England - to win a record-breaking fourth title in Berlin's Olympiastadion. Those matches are part of a 27-match unbeaten streak under head coach Luis de la Fuente. Their last two results this month - emphatic World Cup qualification victories away to Bulgaria (0-3) and Turkey (0-6) - ensured they accumulated enough points to claim top spot in the men's world rankings ahead of the World champions, Argentina. It is the first time that the Spanish men's team have topped the FIFA World Rankings since June 2014 when they were reigning world and double European champions at the end of a glittering six years of unprecedented success. However, they flopped in their defence of the FIFA World Cup that summer, going out after losing their first two games in Brazil. The 2014 FIFA World Cup was eventually won by Germany, who claimed top spot from Spain in July went into 2015 as the number one ranked team in the men's game. There they were joined in December 2014 by the German women's team who had won the 2003 and 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup and six successive UEFA Women's Euro titles going back to 1997. The Spanish men's team will aim to win a second world title next year in the United States and also chase their own national record of 35 unbeaten matches set between November 2006 and June 2009. They are also in sight of the men's world record of Italy who went undefeated for 37 games between October 2018 and September 2021. Despite regaining their number one world ranking in August, the Spanish federation sacked their women's team head coach Montse Tomé immediately after the UEFA women's Euro. In the final four, they will play a two leg tie against Sweden in October with the winners due to take on either France or Germany in the final.</p>

The U.S. men's national team dropped a spot in the latest FIFA rankings, which were released on Thursday morning. The 16th-place Americans remained in second place among Concacaf teams as Mexico, which fell to 14th, still leads the way. Slightly further down, Portugal, Croatia and Italy have all edged up one spot, into 5th, 9th and 10th position, respectively, making the most of the setbacks suffered by Brazil (6th, down 1) and Germany (12th, down 3). For Germany, the damage was done by their away defeat to Slovakia in their opening FIFA World Cup 26 qualifier, and they find themselves languishing outside the top 10 for the first time since October 2024. The biggest climbers overall are Slovakia (42nd, up 10), whose reward for kick-starting their World Cup qualifying campaign with two straight wins – including the aforementioned upset of Germany – is a place back among the top 50.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Within a few hours of Borussia Monchengladbach's 4-0 loss to Werder Bremen on Sunday, a compilation of Gio Reyna's debut at his new club was up on the internet and flying around the U.S. men's national team fan communities. Never mind that the result got Gladbach's manager fired. Six years after debuting in the Bundesliga, across a World Cup controversy and numerous injuries that have mostly kept him on the sideline, there is still belief — hope — that Reyna will be what so many thought he would be when he broke out with four goals and five assists in 2020-21. “That was one of the reasons for my move. Reyna is still just 22 now, hardly over the hill. But with a total of just 2,925 minutes across all competitions with his club team since 2021-22 — an average of 731.25 per season — Reyna faces a historically steep climb back into form and fitness after moving from Dortmund to Gladbach this summer. Three of those players were at least 30 at the end of those stretches: Olivier Giroud, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Corentin Tolisso. Just one, Kelechi Iheanacho, compares both statistically and age-wise. Iheanacho was, like Reyna, considered a top young prospect as an 18-year-old when he had eight goals and one assist for Manchester City in league play in 2015-16. He totaled 5,570 minutes over the next four seasons – almost double what Reyna managed in the past four campaigns – and had 25 goals and assists total in that time, before breaking out as a 24-year-old at Leicester City in 2020-21 with 14 combined goals and assists. The road back may be even tougher for Reyna, in part because Iheanacho is not a perfect comparison. He missed just 10 days due to injury in those four seasons, per Transfermarkt, and was mostly the victim of circumstance. He came up playing in a powerful Manchester City side and then tried to fit into a Leicester team with Jamie Vardy. It wasn't until Iheanacho was moved into a second striker role that he started to thrive again in the Premier League. Per Transfermarkt, Reyna missed 492 days from 2021-22 through the end of last season due to various injuries and ailments. Reyna's max speed, measured by the fastest sprints averaged out across five games, ranked last among all qualified Bundesliga attacking midfielders and eighth-to-last among all outfield players last season, per ESPN. Reyna also sprinted fewer times than all but six central midfielders in the Bundesliga. The question is whether Reyna's body will allow him to meet those demands. “You don't know if it's a situation where is it the fight, or is his body holding him back from winning that starting position and playing week-in and week-out? I would hope that this is a new chapter for him.” But after he was summoned for the March Concacaf Nations League camp, U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino said Reyna wasn't “ready to play in the way that we expect from him, to perform.” “The most important thing is how he is showing now in every single training session and spending time with us,” Pochettino said. What Pochettino has conceded, though, is exactly what fans wrote on social media after Reyna's Gladbach debut: Reyna has a skillset that is unique in the U.S. player pool. And if he can get right in time for the World Cup, that skillset should be enough to put him on the roster. But the last four years have shown that it's a big ‘if.' And Reyna needs to prove that skillset is still at the level it was five years ago. Tillman is actually six months older than Reyna, though his rise started slightly later. A former Bayern Munich youth talent, the German-American has built his career up over stops at Rangers and PSV before earning a $41 million move to Bayer Leverkusen. Among the many X factors determining whether Reyna will fight back into the national team picture, an added challenge is that, after just one game starting in his new team, Gladbach fired coach Gerardo Seoane. American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo is reportedly among the potential candidates to take charge, and Reyna will hope he's a fit for the new manager that does arrive. Everyone around the U.S. program — from staff to fans and media — will be watching to see how it unfolds, with some tracking every touch, sprint and pass along the way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>13 jersey, it marked another milestone for one of the most iconic players in U.S. women's soccer. Morgan joins a small but significant group of NWSL players who have been honored with jersey retirements — tributes that recognize their impact at the professional level. But before these stars became household names, they each built a foundation at the college level. College Soccer News takes a look back at their collegiate accomplishments — a reminder of how college soccer continues to shape the future of the game. At the University of California, Berkeley, Alex Morgan consistently delivered as the Golden Bears' top scorer, finishing her career tied for third all-time in goals (45) and third in points (107). Morgan was also a Honda Award finalist, led the Bears in scoring each season, and guided them to the NCAA Tournament all four years. She graduated early with a degree in political economy while earning Pac-10 All-Academic honors. Rapinoe was also a three-time All-Region pick and capped her career as the 2009 University of Portland Female Student-Athlete of the Year. At UCLA, Lauren Holiday (then Cheney) put together one of the most accomplished careers in program history. She remains the Bruins' all-time leader in goals (71) and points (173), earning four straight First Team All-America selections and four consecutive First Team All-Pac-10 honors. A two-time Hermann Trophy finalist and the 2007 U.S. Soccer Young Female Athlete of the Year, Holiday was instrumental in leading UCLA to four consecutive College Cup appearances, cementing her place among the elite in college soccer. Leslie Osborne was a standout player for the Santa Clara Broncos from 2001 to 2004, helping them secure the 2001 NCAA Championship as a freshman. Osborne still ranks sixth in goals (44) and ninth in assists (33) on Santa Clara's career charts, and she twice earned WCC Player of the Year honors (2003 and 2004) while also being recognized as the league's Defender of the Year as a senior. She tallied 30 goals and 32 assists over her career, starting 82 of 89 matches. A two-time First Team NSCAA All-American and three-time First Team All-ACC pick, Chalupny was the 2005 ACC Tournament MVP and played a vital role in UNC's run to the 2003 NCAA Championship and a perfect 27-0-0 record. She closed her Tar Heel career by leading the program to a 23-1-1 finish in 2005, showcasing her consistency and leadership on the nation's biggest stage. Lohman was a two-time finalist for both the Hermann Trophy and Honda Sports Award, underscoring her place among the nation's elite. She also excelled academically, earning First Team Academic All-America honors and graduating with a 3.98 GPA, while helping Penn State capture four straight Big Ten titles. Their jersey retirements in the NWSL celebrate careers that inspired countless fans, but each of those journeys was rooted in the college game.
