                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested that the federal government might revoke the licenses of broadcast television networks that are "against" him. Trump's comment came a day after ABC suspended airing the "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" show because of comments its host made linking the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to Trump's MAGA movement. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr earlier on Wednesday had hinted that the broadcast license of ABC — which is a subsidiary of Disney — was at risk if it did not "take action on Kimmel." Speaking on Thursday to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said, "I have read someplace that the networks were 97% against me, again, 97% negative, and yet I won and easily, all seven swing states," referring to his 2024 election win. "They give me only bad publicity, press. I mean, they're getting a license," Trump said, according to audio from a press gaggle provided by the White House. "I would think maybe their license should be taken away," Trump said. Trump specifically referred to criticism he has gotten from Kimmel and CBS late-night talk-show host Stephen Colbert. "When you have a network and you have evening shows, and all they do is hit Trump," he said. If you go back, I guess they haven't had a conservative on in years or something, somebody said." "But when you go back, take a look, all they do is hit Trump. They're not allowed to do that. They're an arm of the Democrat party," he said. Carr earlier Thursday told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" that "we're not done yet" with changes in "the media ecosystem" that are consequences of Trump's election. "I think Brendan Carr is outstanding, he's a patriot," said Trump, who nominated Carr to his position. Broadcast television stations affiliated with networks, including ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox, must receive a license from the FCC to operate because their content is transmitted over the air, and is technically free for viewers as long as they have an antenna. — CNBC's Lillian Rizzo contributed to this story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the days since Charlie Kirk's death, some companies have been forced to navigate a delicate situation: employees sharing their personal views about the conservative activist in public. For employers, those remarks highlight the growing challenge of balancing free expression with corporate values and workplace harmony. Major corporations such as Microsoft and Delta Air Lines are taking action against employees who have made social media posts critical of Kirk's own views, or even ones celebrating his death, which could be considered a violation of company values. Kirk, an ally of President Donald Trump, advocated conservative beliefs on college campuses and was influential among young people on the right. Microsoft shared an X post on Friday addressing negative remarks about Kirk made online by some of its employees. Microsoft said, "Comments celebrating violence against anyone are unacceptable and do not align with our values." Microsoft's statement came after Tesla CEO Elon Musk called out Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on X in response to an unverified claim that some employees at Blizzard, a video game company owned by Microsoft, had posted comments "trashing" Kirk. The ODP Corporation, the parent company of Office Depot, apologized to consumers on Friday after footage taken at a Michigan Office Depot gained attention on social media. "The behavior displayed by our associate is completely unacceptable and insensitive, violates our company policies, and does not reflect the values we uphold at Office Depot. "We continue to aggressively investigate the matter and will take action where appropriate." On Friday, Nasdaq said it fired an employee for their remarks about Kirk because they violated company policy. Nasdaq has a zero-tolerance policy toward violence and any commentary that condones or celebrates violence," the company said on X. "The employee in question has been terminated, effective immediately." The political analyst Matthew Dowd was widely attacked online after making remarks about Kirk during an appearance on MSNBC's "Katy Tur Reports" on Wednesday. MSNBC's president, Rebecca Kutler, called Dowd's comments "insensitive" in an X post later that day. "During our breaking news coverage of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, Matthew Dowd made comments that were inappropriate, insensitive, and unacceptable," the statement said. There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise." Dowd responded in a subsequent Substack article on Friday, confirming that MSNBC had fired him. "The Right Wing media mob ginned up, went after me on a plethora of platforms, and MSNBC reacted to that mob," he wrote. "Even though most at MSNBC knew my words were being misconstrued, the timing of my words forgotten (remember I said this before anyone knew Kirk was a target), and that I apologized for any miscommunication on my part, I was terminated by the end of the day." Comcast and Versant executives urged employees to "treat people with kindness" in a memo on Friday. Versant is an independent media company being spun off from Comcast and NBCUniversal that will eventually own MSNBC. "Regardless of whether you agreed with his political views, his words and actions underscore the urgency to maintain a respectful exchange of ideas — a principle we must champion," the memo said. The memo added: "As employees, we ask you to embody our values in your work and communities. The firm fired a lawyer whose social media posts about Kirk gained attention online, where commentators noted his place of work, a spokesperson told Business Insider. We offer our deepest sympathies to Mr. Kirk's family." On Thursday, the Carolina Panthers addressed comments from one of its employees, writing on X, "The views expressed by our employees are their own and do not represent those of the Carolina Panthers." Delta Air Lines suspended an unknown number of employees over their social media posts about Kirk, a companywide memo viewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed. He added, "Violations of our social media policy can carry meaningful consequences, including termination." Karen Attiah said she was fired as an opinion writer from The Washington Post after posting on social media about Charlie Kirk. Attiah wrote a Substack post published Monday that said she was fired after "speaking out against political violence, racial double standards, and America's apathy toward guns." A Washington Post spokesperson said the paper doesn't comment on personnel matters. The day Kirk was shot, Attiah said in a Bluesky post that there was a double standard in how the shooting deaths of Democrats were treated and a failure to address "white men" who commit violence. Attiah wrote a post mentioning Kirk that said the left was prematurely being blamed for his death. Another of her posts referred to not doing performative mourning for "a white man that espoused violence." It is not clear what particular social-media posts led to Attiah's firing. Attiah's departure comes in the wake of the Jeff Bezos-owned Post's overhaul of its opinion section, which is now focused on "personal liberties and free markets." An ABC spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that it "indefinitely" suspended production of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" The decision came after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr criticized Kimmel's remarks about Charlie Kirk during a recent episode. During an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson, Carr said the FCC could intervene after Kimmel's comments. Nexstar, an ABC affiliate, subsequently issued a press release saying it would "preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' "Nexstar strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk and will replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets," a press release said. Sinclair, another ABC affiliate, also suspended the show on its stations. Sinclair said it would fill Kimmel's timeslot with a special dedication to Kirk. Business Insider contacted all the companies mentioned in this story for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to lift lower court rulings that have blocked President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The request came a day after Cook participated in a meeting of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, which decided to cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point. Trump said on Aug. 25 that he was firing Cook from the seven-member Fed Board, citing allegations that she committed mortgage fraud in connection with two residences she owns. Cook, who denies wrongdoing, sued Trump to block her removal, arguing he lacked the required legal cause to do so. A federal district court judge in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 9 barred Trump from firing Cook as her suit plays out. He said that the Justice Department is likely to prevail in the lawsuit "because Cook lacks a Fifth Amendment property interest in her continued service as a Governor of the Federal Reserve System," and that her job is not protected by due process considerations. Sauer also disputed the judge's alternative finding that Trump's rationale for firing Cook for "cause" is not valid because her alleged conduct occurred before she was appointed to the Fed. "The Federal Reserve Act's broad 'for cause' provision rules out removal for no reason at all, or for policy disagreement," Sauer wrote. Sauer said, "Cook had made contradictory representations in two mortgage agreements a short time apart, claiming that both a property in Michigan and a property in Georgia would simultaneously serve as her principal residence." "Each mortgage agreement described the representation as material to the lender, reflecting the reality that lenders usually offer lower interest rates for principal-residence mortgages because they view such mortgages as less risky," Sauer wrote. "When her apparent misconduct came to light, the President determined that Cook's 'deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter' renders her unfit to continue serving on the Federal Reserve Board, and at a minimum demonstrates 'the sort of gross negligence in financial transactions that calls into question [her] competence and trustworthiness as a financial regulator,' "Sauer wrote. The solicitor general also argued that the district court judge "lacked authority to order reinstatement as an equitable remedy for the removal of an officer of the United States, as we have discussed in several recent stay applications." If Trump ultimately prevails in firing Cook, he would be poised to have nominated four out of the seven Fed governors. On Tuesday, the Senate narrowly confirmed White House Council of Economic Advisors Stephen Miran as a Fed governor. Trump nominated Miran to serve the remainder of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's term, which ends Jan. 31. Kugler unexpectedly resigned in August, without giving a reason. Miran participated in the FOMC meeting this week. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Thursday sued Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, over what it called "illegal" ticket resale tactics. Seven states joined in the lawsuit, including Florida, Illinois and Virginia. In the filing, the FTC wrote that the companies "tacitly worked" with scalpers, allowing them to "unlawfully purchase" tickets to increase their profits. "[Ticketmaster and Live Nation's] illegal conduct frustrates artists' desire to maintain affordable ticket prices that fit the needs of ordinary American families, costing ordinary fans millions of dollars every year," the lawsuit reads. The lawsuit alleged Ticketmaster has taken a "bait and switch" approach, which allows the company to alter its advertising of ticket prices to effectively lift total prices, according to the FTC. It also alleges that the company allows broker to exceed ticket limits on purpose with resale and violates the Better Online Ticket Sales Act. "American live entertainment is the best in the world and should be accessible to all of us," FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. "It should not cost an arm and a leg to take the family to a baseball game or attend your favorite musician's show." According to the FTC, Ticketmaster controls roughly 80% of major concert venues' ticketing, and between 2019 and 2024, consumers spent more than $82 billion purchasing tickets on the platform. Ticketmaster and Live Nation did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ticketmaster is also under investigation in the U.K. over its use of "dynamic pricing" for ticket sales for reunion concerts from Britpop band Oasis. Dynamic pricing is a tactic used in many concert sales to reflect broader shifts in the market, justifying higher prices. Last year, the Justice Department sued to break up Live Nation and Ticketmaster over alleged antitrust violations, claiming the company had too large a monopoly in the ticketing industry. The lawsuit followed a 2022 probe into the company after a rollout of tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour came under intense scrutiny for its botched rollout. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starbucks says that customers can ask for political names on their drinks following a viral video in which a barista declined to write the name of assassinated conservative Charlie Kirk on a customer's cup. Eight baristas told Business Insider that before the corporate clarification, they felt trapped between corporate policy, social media infamy, and, in some cases, their own personal beliefs when customers requested politically loaded names on their to-go cups. A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the company does not restrict customers who want to use a fake name on their order, even if that name is political. However, the company prohibits baristas from writing other political messages or pop culture references on drinks. "We are clarifying with our team now that names, on their own, can be used by customers on their café order, as they wish." The statement was made in response to a TikTok video that went viral on Tuesday. After the TikTok clip was posted online, it gained traction on conservative social media accounts. Many commenters said the barista should be fired. Kirk, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump's and a right-wing podcaster, was shot and killed on September 10 during an event at Utah Valley University in what authorities have called a "political assassination." While it's unclear how often Starbucks customers are making such requests of their baristas, several subsequent copycat posts have sprung up on social media, and some Kirk fans have begun posting online, calling for a boycott of the coffee brand. While the most recent viral incident centered on Kirk, baristas told Business Insider that customers have made similar requests related to Trump, the war in Gaza, Black Lives Matter protests, and other social movements. They said it has become more common since cup notes became required. "When things like this gain traction, they basically become a meme," one West Coast barista told Business Insider. Since CEO Brian Niccol took the helm in September 2024, the company has mandated that "meaningful" handwritten notes in Sharpie be added to each customer's to-go cup. Eight baristas who spoke to Business Insider had varying interpretations of Starbucks' guidelines for writing political names on cups, based on what they were told by managers before Wednesday's clarification. Six said the seemingly conflicting policies make them feel set up to fail when customers come in requesting political names written on their to-go cups. The baristas were granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about Starbucks, but their identities are known to Business Insider. Many others have taken to posting online about how customers increasingly use them as characters in their social media posts about culture war topics. A Kentucky-based Starbucks shift supervisor who has been with the company for over a year told Business Insider they would instruct the baristas in their store to refuse a customer request if they were uncomfortable, despite the risk of discipline or harassment. "It puts baristas in a very uncomfortable position, given that we are at a workplace and would effectively be getting caught up in a customer's opinion that we may or may not agree with and cannot walk away from," a barista who has worked at Starbucks for more than six years told Business Insider. "I do believe the people doing it are probably just trying to get a reaction out of Starbucks workers," they said. Robert Post, a constitutional law professor and First Amendment scholar at Yale, told Business Insider that these types of viral social media issues become problematic for Starbucks because they result in negative publicity and put baristas in a "stressful situation." Michael Goldberg, a professor of entrepreneurship and finance at Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Management, told Business Insider that if Starbucks doesn't clearly communicate the rules to in-store staff, it risks problems with retaining talent at a delicate time while striving to improve the customer experience and its stock performance. "Retention of talent is paramount to a company like Starbucks — you're only as good as your employees are," Goldberg added. "And it seems as though people genuinely like working at Starbucks, but if they strip away all the things that are appealing about working there, there are many other retail establishments that are hiring, like McDonald's or Wendy's — are they writing notes on their burgers?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and other crypto executives took to Capitol Hill this week as part of a regulatory showdown between the industry and banks with potentially trillions at stake. Banking advocacy groups are urging lawmakers to prohibit crypto exchanges like Coinbase from offering customers rewards that are structured like interest payments banks offer. "I'm not sure why the banks would want to bring that up again at this point, but they should have to compete on a level playing field in crypto," Armstrong told CNBC on Wednesday. Coinbase currently offers a 4.1% reward for those holding USDC stablecoin. Under the recently passed GENIUS Act, customers can't earn interest on stablecoins, but exchanges can offer rewards. Bank advocacy groups are warning that allowing the rewards will lead to a rush of customers yanking funds from community banks and putting them into stablecoins or other crypto. "If people are pulling their deposits out of their bank accounts and transferring them into stablecoin investments, you are effectively neutering, to some degree, the ability of the banks to continue to lend into the real economy and to support and fuel the economic growth," said John Court, executive vice president at the Bank Policy Institute, an advocacy group representing banks. The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee estimated that $6.6 trillion could go from deposits to stablecoins in an April report. "The real reason that they're bringing this up as an issue is that they're trying to protect the $180 billion that they made on their payment business," he said. "This is something that big banks are funding behind the scenes. Following a meeting with Senate Republicans on Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the subject of stablecoin rewards did not come up, but that regulators need to be thoughtful about any regulations. The American Bankers Association and state association asked in an August 12 letter for lawmakers to "close this loophole and protect the financial system." Crypto groups hit back several days later in their own letter to lawmakers, saying that preventing exchanges from offering rewards "would tilt the playing field in favor of legacy institutions, particularly larger banks, that routinely fail to deliver competitive returns and deprive consumers of meaningful choice." While senators have released several drafts of the market structure bill, changes to crypto exchanges offering rewards are still being worked out. Sen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The IRS and U.S. Department of the Treasury this week finalized rules for certain provisions from the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022, including catch-up contributions for 401(k) and other plans, which apply to workers age 50 and older. Starting in 2027, catch-up contributions generally must be after tax (also called Roth), rather than pretax, for workers who made more than $145,000 from their current employer during the previous year. In the meantime, those investors can pick between pretax and Roth retirement catch-up contributions, assuming their workplace plans have both choices and their cash flow permits, experts say. Here's a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business. Roth contributions are after-tax deposits, but the funds grow tax-free. By comparison, pretax contributions reduce your adjusted gross income upfront, but you owe regular income taxes when you withdraw the funds. Of course, you need to consider your full financial picture when making Roth contributions since a higher AGI can impact eligibility for other deductions. "Now is the time to work with your advisor or tax preparer to run multi-year tax projections," said CFP Patrick Huey, owner of Victory Independent Planning in Portland, Oregon. This could help you decide whether to "accelerate" pretax catch-up contributions through 2026 or "embrace the transition to Roth" sooner, he said. For 2025, workers can defer up to $23,500 into 401(k)s, and investors age 50 and older can make an extra $7,500 in catch-up contributions. In 2024, nearly all retirement plans offered catch-up contributions, but only 16% of eligible workers made these deferrals, according to a 2025 Vanguard report based on more than 1,400 plans and nearly 5 million participants. Most catch-up contribution participants earned $150,000 or more, the report found. However, the choice between Roth vs. pretax catch-up contributions may depend on several factors, including current and expected future tax brackets, experts say. The "key takeaway" for investors is, "do not sit on the sidelines" as the rules change, said certified financial planner Jared Gagne, assistant vice president and private wealth manager with Claro Advisors in Boston.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr said Thursday that ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel appeared to "mislead" the American public about facts regarding conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing in the days leading up to his show's suspension. Carr also told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" that "we're not done yet" with the changes in "the media ecosystem" that are consequences of President Donald Trump's election last fall. ABC on Wednesday night said it was pulling "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air "indefinitely" because of the host's comments, which linked Kirk's alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, to Trump's "Make America Great Again" movement. "The issue that arose here, where lots and lots of people were upset, was not a joke," Carr said Thursday on CNBC. "It was not making fun," said Carr, who hours before Kimmel's show was pulled off the air suggested the FCC might take action against ABC and its parent company, Disney. "It was appearing to directly mislead the American public about a significant fact that probably one of the most significant political events we've had in a long time, for the most significant political assassination we've seen in a long time," he said. Utah court documents filed Tuesday in connection with the murder charge against Robinson say his mother told investigators, "Over the last year or so, her son had become more political and had started to lean more to the left, becoming more pro gay and trans-rights oriented." Those documents also say that when Robinson was asked why he killed Kirk, "Robinson explained there is too much evil, and [Kirk] spreads too much hate." A day before those documents were filed, Kimmel, in his show's opening monologue Monday, said, "The MAGA Gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it." Trump on Wednesday evening praised Kimmel's suspension and called on NBC to cancel its own late-night shows, "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," and "Late Night with Seth Meyers." "Squawk the Street" anchor Carl Quintanilla asked Carr about that on Thursday. Carr replied,"I don't speak for the President, so he speaks to himself on that." "Our goal and our obligation here is to make sure that broadcasters are serving the public interest," Carr said. "And I would simply say we're not done yet with seeing the consequences of that," he said. CNBC anchor David Faber followed up on that. "Then, I mean, will you only be pleased when none of these comedians have a show on broadcast television?" It's just we're in the midst of a very disruptive moment right now, and I just, frankly, expect that we're going to continue to see changes in the media ecosystem." "He had very bad ratings, and they should have fired him a long time ago. On Wednesday, before ABC yanked Kimmel's show, Carr called Kimmel's comments "truly sick" and said there was a "strong case" for action against ABC and Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr told right-wing commentator Benny Johnson that day. "These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead." "They have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest," Carr said. Hours after Carr's comments were reported by Johnson, Nexstar Media Group said its stations that are affiliated with ABC would preempt Kimmel's show "for the foreseeable future" because of Kimmel's remarks. Nexstar is seeking regulatory approval from the FCC for its planned $6.2 billion merger with Tegna About 10% of ABC affiliates are owned by Nexstar. House Democratic leaders on Thursday called for Carr's resignation, alleging that he had engaged "in the corrupt abuse of power." Former President Barack Obama, in a post on X on Thursday, said, "After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like." "This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it," Obama wrote. Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC under a planned spinoff.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia, once again, has stolen the show — specifically the chip titan's announcement of a massive investment in a struggling rival. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite touched fresh records on Thursday, with the indexes coming to life after a tepid response to a widely expected rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. A $ 5 billion deal between Nvidia and Intel, which sparked a big rally led by chip stocks in early morning trading. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday: The two chip giants said they would jointly develop custom products, with Nvidia incorporating some of Intel's chips into its AI infrastructure for datacenters, while Intel incorporates some of Nvidia's chips into its PC systems. "This is a game changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game. Along with the recent US Government investment for 10% this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors," Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note. The good news is coming after a disappointing Fed day for markets. The central bank issued its widely anticipated 25 basis-point rate cut after its policy meeting on Wednesday. Investors appeared to sell the news as the cut was priced in for weeks leading up to the meeting, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, told BI.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper said the Federal Reserve could cut rates a bit more, but then risks more inflation and other dangers to the economy and markets if the central bank goes further than that. In other words, be careful what you wish for. "If they go too much more on interest rates, depending what happens with the economy ... it gets into the danger territory," Tepper said Thursday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." His comments come after the central bank lowered interest rates by a quarter point Wednesday, the first cut this year, while signaling two more reductions are coming this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the cut as "risk management" rather than something more directed at shoring up a weak economy. President Donald Trump has been pressuring the chief to slash the fed funds rate quickly and aggressively. Tepper feared that if the Fed lowers rates while inflation hasn't been fully tamed, demand can pick up faster than supply, reigniting price pressures. Meanwhile, too-easy monetary policy could potentially create asset bubbles as investors keep flocking into riskier corners of the markets. "My view has been that one easing or two easings or even three easings don't matter because we're still in a little restrictive territory with a little bit too high inflation, even without the tariff-induced inflation. So they should be a little bit restrictive," Tepper said. "Beyond that, you're really risking a lot of things, a weaker dollar, more inflation and those sort of things." The founder and president of Appaloosa Management noted valuations are high, but he wouldn't bet against stocks yet while the Fed is still in easing mode. "I'm not ever fighting this Fed especially when the markets tell me ... one and three quarter more cuts before the end of the year, so that's a tough thing not to own." The S&P 500 is trading at almost 23 times forward earnings, near the highest level since April 2021, according to FactSet. Valuations for some of the megacap tech names have become sky high. "I'm constructive because of the easing right now, but I'm also miserable because of the levels," he said. "I do own Nvidia, but I go back and forth a little bit ... trade a little bit," Tepper said. "We've always had some Nvidia position, but not the same size." Click here to watch the full interview. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Reserve's decision to cut its key borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point seems to be sitting well with the White House, if National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is any indication. In a CNBC interview Thursday, the day after the Fed's move, Hassett noted that the administration, and new Fed Governor Stephen Miran, had been pushing for a bigger reduction. Miran, who is on leave as head of the Council of Economic Advisers, pushed for a half-point cut but was outvoted 11 to 1 on the Federal Open Market Committee. However, Hassett was not critical of the committee's decision. "The bottom line is that moving kind of slow and steady and heading towards a target, watch the data come in, that's what prudent policy is," he said on "Squawk Box." "So I know that my colleague Stephen wanted to go to 50 [basis points], but I think 25 was pretty broad consensus, and I think that's a good first step in the right direction to much lower rates." In the past, Trump has launched a barrage of criticism at the central bank, nicknaming Chair Jerome Powell "Too Late" and calling for quick and aggressive cuts. The president has suggested the benchmark federal funds rate should be 3 percentage points lower, a position not reflected in FOMC projections for the future course of policy in updates released Wednesday. Hassett noted strong economic growth trending above 3% for the third quarter, something that normally wouldn't argue for lower interest rates, particularly with inflation running above the Fed's 2% target. However, Trump has said cuts are needed to support the struggling U.S. housing market and to help manage financing costs for the nation's $37 trillion debt. Assessing the economic variables at play and deciding on the incremental reduction was a proper move, said Hassett, who has been mentioned on the short list of Trump's picks to succeed Powell as chair next year. "I think it's much more prudent for the Fed to be looking at all the models, to have a diversity of opinions and decide, 'What are we going to do in this economy that really looks to be taken off with inflation that's decelerating, but higher than the target?'" "They split the baby in this decision, and I think that's probably a pretty prudent call." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this article appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Larry Ellison built the world's second-largest fortune by holding on to his Oracle shares over nearly five decades of ups and downs. At the same time, he's spent billions to fund his philanthropy, vast real estate holdings, sports investments and his son's fast-growing media empire. A close look at the Oracle chairman's finances and shareholdings reveals a fortune built on mountains of leverage and risk, allowing him to borrow against his shares and raise cash without giving up shares or control. At a time when many tech CEOs are following their wealth managers' prudent advice to "take money off the table" and diversify through share sale programs, Ellison represents a triumph of old-school, go-for-broke wealth creation, even at the age of 81. "Ellison does seem to stand out,  not just for his wealth but for the sheer size of his pledged shares," said Michael Sury, associate professor of practice in finance and managing director for the Center for Analytics and Transformative Technologies at the University of Texas at Austin. Elon Musk, for instance, owns less than 20% of Tesla, while Mark Zuckerberg owns about 14% of Meta shares and Jeff Bezos' stake in Amazon is down to about 8% of shares outstanding after selling more than $18 billion worth in the past two years. Ellison has sold Oracle shares over the years, but mostly to exercise options and pay taxes. According to Smart Insider, Ellison has net a total of $5.1 billion from selling shares – representing a fraction of his stake, now worth over $350 billion. The sales included $900 million of shares he sold in 2001, right before the stock plunged on a disappointing earnings report, which sparked an insider trading lawsuit and eventual settlement. Oracle has also done its part to turbocharge Ellison's equity stake. Still, Ellison has continued to spend record sums on real estate, sports, collectibles and other assets. His personal empire includes dozens of luxury properties, the Indian Wells tennis tournament, the Hawaiian resort island of Lanai, a collection of vintage fighter jets, a 288-foot mega-yacht and the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa in Manalapan, Florida, which he bought for $277 million last year. Ellison has also funded a vast array of private companies. He invested in Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter, now called X, offering Musk "a billion or whatever you recommend," according to a text exchange that was later made public. More recently, Ellison has emerged as a behind-the-scenes media magnate. He backed Skydance Media, run by his son David, in its purchase of Paramount for $8 billion, a merger that closed last month. Now, the Ellison family is reportedly backing Paramount's largely cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery in what could be a more than $70 billion deal. Oracle is also among the companies teaming up to buy TikTok's U.S. operations, although it's unclear whether Ellison himself would personally invest. A signer of The Giving Pledge, Ellison posted on X in July that he will be "concentrating his resources" on the new Ellison Institute of Technology, a partnership with the University of Oxford to find solutions to climate change, disease and world hunger. According to the most recent SEC filing, Ellison has pledged 277 million shares of Oracle common stock as collateral "to secure certain personal indebtedness." The shares represent about a quarter of his total Oracle shares and would have a market value of more than $82 billion on Wednesday's closing price. Most companies prevent or limit executives from borrowing against their shares to avoid a forced sale during a crisis or share decline. Oracle, however, has given its chairman and largest shareholder more leeway. Oracle's governance committee stated in an SEC filing that it "believes that Mr. Ellison's pledging arrangements do not pose a material risk to stockholders or to Oracle in part because the pledged shares secure personal term loans only used to fund outside personal business ventures." "His wealth and influence make lenders comfortable in a way they would not be with most executives. For many other companies this level of borrowing would raise real governance concerns and likely be viewed as a red flag." It's unclear how much Ellison has drawn down on the loans. In a rare comment on his borrowing and spending strategy, Ellison told CNBC in 2012 that a $4 billion line of credit against his shares at the time was never drawn down but kept as potential dry powder for big purchases. "I've got a line of credit just in case I go shopping and something catches my eye," he said, mentioning the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers as a potential example if they came up for sale. Ellison's hold-and-borrow strategy stands in stark contrast to the sales of Oracle CEO Safra Catz. Catz has continued to sell the options she receives from Oracle as they vest, maintaining a small stake in the company. She sold through a so-called 10b5-1 program, which is a pre-scheduled share sale program, and missed out on the 50% run-up in Oracle stock in the months following. Bankers and wealth advisors to tech founders and CEOs say there is no right or wrong approach to managing a large stock position in a company. "It all depends on the person," said Solenn Séguillon, technology practice head at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco, who works with many top tech founders and CEOs. "Everyone has a different comfort level in handling single-stock volatility." At the same time, they typically want to fund other tech ventures launched by friends or colleagues. While some see share pledges and loans as compounding risk, Séguillon said it can be a form of diversification if the loans are used to fund outside investments. "We discuss with our clients how to be mindful of the risks so they don't end up in a situation where they're over-levered." When lending to CEOs or founders with concentrated positions, private banks and wealth management firms say they look at a client's entire balance sheet rather than just the stock position.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Zuckerberg's Meta AI glasses demo went wrong live onstage — twice. On Wednesday, the CEO took to the stage at the company's annual Meta Connect event to reveal the second-generation Meta Ray-Bans, a neural wristband, Meta Ray-Bans Display with heads-up display, and sports-centered glasses with Oakley. To drive his point home that AI should serve people and not just "sit in a data center," Zuckerberg connected food content creator Jack Mancuso to the big screen for a live demo on how the newly upgraded Ray Ban Meta glasses could help Mancuso cook — and that is when things began to get awkward. Mancuso asked the glasses with voice control to show him how to mix a "Korean-inspired steak sauce" for his steak sandwich, but instead of starting with the basics, the AI responded that he should use soy sauce and sesame oil. Mancuso pressed the question of what he should do first multiple times, but the AI ignored his inquiries and moved on with its instructions. The second live demo glitch was not long after he revealed the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses alongside a neural wristband, and called it "one of those special moments." Not only does it have voice assist and camera features like the Meta Ray-Bans, which have been out for two years, the Meta Ray-Ban Display also has a heads-up display, or HUD, that appears on the right side of the glasses to deliver notifications and navigation prompts without requiring users to look down at a phone. But the demo had a hiccup when Zuckerberg suggested that Bosworth give him a video call. "This WiFi is brutal," said Bosworth. "Yeah, I don't know," Zuckerberg responded. You practice these things like 100 times, and then, you never know what's going to happen." "I promise you no one is more upset about this than I am, because this is my team that now has to go debug why this didn't work on the stage," Bosworth added. Business Insider reached out to Meta for more information. Meta shares saw moderate gains of half a percentage point after the demonstrations, and the demo glitches did not seem to lower audience morale.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Wednesday celebrated the news that ABC was pulling "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air for comments the host made following Charlie Kirk's death — and he wants other late-night hosts to be next. "Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. "Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Trump appeared to be referencing the NBC late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers. Trump also referred to Stephen Colbert, whose late-night show on CBS was canceled in July. CBS said the cancellation was "purely a financial decision." ABC, which is owned by Disney, confirmed to Business Insider earlier on Wednesday that it was pulling Kimmel off the air indefinitely. The decision came after the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, publicly condemned Kimmel's comments about Kirk, and after Nexstar, which owns ABC affiliate stations, said it would be pulling Kimmel. Sinclair, which also owns ABC affiliate stations, said in a post on X that it had also informed ABC it would be pulling Kimmel. "We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them," Kimmel said. Democratic lawmakers were swift to condemn the cancellation on social media. Ed Markey and Adam Schiff also expressed outrage at the suspension.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ABC said it pulled Jimmy Kimmel off the air "indefinitely" over his comments about Charlie Kirk's killing, in a move that raised questions about how far is too far for a comedian in 2025. On Monday's show, Kimmel made pointed remarks about President Donald Trump and Kirk's killing. "We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them," Kimmel said. Kimmel also mocked Trump's response to a reporter's question about how he was holding up after Kirk's death. "This is not how an adult grieves the murder of somebody he called a friend," Kimmel said on his Monday show. He's hosted the Primetime Emmy and Academy Awards multiple times. Disney-owned ABC's decision came after pressure from both the FCC and a prominent company that owns ABC affiliate stations, Nexstar. Affiliate stations carry ABC programming under contract but aren't owned by the network itself. FCC chair Brendan Carr publicly condemned Kimmel's comments, calling them "the sickest conduct possible." In an interview with YouTuber Benny Johnson, Carr also warned that affiliate licenses could come under review, and that broadcasters are required to operate "in the public interest." Nexstar subsequently issued a statement saying it would pull Kimmel from the ABC stations it owned, citing his Kirk comments. "Local broadcasters have an obligation to serve the public interest. While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community values. I hope that other broadcasters follow Nexstar's lead." Some context: Nexstar is seeking FCC approval for its $6.2 billion mega deal to acquire TEGNA. The deal would include 13 ABC stations and make Nexstar by far the country's biggest local TV station owner. Sinclair, another major company that owns ABC affiliate stations, said it would not lift the suspension of Kimmel's show on its networks "until formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability." It also called on Kimmel to issue a direct apology to the Kirk family, and make a "meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA." The pressure campaign that preceded Kimmel's suspension highlights the government's considerable power to regulate broadcast networks like ABC, as opposed to cable TV and streaming platforms. Voices on the right have decried certain reactions to Kirk's killing as heartless and horrifying, and others have said such contentions themselves are a form of speech suppression. Meanwhile, defenders of such comments say people on the right who once criticized cancel culture are practicing it. "Shame on those in government who forget this founding truth. "This is the actual cancel culture everyone claims to hate so much," Alex Edelman of "The Paper" wrote. "Everybody across the political spectrum should be speaking out to stop what's happening to Jimmy Kimmel," Senator Chuck Schumer wrote. Kimmel's suspension comes a few months after the controversy around the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's late-night show in July. At the time, CBS executives said the move was "purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night." Some lawmakers raised concerns that the cancellation could have had a political motivation, noting Colbert had just called out CBS's parent, Paramount, for settling Trump's lawsuit over "60 Minutes" for $16 million. Paramount won the FCC's approval to merge with Skydance later that month.</p>
