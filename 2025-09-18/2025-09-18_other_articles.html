Fox News host Mark Levin shares memories of his first conversations with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.' In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, some critics of Israel have sought to drive a wedge between the conservative activist and the Jewish state, mischaracterizing his recent statements and making wild, unfounded accusations. Within hours of Kirk's murder — and before a suspect was identified — unhinged conspiracies spread across social media. Seemingly aware of the effort to co-opt Kirk's legacy, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu eulogized him as a champion of "speaking truth and defending freedom. A lion-hearted friend of Israel, he fought the lies and stood tall for Judeo-Christian civilization." Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA speaks during the Turning Point Action conference, July 15, 2023, in West Palm Beach, Florida. "It's painful to see people back in the US attempt to get clicks & make $$ by making up outrageous lies while exploiting the death of Charlie Kirk whose impact & character the propagandists will never have. Rabbi Pesach Wolicki, who spoke with Charlie Kirk via Zoom the night before his assassination, told Fox News Digital that while Kirk voiced criticism at times, he remained strongly supportive of Israel. "The meeting was one he initiated," Wolicki said. "He was heading out on a campus tour the next day and knew he'd face many questions about Israel. Wolicki noted that only a month earlier, Kirk had been attacked by critics for being "too supportive" of Israel. Although they did not discuss the origins of his views, Wolicki pointed to Kirk's evangelical Christian beliefs, which he said aligned with the right of the Jewish nation to thrive. "He said publicly many times that he believed the Land of Israel belongs to the Jewish people and that he supported Israel's war against Hamas," Wolicki added. "He was not soft on our enemies. In a video of a May debate at Cambridge that went viral, Kirk staunchly defended the Jewish state. "When you declare war on Israel, expect a firestorm in reaction," he declared. "A tragic truth of war is that civilians die. "And they brought it upon themselves. Last month, Charlie Kirk appeared on Megyn Kelly's podcast, describing himself as having a "bulletproof resume" when it comes to defending Israel on both college campuses and social media. "I believe in the scriptural land rights given to Israel, I believe in the fulfillment of prophecy. My life was changed in Israel—the spiritual energy there is so amazing. He added that he often has "less ability sometimes online to criticize the Israeli government without backlash than actual Israelis do." I believe in the Holy Land, I love that Jesus walked on water there and rose from the dead," he said. Kirk stressed his personal bond with Israel but warned against hostile reactions to criticism saying the result could eventually be the "weakening and deflating of two of your strongest advocates if that continues." Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, at the National Council of Young Israel Gala in New York City. Josh Nass, a former conservative youth commentator, met Kirk in 2012, when Kirk was just launching his organization, Turning Point USA. "If you take Israel out of the picture, what Charlie dedicated his life to simply falls apart. He thought our value system was collapsing and was very passionate about the need to fight the culture war. His love for Israel was incredibly real and sincere. I know that because he told me so himself," Nass said. Israel Ganz, head of the Yesha Council — the umbrella organization of local authorities in Judea and Samaria — reacted to Kirk's assassination, saying his community "bow[ed] their heads in mourning over the murder of a friend and lover of Israel." In the spirit of coexistence that Kirk promoted, dozens of Christians and Jews gathered on Wednesday atop Jerusalem's Temple Mount to honor him. They prayed for peace for Kirk's widow and children, offering strength and solidarity in their time of grief. Amelie Botbol is a freelance journalist based in Tel Aviv.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A nearly 22-minute video titled 'The Roswell Incident' has been quietly uploaded to the National Archives, reigniting interest in the infamous 1947 crash. The footage combines still images and motion-control camera shots sourced from the published Roswell Report, as well as various magazines and books about UFOs. It opens with a shot of the book 'The Roswell Report: Fact Versus Fiction in the New Mexico Desert' and ends with a stark black-and-white image that appears to show a crash site, with debris scattered across a massive crater in the ground. Major Jesse Marcel, who recovered debris from the crash, described the scene as 'a large area heavily scattered with metallic debris from a single impact point that scarred the earth.' Some viewers have also pointed to a dark formation on the right side of the image, claiming it resembles an alien body. 'In my opinion, it's either a hoax,' he said. If it came out as a release from the military or Congress, I would take it a lot more seriously.' Lee also noted that the 'alien' in the photo is nothing more than a case of pareidolia, a psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimuli. Project Mogul was a top-secret US military program from 1947 to 1949 that used high-altitude balloons equipped with microphones to detect sound waves from Soviet atomic bomb tests. A 1994 military investigation concluded that the debris found at the Roswell site was likely pieces of a high-altitude balloon from Project Mogul, not an extraterrestrial spacecraft. Despite this official explanation, the newly uploaded video has sparked debate online, with viewers offering widely differing interpretations. 'National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has uploaded a video of the Roswell 1947 UAP Crash site,' one user shared. Another user posted on X: 'Like noted UFO researcher Grant Cameron has stated plenty of times, sometimes the disclosure of the real deal is a purposefully placed needle in the haystack. One user posted: 'It's clearly B-roll for that Roswell presentation the government put together in 1996. Someone must have found this and uploaded it in the last couple of days.' Others have suggested a dead alien can be seen in the image, pointing to what Marcle said following the Roswell incident. In July 1947, a rancher reported pieces of debris scattered over his land. The local paper's front page story reported that the Roswell Army Field recovered a flying saucer on a New Mexico Ranch after metallic-looking, light but strong material was scattered across the land. 'The intelligence office of the 509th Bombardment Group at Roswell Army Air Field announced at noon today that the field has come into the possession of a Flying Saucer,' Roswell Daily Record reported on July 8, 1947. It was designed to search the atmosphere for weak reverberations from nuclear-test blasts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license, no changes made While the United States seems to be good at its job of proffering peace throughout the world and maintaining stability, its unique landscape is not seeing many scientific expeditions like its other sectors. If you love to go out particularly in the states, there is no way you wouldn't have come across Utah's Canyonlands National Park. The “upheaval dome” in question refers to a strange circle of deformed rock that spans more than three kilometers across and rises like a bull's eye from the desert floor . Geologists and scientists have come together to attempt to precisely determine the origin and cause of the dome's formation. An important fact to note is that over time, there have been several theories aimed at explaining and unravelling the mystery behind this seemingly extra terrestrial life form. It stipulates that thick layers of ancient salt lie beneath the Canyonlands which over time, pushed these salt layers upward through the rock above them in bulbous formations called diapirs. Another intriguing theory about Utah's upheaval rock formation is the meteorite impact hypothesis. Amidst all the research chaos, some geological elements were also discovered. But if not, shocked quartz are tiny grains of sand whose crystal structures have been rearranged under immense, instantaneous pressure. But the unshakable reality is that these elements do not form under normal seismic and planetary processes. Their existence proves the impact of a meteorite crash down. In the early 2000s, geologists identified such grains in sandstone samples from the “Upheaval Dome”. The presence of shocked quartz dramatically strengthened the underlying hypothesis that explained that a celestial crash-down into our planet's crust was the only reason shocked quartz existed freely on the surface of our planet's lithosphere. Unlike many well-studied craters, Upheaval Dome lacks extensive melt rocks or a thick blanket of ejecta—debris blasted outward during impact. Others suggest that erosion over tens of millions of years may have erased these features, leaving only the deeper structural traces. Who said the United States does not also have its own unique set of wonders? If you're still doubting, pick up your hiking boots and head over to any park. This doesn't necessarily have to be Utah's Canyonlands National Park, it could be any park but you'll become easily intrigued by some of our planet's hints at the supernatural forming behind the scenes, like this mysterious ghost inland.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police say Akshay Vashisht made ‘false, malicious and superstitious' claims about Manohar airport At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Police in India's popular coastal state of Goa have arrested a YouTuber after he posted a video claiming that the state's new international airport was haunted. Akshay Vashisht, who runs a popular channel with more than 570,000 subscribers dedicated to horror stories and paranormal case studies, was detained in Delhi on Wednesday. His arrest followed a complaint by a police constable from Goa's social media monitoring cell, who alleged the video spread false information about the newly built Manohar International Airport at Mopa. In the video, Mr Vashisht claimed that airline staff had reported “paranormal activities” and that pilots often refused to operate night flights due to ghostly sightings, including that of a mysterious woman in a red saree on the runway. A version of the video remained viewable on Facebook but another on Mr Vashisht's main YouTube channel had been made private as of Thursday. Officers seized his mobile phone, laptop and camera and brought him to the Mopa airport police station for further investigation. He faces an initial chargesheet filed under sections of the Indian Penal Code covering public mischief and common intention – people gathering with the intent to commit a crime. As Goa's second airport, it has a goal of drawing 12 million passengers per year in the next five years in order to boost tourism and connectivity in one of India's most popular destinations for both domestic and international travel. Authorities said unfounded rumours could damage its reputation at a time when the facility is still building international credibility. Earlier this year, a spate of posts appeared claiming there was reduced footfall at Goa's beaches and resorts due to increased prices of hotels and restaurants. Goa's tourism minister Rohan Khaunte insisted in July that there had been no drop in tourist numbers and claimed, without evidence, that “paid” “so-called influencers” were deliberately perpetuating false narratives to harm the image of the state.

The Taiwanese series sees Shu Qi and Angelica Lee play a pair of vengeful mothers who seek justice via dark, fantastical means

Lead cast: Shu Qi, Angelica Lee Sinje

Asian superstars Shu Qi and Angelica Lee Sinje headline The Resurrected, Netflix's latest Taiwanese drama series, which premiered its first two episodes at the 30th Busan International Film Festival in South Korea on September 18, ahead of its October 9 release on the streamer.

Directed by Leste Chen Cheng-tao and Hsu Chao-jen, The Resurrected combines pressing social issues with outrageous supernatural horror, two of the most popular and ubiquitous genres in Taiwanese media right now.

A generous dose of melodrama is also added to the mix, as the narrative follows these two women in their struggle to process what happened to their children and the lengths to which they go to ensure justice is served.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Florida Tech astrophysicist Howard Chen is offering new insights to help aid NASA's search for life beyond Earth. Now, he's offering an explanation for why telescopes have yet to find definitive signs of either. A Palette of Water Growth Histories in TRAPPIST-1 Analogs and Compact Planetary Systems," was authored by Chen, an assistant professor of space sciences, and researchers from NASA, Johns Hopkins University and Harvard University. It was published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters in September and explores the likelihood that TRAPPIST-1's three innermost exoplanets contained no water when they formed, despite existing in a zone where water is viable. TRAPPIST-1 is a red dwarf star located about 40 light-years away from us. They also fall within the star's habitable zone, which is the distance range from a star at which temperatures are not too hot or cold to support liquid water. Researchers are searching for any evidence of water on these planets, but have yet to detect anything. Some think a lack of gas in the atmosphere is disrupting the light needed to pick up detailed visuals. Others predict water could have escaped the planets' atmospheres throughout their evolution. He would test it not from an observational perspective, but with mathematical modeling of the planets' initial formation. "You have astronomers who are using telescopes to see what's out there. I come from a different perspective," Chen said. "I'm both trying to explain what we're seeing while trying to make predictions about what we can't." The researchers created models that examined the composition and growth of these planets starting when they were as small as 1 kilometer wide. They simulated how material aggregated during collisions with other celestial objects until they reached their final planetary formations. There are several key factors in collision events that heavily influence a planet's final composition. Chen's models incorporated impact delivery, which is the transfer of materials like water and gases during a celestial collision; impact erosion, which refers to the removal of materials in a planet's atmosphere due to impact; and mantle-atmosphere exchange, which is the transfer of water and gases between a planet's atmosphere and mantle to maintain its conditions. The team ran hundreds of collision simulations, which returned thousands of different possibilities for how TRAPPIST-1's planets might have formed. This means that instead of acquiring material for a gaseous atmosphere, planets' atmospheres were completely cleared out by the power of the collisions. With no gas in the atmosphere to contain water, it's possible that any previously existing water escaped back into space during these collision events. Understanding a planet's earliest characteristics, its water, air and carbon content, builds the foundation for how they evolve. Combining the theoretical context of a planet's formation with the state in which it was discovered can help researchers—and NASA—make informed, efficient decisions on which planets are worth investigating and when it's time to move on to the next.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tyler Robinson's alleged texts to his partner have been met with scepticism across the ideological spectrum. After prosecutors in the US state of Utah published alleged text exchanges between 22-year-old Tyler Robinson and his romantic partner on Tuesday, countless social media users, including numerous prominent influencers, cast doubt on their authenticity. Matt Walsh, a right-wing commentator and podcast host with millions of followers on X and YouTube, suggested the exchanges had been scripted to absolve Robinson's transgender partner of any involvement in the shooting. “This feels like a strategy they cooked up from watching too much TV,” Walsh said on X. Utah Governor Spencer Cox has said that the partner, described as a “male transitioning to female”, had no advance knowledge of the crime and has been cooperating fully with authorities. Steve Bannon, US President Donald Trump's former adviser, said on his podcast that he was “not buying” the texts, describing them as “too stilted, too much like a script”. On the other side of the political spectrum, Majid Padellan, a progressive influencer who goes by Brooklyn Dad Defiant on social media, said he did not believe for “one second” that the texts had been written by Robinson. “I didn't know him personally, but I know that no 22 year old writes text messages like this,” Padellan said on X. After a gunman shot dead a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband in June, right-wing conspiracy theorists claimed that the shooting had been perpetrated by a left-wing extremist or carried out on behalf of the state's Democratic governor, Tim Walz. The alleged gunman, Vance Boelter, espoused staunchly conservative views on issues including abortion and LGBTQ rights. While many conspiracy theories have been driven by a particular ideological faction, Kirk's assassination is the latest event to fuel unfounded claims with “cross-ideological appeal”, said Eric Oliver, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago who studies conspiracy theories. “People are also really emotionally charged by this, both on the left and the right, and will often gravitate to stories that rationalise their fear, rage or feelings of powerlessness,” Oliver told Al Jazeera. The “extraordinary circumstances” of Kirk's murder, including a relative lack of information about Robinson, had also left a vacuum that was being filled by people “already suspicious of anything either the government does or this administration does”, Oliver added. The transcripts of Robinson's alleged texts released by prosecutors provided some of the clearest indications yet of a possible motive for assassinating Kirk, who was lauded by conservatives but seen as an inflammatory figure on the left for his right-wing stances on immigration, abortion and transgender rights, among other issues. Authorities previously announced that they recovered bullet casings inscribed with a number of politically-charged and internet subculture-influenced messages, including “Hey fascist! Prosecutors, who allege Kirk was targeted over his “political expression”, have charged Robinson with aggravated murder and six other charges. Steven B Duke, an expert in criminal law at Yale Law School, offered a blunt assessment of the possibility that prosecutors had fabricated evidence as crucial as the suspect's text messages. “There is nothing in those messages making it even plausible that they were written by law enforcement,” Duke told Al Jazeera. “The conspiracy theorists are crazy, as is anyone who agrees with them.” Nonetheless, that Robinson's alleged communications with his partner after Kirk's assassination have only further fuelled conspiracies is not surprising, experts suggest. “People have worldviews; some of those worldviews make conspiracy theories easy to believe, whether those people are on social media or not,” he told Al Jazeera. “Conspiracy theories existed long before social media and may have been more prominent then.</p>
