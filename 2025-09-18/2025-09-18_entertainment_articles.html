                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FCC chair's latest comments come after he condemned 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' for the host's remarks about the Charlie Kirk shooter on Monday night's show, which ultimately led to Jimmy Kimmel's show being “indefinitely” suspended by ABC. While The View was created by the legendary journalist Barbara Walters, it is primarily a panel talk show, albeit one that tackles current events. Hollywood Unions Say Jimmy Kimmel Suspension "Chills Free Speech," Threatens Artist Livelihoods “When you look at these other TV shows, what's interesting is the FCC does have a rule called the equal opportunity rule,” he said. “But there's an exception to that rule called the bona fide news exception, which means if you are a bona fide news program, you don't have to abide by the equal opportunity rule.” Carr continued, “And over the years, the FCC has developed a body of case law on that and has suggested that most of these late night shows, other than SNL, are bona fide news programs. It is worth noting that the rule “does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate,” per FCC regulations, but rather comparable time and placement. Last year, for example, Vice President Kamala Harris appeared in a sketch on Saturday Night Live. She was only on air for 90 seconds, but NBC proactively reached out to the Trump campaign and gave him a similar amount of time during a NASCAR race and an NFL game. While The View has frequently hosted guests of all political persuasions over the years, it was a favored stop by former President Biden. If the FCC does determine that The View or late night talk shows are not exempt under FCC equal time rules, the networks would need to provide equal time for all political candidates during elections, which could prove onerous.

You can't go around firing somebody because you're fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian criminal administration in the Oval Office, that's just not how this works.” Letterman joked that he was doing the same thing for 30 years. “The point is beating up on these people, rightly or wrongly, accurately or perhaps inaccurately in the name of comedy, not once were we squeezed by anyone from any governmental agency, let alone the dreaded FCC,” he said. We can do things the hard way.' It comes two months after Letterman also shared his views on the cancelation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. “I don't think it was money,” Letterman said on a video on the Letterman YouTube channel. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. He has been losing viewers for a long time now. Why does nobody mention what happened to Bill Maher in 2001? Same exact thing and also on ABC. People's obsession with Trump has clouded their rationale. It's been mentioned several times in various publications over last couple days including the LA Times. No, that was not the “same exact thing”. He got fired for purposefully lying about the ideology of an assassin. Every word out of Trumps mouth is a lie. To bad we can't fire him. He's talking about the FCC strong arming networks into shutting up people that criticize Trump. Trump himself said that Kimmel would be next on the chopping block two months ago when Colbert was fired. You have to be a cult member or just absent in the mind to take what they say at face value. Especially when you can read/see Kimmel's own words and realize he made no insinuation that Robinson was rightwing, but that MAGA was doing everything they could to prove the killer wasn't one of them. But let you all tell it, Kimmel said “I KNEW IT ROBINSON IS MAGA AND ALWAYS WAS”. Same ole “believe what I tell you is true, not what you see or hear.” FBI, DA, Governor, bullet casings, texts, online search history, family statements are all fake? do you know anyone on the left who listens to nick fuentes? i sure don't, the left hates that guy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Sundance prize-winning animator-director Jeron Braxton has brought an A-list cast around Scott “Kid Cudi” Mescudi for Slime, the animated feature marking his feature debut, on which we first reported in 2023. Newcomers to the ensemble will include Willow Smith (I Am Legend), One Battle After Another breakout Teyana Taylor, Emmy and Golden Globe winner Anna Sawai (Shōgun), John Cho (Tempest) and BAFTA winner John Boyega (The Woman King), sources tell Deadline. We're told Smith is set to play the lead role of Muna, with voice work starting next month. 2025-26 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Grammys, Guilds & More 'One Battle After Another' Review: Paul Thomas Anderson's Insanely Great Action Movie With Leonardo DiCaprio And Sean Penn Has It All Set in a too-near future, Slime follows Muna (Smith), an optimistic but broke young woman who signs up for a paid clinical trial, only to be injected with a mysterious creature's slime that unleashes destructive powers she can't control. On the run, she kidnaps Glenn (Mescudi), the lab worker who injected her, and the two set out on a perilous odyssey through a crumbling dystopian world in search of refuge and a cure. But as the clock runs out, is Muna transforming into humanity's worst nightmare or its last, unlikely savior? Set to feature an original soundtrack and score by Kid Cudi, the film is described as an anime-inspired pre-apocalyptic sci-fi monster flick with retro video-game aesthetics. Producers include Alex Lebovici, Mescudi, Karina Manashil, Smith, and Aaron Bergman. Ibrahim Mohammed, Chase Vergari, Craig Peck, Dennis Cummings, Brian Ash, Michael Learner, Jon Oakes, Christian Mercuri, Courtney Chenn, Waylen Lin and Alex Kaplunov are serving as exec producers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the car's front trunk was opened, detectives discovered decomposing human remains. As police continue their investigation, here's everything we know about the shocking case so far. But Rivas' body was so “severely decomposed” that examiners were unable to determine her eye color, age, or race/ethnicity. Just over a week after the body was discovered, on Sept. 16, authorities finally identified Celeste Rivas Hernandez, a 15-year-old from Lake Elsinore, California, who was reported missing by her family last year. A GoFundMe has been set up to help her family cover the cost of funeral arrangements. After Rivas was identified, reporters quickly swarmed the family's home. While the family declined to speak with them, TMZ reported that Rivas' mother said her daughter had been dating someone named “David” before her death. A friend, Rubi Alonso, who was visiting the house, described Rivas as sweet and “studious” to Rolling Stone, adding, “It's so sad. Despite identifying Rivas, there's still much authorities do not know, including a cause of death. Neighborhood sources said the sedan had been sitting in its final spot, on Bluebird Avenue, for at least three weeks. The investigation ramped up Wednesday night after Rivas' body was identified. Per ABC 7 in Los Angeles, investigators searched a house on Doheny Place, close to where the car was abandoned. After several hours at the home, police left with a computer and other items.

(“Not my friend i did a song with him which is currently in the process of being taken down given today's disturbing news,” she wrote on social media following the body's discovery.) D4vd has enjoyed an impressive rise over the past few years. “We are aware of this developing story,” the brands said in a joint statement. Madonna Returns to the Dancefloor — And Warner Records — for New Album Jimmy Kimmel Criticizes Trump's Response to Charlie Kirk's ‘Senseless' Death On Wednesday, as news of Rivas' identification spread, D4vd also had his first show canceled (a gig at the Showbox SoDo in Seattle). As it stands, D4vd's next two shows are still set to go ahead as planned: A Sept. 18 gig at the Warfield in San Francisco, followed by a show at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on Sept. 20. TMZ in particular has surfaced several alleged links, including a photo of Burke that appears to show him with a “Shhh …” tattoo on his finger similar to the one Rivas had. The tabloid also uncovered a photo of Burke in Lake Elsinore, close to where Rivas lived before her disappearance. An allegedly leaked and unreleased D4vd song has also started floating around the web, called “Celeste.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Billboard interview comes as "Golden" spends its fifth week at No. It's fair to say that the world has never seen anything quite like KPop Demon Hunters, which has absolutely captivated audiences — to the point that fictional band HUNTR/X is now making very real moves in the music industry. Its single “Golden,” for instance, has spent five weeks so far at No. That said, the imaginary trio also has some very real musical influences that informed its look and sound — and in a conversation with Billboard over noodles, the singing voices behind HUNTR/X spoke about some of their personal favorite K-pop acts. EJAE, who portrays Rumi in the KPop Demon Hunters musical numbers, begins, “I like the OG generation, so, like, G.O.D, shout-out.” “H.O.T, S.E.S, like, they are the reasons why I fell in love with K-pop,” she continues. “2NE1 was hugely inspirational, because I feel like they were just so cool. “They weren't doing like the traditional girl group, aesthetic approach, of, like, very good, frilly, girly,” she says of 2NE1. “No, they were hard, in your face, full of attitude. And I think us being raised in the West, there was a part of us that we saw in them. “It is really cool, because I feel like they were so trailblazing in their own way as well,” says Nuna of the iconic R&B trio comprised of Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. With all the success Demon Hunters is seeing, fans have been clamoring for another installment. A part two is reportedly in talks, but as REI AMI reminds Billboard, “The sequel has not been confirmed.” “We should start, like, a tap-dancing group or something,” says Nuna as REI AMI and EJAE laugh.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Natasha Lyonne and Matt Berry are co-creating and starring in a new series called Force & Majeure, which has nothing to do with avalanches, cowardly dads, or the Ruben Östlund film with a very similar name. In fact, it seems like Lyonne and Berry's character will do quite the opposite of sprinting away from trouble. (They'll probably scream about it in a silly voice, though, if their respective histories are anything to go by.) Natasha Lyonne is also busy right now with her directorial debut, an AI “hybrid” film called Uncanny Valley. She launched an “ethical” AI production company called Asteria Studios in connection with that project, but at least as of this writing, Force & Majeure won't incorporate the technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MJ Lenderman, King Krule, Arca, Massive Attack, MIKE, and Yaeji are among more than 400 artists and labels who have signed up to a campaign asking distributors to block their music from streaming in Israel. A statement from No Music for Genocide rallies more artists and labels to join the cultural embargo, in protest of “Israel's genocide in Gaza; ethnic cleansing of the Occupied West Bank; apartheid within Israel,” and the repression of pro-Palestine activism, as well as the music industry's own links to military tools. In a separate statement, Massive Attack announced they would remove their music from Spotify globally. Other artists to sign up to No Music for Genocide include Fontaines D.C., Oklou, Wednesday, Kelela, Faye Webster, Japanese Breakfast, Rina Sawayama, Aminé, Erika de Casier, Kneecap, Primal Scream, Eartheater, Aja Monet, Maryam Saleh, Ana Tijoux, Annahstasia, Amyl and the Sniffers, Nadah El Shazly, Ben Howard, Fat Tony, Mannequin Pussy, Liv.e, Mø, Mechatok, Redveil, Horsegiirl, Chanel Beads, Nick León, Escho, Saul Williams, and Verraco. According to the campaign, all three major labels geo-blocked their catalogs from streaming services in Russia within a month of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. A statement from No Music for Genocide reads, in part, “Culture can't stop bombs on its own, but it can help reject political repression, shift public opinion toward justice, and refuse the art-washing and normalization of any company or nation that commits crimes against humanity. This initiative is one part of a worldwide movement to erode the support Israel needs to continue its genocide. We're inspired by the escalating efforts in pursuit of that goal, from the recent Film Workers for Palestine pledge to Spain's ban of Israel-bound ships and planes to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition to Demilitarize Brooklyn Navy Yard to dockworkers in Morocco who've refused to load weapons onto vessels ordered by Tel Aviv.” Pitchfork may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

No Music For Genocide points out that major labels removed their catalogues and closed operations in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, but have stopped short of taking the same measures in Israel. Major label acts who have signed the pledge are also urging Sony, UMG, and Warner to follow suit. “Culture can't stop bombs on its own, but it can help reject political repression, shift public opinion toward justice, and refuse the art-washing and normalization of any company or nation that commits crimes against humanity. “Many of our peers have felt, like ourselves, unsure how to use music in this moment.

When the rise of television threatened movie attendance in the 1950s, Hollywood responded by introducing several new exhibition formats designed to bring people back to theaters with the promise of widescreen images and stereophonic sound. Now, as exhibitors struggle with the rise of streaming and declining theater attendance, one of America's greatest living filmmakers has revived one of the greatest of all widescreen formats, giving today's audiences the same reason to get off their couches that Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Curtiz, and other premier directors of their era gave in the 1950s. Related Stories What Lilly Singh Does Is Not ‘Niche' There's Never Been a Better Time to Own the Full ‘Bluey' Blu-ray Collection Now, director Paul Thomas Anderson has not only filmed but is releasing “One Battle After Another” in VistaVision, with a handful of venues projecting the movie in a format that hasn't been seen by audiences of a new release film since Marlon Brando's “One-Eyed Jacks” in 1961. (Lucky viewers at this year's TCM Film Festival did get to see revivals of “We're No Angels” and “Gunfight at the O.K. What made VistaVision special compared to rival formats like CinemaScope was its larger negative — around twice the size of a typical 35mm film frame, as the film was run through the camera horizontally rather than vertically. In spite of that superior quality, VistaVision ultimately became more or less obsolete for feature film production, though it continued to be used extensively for special effects work on blockbusters like the original “Star Wars,” “Back to the Future,” and “Jurassic Park.” “One Battle After Another” was shot using a combination of VistaVision and Super 35, and will be released in no fewer than seven formats. This has led to intense excitement among cinephiles — and no small amount of misinformation. In one example, a fan-created graphic recently took off on social media and led to widespread confusion over aspect ratios of the various exhibition formats. Anderson referred us to three members of his post-production team: editor Andy Jurgensen, post-production supervisor Erica Frauman, and associate editor Jay Trautman, all of whom dealt with the complexities of VistaVision and the movie's varied release prints throughout the post-production process. Together, they addressed several important questions related to the different ways you can watch “One Battle After Another” when it opens in theaters on September 26. The below interview condenses and combines responses from Jurgensen, Frauman, and Trautman on the specifics of formats for seeing “One Battle After Another.” The film was shot using a combination of VistaVision (8-perf) and Super 35 (4-perf) formats. Both offer a tall enough negative to accommodate the full IMAX 1.43:1 aspect ratio, though the image can be cropped top and bottom to fit the 1.90:1 IMAX or standard 1.85:1 aspect ratios. Camera operator Colin Anderson used ground glass marked with framelines for both 1.85:1 and 1.43:1 compositions to ensure flexibility in framing. We often say that each release format offers its own unique experience of the film. Because the film was shot with both VistaVision and Super 35mm cameras, we had to navigate not only multiple release formats but also multiple capture formats. If we were using the digital intermediate process that nearly every modern film uses, we would just scan all of the negative and resize it in a computer. This means that we had to figure out how to create the VistaVision negative from our Super 35mm shots and our digital visual effects. We started testing these processes over two years ago. In the end, FotoKem configured both an optical printer and a digital film recorder specifically for VistaVision, allowing us to create all the necessary elements to assemble a complete VistaVision negative and produce a VistaVision release print. There are only four of these special screening venues currently scheduled — in Los Angeles, New York, Boston, and London. This is the first narrative feature film to be presented entirely in IMAX's 1.43:1 aspect ratio (with no jumping between aspect ratios). Unlike traditional 35mm film, which runs vertically through the camera gate, VistaVision uses a horizontal feed. Very few of these projectors still exist today. According to VistaVision expert Charlotte Barker, “It's been exactly 70 years since VistaVision projectors were first installed for commercial use, debuting with Paramount's ‘Strategic Air Command' in 1955. Back then, seven U.S. theaters were outfitted with VistaVision projectors, custom 2-foot-deep curvilinear screens, and special aperture plates. Warner Bros. refurbished two Ballantyne VistaVision projectors for use in Los Angeles and New York; Barry Wright (Bell Theatre Services) refreshed their VistaVision projector in London. Boston Light & Sound had previously refurbished two projectors supplied by the George Eastman Museum for the TCM Festival in April of 2025; these will be used in Boston. Each Ballantyne projector is equipped with DTS readers to synchronize audio and fitted with custom-built platters capable of running the entire two-hour, 40-minute film on a single reel. The Boston location will utilize two projectors and play reel-to-reel. Projectionists at each location are receiving specialized training to operate the equipment. This hasn't been possible for over 60 years. As far as we know, this is the first new release feature film to be projected from true VistaVision prints since “One-Eyed Jacks” in 1961.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dozens of Americans across a variety of professional fields have been fired or put on leave from their jobs after conservatives contacted their employers over social media comments they made about right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last week, following his assassination. Kirk, for the record, wrote on X last year: “Hate speech does not exist legally in America. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment.” In practice, though, he and Turning Point USA, the non-profit he co-founded and led, could be openly retaliatory against those they disagreed with — the organization has long maintained, for example, a “Professor Watchlist” of educators they claim push liberal propaganda and discriminate against conservative students in the classroom. College faculty members have called it an attempt to intimidate and inspire harassment. It's no great shock, then, that Kirk's allies and admirers took it upon themselves to surveil public reactions to his death, singling out those who expressed a lack of sympathy or outright contempt for the activist — or simply quoted his most inflammatory statements. Billed by its anonymous organizers as “a searchable database of 20,000 people celebrating Charlie Kirk's murder,” the page provided, along with names and photos, personal information such as an individual's social media handles, employer, city of residence, and email address. “Terrified to think of how far-right fans of Kirk, aching for more violence, could very well turn this into an even more radicalizing moment,” she posted on X. “Will they now believe their fears have been proven right and feel they have a right to ‘retaliate,' regardless of who actually was behind the initial shooting?” For Gilmore, the effect of being put on blast by CharliesMurderers.com over this measured comment was swift and frightening. Rolling Stone reached out to a dozen other people targeted on the website for what they said or shared about Kirk, but most did not respond. All had deleted at least one or more of their social media profiles, including X, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn accounts, presumably due to a torrent of harassment like the one Gilmore has endured. Hannah Molitor, another woman listed on CharliesMurderers.com, was subsequently fired from her job at Next Door, a Milwaukee childcare organization. Marc Maron, Wanda Sykes Raise Free-Speech Warnings After ABC Cans ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' Dem Senator Introduces Bill to End Profiteering by Trump and Lawmakers Sinclair's ABC Stations Will Air Charlie Kirk Tribute During 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' Trump Boasts That Kimmel Suspension is ‘Great News for America' “It is really important to me that people realize both in my post and in my own personal opinion that I would never wish death upon anyone or celebrate anyone's death, especially victims of gun violence,” Molitor tells Rolling Stone. “I may have disagreed with Charlie Kirk politically, but no one deserves to be killed, especially in such a horrific and visible way.” She says far-right extremists distorted her comment and “spread misinformation about me all over the internet.” After her post was shared on the anti-LGBTQ hate account LibsOfTikTok the night of the shooting, she says, her email inbox filled up with “hundreds of vile messages telling me to either kill myself or that they wished I would die a horrible death.” Her phone number and home address were leaked. Molitor was also “receiving pictures of guns,” with people threatening to show up at her home or workplace. “I refuse to let the bully win, and I know these people just want to scare me, and I will not give them the satisfaction.” She started a GoFundMe campaign called “Support Hannah's Fight Against Online Defamation” to cover living expenses after her firing — as well as the costs of potentially taking legal action — and has so far raised more than $2,000. Indeed, many observers speculated that those anonymously smearing random social media commenters as Kirk's “murderers” (while an actual suspect in the slaying, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, had been arrested and charged) could face lawsuits from the individuals who had their personal information shared on the site. A number of lawyers publicly volunteered their services, including civil rights attorney J. Alejandro Barrientos. “Many of the people listed on the ‘Charlie's murderers' website may have viable defamation claims,” Barrientos tells Rolling Stone, noting that “many of the posts contained statements that could not be reasonably interpreted as supporting political violence” while others “only quoted Kirk's own words.” He adds that the site, by collating personal data, “may have also violated anti-doxing laws that some states began enacting in recent years.” Nora Benavidez, another civil rights attorney and senior counsel at the watchdog group Free Press, called the site “dangerous” in a post on X, and agrees that it may have violated anti-doxing laws. She says that “alongside employment law remedies, people on the list may have a legal case in those instances,” but cautions that under the lawless Trump administration, “these avenues for relief offer little comfort.” “We are witnessing a chilling attempt to silence free speech,” Benavidez says. “This list was created to intimidate, harass and exact economic consequences. The new site included a jumbled disclaimer saying that it “lawfully” collected “publicly available data” on “support for political violence,” but was “not a doxxing website” and did not identify individuals. There was no accessible list of people supposedly celebrating Kirk's murder, and a submissions portal for offending posts about him remained inactive. As of Wednesday, this page had also been taken fully offline. Madonna Returns to the Dancefloor — and Warner Records — for New Album Jimmy Kimmel Criticizes Trump's Response to Charlie Kirk's ‘Senseless' Death Molitor does intend to pursue legal action, per her crowdfunding page. Gilmore, for her part, has not taken a step in that direction just yet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pavement have just released Hecklers Choice: Big Gums and Heavy Lifters, their new best-of compilation; physical editions will follow on November 14 via Matador. What's more, the band has also announced that vinyl and CD versions of the soundtrack to their oddball movie Pavements—a blend of documentary, biopic, and mockumentary, all directed by Alex Ross Perry—will arrive on November 14, too. Stream their new compilation album, and check out a live video of “Grounded,” filmed at the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, below. Hecklers Choice is the second best-of compilation of Pavement's career, arriving 15 years after their 2010 collection Quarantine the Past. The updated tracklist includes songs that have since become modern classics of the band's career, including the Spotify algorithm favorite–turned–TikTok hit “Harness Your Hopes.” Pre-orders for vinyl and CD versions of Hecklers Choice are currently ongoing. Pavements (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is also currently available to order. Compiled by the band and Robert Greene, the movie's producer and editor, Pavements' official soundtrack combines live and rehearsal recordings from the band's 2021 reunion tour, dialogue snippets from the movie, scenes from the fake Oscar-bait biopic Range Life, and cast recordings from the Slanted!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Influencer Keeley Whitcomb is mourning the heartbreaking loss of her two children after a car crash on September 15 near Hastings, Nebraska. Her husband, Blake Whitcomb, remains in intensive care following the accident. Whitcomb, who often posted Disney-themed content and worked as a travel agent for Dreams Travel Consulting, shared the devastating news with followers on TikTok. An accident has taken my two children from me and put my husband in the intensive care unit. Consider me out of the Disney office,” she wrote. According to local outlets NTV News and KLKN-TV, the Adams County Sheriff's Department responded to a two-vehicle crash at an uncontrolled rural intersection. Blake, 33, was driving a pickup truck that collided with a farm silage truck driven by 66-year-old Dale Feik. Both drivers were transported to Mary Lanning Memorial Hospital. Honoring her 10-year-old daughter, Laynee Rae, she wrote, “10 years was not long enough for me. She also remembered her stepson, Ryder, in a heartfelt post. Though I didn't know him all his life, I got to know him for 3 years. The family's heartbreak has been felt across their community and online. Ryder's grandmother, Cheryl Gardner, shared her own tribute on Facebook: God has bigger plans for you my little buddy.” Fans and friends have filled Keeley's social media posts with messages of love and support as she navigates unimaginable grief. Another comment read: We are crying with you. This is the first time you've ever been on my FYP, but as a mom, I cried for you.</p>

When it works well, film marketing can feel something like a magic trick. Macon Blair's “The Toxic Avenger” recently made headlines with a marketing move that saw several outlets reporting the film had relieved at least $5 million in medical debt through a hefty donation from Cineverse that the film's ticket sales would supplement. The patients the campaign would help came from a wide pool of people in need — with debt resold at a fire-sale price. That story — about a scrappy indie movie sticking it to America's broken healthcare system through a triumphant rush on the box office — is true, mostly. Related Stories One Format After Another: How, Where, and Why to Watch Paul Thomas Anderson's Latest Film in Every Way ‘Jay Kelly' to Open Middleburg Film Festival, with Chloé Zhao and Colin Farrell Among 2025 Honorees “Medial debt is crippling for American families,” said Lauren McCarthy, senior vice president of marketing at Cineverse. The final amount of medical debt forgiven by the studio could land closer to $8 million, if it makes much more in theaters, and if you account for other donations made directly. The “Toxic Avenger” activation cost just $70,000 for the studio to pull off, and plenty of other low-budget releases could be doing this, too. “One dollar, on average, erases around a hundred dollars or more of medical debt,” explained Daniel Lempert, vice president of communications and marketing at the nonprofit Undue Medical Debt. “It took us a while to wrap our heads around that math,” said McCarthy. “But it was one of the most exciting parts of the process [promoting this film], hearing that all this was possible.” Unpaid medical debt is exceedingly common in the United States. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading source for healthcare data, estimates that more than 100 million people are struggling with medical debt today. That puts the total at a staggering $220 billion or more — a number that shows just how overwhelming and urgent the crisis has become. “A lot of people will borrow from friends and family, and the number one reason people will do a GoFundMe campaign tends to be around healthcare debt.” When Cineverse rescued it last year, their recent triumph with the extremely graphic “Terrifier 3” only made speculation about its content gorier. Partnering with Undue Medical Debt was a smart course correction that played on the film's heart. By comparison, Cineverse spent $500,000 marketing “Terrifier 3,” which could have theoretically paid for $50 million in medical debt when the resale rate is $1 to every $100. “I got an initial quote for a [another stunt] that could have been an option,” said McCarthy, who described a flash mob spectacle that would've cost $50,000 at least. “When you think about the frivolity of what that money could do, and what we are doing instead, it puts things in perspective. … We do a lot of stunts because we certainly don't put anywhere near the budget into paid media than any other studio does. Then we rely on organic digital pickup and we amplify a bit, but we are relying on people to see the stunt, get excited by the stunt, think it's funny, and share it with their friends, and that makes the community bigger.” “It speaks to how pervasive this crisis is that we have such an eclectic roster of partners,” he said. “We're slightly slammed, so we haven't fully gotten there, but I'm hoping that it can be as delightful and surprising to the people receiving the letters as possible,” said McCarthy around the film's opening weekend. “The Toxic Avenger” has so far made a self-reported $2.9 million for Cineverse (although lower insider estimates place it closer to $2.3 million), and Blair's mutant movie doesn't seem to have been substantively aided by the Undue partnership. Still, it's a clever bang-for-your-buck PR purchase from Cineverse — which continues to face blowback for the political reputation of “Terrifier 3” — and a super-charged victory for the nonprofit. The organizers are easy to reach through their website, and no matter what happens at the box office, discussing Americans' everyday battles with the healthcare system can “destigmatize an issue that is certainly no fault of any patients,” he said. “The Toxic Avenger” is coming to digital release on September 30.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lori Harvey, the daughter of entertainment icon Steve Harvey, is bravely opening up about her health and a painful condition she has been suffering with since she was a teenager. In an interview on the “SheMD” podcast with Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi and Mary Alice Haney on Tuesday, September 16, Harvey discussed how receiving polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis diagnoses ended years of not knowing what she was struggling with and being dismissed by medical professionals. I've been going to my gynecologist because I've just been feeling like something's off in my body,” she said, People reports. I feel like something is just off. “I'm like, okay, something is not adding up here. Before learning of her diagnosis, Harvey felt “sad” and described the experience as “disheartening.” She continued, “I used to have the most excruciating periods of my life, every single time I felt like I needed to go to the hospital, just crazy cramps. And I'm like, ‘There's no way this is normal.' And [Aliabadi] told me, ‘Yeah, babe, you're right. It was not normal, and I'm so sorry that you've just been living with this.' A post shared by SHE MD Podcast (@shemdpodcast) Speaking out about her diagnosis and how she continued to push for answers can help raise awareness for endometriosis and help other women who find themselves experiencing similar symptoms. A clip from Harvey's interview was shared on the “SheMD” Instagram page on September 17, and fans used it as a way to show their support for the actress. “It's so frustrating how so many women's symptoms just get brushed aside as'“normal' you are your best advocate. So glad she kept pushing for more!” another person shared. “Omg… she literally explained it to the tee!” a third person wrote. “Explaining to different doctors and the making you feel like its just mundane and like I was making it a big deal.”</p>
