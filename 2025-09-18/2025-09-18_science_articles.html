                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andrew Daniels and John Gilpatrick discuss how your brain could fight to stay alive after your body gives up. Near-death experiences have fascinated people for decades, but now scientists are starting to think there's something even stranger going on: Right as the body shuts down, the brain might be kicking into overdrive, firing off one last burst of consciousness in a final push to stay alive. That's the mind-blowing idea behind one of Pop Mech's most-read recent stories, “A ‘Twilight Consciousness' May Exist in Dying Patients. Could That Mean Death Isn't Final?” In the story, scientists detail a huge spike in gamma brainwaves—those linked with memory, awareness, and sensory experience—after patients are declared clinically dead. Watch Andrew Daniels and John Gilpatrick break down the weird phenomenon of “twilight consciousness” and share a few stranger-than-fiction stories, like the man who woke up on the operating table just before his organs were harvested, and the 95-year-old woman who rose from her coffin after six days and made herself a bowl of porridge because she was hungry. Andrew and John also explore the deeper implications: Does your brain really make one last attempt to find a reason to live? What if we're seriously misjudging the moment of death entirely?

However, global projections remain incomplete, hindering effective policy interventions amid uncertain warming futures2. Here, we developed an interpretable machine learning framework to project global burned areas and wildfire emissions. This framework accounts for the impacts of future climate change on fire activity and quantifies associated premature deaths and radiative forcing from fire-induced particulate matter (PM2.5). Increased fire-related aerosols reduce the 0.06 W m⁻² cooling effect north of 60°N. Projections show a surge in premature deaths from wildfire smoke, reaching 1.40 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.66–2.25) million annually during 2095–2099, roughly 6 times higher than current levels. Africa is projected to experience the greatest rise in fire-related deaths (11-fold), driven by emission changes and an aging population.

Wildfire activity has increased in the US and is projected to accelerate under future climate change 1–3. However, our understanding of the impacts of climate change on wildfire activity, smoke, and health outcomes remains highly uncertain, due to the difficulty of modeling the causal chain from climate to wildfire to air pollution and health. We construct an ensemble of statistical and machine learning models that link climate to wildfire smoke PM2.5, and empirically estimate smoke PM2.5-mortality relationships using data on all recorded deaths in the US. We project that smoke PM2.5 could result in 71,420 excess deaths (95% CI: 34,930 - 98,430) per year by 2050 under a high warming scenario (SSP3-7.0) – a 73% increase relative to estimated 2011-2020 average annual excess deaths from smoke. We find evidence for mortality impacts of smoke PM2.5 that last up to three years after exposure. When monetized, climate-driven smoke deaths result in economic damages that exceed existing estimates of climate-driven damages from all other causes combined in the US 4,5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some Dogs Can Learn Categories like Human Toddlers Do These dogs can extend words to new objects based on function the way children do in early language learning Researchers found that some dogs can learn terms for functional categories, such as ‘pull' and ‘throw' toys. Her owners say she even knows her favorite foods' names; when pizza is on the menu, the word has to be whispered. Arya's gift made her a natural for a new Current Biology study showing that some dogs with unusually large vocabularies can go beyond simply memorizing names. All toys were different in size, shape and color, so appearance could not guide learning. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

After four weeks of training, brand-new toys that looked nothing like typical pulls or throws were introduced. This time, the dogs only experienced each toy's function (either tugging or fetching) during play; they were not taught words for any of them. “These gifted word-learner dogs are not only able to memorize the labels of many different objects, but can also extend a familiar word to new objects that share the same function, even if they look very different,” says study lead author Claudia Fugazza, an ethologist at Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary. Fugazza emphasizes that these animals are exceptional; most family dogs never build such vocabularies. She says the dogs' ease and flexibility applying words by function, similar to how human children begin extending their vocabularies, was surprising. Elika Bergelson, a Harvard University language scientist who was not part of the new study, says human infants “mostly rely on how things look. But by 14 months they can also use role or function—for instance, telling apart who is chasing and who is being chased in a scenario—to extend words” to new things, much like the dogs in the study did. In everyday life, function and appearance usually go together: all cups share a basic shape because it makes them good at holding liquid. “Taking away visual cues is a clean way to probe how categories might form across species.” “Because these dogs live in families and pick up words naturally,” Fugazza says, “their parallel to early child learning could offer scientists unique possibilities to explore how language-related abilities might have evolved—and how they can emerge in a nonlinguistic species.” Anirban Mukhopadhyay is an independent science journalist based in India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has announced a new way to reliably make element 116, livermorium. The results, made by using a titanium beam to irradiate a sample, could point toward the elusive “island of stability” for even heavier nuclear elements—and show researchers a route to create the next feasible element, number 120. Many of us remember a time when the periodic table appeared with some curious blank spots. Your age determines what those blank spots were, but they've been consistent, because discovery of elements has never been in full numerical order. Their availability has depended on location, stability, and accessibility of both the naturally occurring forms and a method to separate them. After a certain point, the elements transition from naturally occurring to laboratory-prepared. These elements may exist somewhere in the universe, but Earth is not cold enough, high-pressure enough, and so forth to create those conditions outside a lab. But inside labs like Berkeley, they use increasingly advanced technologies to jam more protons inside the nuclei of atoms in order to create these new elements. In their preprint paper, a large team of scientists explain that we've reached the limits of a current generation method to make new heavy elements. The heaviest discovery to date, element 118 oganesson, was made using a beam of calcium isotope 48 particles. Calcium 48, with its definitive 20 protons plus 28 neutrons, is a common and very effective starter for physical chemistry. While it's true that we only need to keep pumping protons into existing nuclei, the atoms we start with need to have a lot of protons in order to support that reaction. “Unfortunately, neither of these elements can be produced in sufficient quantities to produce a suitable target,” they write. So, what's a super heavy element enjoyer to do? The next big thing in physical chemistry, it seems, is titanium. Titanium 50 has 22 protons plus 28 neutrons and is very stable. If heavy element chemistry were a sports franchise, they won the world championships with calcium 48, and then had to take time to rebuild after everyone retired. Now, a new generation of players is ready to take over full time. You may wonder why these heavy elements are worth all this exploration and experimentation. The thing is, we just don't know yet what might happen when using these extraordinary and strange elements. Scientists want to find out, and that research could reveal properties and use cases we can't even dream of today—but we can only make a few atoms at a time, and they last for just microseconds before the protons spray back out of the nucleus. Cramming nuclei full of protons is inherently unstable because the protons act like the wrong ends of a magnet, but the island of stability may hold isotopes that last far longer without decaying. There are scientific explanations for this, including theories about layers of particles in the nucleus, and “magic numbers” of protons and neutrons that may be stable in combination. If we can find stable super heavy elements, scientists may be able to make much larger samples that can be subjected to more rigorous experimentation. Elements have always had the capacity to surprise us, like mercury, which is a liquid metal at room temperature; bismuth, which always repels magnets; and copper, which is responsible for almost a rainbow of naturally occurring colors by itself. We can only find out once there's enough to play with. The titanium 50 beam, or something similar inspired by it, could unearth the next half dozen elements—and one or more could be our stable holy grail.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What if it could solve all of our energy problems? We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Nestled between Hawaii and the western coast of Mexico lies the Pacific Ocean's Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 4.5 million-kilometer-square area of abyssal plain bordered by the Clarion and Clipperton Fracture Zones. Although this stretch of sea is a vibrant ecosystem filled with marine life, the CCZ is known best for its immense collection of potato-sized rocks known as polymetallic nodules. These rocks, of which there are potentially trillions, are filled with rich deposits of nickel, manganese, copper, zinc, cobalt. However, a study reports that these nodules might be much more than simply a collection of valuable materials for electric cars—they also produce oxygen 4,000 meters below the surface where sunlight can't reach. The rocks could also rewrite the script on not only how life began on this planet, but also its potential to take hold on other worlds within our Solar System, such as Enceladus or Europa. “For aerobic life to begin on the planet,” Andrew Sweetman, deep-sea ecologist with the Scottish Association for Marine Science and lead author of the study said in a press statement, “there had to be oxygen and our understanding has been that Earth's oxygen supply began with photosynthetic organisms. I think we therefore need to revisit questions like: where could aerobic life have begun?” Taking note of the nodule's “battery in a rock” tagline, Sweetman wondered if the minerals found in these nodules were somehow acting as a kind of “geobattery” by separating hydrogen and oxygen via seawater electrolysis. A 2023 study showed that various bacteria and archaea can create “dark oxygen,” so Sweetman and his team recreated the conditions of the CCZ in a laboratory and killed off any microorganisms with mercury chloride—surprisingly, oxygen levels continued rising. According to Scientific American, Sweetman found a voltage of roughly 0.95 volts on the surface of these nodules, likely charging up as they grow with different deposits growing irregularly throughout, and this natural charge is enough to split the seawater. However, 25 countries want the governing body—the International Seabed Authority (ISA) Council—to implement a moratorium, or at the very least a precautionary pause, so more research can be conducted to see how mining these nodules could affect the ocean. This is especially vital considering that the world's seas are already facing a litany of climate challenges, including acidification, deoxygenation, and pollution. In response to this discovery, Scripps Institution of Oceanography's Lisa Levin, who wasn't involved with the study, highlighted why such a moratorium is so important for protecting these deep-sea nodules in a comment to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition: The ISA is still negotiating with key players on deep-sea mining regulations. So while the future of the world's oceans is approaching a critical moment of conservation or exploitation, science has proven once again that disrupting these ecosystems could have consequences we can't even imagine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ocean is a wondrous place—let's keep our waste out of it. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. The idea did not go according to plan, a disconcerting prospect with an estimated half a million barrels still underwater today. Armed with the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) SuBastian aboard the research vessel Falkor, scientists from UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography took a closer look at these barrels littering the ocean floor and found something distressing. There appeared to be a ghostly halo emanating from many of them, suggesting something was leaking out into the ocean environment. While the researchers were expecting to find concentrations of DDT—a pesticide that serves as the main chemical antagonist of Rachel Carson's famous book Silent Spring, and whose use is now illegal in the U.S.—they instead discovered that the halos were created from alkaline caustic waste that form an extremophile environment. “DDT was not the only thing that was dumped in this part of the ocean and we have only a very fragmented idea of what else was dumped there,” Johanna Gutleben, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. Nobody was thinking about alkaline waste before this and we may have to start looking for other things as well.” The halos formed a thick, concrete-like crust, which was difficult for the ROV to collect using coring devices. Instead, the SuBastian relied on its robotic arm to tear off pieces for further analysis. Where this high pH material meets seawater at the edges, it forms calcium carbonate—the chalky, outer edge of the halo. “It's shocking that 50-plus years later you're still seeing these effects,” Paul Jensen, another co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “We can't quantify the environmental impact without knowing how many of these barrels with white halos are out there, but it's clearly having a localized impact on microbes.” Whether its DDT, caustic waste, microplastics, trash, or other kinds of refuse, the mindset of viewing the ocean as the world's dumping ground is one that's sadly still alive and well to this day.

An important effect is the disruption of natural resource supply by climate-mediated disturbances such as wildfires, pest outbreaks and storms. Here we show that disturbance-induced losses for Europe's timber-based forestry could increase from the current €115 billion to €247 billion under severe climate change. This would diminish the timber value of Europe's forests by up to 42% and reduce the current gross value added of the forestry sector by up to 15%. Central Europe emerges as a continental hotspot of disturbance costs, with projected future costs of up to €19,885 per hectare. Simultaneous climate-related increases in forest productivity could offset future economic losses from disturbances in Northern and Central Europe but not in Southern Europe. We find high disturbance-related cost of unmitigated warming, highlighting that climate change adaptation in forestry is not only an ecological but also an economic imperative. Climate change has strong impacts on global ecosystems1,2. These impacts are likely to result in high economic costs for society3. Recent studies estimated economic losses related to climate impacts on global ecosystems to several trillion dollars4, with income reductions of 19%5, several hundred billions of dollars needed to compensate for loss and damage6, and reductions in the gross domestic product of 1.2% per 1 °C increase in global mean temperature7. In particular, the already observed8 and projected future9,10,11 increases in frequency and intensity of extreme events, such as droughts, wildfires and floods, have severe consequences for the global economy4,12. Forest ecosystems are particularly prone to climatic extremes because trees are sessile and long lived13,14. As forest products are central to a bio-based economy15,16,17, changing extreme events pose a major challenge for a wider use of bio-based materials. A major concern in this regard are forest disturbances, that is, large-scale pulses of tree mortality from wildfires, pest outbreaks and storms18,19. Forest disturbances have increased in frequency and severity in many parts of the globe in recent decades20,21 and are expected to further increase under continued climate change22. A hotspot of changing forest disturbances is Europe, where disturbance rates doubled in less than 20 years for major disturbance agents20, and a massive recent pulse of tree mortality was unprecedented in at least 170 years23. Societies in Europe are strongly dependent on forests for providing jobs, supporting rural livelihoods, and contributing to environmental and economic well-being24. Yet, the continental-scale economic impacts of climate-mediated disturbances remain unclear so far. Understanding the economic impacts of disturbances is complex, as interactions with other climate-induced changes have to be considered. For instance, climate change affects forest productivity, with decreases projected for water-limited regions25 but broad-scale increases expected due to CO2 fertilization25,26,27 and an extension of the growing season particularly in boreal and mountain ecosystems28,29. Changing forest productivity interacts with disturbance costs: increasing productivity increases the growing stock, which in turn enhances the timber value of forests. Simultaneously, productivity-related increases in harvest levels lead to higher returns that might partly or completely offset the economic costs of increasing disturbances30,31. These interactions require a joint evaluation of the economic consequences of changing disturbance and productivity30,31. Here we present an estimate of the current and future economic costs of forest disturbances at continental scale, accounting for climate-mediated changes in both forest productivity and disturbance in Europe. Specifically, we investigated the historical costs of disturbance on the timber-based forest value (under the climate conditions of the reference period 1981–2005) and how they are likely to evolve under scenarios of future climate change (representing the climate conditions expected for the period 2076–2100). We assessed hotspots of economic disturbance impact in Europe and whether increasing forest productivity can offset economic losses from disturbance under climate change. To address our questions, we coupled three crucial elements, (1) spatially explicit (16 ×16 km) forest growth simulations at the level of individual tree species, (2) >150,000 Monte Carlo simulations of forest disturbances informed by latest remote sensing data and (3) economic models to quantify the costs of changing productivity and disturbance across continental Europe focusing on the commercially most relevant species (a total of 91 million ha, or two-thirds of Europe's forest area). We studied a total of 1,536 scenarios under three different representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario families and quantified the cost of disturbance by comparing scenario simulations to the counterfactual of simulations without disturbance under the same climate conditions. Economic effects were quantified by converting simulated time series of planned (that is, business-as-usual management) and unplanned (that is, disturbance-related) timber harvests to economic cashflow, which was subsequently discounted and summed to obtain forest value (Extended Data Fig. We translated the present value of total disturbance costs into annual costs by multiplying with a discount rate of 1.5%. Disturbances are discrete events in space and time, and averaging over extended spatiotemporal scales masks their immediate local effects12. Hence, we report costs for both the average (mean across all stochastic simulations) and the extreme case (defined as the average of the worst 5% of simulations, conditional value at risk), with the latter being particularly informative for planning under the precautionary principle32. Under historical conditions (1981–2005), the economic costs of natural disturbances in Europe (loss of forest values) were €115 ± 3 billion (mean ± s.d., Fig. 1), with an average annual cost of €1,729 ± 48 million yr−1 and an average cost per unit area of €1,265 ± 35 ha−1. These costs were the result of on average 74.5 million m3 of timber disturbed per year (Table 1). Disturbances reduced the total forest value of Europe by 28.6 ± 0.7% compared with the counterfactual of no disturbance. Under climate change, total future timber harvest increased by 17.1%, from 259.6 to 304.1 million m3 yr−1 (for the period 2076–2100) under scenario RCP4.5 (increases of 12.9% and 28.0% under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively), resulting from both increasing productivity (increasing planned harvest) and increasing disturbance (increasing unplanned harvest; Table 1). Distinct increases in unplanned, that is, disturbance-induced, harvests increased costs of disturbance to €186 ± 8 billion under RCP4.5, and up to €247 ± 15 billion under RCP8.5 (RCP2.6: €146 ± 3 billion). This reduced the potential forest value relative to the counterfactual of no disturbance by up to 42.1 ± 2.5%, and translated to average annual costs of €2,783 ± 116 million yr−1 under RCP4.5 (RCP2.6: €2,191 ± 42 million yr−1; RCP8.5: €3,711 ± 218 million yr−1), and average costs per unit area of €2,037 ± 85 ha−1 (RCP2.6: €1,603 ± 31 ha−1; RCP8.5: €2,715 ± 160 ha−1). Simulating a moderate shortening of the rotation period by 10 years as a measure to adapt to changing climate and disturbance regimes reduced the cost of disturbance by up to €10 billion under scenario RCP8.5 (Extended Data Fig. All economic results were sensitive to varying discount rates, with higher costs of disturbance at lower discount rates (Extended Data Fig. Different climate model projections within the same RCP family resulted in similar trajectories (Extended Data Fig. Bars show the timber-based forest value losses from disturbances relative to the counterfactual of undisturbed forest development under the same climate scenario. across all simulations (N = 300). ‘Historical' assumes climate conditions from 1981–2005, while RCP scenarios are for projected future climate conditions for the period 2076–2100. The economic costs of natural disturbances varied widely across Europe (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 1). Hotspots of future disturbance costs were mainly located in Central Europe (especially in parts of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic; Fig. 2c), where disturbances lowered the economic value of forests on average by €3,233 ha−1 under moderate climate change (RCP4.5), and €2,460 ha−1 and €4,375 ha−1 under mild (RCP2.6) and severe (RCP8.5) climate change, respectively (Fig. Extreme costs in this region (that is, the average of the economically worst 5% of simulations, conditional value at risk) were €17,067 ha−1 under RCP4.5 (€13,932 ha−1 and €19,885 ha−1 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively). In contrast to the high disturbance costs in Central Europe, forests in Northern Europe had 60–65% lower economic costs of disturbance, with average losses of €1,164 ha−1 under RCP4.5 (€966 ha−1 and €1,523 ha−1 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively). Nonetheless, local extremes were also high in Northern Europe, exceeding €10,000 ha−1 (RCP2.6: €9,747 ha−1, RCP4.5: €12,370 ha−1, RCP8.5: €14,664 ha−1, Extended Data Table 1). Generally, the continental-scale differences in disturbance costs decreased when considering extreme values (Fig. Disturbance costs in Southern Europe (Fig. 2c) were between those in Northern and Central Europe (Extended Data Table 1). The colour of each point represents the cost per hectare of forest within a 16 × 16 km cell, and the size of each point corresponds to the forested area within that cell. a, Average disturbance costs across all simulations. b, Extreme costs, expressed as the mean over the 5% scenarios with the highest costs.

The increase in forest productivity under climate change (Table 1) overcompensated the economic losses from disturbances in Europe overall, but regional variation was high. The productivity-related increase in forest value can be attributed to two effects: higher initial growing stocks and increased sustainable harvest levels from elevated tree growth (Extended Data Fig. These effects were strongest under scenario RCP8.5, yet in this scenario, disturbance-induced losses also increased most strongly (Fig. The economic effects of productivity and disturbance increased at similar rates across climate scenarios, resulting in little variation in overall forest value with climate change (RCP2.6: €337.9 ± 12.6 billion, RCP4.5: €328.6 ± 20.8 billion, RCP8.5: €340.8 ± 34.9 billion). However, scenario uncertainty was lowest under RCP2.6 and increased considerably with increasing severity of climate change (Fig. Productivity-related offsets of disturbance losses varied distinctly across Europe. In Northern Europe, economic gains from increasing productivity clearly outweighed disturbance-mediated losses under climate change (Fig. In contrast, productivity stagnated or declined in Southern Europe while disturbances increased, resulting in decreasing net forest values under climate change. In Central Europe, productivity was projected to increase, albeit at a lower rate than in Northern Europe. Here, economic losses from disturbances are compensated by gains in productivity, yet the offset capacity decreases with increasing severity of climate change (Fig. Only under the mild climate scenario RCP2.6 was the forest value of all European regions (and 92% of all European countries, Extended Data Fig. 6) projected to increase relative to historical levels, when considering the net effects of both changing productivity and disturbance. a,c, Changes in forest value at the continental (a) and regional (c) scale under future climate compared to historical values.

In all panels, data show the mean ± s.d. across all simulations in the respective stratum. Regions were defined as in Fig. Icons in a adapted from OpenMoji (https://openmoji.org/) under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 licence. Here we provide a continental-scale estimate of forest disturbance costs for Europe. Our findings suggest that disturbance costs could more than double under climate change. Under severe climate change, the annual losses estimated here correspond to up to 15% of the current gross value added of the forestry sector in Europe24. We furthermore highlight considerable differences in the economic costs of forest disturbances throughout Europe, identifying particular hotspots in Central Europe. Local-scale studies from this region show that disturbance costs could be even higher than estimated here, when only considering disturbance impacts on the economically most valuable tree species32. Nonetheless, our results of disturbance-based losses on the timber-based forest value of up to €19,885 ha−1 suggest that disturbances could posit major economic challenges for timber-based forestry in the future. Our results also indicate that simultaneous increases in forest productivity under climate change could offset economic losses from increasing disturbances. The finding that Northern Europe is the main beneficiary of climate change, with increasing forest values in Europe's boreal zone, is in agreement with previous studies on the economic effects of climate change33. In contrast, the timber-based forest value in Southern Europe is already considerably lower than in other parts of the continent24 and will decrease further under climate change. The negative impacts of climate change on Southern Europe identified here correspond well with previous assessments9,25,33,34. Important limitations need to be considered when interpreting our results. First, our estimates of the cost of disturbances are likely conservative, because we only focused on timber-related forest values. Although timber remains the main marketable good from forests throughout Europe, disturbances have broad impacts beyond timber35, and the societal costs of disturbance impacts on non-marketable ecosystem services were not considered here. Similarly, we focused on the economically most important tree species and did not study the effect of tree species change in response to changing climatic conditions. More broadly, the consideration of alternative silvicultural strategies was beyond the scope of our analysis. Rather, we assumed even-aged management as the most widely used silvicultural strategy across the continent24,36,37 and considered local differences in productivity and their effect on rotation periods. While this approach is not able to capture the full variability of forest management regimes applied in Europe24,36, it approximates the dominant management of the simulated tree species well36,38, and provides a robust and consistent baseline for quantifying continental-scale disturbance costs. We also omitted income from thinning, likely underestimating Europe's forest value. However, previous studies showed that considering thinnings does not substantially reduce disturbance costs32. The increasing volatility resulting from disturbances may also drive risk-averse forest owners to exit the market39, which can have considerable economic effects beyond the ones considered here. Moreover, we only incorporated the three most important forest disturbance agents in Europe, namely, wildfires, windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks. The advent of novel disturbances such as invasive alien pests and pathogens could considerably alter future disturbance regimes at the continental scale40 and further increase economic costs of disturbance. Another important assumption in our analysis is that some of the disturbed timber is salvage harvested and thus enters the timber market. This is the current default management response to disturbances in Europe41,42, yet the practice is increasingly criticized for its ecological impacts43,44. Lower salvage rates would likely further increase the economic costs of forest disturbances32,43. While our quantification of disturbance costs is likely conservative, the estimate of the compensatory effect of increasing productivity might be optimistic. Productivity gains offset disturbance losses because they simultaneously increase initial forest values and periodic returns in our analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5), yet the assumptions with regard to initial values are uncertain (that is, similar forest age structure at higher productivity levels). Furthermore, effects of reduced water use efficiency45 or acclimation effects in response to elevated CO246 were not considered here. In fact, recent studies already indicate declining forest growth even in some areas of Northern Europe47. While we here used best available modelling approaches at continental scale, these uncertainties call for further research on economic effects of both changing productivity and disturbance34,48. The high economic costs of disturbance identified here have important implications for forest policy and management. First, losses from disturbances need to be considered more explicitly in forest planning and the economic valuation of different forest management strategies. While even-aged coniferous forests were propagated throughout Europe on the basis of economic grounds in the past, these considerations ignored the substantial disturbance risk of these silvicultural systems13,49, and hence also the associated costs. As disturbances are likely to increase further under climate change, future considerations of forest planning and management need to explicitly account for their impacts50. Second, we show that considerable adaptation efforts are needed to reduce disturbance impacts in Europe's forests. While these efforts (including measures such as planting less disturbance-prone tree species and managing for structured and mixed forests49,51) require resources, they will also reduce disturbance risk49,51 and thus disturbance-related costs. This highlights that there is not only an ecological but also an economical imperative to climate change adaptation in forestry. We show that moderately reducing rotation lengths might reduce disturbance costs, illustrating the potential of climate change adaptation measures in silviculture. However, such measures could also have unintended consequences on other ecosystem services such as forest carbon storage and habitat value36,52, and should thus only be applied after careful consideration of local trade-offs. Efforts should particularly focus on hotspots of disturbance impacts in Central and Southern Europe, where the expected rise in disturbance-related costs could become increasingly prohibitive for regular forest management in the absence of adaptive measures. Lastly, our results underline the importance of climate change mitigation. Only when climate change was limited to mild levels (scenario RCP2.6) did net positive economic effects of changing productivity and disturbance emerge throughout the European continent. In contrast, largely unmitigated climate change (scenario RCP8.5) could lead to severe economic losses from disturbances, particularly in Southern and Central Europe. We thus conclude that mitigating climate change can avoid substantial disturbance-related costs in the forestry sector. We modelled forest development explicitly for 16 × 16 km grid cells across Europe at 10-year time steps using a matrix model (Extended Data Fig. In each grid cell, we considered the forested area of the four economically most important tree species in Europe38, namely, European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and deciduous oaks (Quercus robur L. and Quercus petraea Matt. Together, these species account for more than 95% of the European timber market53 and two-thirds of Europe's forest area (91 million hectares). Stand age distributions were extracted from an analysis based on remote sensing54, and tree species shares for each 10-year age-class bin were considered proportional to the species composition at grid-cell level. For each 16 × 16 km grid cell, the forest area was thus distributed to 104 classes (4 tree species × 26 age classes). For the sake of parsimony and to consistently compare the effects of disturbance and productivity change across Europe, we assumed a single silvicultural system for all simulated forests. As the clear-cut system is still the dominant silvicultural system in Europe for the tree species considered here24,36,37, we simulated even-aged stand development followed by clear cutting and planting. We accounted for local variation in management intensity across Europe by deriving rotation lengths at the cell level. Specifically, we calculated economically optimal rotation lengths (that is, the age of final cutting that maximizes forest value) contingent on tree species and local site productivity for each cell (see Supplementary Table 1 and section ‘Calculation of the economically optimal rotation age' in Supplementary Methods for more details). For the calculation of optimal rotation lengths, we assumed timber production to start from bare ground and we disregarded disturbances. Forest managers are actively adapting their management to the emerging changes in environmental conditions. While a comprehensive assessment of the economic effects of climate change adaptation measures is beyond the scope of our analysis, we considered two elements of climate change adaptation in our simulations: First, we simulated an adaptation of optimal rotation periods to the emerging changes in productivity under climate change. This was implemented by deriving optimal rotation periods separately for each climate scenario and grid cell (see section ‘Climate data' in Supplementary Methods for more details). Thus, rotation periods are effectively shortened in locations where productivity increases, and rotation periods are extended in areas where productivity decreases, simulating dynamic adaptation of managers to changing environmental conditions. Second, we tested the effect of adapting the rotation length from its local economic optimum value in a sensitivity analysis, varying rotation period length by up to ±20 years from the economic optimum (Extended Data Fig. In Europe, reducing rotation period length is a measure that is frequently discussed in the context of dampening the impacts of disturbances52,55, while extending rotation periods can increase forest carbon storage and habitat value36. Thinnings were disregarded in our simulations32, and we simulated no tree species change, that is, species were replanted in their current proportions after final harvesting or disturbance (but see refs. We assessed the effect of climate change by considering two time slices, one representing historical climate (1981–2005) and one future climate (2076–2100). For each time slice, we simulated 500 years of forest development starting from current forest conditions, with climate conditions averaged for each time slice. We chose this approach over transient scenario simulations as it better quantifies the long-term economic consequences of changing climate and disturbance regimes, given that discounting in economic analyses strongly reduces the weight of future changes in transient analyses. We chose a simulation period of 500 years, as it contains multiple rotations, and aggregated cash flows beyond this period have little influence on the forest value because of discounting. Additional to the time slice representing historical climate, we considered 3 climate scenarios (representing different radiative forcing levels, that is, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 from CMIP5) each derived from 3 different climate models, downscaled to our 16 × 16 km grid cells (for details see section ‘Climate data' in Supplementary Methods). This resulted in 12 different climate scenarios considered in the analyses. Climate affected both productivity and disturbance in the simulations, as described in the following paragraphs. Forest productivity and its response to climate change was quantified by dynamically simulating the potential net primary productivity (NPP) per grid cell and species. Potential NPP was defined as the NPP of a fully stocked pure stand of a species under a given climate, during the stand development stage in which tree growth culminates. Potential NPP for each grid cell and scenario was estimated using a deep neural network trained on data generated by the process-based simulation model iLand57,58. To derive training data for the deep neural network, we used iLand to simulate NPP values of the four tree species across the full climate and soil gradients of Europe and under the 12 different climate scenarios considered. In iLand, NPP increases with temperature (as long as temperatures are below optimal temperatures for photosynthesis) and atmospheric CO2 concentration, while water availability (in the atmosphere and soil) and plant-available nitrogen limit the carbon uptake of trees (a detailed description of iLand and the mechanisms used to calculate NPP can be found in refs. 57,58 and on the model website https://iland-model.org). We ran simulations on the basis of daily climate data for each climate scenario (see section ‘Climate data' in Supplementary Methods) and extracted the resulting annual NPP values. We developed a feedforward convolutional deep neural network with 13 layers and 189,000 trainable parameters. We subsequently trained the deep neural network on 14 million datapoints derived from iLand to predict annual potential NPP values for the four tree species under study, contingent on the soil and climate conditions prevailing at a grid cell (see section ‘Forest productivity under climate change' in Supplementary Methods). The deep neural network was well able to learn the responses of the underlying process-based model and generalized well between climate change scenarios. Predicted potential NPP values for current climate conditions were evaluated against independent observations from satellite data (see section ‘Forest productivity under climate change' in Supplementary Methods). To derive merchantable timber volume in our matrix model simulations, we used species-specific yield table estimates (see section ‘Yield tables' in Supplementary Methods for more details), dynamically calculating the respective yield class from potential NPP values per cell. Specifically, we used a quadratic link function to capture the nonlinear relationship between NPP and yield class (see section ‘Mapping of NPP values to yield tables' in Supplementary Methods), assuming correspondence between the range of potential NPP values predicted in simulations under historical climate and the range of yield class values covered in yield tables. In this way, we combined the robust estimates of merchantable timber volume from yield tables with dynamically simulated productivity changes under climate change, resulting in realistic projections of future timber production at cell level. To comprehensively assess the impact of natural disturbances, we considered two types of disturbances in the simulation: first, climate-sensitive ‘background' disturbances were derived on the basis of statistical survival probabilities estimated on the basis of continental-scale forest inventory data59 (see section ‘Background disturbances' in Supplementary Methods). This disturbance type represents small- to medium-scale events that happen regularly (for example, small-scale mortality from drought or insect infestations, small-scale windthrow), but do not lead to larger-scale economic implications such as market crashes. They were sensitive to changing mean annual temperature, maximum temperature of the warmest month, minimum temperature of the coldest month, annual precipitation sum and precipitation sum of the warmest quarter in our simulations59. For each grid cell and tree species, we simulated these disturbances within each time step by resetting a proportion of the cell's area to age class zero and replanting the area, with the proportion affected by disturbance derived from a climate-sensitive hazard probability function59. Second, to account for economic risks from rare but large disturbance events, we simulated stochastic, landscape-scale extreme events, such as severe fires, windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks, using biome-specific remote sensing data60,61,62. Extreme events were defined for each scenario as those affecting more than twice the area disturbed in an average year of the scenario. To estimate the occurrence of such extreme disturbance events, we first calculated historical biome-specific average disturbance rates (1986–2005). We subsequently developed scenarios of potential future changes in average disturbance rates based on expected increases in drought intensity and frequency in Europe2, as well as on other best available estimates for future disturbance change20,22 and the already observed responses to recent climate change (Supplementary Table 2). On the basis of these analyses, we assumed mean disturbance increases by a factor of 2, 4 and 6, respectively, for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and investigated the sensitivity of our results to a wide range of different potential future disturbance changes (Supplementary Figs. Subsequently, the specific frequencies and magnitudes of extreme events were derived using Taylor's power law equations fit to remote sensing data63 (Supplementary Fig. 1), estimating the temporal variance of disturbance rates per agent and biome under historical and increased future mean disturbance rates. The occurrence of extreme events in a simulated time step was determined at the level of biomes by drawing from Poisson distributions. The affected area in each biome was calculated by multiplying the number of extreme events in each time step by their magnitude. Affected cells were then drawn randomly until the estimated disturbed area was reached. In disturbed cells, depending on the disturbance agent (see section ‘Extreme disturbances' in Supplementary Methods), all or most of the forest area was reset to age class zero. Revenues from timber-based forest management were calculated from tree diameter- and species-dependent timber prices and establishment costs53 (Extended Data Table 2). Revenues were discounted and summed over the whole simulation period to quantify forest value32,53 (default discount rate of 1.5%, but see Extended Data Fig. 3 for a sensitivity analysis of different discount rates). Simulated increases in productivity under climate change influenced forest value via increased timber harvests, which positively affected forest value. Simulated disturbances had a range of nuanced economic impacts in the simulation (Extended Data Table 3). For climate-sensitive background disturbances, we assumed that the impacted timber is sold with a 50% decrease in net revenue due to a loss of timber quality and increased harvesting costs (see section ‘Prices' in Supplementary Methods). For extreme disturbance events, revenues from disturbed timber were set to zero for the affected grid cell, assuming a collapse of the timber market in the region as a result of large quantities of disturbed timber flooding the market32. For extreme events, planting costs for the next cohort of trees were assumed to increase by a factor of two, to reflect higher post-disturbance expenses from planting large areas and to account for typical shortages in nurseries after large disturbance events. To assess the sensitivity of our results to additional market effects of disturbances (that is, price drops from extreme disturbance events radiating out to larger areas), we conducted an auxiliary analysis in which we reduced the timber prices of regular harvests in cells adjacent to those affected by extreme disturbance events (see section ‘Prices' in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. To account for the stochastic nature of disturbances, we used Monte Carlo simulations32 to consider a wide range of potential future disturbance impacts. This method involved running multiple simulations for each studied scenario. Within each simulation, different random disturbance events were generated to capture a wide range of disturbance sequences and their corresponding economic outcomes. This allowed us to quantify the variability of the economic impacts of disturbances. Monte Carlo approaches have been widely used in economics and ecology64,65,66,67, and are particularly suited to capture the impacts of highly variable events32. Specifically, we ran 100 Monte Carlo simulations for each scenario and cell with different random numbers used for (1) drawing extreme disturbance events in each time step and (2) choosing which cells are affected by these events. To assess the economic impact of disturbances, we calculated losses as the average difference in economic value between simulations with and without disturbances across all simulations. In other words, simulations without disturbances in the respective climate scenarios served as the counterfactual to quantify the economic impacts of disturbance. Since disturbances, particularly extreme events, disproportionately impact the fat tail of skewed economic damage distributions (Supplementary Fig. 2), and mean comparisons cannot fully capture the effects of increasing frequencies of rare events12, we also analysed extreme values from our Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, for each scenario and simulated cell, we calculated the average of the worst 5% of economic losses across all Monte Carlo runs (conditional value at risk). To transform losses in net present value into annual costs, we calculated an annuity by multiplying the losses by the assumed discount rate of the simulation (1.5%). Regional analyses were conducted for European regions as suggested in the Forest Europe report24 (Fig. Within each region, hotspot areas were defined as cells above the 99th percentile of all values in that region (Extended Data Table 1). To estimate economic costs per unit forest area, the total costs were divided by the forested area for each cell. We successfully evaluated our simulation approach against independent data for several key metrics. The simulated standing timber volume and annual timber extraction rates under historical climate matched observed values well (Supplementary Figs. The model estimated that 28.7% of the annual timber harvest was due to natural disturbances under historical climate, which amounted to 74.5 million m3 timber yr−1 (Table 1). These values are well within the range of empirical data from recent decades, reporting 42.6–78.5 million m3 of timber disturbed annually and 12%–32% of unplanned canopy openings from disturbances relative to the total harvested timber volume for the period 1986–200520,68. These results highlight the robustness of our simulations; full details of the evaluations conducted are provided in Supplementary Methods (see sections ‘Standing timber volume' and ‘Amount of extracted timber'). We used TensorFlow69 in combination with Keras API70 in Python for implementing the deep neural network.

Publisher's note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations. We initialized the simulated forests (16 ×16 km grid cells) using recent species distribution maps38 and age class information extrapolated from NFI data for continental Europe54. Forest growth was simulated based on soil- and climate-sensitive NPP estimates for each tree species, derived from a deep neural network trained on simulations of a process-based forest growth model. NPP values were mapped to yield tables to obtain information on merchantable timber volume and mean tree diameter. We simulated an even-aged clear-cut system (pictograms in top row), with the rotation length varying between cells. To calculate optimal rotation length per cell, we converted extracted timber volumes into economic cashflow and computed the net present value for each possible rotation length (from 0 to 260 years in 10-year intervals), assuming a discount rate of 1.5%. The optimal rotation length was defined as the one that maximizes net present value. After final harvest, we assumed the area was regenerated with the same tree species. To quantify the effect of disturbances, we explicitly simulated two types of disturbances: First, climate-sensitive, background disturbances derived from empirically parameterized hazard probabilities59 (center row), and second, stochastic extreme disturbance events informed by observations from remote sensing61 and scaled to future scenarios using Taylor's power law equations63 (bottom row). In the event of a disturbance, the revenues from timber were reduced for background disturbances, and set to zero for extreme disturbances, representing the combined effects of market price responses, wood devaluation, and increased harvesting costs in the wake of disturbances32. Changing rotation periods from their economic optimal values can be used in silviculture to reduce disturbance risks, and to improve other forest functions such as forest carbon storage and habitat value. Changes in the rotation period have two effects: (1) they result in economic losses because the rotation period is no longer at its economically optimal value (blue bars), and (2) they affect the economic costs of disturbance (orange bars). Bars indicate average values, whileE error bars indicate the standard deviation (N = 300), and points are the net effect and its standard deviation of both economic implications. A positive net effect means an overall increase in forest values compared to default rotation lengths. Lower discount rates decrease forest value due to higher costs of disturbance. The overall effect of climate change on the costs of disturbance is apparent for all evaluated discount rates and climate models used. Each bar indicates the average disturbance costs (N = 300 for panel ‘All', N = 100 for each climate model), while the error bars show the average costs ± the standard deviation of simulated costs. The ‘All' panels include results of all simulated climate models. Raw data is shown as points. The color of each point represents the cost per hectare of forest within a 16 by 16 km cell, and the size of each point corresponds to the forested area within that cell. Panel (a) shows average disturbance costs across all simulations, while panel (b) indicates extreme values, expressed as the mean over the 5% highest costs. For visibility, only cells with a forest cover of at least 5 % are displayed. For comparability with Fig. 3, we kept the color scale the same as in Fig. We note, however, that 0.1% of the extreme disturbance costs under RCP8.5 are beyond the color scale used.

Changes in forest value at the continental (a) and regional (c) scale under future climate compared to historical values as in Fig. Blue bars represent losses due to increasing disturbances, green bars show gains from increasing productivity. Productivity-related gains are attributed to effects on initial growing stock (derived relative to growing stock levels under historical productivity) – indicated by the transparent portions of the bars – and effects related to increased sustainable harvest levels over the simulation period (solid portion of the bars). Dots indicate the net change in forest value compared to historical values. Dots within the transparent area of the bars indicate high uncertainty of net positive economic effects, as economic effects would turn negative in these cases if initial forest values were to remain constant with increasing productivity. Continental (b) and regional (d) forest values under different climate scenarios as in Fig. Gains due to a productivity-related increase in initial forest value are indicated as the transparent portion of the bars. In all panels, data show the mean ± s.d. across all simulations (N = 300) in the respective stratum.

(2025)Cite this article Differences in risk factor exposure and access to prevention resources have led to unequal health outcomes for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) globally. Recent studies elucidate the health benefits of arts participation, but no systematic reviews have focused on NCD prevention and health promotion. Here we share results of a mixed-methods systematic review that included 95 studies of arts programs, practices and activities, addressing NCD risk factors across 27 countries. We found that most reported outcomes were related to physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, mental health, and systemic, structural and social drivers of health. Our findings suggest that the arts may support NCDs prevention and health promotion by generating cultural relevance, providing opportunities for increased physical activity and social connectedness and by helping to identify and address systemic, structural and social forces contributing to health disparities and inequities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If detected early, it can be efficiently treated, but the cost and discomfort of colonoscopies -- the main diagnostic method currently in use -- often result in delayed diagnosis. This inventory was then used to detect the presence of colorectal cancer according to the bacteria present in simple stool samples, a non-invasive and low-cost screening tool. Colorectal cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage when treatment options are limited. While it has long been known that gut microbiota plays a role in the development of colorectal cancer, translating these findings into clinical practice has proven challenging. "The subspecies resolution is specific and can capture the differences in how bacteria function and contribute to diseases including cancer, while remaining general enough to detect these changes among different groups of individuals, populations, or countries." The first step was to analyse huge amounts of data. "As a bioinformatician, the challenge was to come up with an innovative approach for mass data analysis," recalls Matija Trickovic, PhD student in the laboratory of Mirko Trajkovski and first author of this study. "We successfully developed the first comprehensive catalogue of human gut microbiota subspecies, together with a precise and efficient method to use it both for research and in the clinic." "Our method detected 90% of cancer cases, a result very close to the 94% detection rate achieved by colonoscopies and better than all current non-invasive detection methods." It could become a routine screening tool and facilitate the early detection of colorectal cancer, which would then be confirmed by colonoscopy but only in a selected group of patients. "The same method could soon be used to develop non-invasive diagnostic tools for a wide range of diseases, all based on a single microbiota analysis," concludes Mirko Trajkovski.
