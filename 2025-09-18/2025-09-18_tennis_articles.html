Britain's Sonay Kartal opened the tie with a strong start, racing to a 4-0 lead against Japan's Ena Shibahara before closing out the first set 6-3. 55, then dominated Japan's Moyuka Uchijima 6-1, 6-2 in the second singles to secure her nation's place in the last four. 92, struggled to find rhythm as Boulter's solid baseline play proved too strong.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top seed Iga Swiatek stayed perfect against Sorana Cirstea to reach the Korea Open 2025 presented by Motiva quarterfinals on her tournament debut, while Ella Seidel dethroned defending champion Beatriz Haddad Maia in the third-longest match of 2025 so far. 1 seed Iga Swiatek made a victorious debut at the Korea Open 2025 presented by Motiva on Thursday, defeating Sorana Cirstea 6-3, 6-2 to post her sixth win in six meetings with the Romanian -- and afterwards, she revealed the family connection that made it extra special. Swiatek's father, Tomasz, was a rower who competed in the men's quadruple sculls event at one Olympic Games -- Seoul 1988. This may be his daughter's first time in the city, but she's been hearing about it for all of her life. "The Olympics in 1988 were the highlight of his career, and he's been telling us stories about it since me and my sister were kids," Swiatek said in her on-court interview. "So I'm happy to explore this city -- he's been talking about being here as a great adventure. Playing here for sure is an honor, and maybe next year my dad will come!" Playing her first match since losing in the US Open quarterfinals to Amanda Anisimova, Swiatek got off to a fast start against an opponent to whom she has only ever dropped one set -- the first set of their first meeting back at the 2022 Australian Open. She hammered a pair of forehand winners en route to breaking Cirstea in the first game, and swiftly built a 5-1 lead. Cirstea still battled hard, saving the first five points against her with fine serving and getting one of the breaks back as Swiatek lapsed into error -- but another forehand winner from the Pole sealed her sixth set point. In the second set, Swiatek still had to navigate a few untidy moments -- she tallied 19 winners to 21 unforced errors overall -- but nonetheless saved all three break points against her, and converted her first match point as Cirstea sent a forehand long. Swiatek advanced to her 13th quarterfinal in 15 tournaments this year (excluding team competitions). She will next face a fellow major champion -- either No. 6 seed Beatriz Haddad Maia 6-7(4), 7-6(3), 7-5 in the third-longest tour-level match of 2025 so far. 105-ranked German trailed by 5-2 and one match point in the third set, but surged through the next five games in a row in a blitz of heavy forehand winners mixed up with smartly-timed drop shots. This result was her third career Top 30 win, all of which have come since June -- the 20-year-old also defeated Anna Kalinskaya in Berlin qualifying and Emma Navarro in Cincinnati en route to the last 16. Haddad Maia, who took a medical time-out leading 5-4 in the third set, later withdrew from the doubles tournament due to a right knee injury. Top seed Iga Swiatek stayed perfect against Sorana Cirstea to reach the Korea Open 2025 presented by Motiva quarterfinals on her tournament debut, while Ella Seidel dethroned defending champion Beatriz Haddad Maia in the third-longest match of 2025 so far.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gael Monfils cut a dejected figure on Thursday after suffering a painful fall that forced him to retire from his opening match against Alexander Shevchenko at the Chengdu Open. “I loved every second of the match, and I really didn't want to end it like this,” said Shevchenko, who helped Monfils up after he fell. He's incredible, there are so many people looking up to him.” Monfils won his 13th ATP Tour title in Auckland in January and backed it up with a fourth-round run at the Australian. Making his debut at the Chinese ATP 250 event, Shevchenko next plays big-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, who did not face a break point across the second and third sets of his 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 win over Filip Misolic. Earlier, #NextGenATP star Dino Prizmic moved past Terence Atmane 6-4, 6-3 in the Frenchman's first appearance since his breakthrough run to the Cincinnati semi-finals last month. Prizmic set a second-round meeting with top seed and last year's runner-up Lorenzo Musetti, who is eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and aiming to strengthen his push for a Nitto ATP Finals qualification. Other winners on Day 2 in Chengdu include eighth seed Lorenzo Sonego and qualifier Mackenzie McDonald, who both earned deciding-set victories. Sonego rallied past Juan Manuel Cerundolo 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, while McDonald held firm for a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 victory over Botic van de Zandschulp to improve to 2-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Making his first appearance since his first-round Wimbledon exit, Berrettini was unable to withstand the 22-year-old Czech's fearless ball-striking at the Chinese ATP 250 event. “Obviously I wasn't the favourite coming into this match, so I just wanted to come here, enjoy and play freely,” said Svrcina. Backed by rock-solid defence and quick court coverage, Svrcina struck 17 winners to Berrettini's 11 and saved the only break point he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, during their 85-minute battle. His reward: a second-round clash with Buyunchaokete or Zhang Zhizhen. Berrettini, who had reached quarter-finals in Miami, Dubai and Doha earlier this year — including his first win over Novak Djokovic — showed signs of rust after a two-and-a-half month layoff, tallying 15 unforced errors in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head match with Svrcina. In other Day 2 action in Hangzhou, Tomas Martin Etcheverry eased past Damir Dzumhur 6-2, 6-4 to notch his 20th tour-level victory of the season, becoming the second Argentine to do so after Francisco Cerundolo (33). Etcheverry awaits qualifier Rinky Hijikata or fifth seed Camilo Ugo Carabelli. Qualifier Nishesh Basavareddy booked his spot in the second round by rallying past defending champion Marin Cilic 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. The 20-year-old, who made his debut at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF last year, is up one spot to sixth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah and will next play second seed Daniil Medvedev.

I want to be blonde too, but I don't think it's going to work. So, I really love it.Casper Ruud: We have an ongoing discussion of what the nickname should be for him. You know, his hair grows so fast. In a few days, it'll be even darker. “Silver Fox” is a good nickname for him, and I think it's cool.Yannick Noah, Team Europe Captain: You know, we're like actors.
