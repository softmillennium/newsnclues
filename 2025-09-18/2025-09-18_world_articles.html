                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Critics say ‘authoritarianism isn't coming – it's already here' amid widespread condemnation of talkshow's suspension The indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show has prompted impassioned calls for a boycott against Disney, ABC's parent company, and other major media conglomerates that have refused to air Kimmel's show. Boycott calls grew after ABC announced it would indefinitely suspend the popular show following complaints from Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr. Carr's complaints stem from Kimmel's recent monologue in which he addressed the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk by saying: “Many in Maga land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.” Carr, who was appointed by Donald Trump earlier this year, said Kimmel's comments were “truly sick” and that ABC had violated its “public interest” broadcast obligations. Meanwhile, conservative TV conglomerate Sinclair announced it would run a tribute to Kirk during Kimmel's time slot on Friday. It also called on Kimmel to issue a formal apology and make a personal donation to Kirk's family and his rightwing political advocacy group, Turning Point USA. Overnight, calls to boycott ABC and Disney emerged, with grassroots political advocacy group 50501 leading the charge. These two companies are currently seeking approval from the FCC for business deals. We need leaders to protect freedom of speech, not punish it.” One user wrote on BlueSky: “Heard from a friend at Disney+ that there are multiple levels of freakout internally, both from internal dissatisfaction, concerns about subscription cancelations, and of course the big one: concern about a boycott spilling over into parks and cruises.” On Wednesday, CNN correspondent Brian Stelter wrote on X that he asked Carr if he had any new comments following Kimmel's show suspension. “He sent me this gif,” Stelter said, alongside a gif from The Office, where two characters, Michael Scott and Dwight Schrute, are shown celebrating with their hands in the air. Reacting to the news of Kimmel's show suspension, Trump responded gleefully, saying: “Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. In July, Trump celebrated Paramount's decision to cancel The Late Show With Stephen Colbert – the US's highest rated late-night show – after Colbert also mocked Trump. Writing on TruthSocial, Trump said: “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an open letter issued Thursday and shared first with CNN, more than 500 groups condemned what they described as the use of government power to threaten their First Amendment rights. Trump and others in his administration have invoked Kirk's killing at a Utah university campus last week to say they will crack down on groups that they view as part of a coordinated left-wing effort to incite violence. “It is un-American and wrong to use this act of violence as a pretext for weaponizing the government to threaten nonprofit and charitable organizations, other perceived adversaries, or any class of people.” The actions publicly floated by the president and some conservatives include revoking the tax-exempt status of left-leaning non-profits and launching racketeering investigations of organizations that have helped coordinate or fund protests against Trump's policies. So far, Trump has announced that he is designating the far-left movement Antifa as a terrorist organization, although it was not immediately clear how administration intends to carry out the designation. “It is unconscionable to exploit this dangerous political moment to further divisions and violate rights, when what we desperately need right now is to lower the temperature of our discourse and bring the country together.” CNN has reached out to the White House for a response. The letter from the nonprofits follows a similar action Wednesday from more than 100 philanthropies who banded together to defend free speech. In that letter, the foundations defended their work and denounced what they said were efforts to “exploit political violence to mischaracterize our good work of restrict our fundamental freedoms.” Signatories included the Open Society Foundations, the philanthropic group founded by billionaire financier and Democratic donor George Soros, who has been a repeated target of scorn from Trump and the right.</p>

Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) failed by just one vote on Wednesday, after Democrats maneuvered against it. Mace claimed her censure effort was about Omar's criticism of Charlie Kirk.

Mace posted about Omar over 75 times on her X account in recent days, reporters noted, spreading false accusations about her beliefs and waging outright racist, Islamophobic attacks on her faith and Somalian origin. Democrats said that Mace was just trying to boost her profile after entering the South Carolina gubernatorial race last month. Omar noted that Mace is sending out fundraising messages based on her attacks. This is all an attempt to push a false story so she can fundraise and boost her run for Governor.” Republican Representatives Mike Flood (Nebraska), Jeff Hurd (Colorado), Tom McClintock (California) and Cory Mills (Florida) voted with Democrats to table the resolution. Mills had voted against the censure after Democrats threatened a retaliatory censure against him, as Axios reported, introduced by Congressional Progressive Caucus leader Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas). Casar said he plans to withdraw his resolution now that the censure attempt against Omar failed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers might be close to confirming the presence of an Earth-like atmosphere on an exoplanet for the first time, if more detailed analyses verify preliminary observations from the James Webb Space Telescope. The planet is part of a planetary system about 40 light-years away from Earth called TRAPPIST-1, which five Belgian astronomers discovered in 2016 and named after their favorite beer. “The star is very, very small — the size of Jupiter — and it has at least seven rocky planets orbiting around it. Four observations performed in 2023 with the Webb telescope were unable to rule out the presence of an atmosphere, prompting  optimism. “Based on the first four observations, we cannot tell that (this planet) doesn't have an atmosphere, so the dream is still alive — it could still have an atmosphere,” Espinoza said, “and that's super exciting, because we do have a follow-up program of 15 more observations.” “Now I'm pretty confident we'll be able to see what kind of atmosphere TRAPPIST-1 e could have — and if it has an Earth-like atmosphere, we'll be able to tell.” TRAPPIST-1 e is similar to Earth in size and orbits its star every six days — a much faster rate than Earth orbits the sun. When looking for an atmosphere, astronomers wait for a planet to transit in front of its star and notice any minor changes in the starlight that filters through. They search for telltale signs of an atmosphere while learning about its chemical composition. With the four transits observed by the Webb telescope in 2023, astronomers were able to rule out the presence of a primary, hydrogen-based atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 e, which was likely blown away by significant amounts of radiation emitted by its star. (Earth similarly lost its primordial, primary atmosphere early on but then built a secondary one; astronomers hope that TRAPPIST-1 e could have done the same.) It notes that the planet is unlikely to have an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide like those of Venus and Mars, and points toward a nitrogen-heavy one, more similar to Earth and Saturn's icy moon Titan. If the team finds irrefutable signs of an atmosphere, even more Webb telescope observations could be warranted in the hopes of detecting specific chemical signatures of gases such as methane, which is associated with life on Earth. Confirmation of an atmosphere would be groundbreaking, Espinoza said. “It would settle a huge debate going on right now on whether these red dwarf systems can sustain an atmosphere or not,” he said. However, even if an atmosphere was ruled out, the result would still be exciting, he said, because it would make life on Earth even more special. It would also set the stage for future research to look at exoplanets orbiting around yellow dwarf stars such as the sun, using telescopes even more powerful than Webb that are still in the planning stages. These first James Webb results for TRAPPIST-1e are immensely exciting, said Michaël Gillon, research director of the Astrobiology Research Unit at Belgium's University of Liège. “The data are not yet conclusive,” he added in an email, “but they prove that JWST has the power to detect an Earth-like atmosphere if it exists. For the first time in history, we are truly within reach of discovering an atmosphere around a potentially habitable rocky exoplanet.” Agol was not involved with the study but is working on the new set of observations with Espinoza and his colleagues. “The results are interesting, but also incomplete,” he added in an email. “I am agnostic about whether TRAPPIST-1 e may have an Earth-like atmosphere or not, and the current study hasn't affected my opinion.” According to Howard Chen, an assistant professor of space sciences at the Florida Institute of Technology, TRAPPIST-1e sits right at a “tipping point” between opposite states, based on computer simulations that he detailed in a new study that published Wednesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Based on its history, the planet can emerge as either extremely dry or water-rich: “That means both ‘bare rock' and ‘atmosphere-bearing' scenarios remain physically plausible,” he added in an email. “JWST's current data can't distinguish between those scenarios yet, but that ambiguity is exactly what our simulations predict,” Chen said. “The fact that TRAPPIST-1e can plausibly be either very dry or very wet means the next few JWST (observations) could deliver a dramatic reveal.” Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.</p>

If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. Mahmoud Khalil and his lawyers on Wednesday affirmed their plan to fight an immigration court ruling that paves the way for his deportation, months after plainclothes agents accosted the lawful permanent resident and his US citizen wife outside their home in New York City. “It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. “Such fascist tactics will never deter me from continuing to advocate for my people's liberation.” Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. While President Donald Trump has a broad goal of mass deportations, his administration has targeted Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student with a valid green card, and other foreign scholars in the United States for criticizing Israel's US-backed genocide in the Gaza Strip. Federal agents arrested Khalil, an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent, in March. He wasn't released from a federal immigration facility until June. In a Wednesday letter to Farbiarz — an appointee of former President Joe Biden who has already blocked his deportation while the civil rights case proceeds — Khalil's legal team explained that on September 12, Jamee Comans, an immigration judge (IJ), “issued three separate orders denying petitioner's (1) motion for an extension of time, (2) motion to change venue, and (3) application for a waiver, without conducting an evidentiary hearing.” “In denying petitioner's request for a waiver absent a hearing, as well as his motions for extension of time and for change of venue, the IJ ordered petitioner removed to Algeria or Syria… while reaffirming her decisions denying petitioner any form of relief from removal,” the letter says. Khalil now has 30 days from September 12 to start an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). “Upon affirmance by the BIA, petitioner will lose his lawful permanent resident status, including his right to reside and work in the United States, and have a final order of removal against him.” “When the immigration prosecutor, judge, and jailer all answer to Donald Trump, and that one man is eager to weaponize the system in a desperate bid to silence Mahmoud Khalil, a US permanent resident whose only supposed sin is that he stands against an ongoing genocide in Palestine, this is the result,” CLEAR co-director Ramzi Kassem said Wednesday. In addition to calling out the Trump administration for its unconstitutional conduct, Khalil's lawyers expressed some optimism. “As with other illegal efforts by the government, this too will be challenged and overcome.” But independent journalists at Truthout face mounting political suppression under Trump.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Greg Abbott's latest move fuels clash between US red states and blue-state shield laws protecting abortion care Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, on Wednesday signed into law a bill that lets people sue anyone suspected of manufacturing, distributing or mailing abortion pills to or from Texas. “Our mantra as a practice is: ‘No anticipatory obedience',” said Dr Angel Foster, co-founder of the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project (Map), a Boston-area based group that uses telemedicine to ship abortion pills to patients across the United States. Pharmaceutical manufacturers who make drugs that Texans use for abortions could also be found liable, but they may be able to defend themselves by proving in court that they adopted and implemented “a policy to not distribute, mail, transport, deliver, provide, or possess abortion-inducing drugs” – though the language of the law is somewhat ambiguous on whether that provision applies to Texas or more broadly. “We want to create liability for manufacturers that Aid Access is using,” said John Seago, president of Texas Right to Life and a chief backer of the new legislation, in an interview before the bill's passage. It shipped almost 120,000 packs of abortion pills to US residents between 2023 and 2024. Seago continued: “The best we can do at this point is create a higher liability and start trying to deter some of those individuals.” #WeCount found that, in December 2024, nearly 4,000 Texans used telehealth to end their pregnancies. Providers like the Map mail pills under legal innovations known as “shield laws”, which have been enacted by a handful of blue states and aim to protect abortion providers from out-of-state prosecutions when they send pills into states with bans. Rachel Rebouché, professor at the University of Texas, Austin School of Law who studies shield laws, said Texas's new law is the first legislative challenge to shield laws. Many post-Roe abortion pill providers, Rebouché pointed out, have already accepted that their work involves a great deal of risk. “But it might chill, it might hamper or dissuade people who don't want to be implicated, who don't want to face the risk of liability.” Her Safe Harbor, an organization that uses shield laws to mail abortion pills to people and received one of Paxton's cease-and-desist letters, has no plans to block Texans from its services, said Debra Lynch, a nurse practitioner who works with the group, in an interview before Abbott signed the law. In fact, as the Texas law neared passage in the state legislature, Her Safe Harbor started receiving so many requests for help from patients that it had to double its number of abortion providers, according to Lynch.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gold continues to be supported by both fundamental and technical factors. We've written previously on why we're so bullish on the commodity, and today it's time for even more reasons it deserves a prominent place in portfolios. Concerns over monetary policy and political influence have taken center stage after the Big Beautiful Bill in the U.S. got passed, and the tariff file became less onerous than feared in April. Fed policy uncertainty is close to 3 times higher than normal levels, and this is not going away any time soon. Gold also has a huge historical 85% inverse correlation (although it may be lower now) to real interest rates and the U.S. dollar. Real 10-year yields have come down 60 basis points from the nearby peak to 1.8%, but are still some 90 basis points above the long-run mean. As for the DXY dollar index, it is already down well over 10% from the earlier highs, and if it breaks below 95 (currently around 97), then we will see a cyclical bear market in the U.S. dollar index morph into something more secular in nature. Commodities could be on the verge of a new super cycle The supply-demand fundamentals for gold are very bullish to this day. Mined production growth is growing at 1.5% at an annual rate, but demand in aggregate is running north of 3.0% and from a variety of sources. We are seeing a classic mean-reversion trade here. In the 1980s and 1990s, when central banks were winding down their bullion reserves in favour of interest-bearing securities, sales of gold brought its price down by 50% and into a fundamental bear market that ended in 1999 with the Washington Agreement. Back in 1980, the FX reserve share of gold in central bank vaults stood at 70%; by the late 1990s, down to 10%; and today, it is just over 20%. Keep in mind that global central banks still have a lot of work to do — a classic case in point is the U.K., which cut its gold reserves by half in the 1980s and 1990s, and Canada, where the central bank wound down its exposure to zero (talk about terrible timing). From the research we have gleaned, just 1% of global assets are in bullion, and that is down from 26% in the early 1980s — the last time gold was where it is today adjusted for inflation. The technical picture also looks very strong. Mapping out the 1971-1980 cycle and the current one since 1999, for the two legs to match on scale, we would need to see a peak of over US$6,000 this cycle. Treat any corrections along the way (and they have been brief affairs) as buying opportunities in a secular uptrend. All gold has done is go back to around where it was 45 years ago in real terms. The S&P 500 on this basis has shot up over 13x by way of comparison. We get asked all the time about comparing gold to Bitcoin. It has three ties to gold's volatility: the major point being that gold is a ballast and diversifier in the portfolio. Unlike Bitcoin, gold is a hedge against risk, while Bitcoin and crypto in general possess far riskier characteristics. There is something else to consider, which is that the first Bitcoin was mined 16 years ago, so it has barely made it through one full cycle. Expected EPS growth is so huge that the sector trades at a 0.3x PEG ratio — compared to a near-2.0x ratio for the overall S&P 500 and TSX composite. Not just that, but the Canadian gold mining group, even at current record levels, is still trading at a 40% historical discount to the underlying price of the commodity. Closing these gaps would require a doubling in the North American gold miners, even assuming no more price appreciation for bullion. I know that I haven't mentioned silver — “poor man's gold.” We love gold, but we like silver. And while the gold/silver price ratio did hit an extreme last April, half of that gap has been resolved. The last thing that we would like to highlight is that gold has registered new highs in terms of every major currency. So while the depreciating U.S. dollar continues to act as a catalyst, you know that gold is in a bona fide secular bull market when it is breaking out to fresh records across all exchange rates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian forces have liberated 160 square kilometers (60 square miles) of territory during an ongoing "counteroffensive operation" in eastern Donetsk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 18. Ukrainian forces have spent the past month pushing Russian troops back after they advanced 15-20 kilometers (6 miles) toward the strategic Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway, near the embattled city of Pokrovsk. Since late August, Ukrainian units have regained control of multiple villages in the area. Seven settlements have been retaken in the Dobropillia and Pokrovsk sectors during the operation, Zelensky said, citing a report from Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. Ukrainian troops have also captured nearly 100 Russian soldiers, according to the president. Of those, over 1,300 Russian soldiers have been killed, "Zelensky said, adding that Ukraine's counteroffensive operations in Donetsk Oblast are ongoing. Zelensky also renewed his call for continued military aid from international partners and urged the tightening of sanctions to pressure Russia into peace negotiations. The statement comes amid more frequent counterattacks by the Ukrainian side, which has been in a strategic defensive posture along the front line in eastern Ukraine for nearly two years. Ukrainian forces liberated the village of Zarichne in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 8. Russia, however, pursued offensive operations at a high intensity across the front line over summer. According to the Ukrainian mapping and monitoring group Deep State, Russian forces occupied 1,548 square kilometers over summer, significantly more than the 659 square kilometres taken in the equivalent period in 2024. Zelensky warned on Sept. 16 that Russia is preparing two major offensive operations for the fall. Yet, sustained losses in personnel and equipment may hinder Moscow's ability to carry them out, the president added. "The one (war) that I thought would be the easiest (to end) was because of my relationship with President Putin," Trump said. Seven settlements have been liberated in the Dobropillia and Pokrovsk sectors during the operation, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Russia's government is considering raising the VAT rate from 20% to 22% to reduce the budget deficit, Reuters reported. "In the near future, investigators from law enforcement agencies and Interior Ministry experts will carry out all the necessary examinations to identify the repatriated bodies," Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POW) said. The new Ukrainian-Polish task force will serve as a platform for developing joint initiatives and focus on training programs, Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal. Dmitry Kozak, a longtime associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin and one of the few senior Russian officials to oppose the invasion of Ukraine, has resigned from his post as the Kremlin's deputy chief of staff. Long-range SBU drones struck an ELOU-AVT-4 crude oil processing unit at the center of the facility, triggering a "massive explosion," an SBU source said. Unknown individuals set fire to dry grass near the Russian army's command post near the village of Voskresenka on Aug. 30, the Ukrainian project "I Want to Live" said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Chinese port of Ningbo is preparing to launch a cargo ship that will test a new shipping route via the Northern Sea Route (NSR), Politico wrote. The vessel's departure is scheduled for September 20. Although Chinese companies have previously conducted trial shipments via the NSR, the upcoming route will be more challenging. "They did point-to-point trips, like from one Chinese port to Hamburg or to St. Petersburg," Malte Humpert, senior fellow and founder of the Arctic Institute, a Washington-based think tank that studies Arctic security, told Politico. They're trying four ports in China, then through the Arctic, then the UK, Rotterdam, Hamburg and Gdansk. That actually resembles a normal shipping route," he said. Ten years ago, everyone thought that before 2040 or 2050, container shipping in the Arctic would hardly be possible, the expert noted. "And here we are in 2025, and the Chinese are doing it. The development of the Northern Sea Route became possible due to climate change as changes occur more rapidly in the Arctic region than in other parts of the planet, Humpert said. However, he believes that most global trade will continue to flow through the traditional route via the Suez Canal. "If you play this 30 or 40 years into the future, and the ice melts another 30, 40, 50%, suddenly you have six months of no ice [in the waters of the NSR], and the Arctic becomes a very interesting equation. <…> The Arctic is not going to replace the Suez Canal tomorrow. The Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, they will remain there.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eighteen Russian staff officers of the 35th Combined Arms Army were killed in a sabotage attack in the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast in late August, the Ukrainian project "I Want to Live" reported on Sept. 18. The Ukrainian state-run project published a list of Russian soldiers allegedly killed in the fire. Russia rarely discloses its military losses publicly. Ukrainian forces and pro-Ukrainian partisan groups have repeatedly targeted Russian soldiers and military infrastructure on occupied territories or inside Russia. Earlier this week, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) claimed it had carried out explosions in Russia's Vladivostok as a "revenge operation" targeting troops accused of war crimes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. The country, which is now being led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), is contending with recurring violent sectarian clashes, successive Israeli strikes into Syrian territory, and internal disputes within the new government. At its apogee, in 2014, ISIS held roughly a third of the country. Although the group no longer controls any territory in Syria, and its numbers have dwindled from roughly 100,000 fighters to 2,500 fighters today, the group is taking advantage of Syria's post-Assad chaos to rebuild and reconstitute, presenting fresh obstacles to the country's long-sought stability.The group's targeting capabilities are proving more frequent, precise, and sophisticated than ever, targeting sites well beyond ISIS's traditional spheres of operation. Two months later, the group launched more than two dozen attacks across northeastern Syria, relying on a combination of guerrilla tactics, including small arms fire, ambushes, assassinations, and improvised explosive devices targeting military checkpoints and government vehicles. Last year, ISIS took responsibility for 294 attacks in Syria, up from 121 in 2023; estimates by the United Nations and human rights groups are even higher. Syria's already fragile security situation is characterized by frequent clashes between Sunni, Alawite, and Druze communities. Without Washington's active involvement, the coalition's remaining 88 members will struggle to keep ISIS at bay or to adequately support local actors such as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a mostly Kurdish militia that had recently reached an agreement to merge with the state. As U.S. troop numbers dwindle and sectarian tensions mount, Syrian forces may find it increasingly difficult to maintain authority in the country. To deter ISIS, therefore, the United States must retain a presence in Syria beyond 2026. A contingent of roughly several hundred U.S. troops will be necessary to support Syria's new security forces with intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and capacity building. Through its attacks, ISIS hopes to demonstrate that the current Syrian government is unable or unwilling to protect the population, especially minorities. A recent report from the UN Monitoring Team concluded that ISIS “will continue to project an external threat . if divisions in the country allow a permissive space from where they can plan and execute attacks.”Indeed, ISIS was especially busy last spring. Then in May, the group launched another barrage of attacks following clashes south of Damascus, between the new administration's security forces and Sunni and Druze communities. That same month, just a week after U.S. President Donald Trump met in Riyadh with Syria's new president, the former jihadist Ahmed al-Shara, ISIS launched a series of bombings and ambushes across Syria and Iraq. The group also took credit for planting an explosive device that struck a “vehicle of the apostate regime” in southern Syria, resulting in at least seven Syrian army casualties and marking the first recorded attack on Syrian government forces since Assad's fall. ISIS propagandists call Shara “Jewlani,” in reference to a conspiracy that the Syrian president, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, is an Israeli Mossad agent installed to initiate regime change inside Syria in favor of Israel. The group has also labeled HTS as kuffar (Arabic for “nonbelievers”) and accused it of being a puppet of the United States and Israel. Since HTS and Shara came to power, Israel has repeatedly carried out strikes and ground incursions into Syria, sowing the very chaos on which ISIS strives. Alarmingly, ISIS's growing confidence has coincided with an incremental withdrawal of U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq, placing the future of the Global Coalition into question. Although Pentagon commanders have urged the administration to maintain at least a contingent of 500 troops in Syria, the administration has signaled that further cuts may be made. With a withdrawal goal set for the end of 2026, U.S. forces are reconsolidating from Baghdad to Erbil, in Iraqi Kurdistan, and plan to drastically reduce their presence to a small, as yet unspecified number of military advisers. Much of the impetus behind the Trump administration's reengagement with Syria is driven by a desire to complete a total withdrawal from Iraq and Syria—an objective that can be achieved only if the new Syrian government proves capable of countering ISIS. To that aim, Washington has prioritized counterterrorism, directly assisting in operations against ISIS and providing Damascus with intelligence that has thwarted at least eight ISIS attacks. How things develop in Syria will depend, at least in part, on how committed Washington remains to continuing its fight against ISIS. Any U.S. withdrawal would create space for ISIS and other terrorist organizations to step up their attacks, further destabilizing the country, sowing divisions among its rival factions, and even opening the door for Iran-backed Shiite extremists, including Hezbollah. Although ISIS remains largely defeated, Syria's postregime transition has created an opening for the group's return. A premature U.S. departure at such a fragile moment in Syria could empower ISIS, undermining the very mission that brought U.S. forces to Syria in the first place. Washington should not follow through on its planned drawdown. Instead, it must continue to share intelligence with Damascus to foil attacks by ISIS—and step up counterterrorism training with the Syrian army, the SDF, and other local partners. Beyond that, the Trump administration should prevent actions by U.S. allies—such as Israeli strikes on Syrian territory—that risk perpetuating the chaos that ISIS seeks to exploit. Finally, instead of terminating U.S. participation in the Global Coalition, Washington should expand the grouping to include Syria itself—a move that would enable better joint training, intelligence exchange, and operations. To be sure, existing members will have reservations about welcoming former jihadists such as Shara. But if ISIS is to be defeated once and for all, the new Syrian government must be involved and empowered to succeed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Allies of Donald Trump have dismissed claims Charlie Kirk was killed by a lone assassin. Senior figures in the Maga movement believe Tyler Robinson, the student charged with Kirk's murder, is part of a wider conspiracy involving a Left-wing terrorist network, and that authorities need to widen the scope of their investigation. The FBI has suggested Mr Robinson may have worked with others, although no one else has yet been charged in connection with the crime. Kash Patel, the FBI director, told senators on Tuesday that the bureau was investigating “who, if anyone, was involved as an accomplice”. Steve Bannon, Mr Trump's former chief strategist, claimed that Kirk's death was “not a simple murder” and that the truth was “far deeper and far more malignant”. “Antifa needs to be designated as a domestic terrorist organisation,” he continued, referencing the radical Left-wing organisation that has been linked to recent attacks on immigration detention centres. “I will also be strongly recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practices,” he said. It was not clear what legal weight Mr Trump's proclamation carried. Media reports emerged shortly after Kirk's death that the ammunition used by the assassin was engraved with expressions of transgender and Antifa “ideology”, but authorities later clarified this may have been a misunderstanding. Mr Bannon went on to suggest that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) may have been involved in the incident by allegedly funding Antifa. Mr Bannon also told his podcast listeners he was highly sceptical about a text exchange prosecutors said took place between Mr Robinson and his transgender lover. Echoing sceptics on social media who claimed the messages setting out details of the alleged crime were too convenient, he added: “Why are you explaining everything? “I'm particularly not buying those text messages, it just seems too stilted, too much like a script – actually, like a bad script.” Matt Walsh, a Maga-aligned commentator with the Daily Wire, suggested the text exchange had been planned to protect Mr Robinson's lover from prosecution. Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff and a long-time aide to Mr Trump, claimed a “vast domestic terror network” was responsible for Kirk's death. “With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have… to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again,” he vowed. Sean Davis, the founder of The Federalist, a conservative magazine, wrote on social media: “It's obvious now that Charlie Kirk's assassin was not working alone. “He was clearly operating within a larger terrorist network focused on grooming, recruiting, and training terrorists for the purpose of planning and executing terrorist attacks.” Mr Patel was repeatedly pressed by Republicans about whether Mr Robinson had allegedly acted alone when he testified in front of the Senate judiciary committee for several hours on Tuesday. Asked if others could have been involved in Kirk's death, he answered: “Yes.” At one point, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley urged Mr Patel to investigate Kirk's murder as part of a wider wave of “anti-religion, anti-Christian violence”. Dan Bongino, Mr Patel's deputy, has also said the bureau is looking into whether Mr Robinson acted as part of a “larger effort”. “If there was any aiding and abetting, whether it be financial or someone who knew the specifics of it and failed to report that, we're looking into that,” Mr Bongino told Fox News on Monday, and declared: “There's not going to be a stone left unturned.” In the wake of this tragedy, and amid other acts of politically motivated violence, Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Sheibani and Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer held US-brokered talks in London on Wednesday. According to Syria TV, the two ministers discussed a new draft agreement on measures of security that would replace the Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Syria of 1974. US Special Envoy for the Middle East Tom Barrack, who acts as a go-between at the talks, took part. President of Syria for the transitional period Ahmed al-Sharaa said earlier that contacts with Israel on potential agreements on security measures "may yield results with the coming days." However, he demanded that UN observers be redeployed to the Golan Heights. He insisted that Israel "respect Syria's territorial integrity and stop violating its airspace." According to the Al Nahar newspaper, Israel's draft is based on the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of 1979. Israel insists on establishing three demilitarized zones southwest of Damascus, where various security regimes will be in place depending on the distance from the Israeli border. Syria will be allowed to deploy police forces to these zones but flights over them will be banned. Israel will retain control of Mount Hermon (Jabal El Sheikh) it took in December 2024 after the change of power in Damascus.</p>
