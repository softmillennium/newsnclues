            Erika Kirk has been named CEO of Turning Point USA, taking over the organization that her husband, Charlie Kirk, helped found and led until his assassination last week.
    


            The move was announced by the organization's board in a post on X. The post said Charlie Kirk had in prior discussions made known that “this is what he wanted in the event of his death.”
    


            “We will not surrender or kneel before evil,” board members said in a statement. “We will carry on.”
    


            Charlie Kirk co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012 and transformed it into one of the most influential conservative organizations that was credited with galvanizing youth toward Donald Trump's MAGA movement.
    


            In her first remarks since her husband's assassination, Kirk said she was committed to continuing her husband's work and his legacy.
    


            “To everyone listening tonight across America, the movement my husband built will not die,” Kirk said in her Sept. 12 remarks.
    


            “My husband's mission will not end, not even for a moment,” she said, vowing to continue the American Comeback Tour of college campuses scheduled for this fall.
    


            Born Erika Frantzve, Kirk, 36, was raised in Scottsdale, Arizona by her mother after her parents divorced when she was a child. She studied political science at Arizona State University and was briefly an NCAA basketball player. She won the Miss Arizona USA pageant in 2012.
    


            The Kirks were engaged in 2020 and married the next year. They shared two young children.

            President Donald Trump took his effort to remove a governor from the Federal Reserve to the Supreme Court on Thursday, asking the justices to remove Lisa Cook from the powerful board a day after it cut interest rates for the first time in months.
    


            Trump's emergency appeal put the issue of Fed independence – a question of monumental significance for the US economy – onto the court's docket months after the justices appeared to carve out special protections for the agency. On the other hand, Trump's effort to remove Cook involves new legal theories that may find purchase on the 6-3 conservative court.
    


            If Trump is successful in dismissing Cook, it would mark the first time a Fed governor was fired by a president in the central bank's 111-year history.
    


            The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for the first time since December and signaled more cuts are likely this year. Trump has sharply criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for keeping rates high, and critics have suggested the administration's real goal in targeting Cook has been to pressure the agency to act.
    


            “That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,” the administration said in its emergency appeal.

            “Put simply, the president may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself – and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.”
    


            Trump fired Cook on August 25 after a member of his administration alleged that she had committed mortgage fraud by reporting two different homes as her primary residence – a practice that can yield better loan terms. Other documents have subsequently revealed that Cook sometimes declared the second property as a “vacation home.”
    


            A federal court on September 10 blocked Cook's dismissal, asserting that Trump had not “identified anything related to Cook's conduct or job performance as a board member that would indicate that she is harming the board or the public interest.” That ruling was handed down by US District Judge Jia Cobb, nominated to the bench by former President Joe Biden.
    


            The Trump administration quickly appealed to the DC Circuit, which on Monday declined to put Cobb's ruling on hold.
    


            “Given that Cook has a property interest in her position, she is entitled to ‘some kind' of process before removal,” two of the appeals court judges reviewing that case wrote in a concurring opinion Monday. “Before this court, the government does not dispute that it provided Cook no meaningful notice or opportunity to respond to the allegations against her.”
    


            US Circuit Judges Bradley Garcia and J. Michelle Childs, both Biden nominees, sided with Cook.
    


            But US Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas, a Trump nominee, dissented.
    


            “The president plainly invoked a cause relating to Cook's conduct, ability, fitness, or competence,” Katsas wrote. “The allegations against Cook could constitute mortgage fraud if she acted knowingly, and that is a felony offense.”
    


            In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court on Thursday, the Trump administration described that decision as “yet another case of improper judicial interference with the president's removal authority. The administration also asked Chief Justice John Roberts for an immediate, short-term “administrative” order that would take Cook off the board while the case is pending at the high court.
    


            And the administration brushed aside arguments that Cook was entitled to some sort of process to refute the allegations before she was dismissed.
    


            “The lower courts' primary theory is that principal officers are akin to teachers or lower-level civil servants and can thus claim a property interest and an entitlement to notice and a hearing before removal,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court. “This theory is untenable and would wreak havoc on sensitive presidential decision-making.”
    


            On the one hand, Trump has on his side a string of emergency victories at the Supreme Court, in which the justices have allowed the president to remove the leaders of independent federal agencies at will. But on the other, the court took pains to carve out the Fed from those cases, asserting it had a unique history that underscored the importance of its independence.
    


            But the Cook appeal involves a separate legal question: Who gets to define “cause.” Trump has claimed that Cook's dismissal was based on the allegations, which he says count as “cause” to justify the firing. The administration has pointed to a 1901 precedent from the Supreme Court to argue that courts should give the executive wide deference to define cause for removal purposes.
    


            Just before the Fed's meeting this week, Trump appointee Stephen Miran, a White House economic adviser, was sworn in as a new governor. Asked about Miran's arrival – specifically whether his arrangement of serving as a Fed governor while remaining a White House employee – means anything for Fed independence, Powell said that the agency is “strongly committed to maintaining our independence.”
    


            “And beyond that,” he said, “I really don't have anything to share.”
    


            As in past years, the Supreme Court's work is increasingly becoming intertwined with Trump. The court separately agreed to hear arguments in a major case involving the president's use of sweeping global tariffs.
    


            The parties in that case sought an expedited review and, earlier Thursday, the Supreme Court set arguments for November 5 – setting up a significant showdown over the centerpiece of the administration's economic agenda.

Saudi Arabia and nuclear-armed Pakistan have signed a formal mutual defense pact, further strengthening the decades-long security partnership between the two Muslim nations.

The move comes shortly after an extraordinary joint session between the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), in which member states condemned last week's Israeli attack on the Qatari capital, Doha, which targeted officials from Palestinian armed group Hamas. According to media reports, the incident caused concern among Gulf nations about the ability of the US to guarantee their security.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif signed the defense pact between their countries in Riyadh on Wednesday.

""This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieving security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defense cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the joint statement by Riyadh and Islamabad read.

According to the deal, any attack against Saudi Arabia or Pakistan “shall be considered an aggression against both,” it stressed.

India, which fought a four-day military conflict with Pakistan in May following a terrorist attack on tourists in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, said it will “study the implications of this development for our national security as well as for regional and global stability.”

New Delhi was aware of security ties between Riyadh and Islamabad and knew that a defense pact between them had been in the works, Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal wrote on X.

A senior Saudi official told Reuters that the deal with Pakistan was “a culmination of years of discussions. This is not a response to specific countries or specific events.”

Saudi Arabia's relationship with India “is more robust than it has ever been. We will continue to grow this relationship and seek to contribute to regional peace whichever way we can,” he added.

Military ties between Riyadh and Islamabad date back more than half a century, with thousands of Saudi officers receiving training in Pakistan. The defense partnership remains active through training programs and joint exercises.

US President Donald Trump has announced that he is officially designating the left-wing Antifa movement as a terrorist organization.

The decision comes a week after the assassination of conservative podcaster and organizer Charlie Kirk during his college speaking tour. Senior Republican officials, including Vice President J.D. Vance, have attributed the murder to “left-wing extremism.”

“I am pleased to inform our many U.S.A. Patriots that I am designating ANTIFA, A SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER, AS A MAJOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Wednesday evening.

He added that those funding Antifa should be “thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practices.”

Antifa, short for “antifascists,” is an umbrella term for black-clad, masked left-wing activists who often violently disrupt conservative demonstrations and clash with right-wing protesters, as well as with police.

The movement gained national attention during the 2020 George Floyd unrest. Antifa members have also been accused of participating in riots and carrying out ambush attacks on conservative figures and journalists.

Tyler Robinson, the man charged with Kirk's murder, had reportedly held left-leaning and pro-LGBTQ views, according to officials.

Prosecutors said he confessed to killing Kirk in text messages to his transgender romantic partner. “I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out,” Robinson allegedly wrote shortly after Kirk was shot.

ABC News correspondent Matt Gutman has apologized for a report in which he described “very touching” text messages between the alleged killer of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk and his transgender partner. 

Utah County Attorney General Jeff Gray had read some of the messages while announcing charges against Tyler Robinson, accused of fatally shooting Kirk at Utah Valley University.

“I want to protect you, my love,” Robinson allegedly told his partner. Gutman described the messages as “a very intimate portrait” and “very touching.” He described Robinson as “a very human person” and said there was a “heartbreaking duality” in the case, pointing to Robinson's high academic record.

Following a backlash, Gutman posted an apology on X.

”Yesterday I tried to underscore the jarring contrast between this cold blooded assassination of Charlie Kirk … and the personal, disturbing texts read aloud by the Utah County Attorney at the press conference,” Gutman wrote on Wednesday. “I deeply regret that my words did not make that clear.”

“Let there be zero doubt here: I unequivocally condemn this horrific crime,” he said. 

Kirk, a conservative activist and founder of Turning Point USA, was shot and killed during a university appearance earlier this week. Authorities say Robinson was arrested and charged after evidence, including texts and surveillance footage, allegedly linked him to the crime.

The killing has triggered reactions across the political spectrum, with some on the left openly expressing approval.

Since the shooting, several individuals have faced disciplinary measures over social media posts that appeared to celebrate or mock Kirk's death.

MSNBC ended its relationship with analyst Matthew Dowd after he linked the killing to Kirk's rhetoric. Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel's show was pulled off the air indefinitely following comments he made about the assassination.

Other organizations, including Nasdaq, the US Secret Service, United Airlines, Fox Sports, and the Washington Post have also taken action against staff.US Vice President J.D. Vance has called on the public to report individuals who praise or joke about the killing to their employers.

BEIRUT, September 18. /TASS/. Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Sheibani and Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer held US-brokered talks in London on Wednesday.

According to Syria TV, the two ministers discussed a new draft agreement on measures of security that would replace the Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Syria of 1974. The meeting lasted for five hours. US Special Envoy for the Middle East Tom Barrack, who acts as a go-between at the talks, took part.

President of Syria for the transitional period Ahmed al-Sharaa said earlier that contacts with Israel on potential agreements on security measures ""may yield results with the coming days."" However, he demanded that UN observers be redeployed to the Golan Heights. He insisted that Israel ""respect Syria's territorial integrity and stop violating its airspace.""

According to the Al Nahar newspaper, Israel's draft is based on the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of 1979. Israel insists on establishing three demilitarized zones southwest of Damascus, where various security regimes will be in place depending on the distance from the Israeli border. Syria will be allowed to deploy police forces to these zones but flights over them will be banned.

Israel will retain control of Mount Hermon (Jabal El Sheikh) it took in December 2024 after the change of power in Damascus.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

CARACAS, September 18. /TASS/. Venezuela's armed forces have begun the Sovereign Caribbean 200 military maneuver near the island of La Orchila in Venezuela's territorial waters.

""At the instruction of Venezuela's constitutional President Nicolas Maduro, I order to begin the Sovereign Caribbean exercise, which will strengthen our defense capacity,"" Venezolana de Television quoted Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez as saying.

According to the minister, the three-day drills will involve all types of the Venezuelan armed forces: aerospace, special, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, naval, airborne, ground, and aerospace defense forces.

The drills are conducted amid the deployment of US naval forces in the Caribbean, when, according to President Maduro, Venezuela is faced with the biggest threat of a US aggression it has seen in the past 100 years.

Reuters reported on August 19, citing Pentagon sources, that three US missile destroyers (USS Gravely, USS Jason Dunham and USS Sampson) had been deployed near Venezuela as part of an effort to address threats from Latin American drug cartels. Other reports mentioned the deployment of the USS Newport News submarine, the USS Lake Erie missile cruiser, landing ships and 4,500 troops. According to the New York Times, US President Donald Trump has secretly signed a directive to the Pentagon to begin using military force against certain Latin American drug cartels.

Washington claims that Venezuela is not doing enough to combat drug trafficking.

Greg Abbott's latest move fuels clash between US red states and blue-state shield laws protecting abortion care

Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, on Wednesday signed into law a bill that lets people sue anyone suspected of manufacturing, distributing or mailing abortion pills to or from Texas. The first-of-its-kind law is almost certain to dramatically escalate the state-by-state showdown over abortion laws in the post Roe v Wade United States – especially as some out-of-state abortion providers have already vowed that they will continue shipping pills to Texans.

“Our mantra as a practice is: ‘No anticipatory obedience',” said Dr Angel Foster, co-founder of the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project (Map), a Boston-area based group that uses telemedicine to ship abortion pills to patients across the United States. “We will continue to provide care until we are legally unable to do so in Massachusetts.”

Under the new law, which will take effect 4 December, abortion providers could face penalties of at least $100,000 if they mail pills into the state, which bans virtually all abortions. Pharmaceutical manufacturers who make drugs that Texans use for abortions could also be found liable, but they may be able to defend themselves by proving in court that they adopted and implemented “a policy to not distribute, mail, transport, deliver, provide, or possess abortion-inducing drugs” – though the language of the law is somewhat ambiguous on whether that provision applies to Texas or more broadly. Women who take abortion pills are not eligible to be sued.

“We want to create liability for manufacturers that Aid Access is using,” said John Seago, president of Texas Right to Life and a chief backer of the new legislation, in an interview before the bill's passage. Aid Access is one of the biggest telemedicine abortion services in the US. It shipped almost 120,000 packs of abortion pills to US residents between 2023 and 2024.

Seago continued: “The best we can do at this point is create a higher liability and start trying to deter some of those individuals.”

The law represents the cutting edge of the anti-abortion movement's campaign against abortion pills and telehealth, which have become increasingly popular in the years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. By the end of 2024, one in four US abortions were being facilitated through telemedicine, according to #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning. #WeCount found that, in December 2024, nearly 4,000 Texans used telehealth to end their pregnancies.

Providers like the Map mail pills under legal innovations known as “shield laws”, which have been enacted by a handful of blue states and aim to protect abortion providers from out-of-state prosecutions when they send pills into states with bans. However, shield laws have yet to be seriously tested in court.

Rachel Rebouché, professor at the University of Texas, Austin School of Law who studies shield laws, said Texas's new law is the first legislative challenge to shield laws. But the state has already challenged them in other ways. The Texas attorney general, Republican Ken Paxton, has sent cease-and-desist letters to abortion pill providers and a website that provides information about abortion pills. He has also sued a New York doctor accused of mailing abortion pills to a Texan, as well as a New York court official who said New York's shield law prevented him from enforcing a Texas fine against the doctor. New York's attorney general, Letitia James, has declared that she will intervene in that lawsuit.

Many post-Roe abortion pill providers, Rebouché pointed out, have already accepted that their work involves a great deal of risk. “But it might chill, it might hamper or dissuade people who don't want to be implicated, who don't want to face the risk of liability.”

Her Safe Harbor, an organization that uses shield laws to mail abortion pills to people and received one of Paxton's cease-and-desist letters, has no plans to block Texans from its services, said Debra Lynch, a nurse practitioner who works with the group, in an interview before Abbott signed the law. In fact, as the Texas law neared passage in the state legislature, Her Safe Harbor started receiving so many requests for help from patients that it had to double its number of abortion providers, according to Lynch.

“Even if a law was passed that said they would come after us criminally and not civilly – that would not have any impact whatsoever on the services that we provide,” Lynch said. “It's important that women know that.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Critics condemn reopening of ‘Camp J' unit at Angola in service of Trump's nationwide immigration crackdown, noting its history of brutality and violence

There were no hurricanes in the Gulf, as can be typical for Louisiana in late July – but Governor Jeff Landry quietly declared a state of emergency. The Louisiana state penitentiary at Angola – the largest maximum security prison in the country – was out of bed space for “violent offenders” who would be “transferred to its facilities”, he warned in an executive order.

The emergency declaration allowed for the rapid refurbishing of a notorious, shuttered housing unit at Angola formerly known as Camp J – commonly referred to by prisoners as “the dungeon” because it was once used to house men in extended solitary confinement, sometimes for years on end.

For over a month, the Landry administration was tight-lipped regarding the details of their plan for Camp J, and the emergency order wasn't picked up by the news media for several days.

But the general understanding among Louisiana's criminal justice observers was that the move was in response to a predictable overcrowding in state prisons due to Landry's own “tough-on-crime” policies. Though Louisiana already had the highest incarceration rate in the country before he got into office, Landry has pushed legislation to increase sentences, abolish parole, and put 17-year-olds in adult prisons.

Advocates swiftly objected to the reopening of Camp J, noting its history of brutality and violence. Ronald Marshall served 25 years in the Louisiana prison system, including a number of them in solitary confinement at Camp J, and called it the worst place he ever served time.

“It was horrible,” Marshall said.

It turns out, however, that Landry's emergency order and the renovation of Camp J was not done to accommodate the state's own growing prison population. It was in service of Donald Trump's nationwide immigration crackdown.

Earlier in September, Landry was joined by officials in the president's administration in front of the renovated facility to announce that it would be used to house the “worst of the worst” immigrant detainees picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents.

“The Democrats' open border policies have allowed for the illegal entry of violent criminals,” Landry said. “Rapists, child-predators, human traffickers, and drug dealers who have left a path of death and destruction throughout America.”

Numerous studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit serious crimes at lower rates than US citizens – and that increased undocumented immigration does not lead to higher crime rates in specific localities.

The rollout highlights the way the Trump administration and conservative officials are seeking to blur the legally clear distinction between civil immigration detainees and people serving sentences in prison for criminal convictions – this time by utilizing a prison with a long history of violence and brutality, along with a fundamentally racist past.

The Angola facility – which Trump's White House dubbed the “Louisiana lockup” – follows the opening of other high-profile facilities with alliterative names by states across the country, including in Florida, Nebraska and Indiana. It will have the capacity to house more than 400 detainees, officials said.

Recently, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a list of 51 detainees they said were already being held at the Angola facility and who allegedly have prior criminal convictions for serious charges. But while the Trump administration similarly claimed that the Florida lockup dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” would house only the worst criminal offenders, a report by the Miami Herald found that hundreds of people sent there had no criminal charges at all.

Ice has long utilized former jails and prisons as detention facilities. But there are few prisons in the country with the name recognition of Angola. And the decision to use Angola appears to be as much about trading on the prison's reputation as it does about security or practicality.

At a 3 September news conference, DHS secretary Kristi Noem called the prison “legendary” and “notorious”.

Once a plantation with enslaved people, the rural prison occupies nearly 30 sq miles of land on the banks of the Mississippi river about an hour drive north of Baton Rouge, Louisiana's capital. Throughout the 20th century, it gained a reputation as one of the country's worst prisons – due to the living and working conditions, abuse by guards and endemic violence.

In 1951, dozens of prisoners slashed their achilles tendons to protest brutality at the facility.

Medical and mental healthcare at the prison has likewise been abysmal. As recently as 2023, a federal judge found that the deficiencies in treatment at the facility amounted to “abhorrent” cruel and unusual punishment, resulting in untold numbers of avoidable complications and preventable deaths.

The prison has also maintained clear visual ties to its plantation past by continuing to operate as a working farm, where mostly Black prisoners pick crops under the watch of primarily white guards. Today, there is ongoing litigation attempting to end the practice of forced agricultural labor at the prison, which is known as the “farm line” and is required of most prisoners at some point during their sentences. Some prisoners can make as little as two cents an hour for their labor, and some are paid nothing at all.

Civil rights attorneys have argued that the farm line serves “no legitimate penological or institutional purpose” and instead is “designed to ‘break' incarcerated men and ensure their submission”.

Nora Ahmed, legal director at the ACLU of Louisiana, said that the Angola immigration detention facility seemed like a clear attempt by the Trump administration to use the prison's name recognition to further their goal of associating undocumented immigrants with criminals.

“Angola's history as a plantation and the abuse and allegations that have surrounded Angola as an institution is meant to strike fear in the American public,” Ahmed said. “It's the imagery that is deeply problematic.”

The Angola facility is also in some ways the natural result of aligning local, state and national trends and policies related to incarceration, immigrant detention and deportations.

Louisiana has become a nationwide hub for immigrant detention and deportations. Sheriffs across the state have signed contracts with Ice in recent years to let them use their local jails as detention facilities. And Louisiana now has the second largest population of immigrant detainees in the country – after Texas. A small airport in Alexandria, Louisiana, has been the takeoff location for more deportation flights during Trump's second presidency than anywhere else.

It's also not the first time the state has utilized Angola for something other than housing state prisoners.

In 2022, Louisiana's office of juvenile justice moved dozens of juvenile detainees to a renovated former death row facility on the grounds of Angola, a move that was met with litigation and outcry from youth advocates. While state officials made assurances that they would be kept separated from the adult population, youths at the facility reported being abused by guards, denied education and kept in their cells for long stretches of time.

Eventually, a judge ruled that they would need to be moved, calling the conditions “intolerable”.

Louisiana also briefly utilized Camp J in 2020 to house incarcerated pretrial detainees from local jails around the state who had contracted Covid-19.

Pictures and videos from the new immigration facility during a tour given to reporters show that while the facility may have been renovated, it still looks decidedly prison-like. Cells have single-beds cells with metal toilets and bars in the front. There are also a number of outdoor metal chain-link cages at the facility, resembling kennels. It is unclear what they will be used for.

A DHS spokesperson did not respond to specific questions from the Guardian but instead forwarded the press release with the criminal histories of some of the detainees currently being held at the facility. The Louisiana department of corrections did not respond to emailed questions.

The former Camp J is now emblazoned with “Camp 57” – after the fact that Landry is Louisiana's 57th governor. Photos captured by Louisiana news station WAFB showed the area had been painted with a sign reading “Camp 47” in a nod to Trump, who was sworn into office in January as the 47th US president. But officials evidently changed their minds about that name and then touted it as Camp 57 when it was unveiled.

Marshall, now the chief policy analyst for the advocacy organization Voice of the Experienced, said much of what made Camp J so bad were guards that staffed the facility, who promoted a culture of abuse, violence and desperation. But he said that he had little optimism that the conditions would improve under Ice leadership.

“Camp J has that reputation,” he said. “It has a spirit there – like it possesses those who are in control or have authority.”

Marshall also said that when he was in Camp J there was a sense that prisoners could at least attempt to appeal to the federal government to get relief from the brutal conditions. Now, that's no longer the case. “You can't cry out to the federal government for help, because the federal government is actually creating the circumstances,” Marshall said.

The problem with conflating civil immigration detention with prison is not only that it sends a message to the public that undocumented individuals are all criminals, Ahmed said – but also that they are entitled to all the legal rights that people being held in the criminal context are entitled to.

“By attaching criminality to people in immigration detention, the suggestion to the American public is also that those individuals have a [constitutional] right to counsel,” she said. “Which they do not. This is civil detention, and people are not entitled to have an attorney to vindicate their rights.”

There are still unanswered questions about the facility – including who paid for the renovations, whether or not it is being managed by a private prison contractor, or what the conditions are like for detainees. But in these early stages, the Trump administration is already touting the facility as a national model.

“Look behind us, Louisiana,” US attorney general Pam Bondi said at the press conference in front of the new facility. “You're going to be an example for the rest of this country.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukrainian forces have liberated 160 square kilometers (60 square miles) of territory during an ongoing ""counteroffensive operation"" in eastern Donetsk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 18.

Ukrainian forces have spent the past month pushing Russian troops back after they advanced 15-20 kilometers (6 miles) toward the strategic Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway, near the embattled city of Pokrovsk. Since late August, Ukrainian units have regained control of multiple villages in the area.

Seven settlements have been retaken in the Dobropillia and Pokrovsk sectors during the operation, Zelensky said, citing a report from Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi.

Ukrainian troops have also captured nearly 100 Russian soldiers, according to the president.

""Ukraine is rightfully defending its positions and its land,"" Zelensky said. ""We are disrupting all of Russia's plans — plans to destroy our state.""

Zelensky said an additional 170 kilometers (106 miles) of Ukrainian territory ""have been cleared of Russian forces."" However, the president did not provide further details about the condition or strategic status of the areas.

""Russian losses since the start of our counteroffensive just in the Pokrovsk direction, over the past few weeks, exceed 2,500. Of those, over 1,300 Russian soldiers have been killed, ""Zelensky said, adding that Ukraine's counteroffensive operations in Donetsk Oblast are ongoing.

Zelensky also renewed his call for continued military aid from international partners and urged the tightening of sanctions to pressure Russia into peace negotiations.

The statement comes amid more frequent counterattacks by the Ukrainian side, which has been in a strategic defensive posture along the front line in eastern Ukraine for nearly two years.

Ukrainian forces liberated the village of Zarichne in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 8. The operation was carried out by soldiers of the 425th Assault Regiment, better known as Skelia.

Earlier this month, the same unit reported clearing Novoekonomichne and Udachne, two villages in the area of the embattled city Pokrovsk.

Russia, however, pursued offensive operations at a high intensity across the front line over summer. According to the Ukrainian mapping and monitoring group Deep State, Russian forces occupied 1,548 square kilometers over summer, significantly more than the 659 square kilometres taken in the equivalent period in 2024.

Zelensky warned on Sept. 16 that Russia is preparing two major offensive operations for the fall. Yet, sustained losses in personnel and equipment may hinder Moscow's ability to carry them out, the president added.

King Charles III voiced support for Ukraine during a state dinner with U.S. President Donald Trump in Windsor on Sept. 17.

""Today, as tyranny once again threatens Europe, we and our allies stand together in support of Ukraine, to deter aggression and secure peace,"" the king said. 

Trump was seen nodding during King Charles's speech, without commenting on it afterward.

The king's remarks come amid Trump's efforts to bring an end to Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, even as Moscow continues to reject a ceasefire, regularly launches attacks on Ukraine, and recently said talks with Kyiv are on ""pause.""

Despite this, Trump has not imposed additional sanctions on Russia. Before his second state visit to the U.K., the U.S. president reiterated that President Volodymyr Zelensky ""is going to have to make a deal"" with Russia. 

After his meeting with the royal family, Trump is scheduled to meet with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is also involved in peace efforts.

Members of the royal family have consistently expressed their support for Ukraine throughout the Russian war, a stance some experts view as a form of soft power.

Zelensky met with King Charles several times, including following a White House clash with Trump earlier this year.

In Tales from the Golden Age, retirees talk about their spending, savings and whether life after work is what they expected. For more articles in this series, click here.

Roger Jackson, 65, Sudbury, Ont.

I retired in April, 2024, at the age of 63, after working for 42 years as a geologist, first in the oil exploration industry and then in the mining industry. After leaving my job at a major mining company in April, 2022, I planned to do some part-time consulting work for five years, but then decided to retire after just two years for a few reasons. 

Over the past few years, I'd spoken to family and friends who had unfortunately become terminally ill and, in their final days, they all said roughly the same thing: In retrospect, it didn't matter how big their house was or how many horsepower their pickup truck had. They said, if they could go back in time, they would've spent more of their time travelling the world, more time with their kids, and they would have laughed more – even at work. I said to myself, ‘That's going to be me.'

Also, I'm divorced and have a son with Down Syndrome, now in his mid-30s, and I wanted us to spend even more time together travelling while we both can. I have the time, the money and no restrictions. Leading up to, and since retirement, my son has kissed the Blarney Stone in Ireland, ridden a camel in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco and climbed the Great Wall of China, to name just a few experiences. He also loves karaoke and has sung in 30 countries (so far). We're fulfilling my dreams and his interests, and he has experienced more world-class adventures than any other adult I know.

In early 2011, I had the opportunity to convert my defined-benefit pension from a previous employer into a defined-contribution pension. I allocated the majority of those assets to U.S. equities, specifically tracking the S&P 500, which has performed exceptionally well. I'm comfortable as a do-it-yourself investor; however, I do periodic reviews with the retirement specialist at my local bank, who provides a ‘sanity check' of my financial activities and planning. 

I've decided to delay receiving my Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security benefits until age 70, at which time the benefit payments will have grown significantly. I treat these as reserve funds that can be sourced sooner if something drastic were to happen.

When not travelling, I swim once or twice a day and go to the gym. Sudbury is a regional hub for geology and engineering associations and businesses, and there are numerous scientific and mining industry events to keep my gray matter spinning.

What I love most about retirement is that I'm in control of my life, which is headed in exactly the direction I had envisioned for decades. 

My advice for others approaching retirement is to explore the world. Don't just dream about what's out there, go and experience first-hand the prehistoric, historic and cultural sites. Also, stay physically and mentally fit and maintain and expand your social networks. Get off the couch and get out there!

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - September 18, 2025) - World Copper Ltd. (TSXV: WCU) (OTCQB: WCUFF) (FSE: 7LY0) (""World Copper"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to provide an update on the recently announced definitive arrangement agreement (the ""Arrangement Agreement"") entered into between Plata Latina Minerals Corporation (""Plata Latina"") and World Copper on July 22, 2025 for the sale of the Zonia copper project (the ""Zonia Project"") to Plata Latina by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement (the ""Arrangement"") announced on July 23, 2025 (see news release).

Transaction Recap

Transaction Update & Next Steps

World Copper is pleased to announce that it has obtained an interim order (the ""Interim Order"") of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in connection with the Arrangement, which is to be completed by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The Interim Order provides for the holding of a special meeting (the ""Meeting"") of World Copper shareholders to consider and vote on a special resolution approving the Arrangement (the ""Arrangement Resolution""). The Meeting is scheduled to be held at World Copper's offices located at 1570 - 200 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on October 16, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. (Vancouver time) and the record date for determining World Copper shareholders entitled to receive notice of and vote at the Meeting was fixed as at the close of business on August 26, 2025. All of World Copper's insiders and certain other World Copper shareholders representing approximately 29% of the issued and outstanding World Copper shares have entered into voting and support agreements to support the Arrangement.

Meeting Materials

In connection with the Meeting, World Copper will be mailing the joint management information circular of Plata Latina and World Copper (the ""Circular""), letter of transmittal and related meeting materials (collectively, the ""Meeting Materials"") to World Copper shareholders. Shareholders are urged to carefully review all Meeting Materials as they contain important information concerning the Arrangement and the rights and entitlements of the shareholders in relation thereto. The Meeting Materials will also be available under World Copper's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca once they have been sent to shareholders in the coming days.

Investors are cautioned that, except as disclosed in the Circular prepared in connection with the Arrangement, any information released or received with respect to the Arrangement may not be accurate or complete and should not be relied upon.

Timing to Closing

Subject to obtaining the final order of the Court approving the Arrangement, the required approvals from World Copper's shareholders at the Meeting, the required approvals from Plata Latina shareholders at the special meeting of Plata Latina shareholders, required regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction of all other conditions to implementing the Arrangement as set out in the Arrangement Agreement, the Arrangement is anticipated to be completed in October 2025.

Gordon Neal, World Copper CEO, stated: ""In a market where a copper deficit has been creating rising copper prices, the Zonia Project was a primary asset to be put back into production in the Unites States. We had many offers for strategic partnerships to develop the Zonia Project, but we believe that the Plata Latina team will bring the best value to World Copper shareholders. World Copper shareholders will benefit from holding both Plata Latina and World Copper shares upon completion of the Arrangement. I want to thank shareholders for their patience as we navigate through this process and work on the next steps to deliver value.""

Termination of At-The-Market Equity Program

World Copper also announces the termination of its at-the-market equity program (the ""ATM Program""), previously announced in the Company's news release dated July 18, 2024. The ATM Program previously allowed World Copper to issue and sell common shares from treasury having an aggregate gross sales amount of up to $25,000,000 through BMO Capital Markets, acting as sole agent. The ATM Program was originally implemented to raise funds for advancing the Zonia Project and for general working capital purposes. The decision to terminate the ATM Program was made in anticipation of the sale of the Zonia Project to Plata Latina pursuant to the Arrangement. As of the termination date, the ATM Program generated aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $3,501,949.

Rare-earth mining in Myanmar is polluting the Mekong River with toxic metals, threatening ecosystems, food security, and water supplies across mainland Southeast Asia.

Ecologists are warning that mainland Southeast Asia faces a looming ecological disaster unless urgent steps are taken to address the rare-earth mining boom in war-torn Myanmar.

According to Global Witness, a London-based watchdog, Myanmar has become the world's largest source of heavy rare-earth elements. These minerals are essential for manufacturing high-tech products like wind turbines, electric vehicles and medical devices.

Most of these mines are located in Shan state, where civil war has raged since the 2021 military coup.

Earlier this year, Thailand's Department of Pollution Control found arsenic levels nearly four times higher than World Health Organization (WHO) limits in parts of the Kok River, a Mekong tributary flowing into Thailand from Myanmar. Other toxic metals were also detected at dangerous levels.

The Kok runs through northern Thailand's Chiang Rai province before merging with the Mekong, where arsenic concentrations have also reportedly been detected. 

The Mekong is Southeast Asia's longest river, which provides a lifeline for millions. Experts fear the contamination could seep into irrigation systems that feed vast stretches of the region's farmland and drinking water supplies. The WHO has reportedthat prolonged exposure to arsenic and other metals can cause cancer, neurological disorders and organ failure. 

""What we see now is just the beginning,"" Pianporn Deetes, campaigns director at International Rivers, a conservation NGO, told DW. 

""If left unchecked, the situation could deteriorate rapidly — potentially hundreds of unregulated mines upstream, heavy contamination spreading through the Mekong and its tributaries, and ultimately acidification of waters reaching as far as the seas,"" she said.

After petitions from local communities in June, Thai authorities proposed building underwater sediment barriers or mini-dams on the Kok to trap toxic deposits before they reach villages.

Environmental groups say such infrastructure will take years to complete, while the crisis is already unfolding.

Bangkok has few options. The problem lies largely within Myanmar's borders, particularly in Shan state, where new mines are located in territory controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), a powerful China-backed militia that oversees two semi-autonomous enclaves.

Reuters has reported that the UWSA provides armed protection for Chinese-run mining operations there. Neither Myanmar's military rulers nor international organizations exert meaningful control over the region.

Currently, it is unknown whether the pollution has remained concentrated in northern Thailand or whether it has already leached into the Mekong, potentially affecting downstream nations.

It is ""extremely likely"" that toxic metals and chemicals are already detectable in Cambodia, where 60% of the country's protein intake comes from wild-caught fish from the Mekong River, Brian Eyler, director of the Stimson Center's Southeast Asia Program, told DW.

In recent weeks, civil society groups have called for stronger action from the Mekong River Commission (MRC), an intergovernmental body set up by Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam in the 1990s to manage the shared waterway.

""The MRC should urgently establish monitoring stations for heavy metals and ensure that communities across the basin have timely access to accurate and transparent information,"" Pianporn urged.

But the MRC has so far downplayed the threat. In July, it reported arsenic levels above safety limits at four of five sampling sites in Thailand and Laos, yet described the situation only as a ""moderately serious transboundary environmental issue.""

Many analysts agree that ultimate responsibility lies with Beijing, which controls about 60% of global rare-earth production and nearly 90% of refining.

China, the world's largest user of rare-earth minerals, outlawed many forms of rare-earth mining at home in the 2010s because of concerns about the environmental damage it brings.

However, these environmental safeguards triggered many Chinese companies to move south and set up their operations across the border in Myanmar's Kachin and Shan states.

In 2018, Myanmar's civilian-led government had banned exports and ordered Chinese miners to wind down operations, but since 2021, extraction has continued amid a widening civil conflict.

Beijing has ""effectively exported demand for rare-earth mineral extraction to other countries. And now the practice has proliferated in Myanmar's ethnic autonomous regions next door, where it is booming in an unregulated fashion,"" said Eyler.

Beijing should guarantee that all rare-earth imports come only from mines that comply with its laws and environmental standards, Pianporn told DW.  

""If China is serious about leading on 'ecological civilization,' it must act in an accountable and transparent way,"" she added. 

However, a tougher response from Beijing would work against China's own self-interest, as the global race for rare earths is intensifying geopolitical struggle for control of these critical materials.

It would also go against the way China typically conducts foreign policy in regions like Southeast Asia, noted Assistant Professor Dulyapak Preecharatch, lecturer in Southeast Asian Studies at Thammasat University.

In bilateral dealings, China always emphasizes the principle of state sovereignty, in which Beijing stresses that it does not interfere in the affairs of another country, including its environmental legislation.

As such, Beijing can say that it has no influence over rare-earth mining in Myanmar because oversight of environmental damage falls within Myanmar's sovereignty, nor is there a need for China ""to consider problems for other downstream states,"" Preecharatch told DW.

The rare-earth rush is not limited to Myanmar. At least 15 mines have been identified along tributaries of the Mekong in Laos. Cambodia currently lacks active large-scale rare-earth mines, but exploration is ongoing.

Environmentalists fear a regional chain reaction of pollution on the Mekong.

""This situation is likely going to get much worse before it gets any better,"" Eyler of the Stimson Center told DW.

""It's possible that the entire river's fish population becomes contaminated, and the floodplains, which are an agricultural production zone for the world, are unusable for a long period of time,"" he added.

For now, the Mekong is still seen as one of the world's great clean rivers. But experts fear that reputation may soon be lost.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that Germany ""harms its own soul"" when criticism of Israel becomes a pretext for antisemitism. Merz said without Germany's Jews there ""can be no good future"" for the country.

The Central Council of Jews in Germany on Wednesday called on the government in Berlin to continue to lend its support to Israel 'unconditionally.'

Chancellor Friedrich Merz joined the group in Frankfurt, to commemorate 75 years since its foundation.

Germany's Central Council of Jews was founded in Frankfurt, five years after the end of World War II. The organization considers itself the political, social and religious representative of the German Jewish community.

""Germany must stand clearly on the side of Israel,"" Council president Josef Schuster said. 

Schuster called on Merz not to be ""dissuaded from this ""path""— neither by other European countries nor by ""individual lawmakers.""

Since the conflict in Gaza erupted, Germany has been one of Israel's most important supporters.

The Merz administration has been more vocal than the previous government in its criticism of Israel's campaign in the Gaza Strip.

But his government still opposes EU sanctions on Israel over the attacks on the Palestinian territory.

Merz rejected ""criticism of Israel"" if it serves as a pretext for antisemitism. 

Criticism of the Israeli government must be possible, Merz said, ""but our country harms its own soul when this criticism becomes a pretext for hatred of Jews—or when it even leads to demands that the Federal Republic turn away from Israel.""

""We are all called upon to show civil courage wherever we witness antisemitism, racism, or discrimination,"" Merz added.

""The Federal Republic would have been forever uprooted without Jewish life and Jewish culture in our country,"" the chancellor said.

Merz sent a message to Jewish people in Germany, saying that without them, ""there can be no good future for the Federal Republic.""

A key Gazprom refinery in Russia's Bashkortostan region caught fire after a Ukrainian drone strike. The attack on one of Russia's largest plants — far from Ukraine — comes as fuel shortages grow Follow DW for the latest.

Ukrainian drones have hit a major Gazprom-run oil refinery in Russia's Bashkortostan region, igniting a fire some 1,400 kilometers from the front line.

Ukraine's SBU security agency called it a strike on ""the heart"" of one of Russia's largest facilities, aiming to cut Moscow's war funds.

The attack adds to a summer of refinery hits that have driven fuel prices up and forced Russia to extend a petrol export ban as the U.S. pushes allies to curb Russian energy sales.

Here is a roundup of this and other events from Russia's war in Ukraine on Thursday, September 18.

Ukraine's National Police say a Russian guided bomb strike killed five people in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kostiantynivka on Thursday.

Police reported on Telegram that the strike occurred around 10 a.m. (0700 GMT), killing two women and three men and damaging four residential buildings.

Russian forces are currently within 8 to 10 kilometers (5 to 6 miles) of the city, according to the open-source mapping project DeepState.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has met soldiers in eastern Donetsk, where Ukrainian forces are fighting Russian advances on multiple fronts.

There, he said, Ukrainian forces are pushing back Russian troops, reclaiming seven settlements and about 160 square kilometers (62 square miles).

""I met with our warriors taking part in the Dobropillia counter-offensive. I spoke with the defenders, thanked them for their achievements, and presented them with state awards,"" Zelenskyy wrote on X after the visit.

Zelenskyy described heavy fighting near the town of Dobropillia, where Russia advanced rapidly in mid-August, and around the strategic hub of Pokrovsk.

""Our forces are depriving the occupier of the opportunity to carry out a full-fledged offensive operation, which they had been planning for a long time and counting on,"" he said later in a video address.

Russian forces have attacked railway infrastructure in central Ukraine's Poltava region, wounding five people, officials say.

Regional governor Volodymyr Kohut said an assault in the Myrhorod district injured one person and sparked fires. State rail operator Ukrzaliznytsia reported temporary power cuts at several stations and passenger train delays of up to three hours.

Emergency services said a late-evening drone strike also damaged a fuel station, causing a fire and injuring four more people.

The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 48 of 75 drones launched by Russia and recorded 26 drone hits at six sites. Recent months have seen repeated Russian attacks on rail hubs in the Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Kirovohrad regions.

Ukrainian troops and engineers are to work with Polish counterparts in a joint group to counter drones, Ukrainian Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal says, a week after Russian drones crossed into Poland.

""We are talking about training engineers and training soldiers who will withstand and defend the air domain,"" Shmyhal told reporters at a Kyiv press conference alongside Poland's defense minister.

""We are not only talking about interceptor drones, because this is only the tip of this iceberg which allows us to defend our sky together,"" he added.

More than 20 Russian drones entered Polish airspace on the night of September 9–10, prompting NATO jets to shoot down some of them and raising alarm in Warsaw over Moscow's willingness to test the alliance's resolve.

Ukraine has taken back 1,000 bodies of fallen soldiers from Russia, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War says.

""Repatriation measures took place today. 1,000 bodies, which according to the Russian side belong to Ukrainian servicemen, have been returned to Ukraine,"" the agency stated on Telegram.

Ukrainian drones struck a major Gazprom-run oil refinery in Russia's central Bashkortostan autonomous region, sparking a fire about 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) from the front line, officials from both countries say.

A source in Ukraine's SBU security agency on Thursday said the attack targeted ""the heart"" of the facility, one of Russia's largest, as part of a campaign to cut Moscow's energy revenues that fund its war. Unverified images on Russian social media showed flames and a dark smoke plume.

Regional leader Radiy Khabirov confirmed that ""two drones attacked the facility,"" reporting no casualties and saying security forces fired on the aircraft while crews worked to extinguish the blaze and assess damage.

A summer of strikes has already knocked out a notable share of Russia's refining capacity, driving fuel prices higher and causing petrol shortages. The Kremlin has extended a ban on petrol exports, and Gazprom Neft said it delayed maintenance at another site to avoid worsening the crunch.

The United States is also seeking to curb Russia's energy earnings, with President Donald Trump raising tariffs on India over its Russian oil purchases, warning China, and pressing Europe to follow suit.

Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show has been pulled following his “offensive” comments about Charlie Kirk's death.

Disney's ABC said it would take Jimmy Kimmel Live! off air “indefinitely” after Nexstar Media, one of the biggest owners of television stations in the US, said it would no longer broadcast the show on local stations.

Kimmel, whose show has been on air for over 22 years, said that a “Maga gang” was trying to score political points from Kirk's killing, sparking a backlash from conservatives who accused the comedian of being tone deaf.

Donald Trump, currently in London for a state visit, hailed the show's cancellation as “great news for America”.

“The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED,” the US president – who has frequently been the target of Mr Kimmel's jokes – said on Truth Social.

“Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible.”

The White House has signalled a crackdown on Left-wing groups in the wake of Kirk's assassination, while Mr Trump has repeatedly sued, berated and threatened media companies whose coverage he disputes, with legal or other action.

The killing has sparked a wave of anxiety about increasing political violence in America, with Mr Trump blaming the “radical Left”. Critics have accused the president of using Kirk's assassination as a pretext to crack down on political opponents.

Responding to the reaction in the aftermath of the shooting, Kimmel said: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the Maga gang desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

He then mocked Mr Trump's reaction to the tragedy, in which the US president responded to a question about how he was holding up by saying “very good”, before providing an update on the White House ballroom's construction.

“He's at the fourth stage of grief, construction,” Kimmel quipped. “This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he called a friend. This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.”

In a statement on Wednesday, Nexstar said that its “owned and partner television stations affiliated with the ABC Television Network will pre-empt Jimmy Kimmel Live! for the foreseeable future, beginning with tonight's show”.

This means that it will replace the regularly scheduled programme with a different broadcast.

The company said it had made its decision because it “strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk”.

It added that it will “replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets”.

Around 30 minutes after its condemnation of Kimmel, Nexstar confirmed that it plans to formally submit a merger application, which will require federal approval.

Kirk, 31, was shot dead during a talk at an event at Utah Valley University last Wednesday.

At the time of his killing, Kirk was hosting one of his “prove me wrong” events, where he debates students on hot-button issues, as part of his American Comeback tour.

On Tuesday, Tyler Robinson, 22, from Utah, was charged with aggravated murder for Kirk's assassination.

Earlier on Wednesday, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr described Kimmel's comments as “truly sick” and threatened ABC and Disney, urging them to “take action” against Kimmel.

“This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” he told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson.

“These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”

He added: “They have a licence granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest.”

Several public figures jumped to Kimmel's defence.

Ben Stiller, the actor and film-maker, wrote on X “this isn't right” alongside news about the cancellation.

American author Joyce Carol Oates said it was “sad” that a host would be “abruptly fired for anything he says however awkward or inappropriate”.

“If a joke is in poor taste or falls flat the audience's silence is punishment enough for the comic,” Oates wrote.

“Certainly it's ‘free speech' for me, censorship for you. Whatever your politics that is irrefutable.”

California governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, accused the Republican Party of a “dangerous” coordinated attack on free speech and warned Americans “they are censoring you in real time”.

Mr Newsom listed “buying and controlling media platforms”, “firing commentators” and “cancelling shows” as examples.

“These aren't coincidences,” he wrote on X.

Kimmel's cancellation comes after Stephen Colbert's Late Show on CBS was scrapped for describing Paramount's decision to pay a $16m settlement to Trump over another flagship show, 60 Minutes, amounted to a “big fat bribe”.

Mr Trump celebrated Colbert's firing at the time.

The president this week also filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times and book publisher Penguin Random House, accusing them of treating him unfairly.

He also sued the Wall Street Journal for $10bn over its reporting on his links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

When Paramount settled its lawsuit with Mr Trump, it was awaiting the FCC's approval for a merger with Skydance media, which was ultimately granted.

The deal was approved after the Trump suit was settled and after the FCC under Carr opened a probe into the Harris interview on 60 Minutes.

In this instance, Nexstar Media Group is in the middle of a $6.2bn merger with media company Tegna, which owns or partners with more than 200 television stations in the US. Nexstar condemned Kimmel's “recent comments” in a statement made on Wednesday.

JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, said: “A free and democratic society cannot silence comedians because the president doesn't like what they say... this is an attack on free speech and cannot be allowed to stand.”

Chris Hayes, a MSNBC network host, wrote: “This is the most straightforward attack on free speech from state actors I've ever seen in my life and it's not even close.”

Comedian Roseanne Barr, a Trump supporter, was far less sympathetic to Kimmel. Barr noted that he had mocked her own downfall after the reboot of her 90s sitcom was axed by ABC in 2018 when she shared a tweet that was labelled racist.

“Yeah imagine an administration putting pressure on a television channel to fire a comedian they didn't like,” Barr wrote on X.

She added: “Today is better than my birthday.”

Kirk's killing has sparked an outpouring of schadenfreude from some on the Left, which has been met with reprisals from figures on the Right exposing them on social media.

In the US, a growing number of workers, including university professors, secret service agents and NFL staff, have been fired for appearing to praise the killing or for mocking Kirk including by pointing out his own pro-gun views.

Mr Trump also criticised Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, two other late-night hosts, and said they should be cancelled too, calling them “two total losers”.

Representatives for Kimmel were approached for comment.

“As with other illegal efforts by the government, this too will be challenged and overcome,” said one of his lawyers.

Mahmoud Khalil and his lawyers on Wednesday affirmed their plan to fight an immigration court ruling that paves the way for his deportation, months after plainclothes agents accosted the lawful permanent resident and his US citizen wife outside their home in New York City.

“It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” Khalil said in a statement.

“When their first effort to deport me was set to fail, they resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide,” he continued. “Such fascist tactics will never deter me from continuing to advocate for my people's liberation.”

While President Donald Trump has a broad goal of mass deportations, his administration has targeted Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student with a valid green card, and other foreign scholars in the United States for criticizing Israel's US-backed genocide in the Gaza Strip.

Federal agents arrested Khalil, an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent, in March. He wasn't released from a federal immigration facility until June. During his 104-day detention, his wife, Noor Abdalla, gave birth to their son. Over the past six months, he has been a part of multiple legal battles: his challenge to being deported in a Louisiana immigration court; a civil rights case before US District Judge Michael Farbiarz in New Jersey; and a fight for $20 million in damages.

In a Wednesday letter to Farbiarz — an appointee of former President Joe Biden who has already blocked his deportation while the civil rights case proceeds — Khalil's legal team explained that on September 12, Jamee Comans, an immigration judge (IJ), “issued three separate orders denying petitioner's (1) motion for an extension of time, (2) motion to change venue, and (3) application for a waiver, without conducting an evidentiary hearing.”

“In denying petitioner's request for a waiver absent a hearing, as well as his motions for extension of time and for change of venue, the IJ ordered petitioner removed to Algeria or Syria… while reaffirming her decisions denying petitioner any form of relief from removal,” the letter says. Khalil now has 30 days from September 12 to start an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).

Noting “statements targeting petitioner by name for retaliation and deportation made by the president and several senior US government officials,” Khalil's lawyers “have ample reason to expect that the BIA process — and an affirmance of the IJ's determination — will be swift,” the letter continued. “Upon affirmance by the BIA, petitioner will lose his lawful permanent resident status, including his right to reside and work in the United States, and have a final order of removal against him.”

“Compared to other courts of appeals, including those in the 3rd and 2nd Circuits, the 5th Circuit almost never grants stays of removal to noncitizens pursuing petitions for review of BIA decisions. As a result, the only meaningful impediment to petitioner's physical removal from the United States would be this court's important order prohibiting removal during the pendency of his federal habeas case,” the letter points out, referring to Farbiarz's previous intervention.

The courts are being weaponized to persecute Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., for exercising his 1st Amendment rights.Our taxpayers' dollars are paying for the erosion of our civil and Constitutional rights.Tell us again how the Trump Administration is… https://t.co/3FwGhpxv5S

Khalil is represented by Dratel & Lewis, the Center for Constitutional Rights, Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR), Van Der Hout LLP, Washington Square Legal Services, and the national, New Jersey, New York, and Louisiana arms of the ACLU.

“When the immigration prosecutor, judge, and jailer all answer to Donald Trump, and that one man is eager to weaponize the system in a desperate bid to silence Mahmoud Khalil, a US permanent resident whose only supposed sin is that he stands against an ongoing genocide in Palestine, this is the result,” CLEAR co-director Ramzi Kassem said Wednesday. “A plain-as-day First Amendment violation that also puts on sharp display the rapidly free-falling credibility of the entire US immigration system.”

In addition to calling out the Trump administration for its unconstitutional conduct, Khalil's lawyers expressed some optimism.

“We have witnessed a constant lack of humanity and allegiance to the law throughout proceedings in this farcical Louisiana immigration court, and the immigration judge's September 12 decision is just the most recent example of what occurs when the system requires an arbiter that is anything but neutral to do the administration's bidding,” said Johnny Sinodis, a partner at Van Der Hout LLP. “As with other illegal efforts by the government, this too will be challenged and overcome.”

“History shows us that repression always breeds resistance. Fear can never kill solidarity,” says Chicago organizer Miguel Alvelo Rivera. In this episode of Movement Memos, host Kelly Hayes uplifts the voices of activists and organizers across Chicago as the Trump administration's “Operation Midway Blitz” terrorizes communities across the Chicagoland area. Benji Hart, Stacy Davis Gates, Arti Walker-Peddakotla, Ric Wilson, and others discuss Trump's threats to send in the National Guard, ongoing ICE raids, and the solidarity we need to survive these times.Music by Son Monarcas, Scene, Nyck Caution, Katori Walker, Apollo, Curved Mirror, Daniel Fridell, Scientific, DonVayei, Ballpoint, and Sarah, the Illstrumentalist

Note: This a rush transcript and has been lightly edited for clarity. Copy may not be in its final form.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today, we are talking about Chicago, and what organizers here are up against as waves of federal agents continue to invade the Chicagoland area and attack our neighbors. After declaring war on the city of Chicago with an AI slop image styled after the film Apocalypse Now, Donald Trump recently rolled back plans to send the National Guard to our city, blaming uncooperative officials and so-called “professional agitators” for making Chicago “hostile” to his vision. But while Trump is now redirecting his fascist military theatrics to Memphis, a major Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation is still being deployed in our city and the surrounding area. While ICE agents in Chicago are not being flanked by the National Guard, they are still causing a great deal of harm. 

Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.

Last week, ICE agents killed a man in the village of Franklin Park, about a half-hour outside Chicago. His name was Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez. He was a 38-year-old father of three who had just dropped his youngest child off at daycare moments before being targeted by ICE. Villegas-Gonzalez was from Mexico and had lived in the United States for more than 20 years. The official narrative the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has offered about his death does not match available evidence. 

DHS has also fired tear gas and pepper balls at protesters outside the ICE Processing Center in Broadview, which is the primary processing center for what ICE is calling “Operation Midway Blitz” — the organization's current assault on Chicagoland. The total number of immigrants ICE has detained is unknown at this time, but we know residents have been snatched from their homes, at their jobs, in gas stations, at bus stops, and in front of their crying children.

In addition to organizing in defense of our migrant neighbors, local activists are still cognizant of the possibility that Trump may eventually send troops here, and are thinking about what it means to communicate with, and potentially influence, active members of the military in our streets. 

Today, you will be hearing from organizers and activists across Chicago about the current state of the struggle, what we're up against, and what we need you to know about this moment of turmoil, escalation, and resistance. Our governor, our mayor, and most importantly, the people of Chicago have held the line against Trump's efforts to use our city to further normalize his fascist domestic military occupations. But we are still living through a moment of intense struggle, and gearing up for the long fight ahead. This episode is a true movement memo — a series of messages from the front lines in a moment of intense state violence and federal occupation. I hope you will take the words of my friends and co-strugglers to heart, tell the world what's happening here, and deepen your own commitment to justice work, wherever you are.

[musical interlude]

Benji Hart: Hey, everybody. My name is Benji Hart. I use they/them pronouns. I'm a member of Southside Together. I'm also a member at Concord Missionary Baptist Church. And I'm a resident on the low end in the Bronzeville neighborhood here in Chicago. And I really want to reach out to you, call out to my people across the city, across the country, and hopefully far beyond, to really think about what is most needed in this moment where we can feel so isolated, we can feel so powerless, and bewildered, and overwhelmed by the barrage of things intentionally being launched at us. How do we find our focus? How do we find our footing? And how do we find our grounding to really pose the threat and really be the threat that we can be and that we know we represent or we wouldn't be being suppressed so hard and so violently?

I'm thinking a lot right now about how our actions are disruptive. There's a lot of big demonstrations happening around the country to resist the military occupation of these large democratic, often Black mayor-run cities. And showing mass support that this is not what we want in our communities. And mass resistance to militarization, not just in Chicago and D.C., but globally, I think is so beautiful and so important. And I think we need to be asking critical questions about: Are our actions just showing numbers, and just showing symbolic support for marginalized and repressed communities? Or are they actually disrupting the work of the federal government? Are they actually making the work of ICE and the work of police harder and more difficult?

Because that is so crucial, that actually protecting our communities means making the work that these agencies are trying to do harder. And how do we translate these numbers that we know we have into actions that protect our neighbors and protect ourselves? And I think we're already doing that. That's not to say that that's not happening. It absolutely is. But I really want to encourage folks, especially folks who might be coming out for the first time or coming out in a while, and joining marches against Trump and against the National Guard occupying our communities. Where do you go from there? Where do we go from there?

Whether it's joining an organization, whether it's becoming a part of your local ICE watch, figuring out who's doing the work on your block, in your neighborhood, or even doing that work yourself. How do we actually do things that make it harder for our neighbors to be taken away? How do we actually do things that make the criminalization of ourselves and our communities more difficult? Whether, again, that's actually knowing your rights and making sure that other people who are being targeted know theirs. Whether that's actually blocking ICE from entering a space. Whether that's being present in the neighborhoods that we know are being targeted, to make sure that there's eyes and there's bodies making the work of disappearing people more difficult and harder for them to get away with.

Where do we actually put ourselves to stop the violence from happening, not just show symbolically that we're against it happening? And by that same logic, I think that I'm also seeing still a lot of focus on arguing against the logic of the Trump administration or the logic of militarization. We know that there are so many racist tropes about Chicago being a dangerous, violent, crime-ridden place. And people are right to point out that so many of the investments we've been making in recent years — investments in mental health care, and in non-police crisis responses, and in housing, and so many other things — have actually been very effective at lowering rates of crime and lowering rates of violent crime.

And relying on that argument of proving that we're not the things that people say that we are, is really actually using the logic of the people, of the bodies that are oppressing us, which I think is always ineffective. We know that regardless of what the crime rate is or isn't, the idea that military occupation is the answer is always wrong and is always a threat to Black communities, to Indigenous communities, to undocumented [communities], to Muslim [communities], to all the people that we know need protection right now. And how do we actually get away from using their own logic against them, which I think is always a waste of our time and energy? And saying, We know what this is really about. We know this has nothing to do with crime.

We know this has nothing to do with protecting our communities, because policing, militarization, criminalization, and incarceration are never about that. They never have been and they're not in this moment either. And what we want are the things that have actually been successful in lowering violence and lowering harm in our neighborhoods. And that's violence prevention programs. That's housing, that's well-paying jobs, that's health care, that's public spaces. That's where we want to see our resources go. And again, the point of saying that is not to convince the people who are hell-bent on occupying and suppressing us.

The point is to get on the same page and to create a container that other people can join to say, Here's what we're actually fighting for. It may be clearer in this moment what we're fighting against, and that's important too, to have that clarity. But what are we fighting for? And in place of occupation, in place of militarization, in place of policing, and of environmental devastation, what does the city that we want look like? What does the community, the neighborhood, the landscape that we want actually look like? And getting really clear on that, because that is also I think how we grow our numbers — having a vision that people want to join in with and that are excited about. And that has to be about more than just what we want to destroy and take down. It also has to be about what we want to build up and who we want to build it up with.

KH: Each person who is kidnapped by ICE has a life, a family, and a story that the broader public will probably never hear about. In Chicago, one of those people is named Willian, and his friends believe he was targeted for trying to do some good.

Miguel Alvelo Rivera: My name is Miguel Alvelo Rivera, a proud Puerto Rican resident of Albany Park and Chicago. The son of teachers and union organizers and the grandchild of farmworkers and laborers. I am also the executive director of the Latino Union of Chicago, Chicago's oldest worker center, where we fight for social and economic justice by building worker power with domestic workers and day laborers.

Chicago is currently enduring another surge of violence at the hands of ICE. Communities and families are being torn apart in the wake of Trump's deportation machine. As we experience an escalating federal invasion of our neighborhoods, our collective safety is disintegrating by the day. I'm here today to uplift one of our neighbors who has been taken by ICE.

On September 12, our compañero, our community member, our leader Willian was unjustly detained by ICE. This is not just about one man. It is about a system that criminalizes workers, silences dissent, and tears families apart.

Almost two years ago, our organizers doing outreach [to day laborers] at Chicago's corner hiring sites began hearing stories from workers. Stories of abuse at the hands of Home Depot security guards and off-duty police officers. Stories of being beaten, harassed, and humiliated simply for seeking a day's work.

Many day laborers had experienced this before. Many stayed silent out of fear: Fear of retaliation, fear of losing the income they rely on to pay their bills. But five brave workers decided to break that silence. They decided to stand up and denounce these human rights abuses. Among those five was Willian, who I first met at the 47th Street Home Depot in Chicago.

Like thousands of day laborers across this country, Willian would wake before sunrise, lace up his boots, and wait at the corner hoping for a chance to work. He told me, “I came to this country to work and progress, to live in peace with my family.” But instead, he was met with violence, he was met with repression, he was met with abuse.

When we prepared to file a lawsuit against these abuses, we made sure Willian and other workers understood the risks. We told them: Once you speak out, you may face more harassment. You may be targeted. You may be punished for your courage.

Willian listened, he took a deep breath, and he told me: “I know. But I am not only doing this to get justice for myself and my compañeros. I am doing this because I don't want anybody else to ever have to live through what I have lived.”

That is who Willian is. That is who ICE has taken from us. He is a man of integrity, of bravery, of solidarity. He is a man who stood up not just for himself, but for every worker who has been beaten down, exploited, and silenced.

This detention is not random. It is retaliation. It is punishment for speaking out against corporate abuse and police violence. It is meant to send a message to every worker: stay quiet, keep your head down, don't challenge power. Or you too could be disappeared.

This is how systemic repression works. Corporations exploit migrant workers. Police harass and abuse them. And when workers resist, ICE steps in to finish the job: to take people away from their families, to sow fear in our communities, to attempt to destroy movements.

We will not allow that.

Willian's detention is not just an attack on him. It is an attack on every worker who dares to organize. It is an attack on every person who dares to fight for justice. Each and every detention under this administration is an attack on entire communities' right to live with dignity and freedom.

Right now, we are facing a government that is escalating deportations, that is shredding due process, that is openly using federal agencies as tools of fear. We are seeing laws twisted and weaponized against the very people who build this country with their labor every day. And yet, despite all this, we are still here. We are still resisting. We are still demanding justice.

History shows us that repression always breeds resistance. Fear can never kill solidarity. And fascism always fails when people are united.

So to ice, we say: Free Willian! End this unjust detention and let him return to his family and community. Free all who are unjustly abducted, detained, and denied their basic rights.

We demand an end to the targeting of workers who speak out. We demand an end to the separation of our families and communities. We demand dignity, safety, and justice for all people.

As we stand for Willian, we also stand for ourselves. For every working person who wakes up every day to build a better world for all of us. 

We will not be silent. We will not back down. We will fight until Willian is free, until all our communities are safe, and until every worker can live and labor with dignity.

KH: Amid the many crises Chicago has faced in recent years, the Chicago Teachers Union has remained a steadfast force for the common good — advocating not only for educators, but for students, families, and entire communities. Among the many principled and courageous leaders helping to navigate these times, Chicago Teachers Union President Stacy Davis Gates stands out as someone whose vision and commitment I deeply trust and respect.Stacy Davis Gates: My name is Stacy Davis Gates and I am the president of the Chicago Teachers Union. I am also a high school history teacher. And as a high school history teacher, it is incumbent upon me to use this platform to educate, to agitate, and to organize.

Throughout our country's history, there have been many inflection points where we've had to debate our people's humanity and this country's democracy. And every single time this country has had that debate, it's been workers allied with the people who have saved our democracy and honored humanity. For four years, our country fought almost exclusively on these grounds. We engaged in a debate about the sovereignty and the humanity of my ancestors, enslaved Africans.

These workers, enslaved Africans, perhaps were the most courageous in this debate because they allied with women, with abolitionists, both Black and white, left these plantations, and liberated themselves. And through their mass action (one may call a general strike), they pushed the government to codify their humanity and their sovereignty, and Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. He didn't free us, we freed ourselves. And because of the solidarity and the allyship with women, with Black abolitionists, with white abolitionists, these enslaved Africans, these workers created something called Reconstruction. A space created the Freedmen's Bureau, and the Freedmen's Bureau begets the departments of education, justice, and housing. Their action begets an expansion of democracy that gives us the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th Amendments, and they recreate a country where more people have opportunity.

It lays the groundwork for our workers not only to secure a reunification of our country, but one of the greatest expansions of democracy. Workers did that. And we stand today in the city of Chicago, a Black metropolis that was ushered in by Black men called Pullman porters. Workers, men working for low wages, and against the indignities of being called George and not Mister.

We honor these men. These men went to places like Sunflower County, Mississippi, and told Black people, Black southern migrants under the tyranny of Jim Crow south, that they could escape that brutality. They did that, allied with publisher and founder Robert Abbott of the Chicago Defender, and together in coalition, these men drove opportunity and refuge for Black southern migrants escaping fascism.

This is what organized workers do. We make it better for everyone. Today, we are in a time and space where workers must practice a radical solidarity. A radical solidarity that extends beyond the wishes of the billionaire class. Workers have to practice a radical solidarity that elects mayors who can invest in the people because he can see them. Workers have to practice a radical solidarity that anchors the common good, and every single collective bargaining agreement we take from the table. Workers have to practice a radical solidarity that rebukes the tyranny of Trump and his troops in our cities.

This is our work. We have to draw contrast. We have to show that Black mayors and Black cities are reconstructing school libraries while Trump bans books written by Baldwin and Morrison and Hurston. We workers have to show them that reopening mental health care clinics in cities like Chicago means we need the president of the United States to undo cuts to Medicaid. We have to show them that in Chicago, we've abolished sub-minimum wage because slave wages went out with the 13th Amendment. In Chicago, we reject a billionaire's tyranny over our city. We reject a billionaire and his cabinet of more billionaires who rob from Medicaid, who defund public education and give billionaires like themselves tax breaks.

So let me be clear about what solidarity is and the power it holds. Solidarity is the antidote to white supremacy. Solidarity is the antidote to anti-immigrant fear. Solidarity is the antidote to homophobia and transphobia. Solidarity is the antidote of people not having and still needing. Solidarity is what reunites us. Solidarity is what keeps us. Solidarity is what supports us. Solidarity breaks down the lines of race, of gender, of age. Solidarity is our country's safest space.

And so workers and allies, I encourage you, I organize you, I call you, I challenge you to practice solidarity because it is solidarity that makes these United States of America for the people and by the people.

KH: Amid our efforts to protect and defend our neighbors in Chicago, we have been learning from our friends and co-strugglers in L.A. and D.C., who have already faced Trump's escalations and aggression. One of those people is Shannon Clark, an organizer with Remora House, in Washington, D.C. Shannon has been on the front line of mutual aid efforts in D.C., and I have been so grateful for the opportunity to learn from their experience.

Shannon: My name's Shannon, and I organize with Remora House in Washington, D.C. What is happening now with the federal takeovers of our cities is a further escalation of a fascist police state to whip any dissenters into submission. He [Trump] is marching mass federal agents and the U.S. military into our streets to terrorize anyone not cooperating with his agenda. His goal is to wipe out Black and Brown communities to pave the way for a white supremacist nation that he and his followers dream of.

In D.C., with the help of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), the swarms of federal agents flooding our city have increasingly targeted Black and Brown workers and communities. The National Guard is clustered around the National Mall, the Capitol, and the White House. They're staging photo ops with massive armored trucks at Union Station and spreading mulch at parks downtown.

They aim to spread fear and intimidation while normalizing having the military in our streets. Meanwhile, ICE, HSI, FBI, ATF, DEA, Parks Police, Secret Service, and MPD are roaming our neighborhoods and harassing our neighbors. They're checking IDs and barring entry to metro stations. They're setting up traffic checkpoints for commuters coming from majority-Black and Brown parts of the city.

They're harassing people sitting on their front porches and targeting and kidnapping migrant neighbors doing food deliveries. They're arresting people on their way to soup kitchens and Spanish church services. The attacks on our unhoused neighbors is an escalation and an already escalating attack on the city's residents. There is now no notice when an eviction is coming.

Evictions that would've taken hours are finished in 30 minutes, with people packing as fast as they can while MPD drags their tents to dump trucks. Camp evictions are violent, traumatizing, and cruel. People lose their belongings, medical documents and medications, IDs and birth certificates, family photos, clothes, favorite books, privacy, safety, and protection from the elements.

They claim they're connecting people to services. Not only is that clearly not the goal, how would 850 federal agents from outside of D.C. even know where to begin? Even if that were the plan, there are no shelter beds. People are outside because there is nowhere for them to go, or the options for shelter would force them to separate from their partners, their pets, their belongings. So why did he [Trump] choose D.C.?

He's been clear about his hatred for this city, a city that has loudly and proudly rejected everything about him and his administration, that made him hide in a bunker during the 2020 uprising. D.C. is beautiful and diverse. It is a chocolate city. It has a thriving legacy of immigrant communities that are integral to who this city is. He wants to erase all of that and create a D.C. that fits his white supremacist, fascist imagination of what a national capital should look like.

But most importantly, he's doing this to D.C. because he can. He tried L.A. and failed, but D.C. has political loopholes and a cowardly mayor that have left the door open to this federal takeover and military occupation. We were the testing ground for the expansion of this fascist police state. What we thought was going to be 30 days of occupation now has no expiration date. D.C. government has control over our police department again.

But what that means when the chief of police has agreed to cooperate with ICE and when the mayor has agreed to set up long-term relationships with federal police remains to be seen. This is part of the normalization. This is part of the goal. Most of our politicians, no matter where you live, including the bluest city in the country, are aligned with these goals. They love police.

They know the way this capitalist, white supremacist nation functions is by policing, terrorizing, and imprisoning the people within its borders. We have to be kept in our place. We have to be forced to work. We have to be separated from one another. Our communities have to be dissolved. Our solidarity with one another broken. Because when we realize we can have better, that we can build something different when we come together to support one another and defend each other, that is a threat.

D.C. residents are scared and exhausted, but we continue to show up and defend each other and our numbers are growing. In the face of widespread police violence, people are responding by joining mutual aid organizations and taking it upon themselves to keep each other safe. Evictions were stopped by local advocates, buying people another night of rest and safety.

Organizations are getting people into hotels, making sure they are fed, getting them tents and camping supplies, helping them pack and move and find safe places to hunker down. People all over the city are sharing photos and warnings of feds patrolling streets, trying to set up vehicle checkpoints and calling into ICE hotlines to keep each other safe. Mutual aid groups are delivering food to families of people abducted by ICE.

Local orgs are making safety patrols for our young Black neighbors being targeted by the feds. They're creating drop-in spaces, providing meals and safety from the police. Know your rights trainings or giving people skills to back down federal agents when they're trying to escalate people and arrest them. So yes, we are exhausted, we're scared, but we're in this for the long haul. We've become stronger as a community through this.

We have tested our skills and learned our strengths. We have leaned on each other and relied on each other. So it's coming for y'all next, but you will also get through this. While this is an escalation from the norm, not all of this is new. We have organized against police, against deportations, and against state violence in our communities. We have built the skills and communities we need to get through this too. Find your people, find your place, find your community, and get to work protecting each other.

[musical transition]

KH: In thinking about what it means to have soldiers deployed in U.S. cities, as Trump attempts to further consolidate his authoritarian power, I have been grateful for the work of organizations like About Face, an organization composed of post-9/11 service members and veterans who are organizing against permanent war and the use of military weapons, tactics, and values in communities across the U.S. No one is better positioned to understand the mindset of National Guard members being deployed in our city, or how they might be reached.

Arti Walker-Peddakotla: My name is Arti Walker-Peddakotla. I am a U.S. Army veteran, lawyer, former local elected official, and board chair of About Face: Veterans Against The War. About Face was founded in 2004 by veterans returning from the post-9/11 Iraq invasion. Our praxis is informed by our ancestors at Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW). About Face together with VVAW organize to end a foreign policy of permanent war and the use of military weapons and tactics in our communities. About Face works to dismantle U.S. imperialism and the military-industrial complex by organizing post-9/11 military members and vets to withdraw consent from the military machine and reposition our solidarity within an intersectional antiwar movement that can transform what is possible for our futures beyond militarism. 

From our vantage point, as veterans, we see a world at war. Currently we have a president that has threatened to wage war against American cities. We have a president that has deployed military troops to Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles; and threatened to deploy troops to Chicago and New Orleans. The Department of Defense has been renamed to the Department of War, with the Secretary of War Pete Hegseth stating, “those who long for peace must prepare for war.”

What does that statement mean — that we must prepare for war? It means that militarism is embedded into the very fabric of this country, impacting people beyond borders. War is already being waged against us, both here at home and abroad. As Harsha Walia teaches us, militarism is enacted through border imperialism — “the entrenchment and re-entrenchment of controls against migrants, who are displaced as a result of the violences of capitalism and empire, and subsequently forced into precarious labor as a result of state illegalization and systemic social hierarchies.”

The constructed precarity of racial capitalism results in a counterinsurgency strategy where the same communities targeted by state violence are the ones whose members are recruited into perpetuating that state violence. In the military, we call this the poverty or oppression draft. This dual targeting and recruiting further fractures and divides our communities, confounding left movement efforts to build a united front.

If we can understand militarism as a system of political, economic, and social philosophies that prioritizes and glorifies the expansion and aggressive use of state violence to address social and political problems, and further government and corporate interests, then we can also understand why we are currently seeing the largest expansion of militarism in our lifetimes. A culture that embraces militarism is marked by the passive belief in the intrinsic value (or necessity) of war. To quote Arundathi Roy and INCITE!, “For strategic, military and economic reasons, it is vital for the US government to persuade the American public that America's commitment to freedom and democracy and the American Way of Life is under attack” — leading us to our current militaristic state. 

Under this state, we've seen not only the deployment or threat of deployment of National Guard and active-duty troops, but also the deployment of federal immigration enforcement sent to cities like Chicago, D.C., and L.A. as occupying forces. We must remember that the military isn't the only occupying force in our cities. ICE is also an occupying force that terrorizes communities and destabilizes neighborhoods. We must not normalize the occupation of our cities by ICE, federal law enforcement, or the military — while militarism is a norm in this country, we do not have to accept it as the norm in our communities. 

To counter these occupying forces, we must build networks of solidarity, of care, and of support that encourage resistance both from within and outside the machine. At About Face, we use the term “radical reorientation” to describe the turn that GI resisters make — soldiers who become aware of the harm they are inflicting and make the decision to resist and refuse orders. Solidarity requires that we radically reorient ourselves within empire. GI resistance in all of its formations, from the subtle work slowdown to the outspoken war resister, is a radical posture that helps us disrupt state violence. But many people overlook the history of GI resistance because we tend to discredit the organizing work of those who have participated in enacting state violence.

As more of our people are swept up into working for the military-industrial complex or the deportation machine, we must support a spectrum of resistance strategies that withdraws our collective consent from the war and deportation machines, and can eventually lead to the dismantling of the military-industrial complex and the abolition of ICE. Learning the history of GI resisters, from the Civil War to Vietnam, to the post-9/11 GI resisters is crucial in this moment. Because the strategies of GI resistance — the act of radically reorienting oneself inside of U.S. empire, the act of resisting the war machine from the inside — are the same strategies we need to slow the growth of the deportation machine. As more of us recognize the state as the central organizer of violence, more of us can begin the journey of radical reorientation. To achieve collective radical reorientation requires deep networks of support, trust, and care — networks that have already been built in many of our communities and that we must rapidly expand. Thank you.

KH: Another organization focused on the violence of militarism is Dissenters, a youth organization that seeks to reclaim resources from the war industry, and drive investments in life-giving programs and institutions.

Heather: I'm Heather and I'm from Chicago Dissenters. We're hearing this week that the National Guard may no longer be coming to Chicago. While that tentacle of U.S. militarism might not be in our backyards this week, there are still so many ways in which the militarization of our cities has been expanding and becoming normalized through discrete military intervention and state-sanctioned violence at a local, national, and international level. We can look at JROTC programs in schools actively focus on recruitment of Black and brown children; they make joining the military a prerequisite for earning any sort of higher education. We can look at one of the 50 schools Rahm Emanuel closed in 2013 was one where the principal refused to instate a JROTC program. We can look at the increasingly militarized policing tactics in our cities across the nation. The fact that ICE is still in our cities and neighborhoods, kidnapping and threatening the safety of our communities and boasting one of the highest military budgets in the world that's allocated just for so-called immigration enforcement. There is literally a federal prison hidden away in downtown Chicago. On top of this, one-hundred million of our tax dollars being used to fund genocide abroad. We can look at the fact that Chicago is funding the building of a quantum campus in South Shore that is attempting the building of the nation's first quantum computer. If built, one of its goals is to enhance surveillance for the DoD. We have normalized military violence so much so that Israel was able to attack six different countries, kill a prime minister, and there is a bigger response by our country to the killing of a right-wing political influencer. 

Because of all these things and more, right now is the time to join something, whether it be mutual aid or anti-imperialist organizing or just building deeper relationships with the people in your direct communities. I moved back to Chicago last year and joined an anti-imperialist group called Dissenters. We know in Dissenters that U.S. militarism and imperialism rears their ugly heads at every level of our society. We know this because we know that police killings in Chicago, in D.C., in L.A. are protected under the same rhetoric that protects drone strikes abroad. Because we know an IDF sniper from Naperville, Illinois, killing a family in Gaza is made possible and upheld by the same system that is sending ICE into our communities. Because the same system that denies Black and Brown kids equal education while recruiting them to the military to fight for causes that don't serve them. And because we understand and know how interconnected these systems of militarization are, we know that we can only overcome them by building up our networks stronger. 

Chicago Dissenters is building up these networks through our campaign work across the city — one of these campaigns being the Public Health and Safety Campaign, [which] is working to actually build and strengthen networks of care in the city, by directly taking $300 million from the Chicago police budget and using that money to fund public health and safety initiatives in the city. We are also plugged into the Illinois Divest campaign, which is researching and doing work to divest our Illinois tax dollars from the funding of Israel. This campaign was inspired by a similar campaign in Florida called Break the Bonds. At the end of the day, the militarization of our cities is happening whether or not the national guard is here. Whether or not they are here, it is important to stay on alert, look out for your neighbors and continue to build networks of care in Chicago and beyond. There are so many campaigns for you to join. Whether it be focusing on measures that can actually build public health and safety in our city, fighting against the building of two new prisons through the No New Prisons campaign, or fighting to make it so our tax dollars aren't funding a genocide abroad with the Divest Campaign. There are so many places to build together to create a better world for all of us.

[musical transition]

KH: Some of the most important work that has been done in our city to confront this moment has come in the form of political education and rapid response. Groups like Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights and Organized Communities Against Deportations (OCAD) have worked relentlessly to educate immigrant communities in Chicago about their rights. These efforts have led Trump's “Border Czar” Tom Homan to complain that Chicago is very well educated. In January, Homan told reporters, “They've been educated how to defy ICE, on how to hide from ICE. They call it ‘Know Your Rights.' I call it how to escape from ICE.” But while those efforts have kept many of our neighbors here in Chicago, where they belong, they are not enough. Community defense requires constant vigilance. Which is why local ICE-watch trainings and rapid response teams are so important.

Ana: Hello, my name is Ana. I'm with Organized Communities Against Deportations. Donald Trump's attacks on the immigrant community are being strongly felt here in Chicago. He is sending hundreds of federal agents to abduct our friends, families, and communities. At this moment, our people are holding a lot of fear and loss. There are mothers in Chicago who are afraid to take their children to [the] hospital; a lot of children are missing school and important developmental moments, and a lot of people are missing work in order to avoid coming across ICE. I used to work as a barista and I know folks who are no longer going out to get their daily coffee. It's both the big and little habits that we have which make up our lives. Pulling out of normal life is not out of choice — people are staying inside so they can stay with their families, instead of losing what they've built here. Our people are in hiding while Chicago is being attacked.

These feelings of fear are valid, even though we're being made to feel like we're wrong to want to live safely when this campaign of hate is coming from the White House and even other neighbors. This reality is not normal, and it shouldn't become the new normal. We need to find a way to turn the tide.

Trump is not doing all of this to keep our communities “safe.” He is hiding a larger agenda behind that lie. His goal is to target Black and brown communities because we don't fit into his idea of what the United States should look like. Trump is definitely trying to gain control, but this control is about making stereotyping a legal way for police and federal agents to target, continuing to ostracize us as “other,” and targeting poor communities in order to tear us down. Nobody deserves to live in fear, to think that this will be the last time we will see our children. It's inhumane.

We are not alone. Even though we're living inside this system, fighting this thing bigger than a single person, there are so many of us, and none of us are alone. I know that if we stick together, we can overcome this.

Every week I answer calls from people who are calling into an ICE watch hotline and sharing suspicious sightings with hotline operators. We're getting calls about ICE so that the community can be made aware. This hotline is also able to mobilize rapid responders the moment we get a call about an ICE sighting, have them intervene, and even stop an abduction from happening. Every week, more and more people are reaching out for know-your-rights information so that they can better help their neighbors, families, and wider community.

It is natural to feel this intense fear, but being part of a community that is fighting for immigrants has shown me that there are plenty of people looking out for each other. We are in this together.

At the end of the day, if we look at history, bullies are overcome. They don't get that far; it has been shown in the city of Chicago. If you're in L.A., D.C., or the Chicagoland area, reach out to organizations which are already supporting the communities being impacted by the increase in federal agents. It's so important to have the right people trained to know how to intervene when ICE has been sighted, to understand how to approach a difficult situation, and to be able to move between the legal gray areas so that you can help your fellow neighbors. But you have to reach out to the proper resources to do it.

But every city that is attacked cannot do this alone. If we are going to beat this moment, we have to stand together. If it's sharing what we know so other groups can take what worked for us in Chicago. Continue to talk about the occupations as weird, unacceptable, and illegal. We cannot allow ourselves to see the militarization of our cities as normal. If you're able to, donate to organizations in L.A., D.C., or Chicago who are doing work on the ground to keep vulnerable communities safe.

Anything we do which adds another person who calls in to report an ICE sighting, or helps someone feel safer, or empowers someone with new information about their rights is a direct act of resistance against Trump and his agenda. There is actually a lot of power in community. There are so many of us gathering together, making it our daily objective to interfere in the attack on our families and friends. At the end of the day, anytime we can interfere and stop an abduction is a huge win, because it's one less community member we have lost.

KH: When we think about the violence of fascism and authoritarianism, we have to think internationally, and I am grateful to my friend Eman Abdelhadi for helping us to make those connections.

Eman Abdelhadi: My name is Eman Abdelhadi. I am an organizer with Faculty & Staff for Justice in Palestine and Scholars for Social Justice. I am also a scholar here based in Chicago. I want to urge us today to face this moment with political clarity. The ruling class wants us to believe that all of our struggles are separate, that the fight against ICE the fight against the National Guard occupying our streets at the whims of an authoritarian president; the fight for Palestinian lives in Gaza and the West Bank; the fight against police murder of Black, Brown, and Indigenous people here in the U.S., they want us to believe that all these fights are separate, and I want us to enter this moment with clarity that our enemy across all of these fronts is the same. These are all battles in the same war that the ruling class has decided to wage against us. The enemy is a world where the wealthy and powerful get to decide who lives and who dies from Gaza to Chicago, who can walk the streets in safety, and who has to hide from masked ICE agents. Those same people have told us that we can't protest for Palestine without risking deportation, arrest, or police brutality. Those same people are saying we don't have the right to protest the occupation of our streets. They have shown us that nothing is sacred to them, none of our so-called rights, none of our so-called constitutional guarantees, nothing. They want to decide who is disposable. They accuse us of violence and then show up in tanks, armed with assault rifles and covered in masks to kidnap our friends, family, and neighbors. They tell us that we are lawless when they won't even identify themselves. This is not about crime, and this is not about law or order. This is about might. This is about power. 

We have to, in this moment, show the power that we have in each other. We have to show that safety never came from the state. It comes from us, from the movements that we have built together, from the solidarity that we have shown each other over and over and over, for decades, and against all odds, we are equipped for this fight. And just as we enter this moment with a ton of clarity, we have to also let this moment further clarify our politics and our landscape here in Chicago. Anyone who stands for the U.S. military occupying our city is an enemy of the people. Anyone who wields this unjust, inhumane, cruel deportation system; anyone who calls ICE on our community, is an enemy of the people. None of this is abstract. None of it is simply a matter of political opinion. These are our lives and our livelihoods on the line. Anyone who buys into and perpetuates the fascist narrative of our city is an enemy of the people. We have to be clear that what we need here in Chicago is for our tax dollars and our energy to go into serving our communities rather than policing them. We are ready for this fight. We are clearer now more than ever, on who our enemies are, and I think our movements have gotten sharper, have gotten better at working together across lines, and we are ready to keep each other safe and to keep our city safe.

Many of us have spent our lives in waves of movement, and with each one, we have further developed our skills, strengthened our networks and sharpened our analyzes. Here in Chicago in particular, we have shown what a strong, united left can do. Trump wants to punish us for that. He wants to make an example of us. He wants to ensure that he can do this in any city. He thinks that if he can make Chicago bow down, then the whole world will be able to bow down to him. He's angry that our city has effectively protested ICE since his inauguration. What we do now will not just protect us, but will set a precedent, will establish that Trump can be resisted. Trump is not inevitable. We will absolutely rise up and resist the kidnap of our neighbors and the militarization of our city. The whole country is watching, and we will show them that a city can rise up.

KH: Artists are deeply important to our resistance in Chicago. They enliven our imaginations, energize our actions, and help us find hope and joy during dark times. So, with appreciation for Chicago's movement artists, we are going to wind down this episode with some words from my dear friend, performing artist Ric Wilson.

Ric Wilson: So we're realizing that we're in a later stage of fascism in this country than we thought we were. I think because of the education issues that we have in this country, it's hard to even explain what fascism is to people because they've just been misled so much. So as a leftist, I feel like that's another big struggle of mine. And I perform for a living, and I try my best to spread the word or whatnot. I try my best to do it socially. I try my best. I feel like … especially with social media and technology and everything, and living in this techno-feudalism, it's really, really creating the disconnect between folks' humanity. I try to stay hopeful, right? Mariame [Kaba] says that's a discipline. I think giving up is way easier than trying, and I think being hopeless is way easier than having hope, and it makes me think: If miseducation is an issue here, how much of yourself do you give to try to educate the miseducated, and not from a point where you're coming on a high road, but from a point of literally actually caring about folks who are being used for the right-wing agenda?

Agenda for what? I don't know. I don't know if they're just trying to destroy the world or what, or just take over everything. They're going to need the working class. The working-class people are going to always be here. You know what I mean? The bosses aren't. So I just try to figure out how I can get on stage and represent that.

I don't know. I never think about making the world a better place. I just try to make the world a safer place, and I don't think there could be a subjective or a different opinion on what the fuck the word “safe” means. That's just some thoughts of mine.

[The following is performed as a rap.] 

I rap for people that will never get to make it out of Chicago. Marginalize their problems, and then drink it into bottles. Seasons steady changing, but you're stuck just like a pothole. Then you lose his life from bullets from a tinted Tahoe. Kids from summer camp that never make it to the next year get so numb it's almost like the death is not complex here, and every funeral where AI leak is getting old, this for everyone they overpriced to ever dig a hole. I rap for listeners, hood niggas that's turn prisoners, Hennessy holders, and the cousins that I'll be missing up. Fly ladies, breakdancers and ghetto visitors. Lowlifes, gang bangers and late finishers. Uncles who can't afford their Hennessy so get the brandy. Hardworking grannies on the CTA standing. Closed all the projects, now we Ubering to Lansing because buying granny house is part of gentrified planning, but fuck them. We still here and we still fighting. Forever in solidarity. Yep.

KH: During this challenging time for our city, organizations providing legal support are working collaboratively to support targeted community members and people exercising their right to protest. If you're planning a protest and need legal advice or support, or if the FBI comes knocking, the Chicago chapter of the National Lawyers Guild has a hotline you can call.

Jerry Boyle: My name is Jerry Boyle and I volunteer with the National Lawyers Guild Chicago chapter. Most of the work I do is as a legal observer, but with this federal invasion, the Lawyers Guild is working very closely with other legal organizations to provide a unified front from all legal groups for activists and individuals facing this federal invasion. And we've managed to put together a fairly seamless network to provide a full-featured suite of legal services for activists and immigrants. And we're even doing joint messaging and focusing on our hotlines. And for the Lawyers Guild [Chicago chapter], our hotline is 872-465-4244. And the Guild performs a variety of services for protesters. We send legal observers. We manage court tracking and relationships with jail support. We also offer lawyers to advise folks planning actions. The Cook County Public Defender's Office has an arrest response hotline, and this is for right after people get arrested. And that is 844-817-4448. If somebody gets arrested, you can call that number and the Public Defender's Office will send a lawyer to check in on them in the lockup.

First Defense Legal Aid has a hotline as well, and it's 800-529-7374. They're more focused on civil litigation relating to the invasion and also trauma-informed alternatives to calling the police in this situation. And it's important; we can't necessarily rely on 911 right now. 

And then for immigrants, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights has a family support network, 855-435-7693. And they do a variety of things. They're a clearinghouse for reports of ICE-related activity. So if you see something, call that number, report it to them. They have a network of rapid response teams throughout the city who can check it out and formulate a response to the potential raid. They also provide services to the families that are subjected to the raid, whether it's the person that's been seized or their relatives and dependents, and they put immigration lawyers on those issues.

And legal is just one dimension of what's going on in Chicago right now. But it's an important one and a useful one. And we're there as service people for activists. So keep our numbers handy and feel free to reach out to us and we encourage you to reach out to us. We're at your service.

[musical transition]

KH: I am so full of gratitude for everyone who brought their experience and strength to this conversation. You can call it a mixtape or remote rally, but more than anything, it's a call for awareness, understanding and solidarity. The corporate media shaped Chicago's situation into a question of whether Trump was going to send troops here immediately, and when Trump pivoted in his plans, cable news networks and legacy publications closed the subject. But Trump's federal agents are here in force. I know a lot of people are focused on Charlie Kirk right now because his death is being weaponized against the left, and because the murder of a famous white man who's a millionaire is well outside the norms of this society, but there's more happening in this society than the noise surrounding Kirk's death. People are being hunted on the streets of Chicago and in surrounding towns and suburbs. Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez was killed by ICE agents. On Sunday, migrant parents were snatched from their vehicle, while their children were left screaming in the backseat. We are struggling to defend the Chicagoland area, and we know that Trump's aggression won't end here. We need solidarity, in this moment, and in the months ahead, as we build political projects that allow us to protect and support each other. Trump is hiring 10,000 new ICE agents. That means this moment of intensifying state violence in Chicago could be only a hint of things to come. 

We must resist Trump's aggression now, because the grip of authoritarianism will tighten. We have to move now, as much as we can, before the walls close in further. So, please, uplift our stories, and join the struggle. Map your networks of support and defense and do what you can, here and now, to hold the line against fascism, wherever you are. Show them that we will not abandon our neighbors, and we will not submit to authoritarianism. Let's endeavor to care for each other, and let's refuse to leave each other behind.

I want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I'll see you in the streets.

 The Group Is Rebuilding in Syria—Just as U.S. Forces Prepare to Leave

 Caroline Rose and Colin P. Clarke

Nine months after the longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad was toppled by a rebel offensive, Syria faces a litany of new challenges. The country, which is now being led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), is contending with recurring violent sectarian clashes, successive Israeli strikes into Syrian territory, and internal disputes within the new government. Adding to the tumult is a resurgence of one of Syria's most enduring challenges: the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.Since the Assad regime was toppled in 2024, ISIS has waged a terror campaign throughout Syria, targeting the new Syrian government, as well as Christian, Shiite, and Kurdish minorities. At its apogee, in 2014, ISIS held roughly a third of the country. Although the group no longer controls any territory in Syria, and its numbers have dwindled from roughly 100,000 fighters to 2,500 fighters today, the group is taking advantage of Syria's post-Assad chaos to rebuild and reconstitute, presenting fresh obstacles to the country's long-sought stability.The group's targeting capabilities are proving more frequent, precise, and sophisticated than ever, targeting sites well beyond ISIS's traditional spheres of operation. In June, for example, a suicide bomber linked to ISIS attacked a Greek Orthodox church in Damascus, killing 25 and injuring 63. Two months later, the group launched more than two dozen attacks across northeastern Syria, relying on a combination of guerrilla tactics, including small arms fire, ambushes, assassinations, and improvised explosive devices targeting military checkpoints and government vehicles. Last year, ISIS took responsibility for 294 attacks in Syria, up from 121 in 2023; estimates by the United Nations and human rights groups are even higher. Such attacks pose a blatant challenge to the new administration's attempts to stabilize the country. Syria's already fragile security situation is characterized by frequent clashes between Sunni, Alawite, and Druze communities. As the frequency of terrorist attacks increases, the new Syrian government risks squandering its political legitimacy by failing to protect the country's minorities. The Syrian population, meanwhile, faces a real possibility of a large-scale terrorist resurgence. This situation will grow more dangerous still if the Trump administration follows through on its plan, announced in April, to begin withdrawing the approximately 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country. Since 2014, the United States has been the linchpin of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, an international counterterrorism group that has worked with local security forces to degrade ISIS. Without Washington's active involvement, the coalition's remaining 88 members will struggle to keep ISIS at bay or to adequately support local actors such as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a mostly Kurdish militia that had recently reached an agreement to merge with the state.

As U.S. troop numbers dwindle and sectarian tensions mount, Syrian forces may find it increasingly difficult to maintain authority in the country. The combined manpower of the Syrian army and the SDF is likely insufficient to prevent an ISIS resurgence. To deter ISIS, therefore, the United States must retain a presence in Syria beyond 2026. A contingent of roughly several hundred U.S. troops will be necessary to support Syria's new security forces with intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and capacity building. If Washington discontinues counterterrorism support to Damascus, the Syrian government may fail to unify the country and prevent ISIS's return. If ISIS is able to regain momentum in Syria, it will inevitably turn to conducting attacks throughout the region and beyond. It behooves Washington to prevent ISIS's ability to rebuild and once again destabilize the entire Levant. 

ISIS sees an opportunity in a divided Syria. Its leaders seek to exploit the country's sectarian and ideological divisions to recruit new fighters and rebuild their caliphate. Through its attacks, ISIS hopes to demonstrate that the current Syrian government is unable or unwilling to protect the population, especially minorities. A recent report from the UN Monitoring Team concluded that ISIS “will continue to project an external threat . . . if divisions in the country allow a permissive space from where they can plan and execute attacks.”Indeed, ISIS was especially busy last spring. In March, in the aftermath of violence between Sunni and Alawite communities in the port city of Latakia, ISIS conducted a string of attacks against the SDF. Then in May, the group launched another barrage of attacks following clashes south of Damascus, between the new administration's security forces and Sunni and Druze communities. That same month, just a week after U.S. President Donald Trump met in Riyadh with Syria's new president, the former jihadist Ahmed al-Shara, ISIS launched a series of bombings and ambushes across Syria and Iraq. The group also took credit for planting an explosive device that struck a “vehicle of the apostate regime” in southern Syria, resulting in at least seven Syrian army casualties and marking the first recorded attack on Syrian government forces since Assad's fall. A week later, another bomb attack conducted by ISIS in southern Syria targeted fighters from the Free Syrian Army, a U.S.-backed militia. Notably, all these attacks transpired deep in government-held territory.This surge in violence has been accompanied by a surge in ISIS propaganda undermining Shara and HTS. In its weekly online newsletter, which reaches and inspires jihadists across the globe, the group routinely maligns Shara and the new government and calls for soldiers in the Syrian military to defect. ISIS propagandists call Shara “Jewlani,” in reference to a conspiracy that the Syrian president, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, is an Israeli Mossad agent installed to initiate regime change inside Syria in favor of Israel. The group has also labeled HTS as kuffar (Arabic for “nonbelievers”) and accused it of being a puppet of the United States and Israel. Since HTS and Shara came to power, Israel has repeatedly carried out strikes and ground incursions into Syria, sowing the very chaos on which ISIS strives.

Alarmingly, ISIS's growing confidence has coincided with an incremental withdrawal of U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq, placing the future of the Global Coalition into question. In September 2024, the United States and Iraq jointly announced that the Global Coalition would end its military mission in Iraq by the end of September 2025 and in Syria by September 2026. In April, U.S. Central Command announced cuts to its U.S. troop presence in Syria from 2,000 to 1,400 by the end of this year. The United States has already transferred control of three of its eight bases in the country to the SDF, with plans to consolidate to just one base. Although Pentagon commanders have urged the administration to maintain at least a contingent of 500 troops in Syria, the administration has signaled that further cuts may be made. In neighboring Iraq, a parallel process is underway. With a withdrawal goal set for the end of 2026, U.S. forces are reconsolidating from Baghdad to Erbil, in Iraqi Kurdistan, and plan to drastically reduce their presence to a small, as yet unspecified number of military advisers.

When Trump met with Shara in May, it was the first time a U.S. president had met with a Syrian president in a quarter century. Much of the impetus behind the Trump administration's reengagement with Syria is driven by a desire to complete a total withdrawal from Iraq and Syria—an objective that can be achieved only if the new Syrian government proves capable of countering ISIS. To that aim, Washington has prioritized counterterrorism, directly assisting in operations against ISIS and providing Damascus with intelligence that has thwarted at least eight ISIS attacks. The Trump administration has also pressured the new Syrian administration to accelerate reconstruction and national unification efforts, such as the SDF integration with the government.

How things develop in Syria will depend, at least in part, on how committed Washington remains to continuing its fight against ISIS. After a decade and a half of extreme violence perpetrated by myriad actors, both state and nonstate, Syria faces a long road toward stability under the best of circumstances. Any U.S. withdrawal would create space for ISIS and other terrorist organizations to step up their attacks, further destabilizing the country, sowing divisions among its rival factions, and even opening the door for Iran-backed Shiite extremists, including Hezbollah. If the government in Damascus falls, or if it is unable to unify the country's minority communities, Syria will plunge back into civil war.Rather than prematurely depart a fragmented Syria, the United States and its partners in the Global Coalition should make long-term investments in the country's security. The U.S.-led mission has significantly degraded ISIS over the preceding decade, and U.S. forces have effectively collaborated with the SDF and other local actors on counterterrorism measures. Although ISIS remains largely defeated, Syria's postregime transition has created an opening for the group's return. The United States should withdraw from Syria only when Syrian forces can defend the country against ISIS and other terrorist groups. That moment has not yet arrived.

A premature U.S. departure at such a fragile moment in Syria could empower ISIS, undermining the very mission that brought U.S. forces to Syria in the first place. Washington should not follow through on its planned drawdown. Instead, it must continue to share intelligence with Damascus to foil attacks by ISIS—and step up counterterrorism training with the Syrian army, the SDF, and other local partners. Beyond that, the Trump administration should prevent actions by U.S. allies—such as Israeli strikes on Syrian territory—that risk perpetuating the chaos that ISIS seeks to exploit.

Finally, instead of terminating U.S. participation in the Global Coalition, Washington should expand the grouping to include Syria itself—a move that would enable better joint training, intelligence exchange, and operations. To that end, the United States and its partners in the Global Coalition should stipulate the conditions that HTS must meet to join. To be sure, existing members will have reservations about welcoming former jihadists such as Shara. But if ISIS is to be defeated once and for all, the new Syrian government must be involved and empowered to succeed.

 As America Drifts Away From Its Allies, a Less Peaceful World Awaits

 Stewart Patrick

It has become commonplace to speak of living in a “post-Western world.” Commentators typically invoke the phrase to herald the emergence of non-Western powers—most obviously China, but also Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey, and the Gulf states, among others. But alongside the “rise of the rest,” something equally profound is occurring: the demise of “the West” itself as a coherent and meaningful geopolitical entity. The West, as understood as a unified political, economic, and security community, has been on the ropes for some time. Donald Trump's second term as U.S. president could deliver the knockout blow.

Since the end of World War II, a tight-knit club of economically advanced democracies has anchored the liberal, rules-based international system. The group's solidarity was rooted not only in shared threat perceptions but also in a common commitment to an open world based on free societies and liberal commerce—and the collective willingness to defend that order. The core members of this cohort included the United States and Canada, the United Kingdom, the members of the European Union, and several allies in the Asia-Pacific, such as the former British dominions of Australia and New Zealand, as well as Japan and South Korea, which became integrated into the postwar U.S. alliance system and adopted the liberal principles of democratic governance and market economics. The West formed the core of the so-called free world during the Cold War. But the West outlasted that bipolar conflict and even expanded its boundaries to include a number of former Soviet bloc countries and some former Soviet republics through the expansion of NATO and the European Union.

Over the past 80 years, Western countries have created numerous institutions to advance their common purposes, most prominently NATO, the G-7, the EU, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Equally important, these countries have coordinated policy stances within more encompassing multilateral frameworks, such as the United Nations and its agencies, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Trade Organization, and the G-20.

To be sure, periodic divisions and tensions have stressed Western solidarity. Prominent examples include the Suez crisis of 1956, French President Charles de Gaulle's challenge to NATO's integrated command structure in the 1960s, U.S. President Richard Nixon's abrupt suspension of dollar-gold convertibility in 1971, the Euromissile crisis of the 1980s, and transatlantic acrimony over the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.

But none of these episodes have tested the West's cohesion nearly as much as Trump's return to the White House. Since January, the president has adopted a full-throated “America first” orientation in foreign, economic, and national security policy. His vision for the U.S. role in the world is hypernationalist, sovereigntist, unilateralist, protectionist, and transactional. In contrast to his presidential predecessors, he rarely speaks about American global leadership, much less responsibility. He disdains alliances, multilateralism, and international law. He cares little about democracy, human rights, and development—and he has dismantled the U.S. capacity to promote them abroad. He repudiates his country's role in contributing to global public goods, including open trade, financial stability, climate change mitigation, global health security, and nuclear nonproliferation. And he is the most prominent champion of the ascendant right-wing, nationalist political forces in Europe and North America, appealing to a vaguer, civilizational notion of the West and casting doubt on the abiding importance of the geopolitical West.



Trump's shifts have stunned the closest U.S. partners. “The West as we knew it no longer exists,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, declared mournfully in April. Western leaders have sought to paper over these inconvenient truths, including at their June G-7 and NATO summits, with obsequious efforts to flatter, humor, and cajole Trump.

But von der Leyen's observation continues to echo because it resonates with what other leaders believe and say, if often sotto voce: this time it really is different. The passing of the West as a meaningful entity will come with great loss. It will leave the open, rules-bound international order adrift, without its historical anchor and main motor for progress. The liberal notions that underpinned the geopolitical West were fundamentally universal; the nationalist ones that raise up the civilizational West are instead fixated on the defense of borders and fear of others. Beyond endangering liberal principles domestically, these trends are likely to accelerate the rise of illiberal multilateralism, a bare bones international order shaped and even dominated by authoritarian great powers. To be sure, the fading of the West does provide an opening for constructive middle powers to build new networks of international cooperation tailored to the twenty-first century. But it also augurs a less peaceful, less cooperative world than the one the West helped make.

During the Cold War, the West emerged as a coherent and unitary geopolitical actor, comprising a bloc of (mostly) democratic countries opposed to the Soviet Union and its satellites—the “East,” in common parlance—and distinct from the countries of the “global South”—a postcolonial terrain where much of the East-West global competition unfolded in bloody fashion.

This bipolar arrangement was not the international system the United States had envisioned during World War II, when American postwar planners drafted blueprints for an open international order based on universal membership, multilateral principles, and great-power comity and cooperation, especially as embodied by the newly minted United Nations. The confrontation with the Soviet Union foiled these best-laid plans and led the United States to adopt a policy of containment. If there were indeed “two worlds instead of one,” as the U.S. diplomat Charles Bohlen concluded in 1947, when Moscow imposed total control in Eastern Europe, the United States had little choice but to unite the “non-Soviet world . . . politically, economically, and in the last analysis militarily.”

The doctrine of the containment of communism thus gave birth to a more concretely geopolitical—as opposed to nebulously civilizational—West, soon embodied in new institutions such as NATO, an integrating Europe, and the OECD. The West became an order within an order, a club of market democracies nested within a more encompassing global system populated by large membership organizations such as the UN, the World Bank and the IMF, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Over time, this inner order came to include a more diverse array of market democracies, most notably Japan, which were not Western in any traditional cultural sense but embraced liberal political and economic principles. When some analysts today refer to the “global North,” they are speaking of that inner order.

A shared attachment to democracy, as well as capitalism, underpinned Western solidarity. The preamble to the Treaty of Washington (1949), which established NATO, pledges members of the alliance to “safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.” Cynics may dismiss such language as sentimental window-dressing, but they are wrong. These commitments tangibly affected allied behavior, shaping how Western countries understood their national interests, communicated with one another, and settled occasional disputes, so that, for instance, the notion of war among members of the inner order became inconceivable. To be sure, this cohort often valued democracy more among fellow members of the West than they did among the countries of the developing and postcolonial world, particularly those whose publics were tilting leftward.

Beyond shared ideals, Western allies could take comfort in Washington's consensual leadership style, which softened the reality of U.S. dominance. President Dwight Eisenhower endorsed this orientation in his first inaugural address, in January 1953, in language that today appears to be from a bygone era: “To meet the challenge of our time, destiny has laid upon our country the responsibility of the free world's leadership. So it is proper that we assure our friends once again that, in the discharge of this responsibility, we Americans know and we observe the difference between world leadership and imperialism; between firmness and truculence; between a thoughtfully calculated goal and spasmodic reaction to the stimulus of emergencies.” To the degree that the United States enjoyed an imperium within the West, it was, in the historian Geir Lundestad's words, an “empire by invitation.”



The West persisted as a meaningful geopolitical concept and entity even after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its concomitant East. It would have been natural for a club that formed in opposition to the Soviet Union to lose definition after that rival disappeared. But at least during the 1990s, the cohort did not fragment into competing blocs and rivalries or produce efforts to undercut American unipolarity. Indeed, there was a widespread if naive expectation that the world's community of market democracies—the West, in other words—would inexorably expand to encompass more of the world, as other countries embraced liberal, universal values and the normative architecture of the open, rules-based international order.

These hopes would not be borne out. Instead of the universalization of the West, the world saw the rise of the rest, a diverse array of major and regional powers bent not only on raising their voices in international institutions but also, in some cases, on challenging the organizing principles of those institutions. More gradually and subtly, the West began to take on a more civilizational dimension, a process accelerated by the September 11 attacks and the ensuing “war on terror” and the crises of mass migration and subsequent nativist outrage in the 2010s.

Despite these challenges, Western solidarity itself held firm, even after Trump's tumultuous first term. The community of advanced market democracies revived during the administration of President Joe Biden, confident not only in U.S. security guarantees but in Washington's broader commitment to liberal principles and the vision of an open, rules-based international order. By and large, Western governments continued to follow Washington's lead, because they regarded the United States as a stable investment and were confident that if the going got tough, the United States would have their backs and would bail them out. It was an arrangement built on trust, underpinned by a commitment to common values, shared rules, and mutual obligations.

Eight months into Trump's second term, that trust has now been shattered. At their G-7 and NATO summits in June, U.S. partners gamely tried to paper over growing frictions, including about Trump's imposition of heavy tariffs, browbeating of allies to ramp up defense expenditures, and unilateral strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. Bowing and scraping, the assembled leaders praised the president for his boldness, glossing over the reality that his relentless bullying is a profound departure from the consultative style that has long set relations among Western countries apart from run-of-the-mill diplomacy.

The closest U.S. allies can no longer take Washington's security guarantees for granted. The president's bombast and capriciousness have led many European countries to increase their defense spending—a positive outcome, to be sure, and not inherently at odds with the notion of a unified, geopolitical West. But Trump has also alienated allies and revitalized long-floundering EU efforts to pursue strategic autonomy, which would allow the bloc to not only punch at its weight militarily but also pursue an independent geopolitical path. In the Asia-Pacific, too, allies worry about the United States suddenly canceling their insurance coverage. As Trump assaults the rules-based multilateral trading system with sweeping tariffs, U.S. allies are likewise moving to diversify their commercial options and engage with more reliable partners, remodeling the global trading system in the process.

Such hedging behavior is consistent with public sentiment. Opinion polls in Europe reveal cratering approval for the United States and dwindling confidence in the transatlantic alliance. In the spring of 2025, only 28 percent of respondents deemed the United States to be a “somewhat reliable ally”—down from more than 75 percent a year before.

One institutional casualty of Trump's disengagement from the West is the G-7. From its origins in the 1970s, the G-7 has been a symbol of Western solidarity and a pillar of global economic governance, uniting the most important advanced market democracies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the EU. Although many wrote its obituary during the global financial crisis, when it risked being eclipsed by the G-20, it came roaring back to life in 2014, when the Western members of the then G-8 ejected Russia for supporting secession in eastern Ukraine and annexing Crimea. Trump, however, has repeatedly criticized Russia's expulsion and made no secret of his disdain for the G-7—even quitting its 2018 summit in a huff. Many observers now refer to the body as the “G-6 plus one.” This U.S. estrangement from the G-7 risks depriving its members of something that the more heterogeneous G-20 can never provide: a like-minded club in which the world's leading market democracies can harmonize policy stances consistent with their commitment to an open, rules-bound world based on shared liberal principles.

Caught between Trump's unilateralism and misgivings about China, Western middle powers are beginning to explore new, flexible partnerships with rising middle powers in the developing world, part of a broader trend toward an international system defined by “multi-alignment,” in which countries pursue maximum flexibility in their diplomatic, economic, and security relationships rather than align consistently with particular great powers or blocs. Indeed, this is precisely what is happening, with the EU and its individual members trying to craft tighter commercial ties and closer diplomatic links with countries such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, and South Africa.

During his first term, when he was constrained by institutionalists, Trump occasionally invoked the concept of the West. Speaking in Warsaw in July 2017, the president declared that “the fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.” Given his actual conduct in office, which has involved cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and other autocrats, it is clear that Trump understands the West not as a Cold War–era geopolitical entity undergirded by common threat assessments and a commitment to liberal values but rather in its older, ethnonationalist, and more amorphous connotation as a common civilization based not on liberal political principles but shared geographical and historical roots.

The West is now splitting apart, as its meaning drifts from one of geopolitical and ideological solidarity toward a more civilizational concept, particularly in the United States, and confidence in the transatlantic and other alliances erodes. As its internal divisions come to the fore, it seems fair to question the coherence and utility of the category itself. There is irony in this predicament. For years, critics in the United States and Europe have been skeptical of the catchall concept of the global South, dismissing it as an impossibly broad label to apply to a diverse collection of more than 100 postcolonial and developing countries. What explanatory purchase could the term possibly afford, given the varied histories, cultural inheritances, political institutions, economic circumstances, strategic orientations, and regional ambitions of the cohort it purports to encompass?

The question today is whether the geopolitical West as a category merits similar skepticism. The once taken-for-granted strategic and ideological solidarity among the United States and other major market democracies has frayed. The unmaking of the West has not been Trump's doing alone. Nor is it a case of simple bifurcation, with the United States heading off in one direction as its erstwhile partners head in another. Across most advanced democracies, electorates are increasingly polarized, resulting in dwindling support for the political center and the delegitimization of moderate parties and governments. Cosmopolitan progressives and conservative nationalists are at each other's throats, including over the very meaning of the West.

These tensions came to a head publicly and prominently at the Munich Security Conference in February. There, U.S. Vice President JD Vance outraged his largely European audience by depicting “woke” restrictions on the free speech of the continent's far-right political parties as a greater threat to Western freedom and security than Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the heart of his critique was a blood-and-soil conception of the West, one rooted—like Vance's concept of the American nation itself—not in a devotion to the shared political principles of the Enlightenment but in a civilizational identity and an organic sense of place.



For decades, the world's advanced market democracies have stood together in crises, defended human rights and other liberal values, and generally sought to harmonize and coordinate their policies within both minilateral clubs and more encompassing international organizations, including the UN and the Bretton Woods institutions. The demise of the West as a reliable geopolitical unit will increasingly see the United States and its former partners acting at cross-purposes and finding themselves on the opposite sides of debates. This is not simply an inevitable function of declining U.S. hegemony in the international system. One could imagine a gradual renegotiation of leadership and burden sharing within the West, with, for instance, greater allied responsibility for collective defense. Washington's abandonment of internationalism and any concern for liberal norms and agenda setting is leading to a divergence of values and threat perceptions among Western countries that will fundamentally break the solidarity of the geopolitical West.

This rupture is profound because it is taking place in the inner core of the world order that has existed since the 1940s. It also creates a choice for the world's middle powers, not only in the West but also among emerging economies that have no desire to replace U.S. with Chinese hegemony. Emerging powers have long complained that they have been excluded from the global high table. The current fluid moment provides an opportunity for the likes of Brazil, India, Indonesia, and South Africa to collaborate with advanced market democracy counterparts, such as Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom, which may be looking for new partners in the post-Western world.

But the welter of arrangements that may arise to replace the vanished certainties of the old order will not be able to replicate that order's greatest outcome. The West, the inner order that emerged in the crucible of the Cold War, was a zone of peace. Its members would never war with one another. In its absence, the West leaves behind a world that will be more prone to suspicion, hostility, and conflict.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

 A Conversation With Anne Neuberger

In 2024, the U.S. government discovered that Chinese hackers had penetrated a huge swath of the American telecommunications system—and remained there for years. That attack came to be known as Salt Typhoon. China has not only managed to steal the data and surveil the communications of hundreds of millions of Americans. It also embedded itself in the United States' most important infrastructure, giving Beijing a crucial advantage in a conflict.

Anne Neuberger was until recently the top cybersecurity official on the National Security Council. She was in that position when Salt Typhoon was discovered. And to her, the attack is not just an isolated incident of cyberespionage. Rather, it is evidence of American weakness, and Chinese dominance, in a central arena of national security.

“Decades after the widespread adoption of the Internet opened a new realm of geopolitical contestation,” she writes in the current issue of Foreign Affairs, “the United States has fallen behind, failing to secure a vast digital home front.” Neuberger warns that, as artificial intelligence grows ever more sophisticated, the threat of a cyberattack that could paralyze the country in a time of crisis has never been higher.

            Tesla is looking into redesigning the way to open its car doors in an emergency following﻿ several accidents where passengers were reportedly trapped in burning vehicles because rescuers could not open them.
    


            Even without an accident, other Tesla owners have reported having to break their own car windows after buckling their children in and then being unable to get in the car again, according to an investigation launched by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, citing owner complaints. An investigation by Bloomberg found 140 incidents of people being trapped in their Teslas due to problems with the door handles, including several that resulted in horrific injuries.
    


            Tesla design chief Franz von Holzhausen said in a podcast Wednesday that the company is looking to combine the manual and electronic release mechanisms in the doors, which are now separate, in order to make escaping the car easier and quicker in a “panic situation.”
    


            “The idea of combining the electronic one and the manual one together into one button, I think, makes a lot of sense,” he said in an interview for Bloomberg's Hot Pursuit! podcast. “That's something that we're working on.”
    


            It's unclear if Tesla is working on a fix for all of its cars or just the new ones, but it's unlikely the company will be able to combine the two ways of opening the door on existing models.
    


            The door handles of the Tesla Model S and Model X extend and retract, while the door handles on the Model 3 and Y mechanically flip out when pressed in. But when that fails, the doors need to be opened with a manual door release inside the vehicle to get out. That can happen if there's a loss of power following a crash.
    


            And the location of the manual release buttons can be difficult to find, especially to a young child alone in a car, or a passenger who is not familiar with the vehicle, like in an emergency situation. The Bloomberg investigation found numerous instances of passengers who were killed or severely burned by post-crash fires when rescuers on the scene were unable to open the doors.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  In Snap, we look at the power of a single photograph, chronicling stories about how both modern and historical images have been made.



            Depicting a crisscross of welts and scars streaked across the body of a formerly enslaved Louisiana man, “Scourged Back” is one of the 19th century's defining photographs. The image was so widely circulated in America during the Civil War that it reshaped the abolitionist cause by laying bare the abominable cruelty of slavery to a largely oblivious northern public.
    


            More than 160 years later, the influence of this visceral portrait — whose subject may have been called Peter or Gordon — continues to be felt. Musuems, libraries and universities across the US display historic prints of the image, which is often used to educate audiences in a country still reckoning with its past.
    


            But amid growing political debate over how history is presented in America's museums, the 1863 photo has become a flashpoint in the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's efforts to eradicate what it calls “corrosive ideology” from federally owned sites.
    


            On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that officials at an unidentified national park had ordered that the photo be taken down, along with other signs and exhibits related to slavery. Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper described the move as being in line with an executive order Trump issued in March directing the US Interior Department to do away with content that disparages “Americans past or living.”
    


            The department, which oversees the National Park Service, has since denied the report.  Spokesperson Elizabeth Peace told CNN via email that sites were not asked to remove the photo. She added: “If any interpretive materials are found to have been removed or altered prematurely or in error, the Department will review the circumstances and take corrective action as appropriate.”
    


            By then, however, the story had already sparked concern among artists, activists and curators. The National Parks Conservation Association was among those voicing disapproval, with senior director of cultural resources Alan Spears saying that removing the photo would be “as shameful as it is wrong.”
    


            The dust-up comes as Trump escalates attacks on museums, going so far as to slam the Smithsonian Institution for being overly concerned with “how bad Slavery was.” In turn, the furor around “Scourged Back” has also generated renewed interest in the story behind the photo and what it means today.
    


            “I find it all very strange,” movie producer and The Black List founder, Franklin Leonard, told CNN's Abby Phillip in response to the Washington Post report. “What more great American story is there than the survival and triumph over enslavement, Jim Crow and (its) repercussions?”
    


            While there is limited historical consensus on Peter's escape — or even his name — the pictured man is thought to have fled a Louisiana cotton plantation in early 1863. Traveling on foot to Baton Rouge, his clothes torn and muddy, he eventually reached Union lines, which under President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was enough to be considered permanently free and eligible to join the US army's “Colored Troops.”
    


A sultry kiss, flipped — the artist turning found photographs into uncanny new images



            According to one written record of his testimony, the man said he was severely whipped by his former owner's overseer after attempting to “shoot everybody” (though he had no recollection of the alleged incident). He was bed-bound for months following the beating.
    


            After undergoing a medical examination, Peter seemingly sat for a series of portraits at a photography studio owned by William D. McPherson and J. Oliver. The studio produced at least three versions of the image, adjusting their composition and Peter's pose as they went along, with the most famous variant — the third — taken some time after the other two.
    


            To David Silkenat, a historian at Scotland's University of Edinburgh, this assiduous approach suggests that whoever took the photo understood how impactful it could be. “The most significant difference in the final photograph is that Gordon's neck is twisted more to the left towards the camera, revealing his full profile and his beard, which is either totally or partially obscured by his shoulder in the other images,” Silkenat wrote in an influential 2014 research paper on the photo. “The combined effect of these minor changes in the photos' composition made the final image subtly, but noticeably more arresting.”
    


            The picture was originally produced as a “carte de visite,” a relatively affordable kind of small-format photograph commonly sold, shared and traded by Civil War soldiers. Unlike earlier forms of photography, the negatives could be easily reprinted on paper, meaning images could spread quicker than before (cartes de visite are often dubbed the “social media” of their day).
    


            As the photo gained traction in the summer of 1863, abolitionist newspaper The Liberator recounted an enlightening example of its spread: A surgeon in an all-black regiment in the Union Army had sent a copy of “Scourged Back” to his brother in Boston along with a note reading, “I have seen, during the period I have been inspecting men for my own and other regiments, hundreds of such sights — so they are not new to me; but it may be new to you. If you know of anyone who talks about the humane manner in which the slaves are treated, please show them this.”
    


            The Liberator also directly disseminated the portrait, which is also known as “whipped Peter,” to readers for 15 cents, or $1.50 for 12.
    


            “If you look at abolitionist newspapers, they're not only talking about what this image means, they're also selling the image to subscribers,” said Matthew Fox-Amato, an associate history professor at the University of Idaho and author of “Exposing Slavery: Photography, Human Bondage, and the Birth of Modern Visual Politics in America,” in a phone interview. He added: “It goes viral, if you will, because it is that carte de visite technology that entails reproducibility.”
    


            By July 1863, “Scourged Back” had found its way onto the pages of Harper's Weekly, a more mainstream publication, where it appeared as part of a triptych in an article titled “A Typical Negro.” While the magazine claimed the three photos depicted the same man — whom they called Gordon — historians believe each picture showed a different individual. The magazine is also thought to have sensationalized the subject's story and conflated his account with that of other escapees, writing that Gordon rubbed himself with onions to throw bloodhounds off his scent (academics have since struggled to independently corroborate details of his journey to Baton Rouge).
    


            The hugely popular Harper's Weekly was how many middle- and upper-class Americans stayed up to date with the Civil War. In an early demonstration of the power of photography as a medium, it was the image, not the story itself, that captured — and horrified — their imaginations. This was especially so in the north, where people had largely been spared visceral depictions of slavery.
    


            “The image, in many ways, visually confirmed things that abolitionists — including formerly enslaved people — had been saying for the longest time: that violence was at the core of American slavery,” said Fox-Amato, adding “it also confirmed… what photography could do — that photography can serve as a tool of justice,” he added.
    


            The sight of Peter's scarred, beaten back continues to inspire and inform. In 2017, celebrated Black artist Arthur Jafa appropriated the photo for his sculpture “Ex-Slave Gordon.” Then, at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, the photo appeared in artist Kadir Nelson's George Floyd-themed collage for the New Yorker cover, while also inspiring photographer Dario Calmese's Vanity Fair shoot with Viola Davis, her back turned to the camera. The formerly enslaved man's story was then retold in the 2022 movie “Emancipation” starring Will Smith.
    


Rare 19th-century images show China at the dawn of photography



            Meanwhile, the National Portrait Gallery and the National Museum of African American History and Culture are among several US institutions that still own prints of the photo. Both museums are part of the Smithsonian, which — according to a letter sent to its secretary, Lonnie Bunch III, by White House officials last month — is now obliged to present America's heritage in ways that are simultaneously “historically accurate” and “uplifting.” The Trump administration has begun a wide-ranging review of Smithsonian museums' content, and has signaled that it expects the institution to start implementing corrections around the end of the year.
    


            Whether the resulting changes compromise the Smithsonian's stated mission of presenting “the complexity of our past” will undoubtedly become a matter of debate. And what  the president's attempts to restore “truth and sanity to American history” mean for future displays of “Scourged Back” remains to be seen.

            Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has described Gaza as a potential real estate “bonanza” and claimed he was talking to the United States about how to divide up the war-torn enclave.
    


            Speaking at the Urban Renewal Summit in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, the far-right minister said that Israel and the US had “paid a lot of money for the war, so we need to share percentages on the land sales in Gaza.”
    


            Smotrich also said he had already started negotiations with the US on how to divide Gaza, claiming there was a business plan on the matter sitting “on President (Donald) Trump's desk.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            “We have done the demolition phase, which is always the first phase of urban renewal – now we need to build,” he said.
    


            Smotrich's comments follow similar remarks by Israel's far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who said on Monday that he planned to build a “magnificent neighborhood” for Israeli police officers in Gaza after Israel's operation in Gaza City is over.
    


            Trump has previously said that he viewed Gaza as a “big real estate site” and proposed expelling 2.1 million Palestinians from the territory before transforming it into a “Riviera” that would be owned by the US.
    


            In February, the president even posted a video on his Truth Social account – which appears to have been created with generative AI – promoting the transformation of Gaza into a Gulf state-like resort featuring a golden statue of himself, a hummus-eating Elon Musk, and shirtless American and Israeli leaders lounging on a beach.
    


Israeli tanks surround Gaza City ahead of ground incursion as EU proposes sanctions amid global outcry



            The proposal received mass condemnation from the international community.
    


            Israel's far-right has long wanted to move Palestinians out of Gaza, a prospect that critics have said would amount to ethnic cleansing.
    


            Fears are rising further for Gaza's plight as Israel said it has begun a planned invasion of Gaza City, the enclave's largest, pushing more than 1 million residents to overcrowded areas further south in the strip.
    


            As of Wednesday, Israeli tanks were stationed on the edge of Gaza City ahead of the planned ground operation, according to eyewitnesses and satellite imagery.

            • Disney's ABC is taking Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show off the air indefinitely amid public pressure from FCC Chair Brendan Carr and ABC affiliates.
    


            • The controversy stems from Kimmel's comments from his Monday night monologue about Charlie Kirk's suspected killer.
    


            • The stunning and sudden decision shocked Hollywood and surprised the show's staff. Kimmel has not yet commented on the suspension.
    


            Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr is a long-serving member of the regulator who has become an increasingly visible attack dog for the Trump administration this year.
    


            He is an attorney who joined the FCC as a staffer in 2012 and became a commissioner, appointed by Trump, in 2017. Upon Trump's reelection, the then-president-elect chose him to chair the regulatory agency.
    


            Carr has been a regular at Mar-a-Lago as well as Fox News, and earlier this year he showed his loyalty to Trump by wearing a gold lapel pin of the president's face.
    


            He rose to prominence in 2024 after he wrote the chapter on the FCC in the conservative blueprint known as Project 2025. In it, he railed against technology and media companies' “censorship” of right-wing content and values — and promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion programs. He wrote that among the agency's top priorities should be “reining in Big Tech.”
    


            He has promised to hold broadcast TV and radio stations accountable, and just one hour after thanking the president for his appointment, Carr wrote on X, “We must dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.”
    


            Since Trump's election, Carr has gone on the attack, threatening broadcasters with enforcement actions and investigations for perceived slights against Trump and the MAGA movement. He also has an active presence on social media, and is unafraid to make his rooting interests known: Carr initially reacted to the news of ABC's Kimmel show suspension with a celebratory dancing GIF from “The Office.”
    


            On Thursday morning, he wrote on X that he was “glad to see that many broadcasters are responding to their viewers as intended.”
    


            Comedians reacted to Jimmy Kimmel's show being pulled from ABC after remarks about Charlie Kirk.
    


            The move flooded social media with sharp, polarized takes — from censorship warnings to cheers.
    


Watch what some of them had to say:


Comedians react as Jimmy Kimmel's show is pulled by ABC after remarks about Charlie Kirk, flooding social media with sharp, polarized takes—from censorship warnings to cheers.


            Jimmy Kimmel's show was suspended after Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr on Wednesday issued an unsubtle threat to ABC and its affiliates that they must act against a comedian who has long lampooned Trump on his show. He implied that public broadcast licenses could be at risk. The cave came in hours.
    


            It's not hard to follow the money trail. Nexstar — one of the affiliate groups that threatened to pull Kimmel's show, forcing the hand of ABC's corporate leaders at Disney — is seeking to merge with another station conglomerate, Tegna. It needs the Trump administration's approval to do so.
    


            ABC and its parents could have resisted government efforts to shut down Kimmel's show on the grounds that the government is using its power to suppress the companies' First Amendment rights to free speech. But the public arm-twisting by Carr made the cost of such an option perfectly clear.
    


            The Trump administration is especially keen to target media firms as it seeks to suppress criticism of its own streams of misinformation or simply to spare the president from mockery on late-night comedy shows with which he's long feuded.
    


            Trump scored a win over “60 Minutes” in his dubious lawsuit against the iconic show. His legal action coincided with an ongoing merger between CBS' parent, Paramount, and Skydance. With billions of dollars riding on the merger, then-Paramount boss Shari Redstone opted for a settlement with the administration.
    


            And CBS recently canceled “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” insisting it did so to cut costs. But many media commentators believe it did so to muzzle another Trump critic.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune pointed to market forces as the reason for the indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's program and dismissed the notion the was the victim of government censorship.
    


            “That's obviously a decision the network made,” he said. “People make commercial economic market decisions, that's what it looked like to me.”
    


            “I believe in free speech,” he added.
    


            He was asked if the FCC should be encouraging stations to take down shows that the Trump administration opposes.
    


            “My preference would always be let the companies make economic market decisions. And you know, obviously, if they've got shows that are losing money and they don't have an audience, I think they'll, they'll come to that conclusion,” said Thune, a former chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the industry.
    


            The top Senate Republican did not respond to a question on whether it was appropriate for FCC Chair Brendan Carr to threaten companies if they didn't take action.
    


            Jimmy Fallon pulled out of a planned appearance at the Fast Company Innovation Festival on Thursday morning, according to a copy of an email sent to attendees viewed by CNN.
    


            “Unfortunately, Jimmy Fallon is no longer able to attend today's session,” the festival wrote in an email to attendees, about 30 minutes before the session was set to begin in New York.
    


            The NBC late-night host had been scheduled to appear at the festival for a talk called “Staying ‘On Brand,'” alongside Bozoma Saint John, co-host of his new unscripted NBC show “On Brand.”
    


            A spokesperson for Fast Company said, “In light of recent events, Jimmy couldn't be here. But we were so happy to have Bozoma Saint John.”
    


            Representatives for Fallon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


            FCC chair Brendan Carr appeared Thursday morning on CNBC's “Squawk on the Street” and skirted around the issue of whether his public threats to revoke ABC affiliate licenses led to Kimmel's suspension.
    


            Instead, he said, this was merely “local broadcasters now pushing back on national programs for the first time that I can think of in modern history.” Carr continued: “That's one thing we want at the FCC, we want to empower local broadcasters that have the public interest obligation to push back on national programmers so that people have more choice.”
    


            The Trump-appointed regulator cheered the results. “I'm pleased,” Carr said, “that Nexstar and Sinclair are looking to their viewers and saying, ‘Our viewers don't want this.'”
    


            Carr told CNBC that the core issue was that Kimmel's comments were “not a joke,” and instead appeared to “directly mislead the American public” about the Charlie Kirk assassination, which the FCC chair described as “one of the most significant political events we've had in a long time.”
    


            When asked whether it was appropriate for Sinclair to demand that Kimmel make a “meaningful personal donation” to Charlie Kirk's family and conservative activism organization in exchange for returning to air, Carr said the company “has every right to call for” that.
    


            Asked whether the FCC would like NBC to cancel Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, Carr replied: “If there's local TV stations that don't think running that programming serves the public interest, then they have every right under the law… to preempt it.”
    


            President Donald Trump on Thursday doubled down on his criticism of Jimmy Kimmel, calling the talk show host “not a talented person” and dismissing questions over whether his suspension amounted to an attack on free speech.
    


            “He had very bad ratings and they should have fired him a long time ago,” Trump said. “So you can call that free speech or not, he was fired for lack of talent.”
    


            Kimmel's suspension came after Trump's Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, threatened to take action against Disney and ABC if they did not address Kimmel's comments about the reaction to Charlie Kirk's murder.
    


            During a press conference in the UK Thursday, Trump again blasted Kimmel for saying “a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk.” But the president, who has long called for Kimmel to be taken off the air, insisted that the suspension was driven by poor viewership.
    


            “He had bad ratings more than anything else,” Trump said.
    


            ABC would certainly disagree with that characterization. While late-night TV viewership has been declining across the board, Kimmel has been holding his own, and in the second quarter of this year he actually outrated the usual #1 show, “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” in the key demographic of viewers ages 25 to 54.
    


            The American Federation of Musicians (AFM), a union representing musicians across the entertainment industry, condemned ABC and the Trump administration for what it said represents “a direct attack on free speech and artistic expression,” in the wake of the network's taking of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” off the air, which it said employs musicians from Local 47 in Los Angeles.
    


            “These are fundamental rights that we must protect in a free society,” AFM President Tino Gagliardi said in a statement.
    


            “This is not complicated: Trump's FCC identified speech it did not like and threatened ABC with extreme reprisals. This is state censorship. It is now happening in the United States of America, not some far-off country. It's happening right here and right now,” Gagliardi said. “We stand in solidarity with all those who will be without work because of government overreach.”
    


            Republican leaders in the House said this morning that the decision to indefinitely suspend Kimmel's late-night talk show is up to ABC.
    


            “I don't know anything about that,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said when asked of Democratic criticism of FCC Chair Brendan Carr.
    


                    “What I do know is that ABC is a private company and they can make their own choices on who they want to wear their brand so to speak. So this is a matter of ABC's leadership. It doesn't have anything to do with Congress or anything we're doing here,” Johnson said.
                





            House Majority Leader Steve Scalise was similarly mum on the criticism of Carr and said Kimmel's suspension came down to his tone.
    


            “Jimmy Kimmel's become more and more mean spirited. I mean frankly he's doing a late-night show and he's not funny. That's why ABC pulled him,” Scalise told reporters. “He's just gotten more and more violent. That turns people off. Don't blame republicans because you're no longer funny, just stop trying to be mean spirited.”
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and members of his leadership team, meanwhile, are accusing Carr of “bullying ABC” and calling for his resignation following the network's decision to indefinitely suspend Jimmy Kimmel.
    


                    “Brendan Carr, the so-called Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has engaged in the corrupt abuse of power. He has disgraced the office he holds by bullying ABC, the employer of Jimmy Kimmel, and forcing the company to bend the knee to the Trump administration. FCC Chair Brendan Carr should resign immediately,” the Democrats wrote in a statement
                





            “Donald Trump and the Republican Party's war on the First Amendment is blatantly inconsistent with American values,” they added.
    


            Former President Barack Obama said Thursday that media companies should “start standing up, rather than capitulating” to the Trump administration — adding his voice to the wave of criticism in the wake of ABC pulling Jimmy Kimmel off the air.
    


            “After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like,” Obama wrote in a message on X.
    


            He added: “This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it.”
    


            Obama has appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” before, during and after his presidency. He is friendly with Kimmel, an aide said, but his comments were directed at the Trump administration and Disney, the parent company of ABC.
    


            The former president made his comments on Thursday as he reposted stories about Kimmel and the firing of Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah, who said she was dismissed for her comments in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination.
    


            Obama, who has made a point of not responding to every action of the Trump administration, is increasingly speaking out and adding his voice on major issues of the day. He did not mention President Donald Trump by name, but his description of “government coercion” is among the strongest critique he has delivered that pointed at his successor.
    


            “Breaking news,” George Stephanopoulos said Thursday morning, “involving our parent company Disney and ABC, which pulled Jimmy Kimmel from the air overnight, hours after a threat to the network from the head of the FCC appointed by President Trump. The move has drawn a sharply polarized response.”
    


            Then he tossed to correspondent Elizabeth Schulze, who helmed a two-minute package about the news.
    


            Stephanopoulos wrapped the segment by saying this is the latest move “against the independent media from President Trump and his appointees.”
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other House Democratic leaders accused FCC Chair Brendan Carr of “bullying ABC” and called for his resignation following the network's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel.
    


            “Brendan Carr, the so-called Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has engaged in the corrupt abuse of power,” the leaders wrote in a statement. “He has disgraced the office he holds by bullying ABC, the employer of Jimmy Kimmel, and forcing the company to bend the knee to the Trump administration. FCC Chair Brendan Carr should resign immediately.”
    


            “Donald Trump and the Republican Party's war on the First Amendment is blatantly inconsistent with American values,” they added.
    


            The Democratic leaders also said media companies like ABC “have a lot to explain” and questioned whether there is a “pay-to-play scheme” underway.
    


            The suspension came after Carr told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson that Kimmel's remarks about Charlie Kirk's assassination constituted “the sickest conduct possible,” and suggested the FCC could move to revoke ABC affiliate licenses.  After that, Nexstar, which operates about two dozen ABC affiliates, issued a public statement objecting to Kimmel's remarks and saying its stations would “replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets.”
    


            Democratic leaders called ABC's actions – and Nexstar's threats – censorship.
    


            “The censoring of artists and cancellation of shows is an act of cowardice,” they wrote. “It may also be part of a corrupt pay-to-play scheme. House Democrats will make sure the American people learn the truth, even if that requires the relentless unleashing of congressional subpoena power. This will not be forgotten.”
    


            The stunning news of Kimmel's suspension amid Trump administration pressure has left us asking a bunch of questions. Here are some worth pondering:
    


            • ABC's statement amounted to just seven words, and three of those words were the title of Jimmy Kimmel's show. Now, millions of viewers are outraged, while others are gloating about Kimmel's suspension. What more will the network say and when?
    


            • Kimmel's contract was coming up for renewal at the end of this year, and he has previously dropped hints about retiring. So, did his retirement start last night?
    


            • Would streaming services like Netflix take a risk on talent like Kimmel or Stephen Colbert in this political environment?
    


            • Assuming Trump and Carr feel emboldened by ABC's action, what's the next move? Will Republicans in Congress try to expand the FCC's powers so that Carr can bully media outlets that aren't currently subject to regulatory scrutiny?
    


            • Trump has portrayed himself as a champion of free speech; do his supporters see the hypocrisy that's self-evident here?
    


            • Will conservative-leaning comedians, like Kimmel's longtime best friend, Adam Carolla, defend him? What will Trump-friendly podcasters like Joe Rogan say in the coming days?
    


            • Trump immediately pivoted to saying Comcast should fire NBC's Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers next. How will Comcast respond to political pressure?
    


            • What are the co-hosts of “The View” thinking right now? Will the show talk about Kimmel today or in the coming days? Recall this headline from over the summer: “White House warns ‘The View' could be canceled next after Joy Behar's anti-Trump rant.”
    


            • Will the government's actions against old-line media companies cause even more of a talent exodus to Substack, YouTube and other newer platforms?
    


            Jimmy Kimmel, in his recent monologues, made comments that referenced Charlie Kirk's murder suspect Tyler Robinson and criticized what he perceived as right-wing media's attempts to politicize the assassination.
    


            On Monday, Kimmel said: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it. In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving.”
    


            On Tuesday, Kimmel said: “Many in MAGA-land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.”
    


            Weaponize the levers of government for partisan political gain. Pressure privately owned media companies to toe the party line. Punish the owners who resist and reward the ones who acquiesce.
    


            That's how Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán consolidated control of the media in his country, according to scholars who witnessed Hungary's democratic backsliding firsthand.
    


            President Trump and his allies appear to be running the same playbook against media outlets in the US.
    


            Using legal maneuvers, financial incentives and public pressure campaigns, Trump is persuading companies to make changes that benefit his party and bolster his own power. Wednesday's decision by Disney's ABC to sideline Jimmy Kimmel is the latest example.
    


            Gábor Scheiring, who experienced Orbán's autocratic power plays firsthand as a member of the Hungarian parliament, told CNN that “this story is very familiar.”
    


            Scheiring, now an assistant professor at Georgetown University Qatar, said that both ABC's decision-making about Kimmel and last July's move by CBS to cancel “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” reek of what is sometimes called “Orbanism.”
    


            “A key underlying story is that media owners, both foreign and domestic, largely capitulated individually rather than mounting collective resistance, which enabled Orbán's systematic capture strategy,” he said.
    


            On Monday, Kimmel said in his monologue: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it. In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving.”
    


            On Tuesday, Kimmel said: “Many in MAGA-land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.”
    


            On Wednesday, FCC Chair Brendan Carr told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson that the late-night host's remarks constituted “the sickest conduct possible,” and he suggested the FCC could move to revoke ABC affiliate licenses as a way to force Disney to punish Kimmel.
    


            Later Wednesday, Nexstar, which operates about two dozen ABC affiliates, issued a press release saying it “strongly objects” to Kimmel's remarks and saying its stations would “replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets.”
    


            Minutes after Nexstar criticized Kimmel publicly, ABC said the show was being yanked nationwide.
    


            As Jimmy Kimmel prepared to tape last night's episode in Hollywood, ABC decided to pull the plug, much to the astonishment of the entertainment industry.
    


            Free speech and free expression groups immediately condemned ABC, calling the suspension cowardly, while President Donald Trump, who frequently sparred with Kimmel, celebrated all the way from the UK, where he is on a state visit.
    


                    “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. “That leaves Jimmy (Fallon) and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!”
                





            Disney's ABC is taking Jimmy Kimmel's late night talk show off the air indefinitely amid a controversy over his recent comments about Charlie Kirk's suspected killer.
    


            “Jimmy Kimmel Live will be pre-empted indefinitely,” an ABC spokesperson said, declining to share any further details.
    


            A representative for Kimmel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


            The stunning decision came just a few hours after the Trump administration official responsible for licensing ABC's local stations publicly pressured the company to punish Kimmel.
    


            As news was breaking of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show being suspended, guests booked on yesterday's episode were already on their way to the El Capitan Theater in Hollywood where “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” is recorded, sources told CNN.
    


            The sudden decision made by ABC to pull the show from air came hours after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr said on a podcast that the FCC could move to revoke ABC affiliate licenses as a way to force Disney, ABC's parent company, to punish Kimmel for recent comments he made about reaction to Charlie Kirk's shooting death.
    


            According to a source with knowledge of the events, Kimmel's staff members had been working as usual, holding calls with talent publicists regarding upcoming episodes just before the decision was announced.
    


            Numerous Hollywood publicists, producers, media executives who spoke with CNN on Wednesday evening expressed their astonishment over the suspension.
    


            “We are all shell-shocked,” one celebrity publicist told CNN.
    


            “I cannot believe this is real life,” a studio publicist said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Bad news for Da Bears and Mahomes in trouble: 5 things to know about Week 3 of the NFL season","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/sport/football-nfl-week-3-five-things-to-know","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 11:00:05 GMT","


            The NFL season may be young, but the stakes are already high heading into Week 3. Joe Burrow is sidelined again, Patrick Mahomes is in uncharted territory, and a handful of teams are staring down the dreaded 0-3 start.
    


            Here are five things you need to know.
    


            Bad news in Cincinnati: Joe Burrow is out once again.
    


            The Bengals quarterback – who was placed on injured reserved on Tuesday – suffered turf toe that requires surgery and is expected to miss at least three months, according to reports, derailing another season before it really gets going.
    


            It's the latest blow in what's become a frustrating cycle of injuries for Burrow and the Bengals. Still, Cincinnati has opened 2-0 for the first time since 2018, giving the team a little cushion. Backup Jake Browning takes over as the Bengals visit the 1-1 Minnesota Vikings on Sunday.
    


            Minnesota has quarterback issues of its own, with rookie J.J. McCarthy sidelined two to four weeks by an ankle injury. That leaves Carson Wentz, once cast aside, with another chance to prove he belongs.
    


            The Indianapolis Colts have done something no NFL team has ever done in the Super Bowl era: they haven't punted through two games. That's not just efficiency – it's borderline absurd.
    


            Quarterback Daniel Jones, rejuvenated in Indy, has clicked with running back Jonathan Taylor to power a 2-0 start, capped by last week's win over Denver.
    


            For now, Rigoberto Sanchez has the strangest job in football: punter without a punt. That streak could end Sunday when the Colts play their first road game against Tennessee, but the fact it lasted this long shows just how dangerous Indy's offense looks.
    


            The Chicago Bears are in a rough spot at 0-2, including a 52-21 mauling at the hands of the Detroit Lions that showed how far they still have to go.
    


            Fans expected second-year quarterback Caleb Williams and new head coach Ben Johnson to spark a turnaround, but so far the offense has been inconsistent, and the defense has been flat-out bad.
    


            Chicago's next test is a clash with the Dallas Cowboys, whose defense just gave up 450 yards passing to Russell Wilson.
    


            If Williams and the offense can't take advantage of that matchup at home, expect the Soldier Field boos to rain down early.
    


            For the first time in his career, Patrick Mahomes is 0-2.
    


            The Chiefs' 20-17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in last week's Super Bowl rematch marked their third straight defeat dating back to last season. That hasn't happened since Andy Reid and Mahomes joined forces.
    


            Kansas City fans aren't used to this kind of start – especially after celebrating three Super Bowl titles in the last six years. No one's hitting the panic button yet, but if the Chiefs fall to the New York Giants on Sunday night and drop to 0-3, it would spark a full-on crisis in KC.
    


            Falling to 0-3 is essentially a death sentence for playoff hopes.
    


            Only six teams in NFL history have started 0-3 and rallied to reach the postseason. The most recent example was the 2018 Houston Texans, and before that you have to go back to the 1998 Bills. It's rare for a reason – digging out of a three-game hole in a league built on parity is almost impossible.
    


            This week, 10 teams are staring at that cliff: the Chiefs, Texans, New York Jets (who will be missing starting QB Justin Fields due to a concussion), Miami Dolphins, Giants, Cleveland Browns, Tennessee Titans, Bears, New Orleans Saints and Carolina Panthers. That means a slew of “must-win” games in Week 3, even though the calendar still says September.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Thursday asked the Supreme Court for an emergency order to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's board of governors. 

The Republican administration turned to the high court after an appeals court refused to go along with ousting Cook, part of President Donald Trump's effort to reshape the Fed's seven-member governing board and strike a blow at its independence.

The White House campaign to unseat Cook marks an unprecedented bid to reshape the Fed board, which was designed to be largely independent from day-to-day politics. No president has fired a sitting Fed governor in the agency's 112-year history.

Cook, who was appointed to the Fed's board by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has said she won't leave her post and won't be “bullied” by Trump. One of her lawyers, Abbe Lowell, has said she “will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.”

Separately, Senate Republicans on Monday confirmed Stephen Miran, Trump's nominee to an open spot on the Fed's board. Both Cook and Miran took part in Wednesday's vote in which the Fed cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point.

Trump sought to fire Cook on Aug. 25, but a federal judge ruled last week that the removal probably was illegal and reinstated her to the Fed's board. Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties, in Michigan and Georgia, as “primary residences” in June and July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home. 




“Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself — and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in his Supreme Court filing.

But Cook has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. According to documents obtained by The Associated Press, Cook did specify that her Atlanta condo would be a “vacation home,” according to a loan estimate she obtained in May 2021. And in a form seeking a security clearance, she described it as a “2nd home.” Both documents appear to undercut the Trump administration's claims of fraud. 

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration had not satisfied a legal requirement that Fed governors can only be fired “for cause,” which she said was limited to misconduct while in office. Cook did not join the Fed's board until 2022.

Cobb also held that Trump's firing would have deprived Cook of her due process, or legal right, to contest the firing.

By a 2-1 vote, a panel of the federal appeals court in Washington rejected the administration's request to let Cook's firing proceed.

Trump's lawyers have argued that even if the conduct occurred before her time as governor, her alleged action “indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy.” 

Trump has previously won orders from the court's conservative majority to fire the presidentially appointed leaders of other independent federal agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Trade Commission, even as legal fights continue.

Those firings have been at will, with no cause given. The Supreme Court has distinguished the Federal Reserve from those other agencies, strongly suggesting that Trump can't act against Fed governors without cause.

In its new filing to the Supreme Court, the administration is asking Chief Justice John Roberts for a temporary order that would effectively remove Cook from the board and a more lasting order from the whole court that would be in place while her legal case continues.

ABC has suspended Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show indefinitely after comments that he made about Charlie Kirk's killing led a group of ABC-affiliated stations to say it would not air the show.

The crowd lined up to attend “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Wednesday were turned away just before they expected to enter the theater in Hollywood, according to one audience member. ABC announced that it has “indefinitely” suspended the late-night talk show. (Sept. 17)

ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show following comments he made about the killing of Charlie Kirk drew reactions from across the entertainment and political worlds, including from President Donald Trump.

Fellow late-night host Stephen Colbert got the news Wednesday while taping an episode of his own show in New York, telling a stunned studio audience that “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” had been suspended.

“It was a mix of shock and bewilderment,” said audience member Monserrat Lopez, recounting how Colbert left the stage before coming back to say he would call Kimmel to talk privately. 

Just this summer, CBS said Colbert's “Late Show” would end next year due to financial reasons — a decision made just after Colbert criticized a settlement between Trump and CBS's parent company over a “60 Minutes” story.

During Kimmel's Monday night monologue, he suggested that the suspect in Kirk's killing might have been a pro-Trump Republican.

Kimmel's show was suspended not long after Nexstar Communications Group announced plans to pull the program from its 23 ABC affiliates starting Wednesday. The Federal Communications Commission's chairman called Kimmel's comments “truly sick” and said his agency had a strong case for holding Kimmel, ABC and network parent Walt Disney Co. accountable for spreading misinformation.

There was no immediate comment from Kimmel, whose contract is up in May 2026. In its statement announcing the suspension, ABC didn't cite a reason.

Here's are some other notable reactions posted on social media: 




“Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC,” he wrote, referring to late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers. “Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT”

Neither Fallon nor Meyers had commented publicly about Trump's post as of Thursday.

“After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like. This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it.”

“Local broadcasters have an obligation to serve the public interest. While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community values.”

“The state under Donald Trump has amassed a chilling record of restricting speech, extorting private companies, and dropping the full weight of the government censorship hammer on First Amendment rights. This is no exaggeration. Trump's attorney general has directly confirmed that they'll come after you for your speech, and now his FCC chair has doubled down. It's not the bully pulpit anymore — it's the thought police presidency.”

“I was supposed to go over and have a chat with my friend Jimmy Kimmel on his show, but as you have heard by now, the Jimmy Kimmel Show has been pulled indefinitely. Abruptly, because of complaints from the Trump administration. So let's see. He didn't end the Ukraine war or solve Gaza within his first week. But he did end freedom of speech within his first year. Hey, for those of you who pray, now's the time to do it. Love you Jimmy.”

“I'm not sure who needs to hear this but Jimmy Kimmel got on the air and falsely stated as a fact that Charlie Kirk's killer was MAGA, smearing an entire movement and Trump in particular with a vile disgusting lie — and at a time when the threat against those on the right is at an all-time high.”

Kelly was fired from her NBC morning show in 2018 after suggesting it was OK for white people to wear blackface at Halloween.

“I am horrified at the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel Live. What Jimmy said was FREE speech, not hate speech. People seem to only want to protect free speech when it suits THEIR agenda. Though I didn't agree at ALL with Charlie Kirk; his shooting death sickened me; and should have sickened any decent human being. What is happening to our country?”

“I've spent a lot of time in public & private defending comedians I don't agree with. If you're a comedian & you don't call out the insanity of pulling Kimmel off the air — don't bother spouting off about free speech anymore.”

“Kimmel canned for disgusting Kirk comments. ... Jimmy Kimmel is a pathetic hate monger. He should've been canned a long time ago. Better late than never.”

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — After well over a century under construction, Barcelona's Sagrada Familia basilica is ready to raise its immense central tower and become the tallest Christian church in Europe.

The basilica's General Director Xavier Martínez said Thursday that “the tower will be finished at the end of this year or the beginning of 2026.”

“This is an important moment in the history of the building of the Sagrada Familia because it will reach its maximum height,” Martínez told The Associated Press. “We are used to seeing skyscrapers like those in the United States (go up), but it is remarkable that in the 21st century we are building a cathedral.”

Once the gigantic Tower of Jesus Christ is up, the masterpiece of architect Antoni Gaudí will rise to 172 meters (564 feet). That will make it taller than the Ulmer Münster church in southern Germany, which tops out at 162 meters (531.5 feet).

The first pieces are already in place and the rest will be added in phases over the coming months. Once complete, the structure will be crowned by a cross and tightly surrounded by five other towers, one dedicated to Mary and four slightly shorter ones for the four evangelists.




Work on the facades and interior will continue for several years, the church's head of construction Esteve Camps said, but the goal is to finish building work in approximately a decade from now.

Next year will be the 100th anniversary of the death of Gaudí. The church will hold several events to celebrate his legacy, which includes several stunning buildings in Barcelona and other places in Spain.

Pope Leo XIV has been invited for a solemn Mass to be held in Gaudí's memory on June 10, the day he died when struck by a streetcar in 1926. Sagrada Familia officials said that they hope to have a response from the Vatican in the coming weeks.

Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the Sagrada Familia (Holy Family in Spanish) and designated it a minor basilica in 2010.

The first stone of the Sagrada Familia was placed in 1882. Gaudí never expected it to be completed in his lifetime. Only one of its multiple towers was finished when he died.

A fervent Catholic, Gaudi incorporated both Christian symbolism and organic forms into his unique aesthetic.

Work has sped up over recent decades as the basilica became a major international tourist attraction. The money from entrance fees is used to fund the ongoing construction. Last year, 4.9 million people paid to visit it, with 15% of those tourists coming from the United States.

TACOMA, Wash. (AP) — A helicopter crashed in Washington state near Joint Base Lewis-McChord, the U.S. Army said Thursday. There was no immediate word of how many people were aboard and their conditions.

The helicopter crashed at about 9 p.m. Wednesday near the base, an Army official said in a statement.

“This remains a developing situation, and no additional details are available at this time,” the statement said. No details were released about the helicopter.

The base is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Tacoma under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Joint Base Headquarters.

The Thurston County sheriff's office, based in Olympia, posted online late Wednesday that deputies were dispatched to reports of a possible helicopter crash in the Summit Lake area, west of Olympia. 

“We have been advised that the military lost contact with a helicopter in the area,” the department said. It said it was working with the base and that no further details were available.

Thurston County Sheriff Derek Sanders said on Facebook that deputies located the crash site, “but have been unable to continue rescue efforts as the scene is on fire.”

The King County Guardian 1 helicopter and special operation rescue units responded to the crash site, the sheriff said.

NEW YORK (AP) — Nvidia, the world's leading chipmaker, announced on Thursday that it's investing $5 billion in Intel and will collaborate with the struggling semiconductor company.

The two companies will team up to work on custom data centers that form the backbone of artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as personal computer products, Nvidia said in a press release.

Nvidia said it will spend $5 billion to buy Intel common stock at $23.28 a share. The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, comes a month after the U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel. 




“This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. “Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.”

The two companies said they will work on “seamlessly connecting” their architectures. 

In morning trading, Intel shares jumped 25%, its biggest one-day percentage gain in decades. Nvidia shares added 2%.

For data centers, Intel will make custom chips that Nvidia will use in its AI infrastructure platforms. While for PC products, Intel will build chips that integrate Nvidia technology.

The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, which was a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut. 

Intel fell even farther behind in recent years amid the artificial intelligence boom that's propelled Nvidia into the world's most valuable company. Intel lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, and expects to slash its workforce by a quarter by the end of 2025.

The U.S. government stepped in last month to secure a 10% stake, making it one of Intel's biggest shareholders. Federal officials said they invested in Intel in order to bolster U.S. technology and domestic manufacturing. 

The deal is “bullish for U.S. tech,” Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note.

“This is a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game,” Ives said. “Along with the recent U.S. government investment for 10% (equity stake in Intel) this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors.”

Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the artificial intelligence boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems. 

The deal between the two chipmakers comes as China moves to be less dependent on U.S. semiconductor technology. This week, Chinese officials reportedly forbade several large domestic technology companies from purchasing Nvidia chips, and Huawei announced that it was expanding its development of AI chips and manufacturing.

While Nvidia and Intel will work together to develop new chips, a manufacturing deal has yet to be struck between the two. The potential access to Intel's chip foundries by Nvidia poses a risk to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which currently manufactures the tech giant's flagship processors.

WASHINGTON (AP) — At a moment of growing international alarm about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, more U.S. adults view Israel's military action in the Palestinian territory as excessive than at the beginning of the war, according to a new poll.

About half of Americans say the military response from Israel in the Gaza Strip has “gone too far,” according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That's up from November 2023, when 40% said Israel's military action had gone too far. That AP-NORC poll was conducted shortly after Hamas started the conflict by launching an Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages.

But at the same time, Americans overall, particularly Republicans, are less likely to say that negotiating a ceasefire should be a high priority for the U.S. government than they were just a few months ago when the U.S. was holding ceasefire talks with Hamas.

The shift in American attitudes about Israel's actions comes as Israel begins an expanded ground offensive on Gaza City. Israel is facing increased international scrutiny over its conduct in Gaza, with a team of independent experts commissioned by the United Nations' Human Rights Council this week announcing it has concluded that Israel is committing genocide. 

Israel has already destroyed vast areas of Gaza, displaced around 90% of the population and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with experts announcing a famine in Gaza City. The Palestinian death toll has surpassed 65,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

“The level of innocent women and children suffering,” said Renee Hollier, of Lafayette, Louisiana, who described herself as a political independent and mother of a toddler. “There's just no justification for this kind of suffering to continue.”

The poll found a bipartisan uptick in Americans finding Israel's military response has “gone too far.” 

About 7 in 10 Democrats say this now, up from 58% in November 2023. And roughly half of independents say the same, compared with about 4 in 10 in the earlier measure. Republicans have also moved slightly, from 18% to 24%.




Concern about overreach from Israel was high in January 2024, when 50% of U.S. adults said Israel had “gone too far,” but that fell slightly as the war continued.

And 45% of U.S. adults now say it's “extremely” or “very” important for the U.S. to provide humanitarian relief to Palestinians in Gaza, similar to Americans' views at the start of the war but up slightly from 41% in March.

Miguel Martinez, 55, of Miami, said it remains critical for President Donald Trump's Republican administration to prioritize humanitarian relief even as it backs the Israeli military's effort to defeat Hamas. Martinez supports Israel's aim to defeat Hamas, but he's concerned that the conflict is dragging on.

“Not everyone there is the enemy,” said Martinez, a Republican who said he broadly approves of Trump's handling of the conflict. “Those people need help.”

Despite the growing view that Israel has overstepped, Americans are less likely to consider it a high priority to negotiate a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas than they were when the Trump administration was heavily involved in negotiations. That downward shift is primarily driven by Republicans. 

About half of U.S. adults say it's “extremely” or “very” important, down from 59% in March but in line with views from last year. Republicans have grown less likely to say it's “extremely” or “very” important for the U.S. to negotiate a permanent ceasefire since earlier in the year, while Democrats haven't shifted.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the conflict will continue until Hamas is eliminated and the remaining hostages are released from captivity. Hamas has said its assault was in response to the more than decadelong blockade of Gaza, Israeli raids inside West Bank cities, increasing attacks by settlers on Palestinians and the growth of settlements.

In interviews, Americans across the political spectrum were dour about the prospects of the Trump administration mediating a lasting ceasefire. During the campaign, Trump pledged to quickly end the Israel-Hamas war as well as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He's struggled with both.

Approval of Trump's handling of the conflict is down slightly among U.S. adults to 37%, compared with 44% in March.

“There's an all-or-nothing attitude on both sides,” Martinez said of Israel and Hamas. “Any resolution, any ceasefire, it's hard to see it being anything more than temporary.”

Netanyahu last week approved an audacious strike targeting Hamas officials in the Gulf emirate of Qatar, an operation that killed six people but that Hamas claims failed to kill any of the group's leaders. The attack also threatened to upend months of ceasefire diplomacy mediated by Qatar, which has served as an intermediary with Hamas.

Larry Kapenstein, 71, a Democrat from Middletown, Pennsylvania, said he's worried about the conflict's long-term ramifications for Israel's economy and standing in the world.

“I side with Israel, and I think they're in the right in this, but I think Netanyahu has just taken this too far,” Kapenstein said. “There's got to be a better way.”

About 3 in 10 U.S. adults said it is “extremely” or “very” important to negotiate the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, unchanged from January 2024. But that belief is especially pronounced among Democrats: About half now say this is highly important, up from 41% in 2024. That compares with 19% of independents and 14% of Republicans. 

The U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly last week to support a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict and urge Israel to commit to a Palestinian state, a move that Netanyahu vehemently opposed and that the U.S. was one of the 10 countries to vote against.

The survey also found slightly less support for military aid for Israel.

About 2 in 10 U.S. adults said it is “extremely” or “very” important for the U.S. to provide aid to Israel's military to fight Hamas, down from 36% at the war's start. The decline has been particularly dramatic among Democrats, from 30% at the beginning of the war to 15% now.

Lehks Wright, 50, of Albany, Georgia, who is an independent, said it's difficult to justify spending billions of dollars backing Israel's military when the Trump administration is calling for sweeping cuts in federal spending on health care and other social programs.

“If you're going to say we're in a deficit and there's government bloat, and I am not doubting that, then cut spending on other countries, too,” Wright said.

The ""Jeopardy!"" stage turned into a pop culture battleground this week after contestants failed to identify one of Hollywood's most legendary actors.

In a recent episode of the beloved game show, viewers were left stunned when all three contestants couldn't come up with the name of James Earl Jones, whose voice was linked to some of the most memorable moments in film history.

During Monday night's show, ""Jeopardy!"" host Ken Jennings presented the category ""Sesame Street.""

One of the clues read, ""Throughout the years, lots of people have stopped by ‘Sesame Street' like Alex Trebek and Ken Jennings,"" the Oscar the Grouch character began to say from his trash can. 

""Why can't they leave a grouch alone? But, the very first was this guy, who recited the alphabet for us.""

As Jennings read the clue, a black-and-white photo of Jones popped up on the screen.

The buzzer went off as the ""Jeopardy!"" contestants drew a blank.

""That's James Earl Jones,"" Jennings revealed, referring to the voice icon, who died on Sept. 9, 2024, at the age of 93.

On the official ""Jeopardy!"" social media account, fans didn't hold back — quickly calling out the contestants for failing to recognize one of the most iconic voices in Hollywood history.

One fan fired off, ""Literally how did not a single one of them not know THEE James Earl Jones!?""

""Nobody knew James Earl Jones, straight to jail,"" one viewer joked, while another admitted, ""The way I screamed JAMES EARL JONES to my phone multiple times.""

""So excuse me, you know Rocco The Rock but you don't know James Earl Jones? I weep,"" another comment read.

Jones was best known for his voice role as Darth Vader in the ""Star Wars"" franchise, in addition to ""Coming to America,"" ""Field of Dreams"" and ""The Hunt for Red October.""

The award-winning actor passed away at his home in Dutchess County, New York, surrounded by family, his representative shared in a statement to Fox News Digital at the time. 

Jones is one of the few entertainers to have achieved EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony awards) status. 

Over his illustrious career, he claimed two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Grammy and three Tony Awards — solidifying his legacy in television, music and theater.

While Jones did not win a competitive Oscar, he was presented with the Honorary Academy Award by Sir Ben Kingsley.

Jones launched his career in theater in the early ‘50s. He earned acclaim as one of the premier Shakespearean actors of his time, commanding the stage with unforgettable performances as ""Othello,"" ""King Lear,"" Oberon in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" and Claudius in ""Hamlet."" 

His most prolific role came in the form of voicing Darth Vader in George Lucas' 1977 space epic ""Star Wars."" He reprised his role for the sequels ""The Empire Strikes Back"" in 1980 and again in ""Return of the Jedi"" in 1983.

Jones' film credits additionally included, ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""The Sandlot,"" ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger.""

He was a Kennedy Center honoree in 2002 and received lifetime achievement awards from the Screen Actors Guild in 2009 and the National Board of Review in 1995.

Right on Crime executive director Brett Tolman and retired FBI special agent Robin Dreeke discuss the alarming rise in justifying political violence on ‘America Reports.'

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting blasted on social media after posting a picture supporting American Federation of Teachers (AFT) chief Randi Weingarten's new book that suggests her political opponents are ""fascists.""

""Congratulations to my friend [Weingarten] on ‘Why Fascists Fear Teachers.' From banning books to controlling curriculum, authoritarians go after public education because it's a cornerstone of democracy,"" Clinton posted on Wednesday, along with a picture of Weingarten holding the book. 

""Randi's new book is a critical read for this moment,"" she wrote.

Clinton was criticized by conservatives for the post, which they argued continued the smear campaign against political opponents that many believe contributed to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

""It's been one week since Charlie Kirk was murdered by a lunatic who wrote about ‘fascists' on shell casings,"" Republican communicator Matt Whitlock posted on X. 

""Now, Randi Weingarten has a new book arguing everyone who disagrees with her views on public education – which have destroyed public education in America – is a fascist.""

American Culture Project senior fellow Corey DeAngelis wrote on X, ""Hillary Clinton and Randi Weingarten are going full speed ahead with this disgusting rhetoric right after Charlie Kirk's assassination. Sick people.""

""Charlie Kirk was murdered exactly one week ago,"" conservative influencer Jack Posobiec posted on X. ""Here's Hillary Clinton today:""

""They wrote an entire book on a word they don't even understand,"" restaurateur and Huntington Beach City Council member Andrew Gruel posted on X.

""The room. That's what y'all should read,"" Washington Free Beacon investigative reporter Chuck Ross posted on X.

""Democrats Hillary Clinton and Randi Weingarten are still suggesting Republicans are ‘fascists,'"" an account belonging to the Republican National Committee (RNC) posted on X.

""They really can't help themselves, can they?""

Fox News Digital reached out to Clinton's office for comment on the post, which has racked up 2 million views on X, but did not immediately hear back.

""Have they read the book?"" Weingarten said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""If they did they'd discover it's a love letter to teachers.""

Weingarten's book, which hit bookshelves Tuesday, elaborates on her views on battling what she says is fascist ideology and how it works to ""undermine democracy, opportunity and public education as we know it.""

""Attacks on schools and teachers have long been a hallmark of fascist regimes: Throughout history, as many dictators rose to power they began banning books and controlling curriculum,"" the book's preview reads. ""Fascists fear teachers because teachers foster an educated and empowered population that can see past propaganda and scare tactics. Fascists fear teachers because they teach young people how to think for themselves."" 

Media pundits and conservatives have been pointing to the left's years of claiming conservative figures such as Kirk are ""fascists."" 

Following Kirk's assassination at the hands of a shooter authorities say embraced a leftist ideology, numerous examples have surfaced of liberal pundits, politicians, professors and other individuals celebrating or downplaying the death of Kirk, prompting many to blame heated political rhetoric from the left as a contributor to Kirk's death.

University of Oregon sophomore Maggie Thorsby discusses the 'Charlie Kirk effect' that has inspired an outpouring of support for Turning Point USA in the days following his assassination on a Utah college campus.

FIRST ON FOX: More than a dozen state attorneys general sent a letter to public university and college presidents in their respective states Thursday warning them against invoking the assassination of Charlie Kirk to chill conservative free speech, or face investigations and potential lawsuits, Fox News Digital exclusively learned. 

""Unfortunately, we have heard troubling reports that some university officials are using the murder of Charlie Kirk as a justification to shut down speech on campus,"" the letter reads. ""While considering safety concerns, it is critical that universities are not imposing what would effectively be a tax on free speech."" 

""Particularly at this moment, when free speech itself was attacked, our universities must show through their actions that they will defend free speech and resist the ‘Assassin's Veto.' You have an obligation to protect free speech—you must not use the burden of protecting free speech to prevent free speech.""

The ""assassin's veto"" is understood as a phenomenon of using violence or threats of violence to silence opposing views.

At the heart of the letter is the issue of security costs as it pertains to conservative speakers. Colleges and universities previously have come under fire over accusations of charging higher security fees for conservative speakers.

Such accusations have led to free speech lawsuits in the past, including the University of California, Berekely, settling a lawsuit with campus conservative groups, the College Republicans and Young America's Foundation, in 2018 concerning allegations the school discriminated against conservative speakers by leveling higher security fees and other safety restrictions that led to the cancellation of right-leaning speakers on campus. 

Berkeley argued that the higher security fees were based on assessment from law enforcement officials that the speakers were likely to face an increase in public disruption and violence, before reaffirming its ""commitment to free speech"" and changing its security fee operations. 

The state attorneys general called on colleges to ensure they ""impose security fees in a content-neutral and viewpoint-neutral manner"" or face potential investigation and legal action.

YEARS OF CAMPUS ATTACKS ON CONSERVATIVE ACTIVISTS RESURFACE AFTER CHARLIE KIRK'S MURDER

""Any security policy that appears neutral on its face must not be applied in a discriminatory manner. There is a long and troubling trend of universities misusing security policies to unconstitutionally chill conservative speech on campus. For example, just last year, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico issued a preliminary injunction against the University of New Mexico after the university attempted to charge Turning Point USA over $5,000 in security fees for an October 2023 event featuring conservative speaker Riley Gaines. As the Court found, that was unacceptable,"" the letter continued, pointing to another instance of colleges using security fees to allegedly silence conservative voices. 

The letter was spearheaded by Republican Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird. A total of 17 Republican state attorneys general signed onto the letter, including top law enforcement officials from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Utah. 

""The tragedy of Charlie Kirk's assassination is a sobering reminder that the right to free speech must be protected,"" Bird told Fox Digital. ""Charlie was murdered while debating on a university campus, a place where the free exchange of ideas should be encouraged; we cannot allow the actions of an assassin to stop free speech in any way. Colleges and universities must take steps to keep their students safe while preserving free discussion and open debate."" 

Kirk was killed Sept. 10 while he was at Utah Valley University's campus as part of a Turning Point USA event. The conservative powerhouse was sitting under a tent while chatting with students when a single shot rang out and struck Kirk in the neck. 

""We were shocked and saddened by the assassination of Charlie Kirk on the campus of Utah Valley University on Wednesday,"" the letter reads. ""As the chief law enforcement officers of our states, we unequivocally condemn political violence of any kind. The fact that the slaying took place on a college campus, during a debate, makes it even more tragic."" 

""It is critical our state institutions of higher learning serve as forums for robust debate from all perspectives,"" the letter continued. ""The campus should be the very place where the First Amendment rings loudest for all to hear. We urge you to say no to the 'Assassin's Veto.'""

The attorneys general argued that students might be considered ""consumers"" under the respective states' Consumer Fraud Acts or Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices laws, and that the universities might violate state ""laws if you invoke ‘security concerns' to impose exorbitant fees on student groups,"" while simultaneously advertising to students that the school is open for discussion and dialogue across the political spectrum.

""If we receive complaints about your school, we will fully and fairly investigate those complaints subject to the authority of our respective offices,"" the state attorneys general wrote. ""Our offices are committed to ensuring that all our state entities, including our public colleges and universities, follow the Constitution."" 

Conservative nonprofits, including President of Defending Education Nicole Neily, celebrated that the AGs' calls for better protecting free speech is the ideal way to honor Kirk's legacy. 

""This is a moment for leadership, and we are deeply grateful that the nation's attorneys general are using their authority to remind university administrators of their sacred obligation to protect free speech and open discourse on college campuses,"" she said. ""I can think of no better way to honor Charlie's legacy than through ensuring that students voices cannot be silenced by fear or malice."" 

Will Hild, the executive director for Consumers' Research, a longtime nonprofit dedicated to consumer information, lauded Bird for leading the charge on ending the ""assassin's veto.""

""By sustaining the assassin's veto, these University bureaucrats are actively aiding Charlie's murderer, using the threat of violence to cut off free debate,"" Hild told Fox Digital. ""Such a practice is not just antithetical to everything Charlie Kirk represented but to the very principles of America. Attorney General Bird's leadership in rallying states' top law enforcement officers to oppose the Assassin's Veto in all its forms is encouraging and should be emulated by others. Last week's atrocity should be a turning point for every American campus.""

A judge dropped terror charges against Luigi Mangione who is accused of fatally gunning down killing Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. The 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts weigh in on how his supporters responded. 

While accused assassin Luigi Mangione has thousands of supporters online and attracts demonstrators outside of his court appearances, their push for ""jury nullification"" in his pending cases may be a long shot, experts tell Fox News Digital.

The 26-year-old former Ivy Leaguer is accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a Minnesota father of two, outside a shareholder conference in New York City on Dec. 4. Mangione allegedly kept journals that described his plans for the attack, his intent to send a message and condemnations of the health insurance industry.

""This case is not a Prohibition case nor a draft-dodging situation — it was an outright premeditated murder,"" said Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and criminal justice professor at Penn State Lehigh Valley. ""My only concern is that Alvin Bragg has lost a number of high profile cases and was just dealt another blow with the dismissal of the terror charge in this case.""

(Mostafa Bassim/Anadolu via Getty Images)

A New York judge found no basis for terror-related charges in the alleged assassination case and threw them out Tuesday — taking first-degree murder and a potential life without parole sentence off the table. Mangione still faces a second-degree murder charge, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, with the potential for parole.

APPARENT LUIGI MANGIONE SUPPORTER CLAIMS SHE'S 'MARRIED' TO HIS 'AI' AT COURTHOUSE RALLY

Many of Mangione's defenders have noted he is considered innocent until proven guilty in the eyes of the law. Jury nullification would be the result of jurors delivering a verdict based on their own ideology rather than the law at trial.

In addition to Mangione's widespread support, she noted that New York also has an ""extreme emotional disturbance"" defense that lawyers can use to gin up sympathy for their client and to attempt to have the severity of charges reduced. As an affirmative defense, Mangione's lawyers would have to convince jurors of such an argument at trial, she said.

LUIGI MANGIONE DEFENSE SHARED SAME RECORDS THEY CLAIMED CONSTITUTED PRIVACY VIOLATION: PROSECUTORS

Even if jury nullification doesn't happen, however, the defense only needs one juror on their side to force a mistrial, according to Linda Kenney Baden, a high-profile defense attorney whose clients have included Aaron Hernandez and Casey Anthony.

""This defense is compatible with trying to find [one or more] jurors who can hang the jury,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""But this is a premeditated murder, so NY will retry him over and over.""

Separately, federal prosecutors are warning that he was inspiring support for other attacks, too.

""Certain quarters of the public — who openly identify as acolytes of the defendant — have increasingly begun to view violence as an acceptable, or even necessary, substitute for reasoned political disagreement,"" federal prosecutors wrote to a New York judge on Aug. 27.

Specifically, they mentioned a mass shooting on Park Avenue.

(Mostafa Bassim/Anadolu via Getty Images)

""On July 28, 2025, Shane Tamura brought an assault rifle to a Manhattan office building, a short distance away from where Mangione had killed Thompson,"" prosecutors wrote. ""Tamura shot and killed four people, including an off-duty police officer, an executive of a financial services firm, and a security guard, and he injured others, including an employee of the National Football League (""NFL""). Like Mangione, Tamura left behind a piece of evidence for investigators to find, blaming the NFL and football for causing chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Almost immediately, members of the public sympathetic to the defendant touted Tamura's actions as a laudable continuation of the defendant's philosophy.""

Fourteen days after prosecutors filed this memo with a federal court in Manhattan, a sniper shot and killed Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk at a speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.

LUIGI MANGIONE'S LAWYERS SLAM ‘VAGUE' ALLEGATIONS, DEMAND FEDS SHOW THEIR HAND IN ‘BAREBONES' CEO MURDER CASE

Like Mangione, the suspect in that case was accused of writing messages on bullets used in the attack. Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old from southern Utah, faces aggravated murder and other charges in connection with the attack.

As of Wednesday afternoon, nearly 35,000 Mangione supporters had donated more than $1.2 million toward his defense in the three criminal proceedings he faces in New York, in Pennsylvania and federally.

The cover photo for the fundraiser is an image of Mangione's arrival in New York City after he was flown from Pennsylvania, where police captured him, to an airport on suburban Long Island. Wearing shackles and an orange jumpsuit, he is flanked by dozens of officers wearing NYPD and FBI gear.

His supporters have subsequently shown up in force outside his Manhattan court hearings as the murder case proceeds, many of them dressed up like Nintendo's Luigi character and carrying signs. One notable sign present Tuesday, when the judge tossed state-level terror charges, read simply, ""Jury Nullification.""

But while the group cheered news of Judge Gregory Carro's decision, their broader hopes could be wishful thinking.

""Jury nullification could always be an issue, especially with how this kid has come to encapsulate so many progressive gripes against corporations and the insurance industry, but I don't think even Manhattan criminal justice has been that completely defanged,"" Paul Mauro, a former NYPD inspector and Fox News contributor, previously told Fox News Digital. ""Yes, this is the venue that got us Alvin Bragg, but this is also the venue in which 12 ordinary New Yorkers acquitted Daniel Penny.""

Following up Wednesday, he said he's still doubtful jury nullification would be a problem.

""[It's] always possible, but I still lean hard against it,"" he said. ""But this is the Mamdani NYC, so anything's possible.""

'Outnumbered' panel reacts to newly released audio of Charlotte, North Carolina, murder suspect Decarlos Brown Jr. speaking with his sister after allegedly killing Iryna Zarutska.

FIRST ON FOX: The House of Representatives is charging ahead with discussions on how to bolster trust in public transit after the deadly stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee in Charlotte, N.C.

A panel of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is holding a closed-door roundtable with federal transit officials, as well as law enforcement and union representatives on Thursday, Fox News Digital has learned.

It's being led by Highways and Transit subcommittee chair Rep. David Rouzer, R-N.C., who represents the state where the stabbing occurred. 

""The recent deadly stabbing of Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte's light rail is a stark reminder safety must be at the center of our national transit conversation,"" Rouzer told Fox News Digital.

Lawmakers said they are hoping to hear directly from officials on strategies to mitigate crime on public transit systems.

While public transportation has already been under the committee's purview, the tragic killing of Iryna Zarutska on a train in Charlotte last month is fueling new urgency for House lawmakers on the panel.

The Thursday roundtable is directly tied to that incident, Fox News Digital is told.

Among the participants expected are Federal Transit Administration leader Marc Molinaro, who is a former House lawmaker, as well as American Public Transportation Association President Paul Skoutelas, Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves, AFL-CIO Transportation Trades Department President Greg Regan and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) CEO Randy Clarke.

A spokesperson for the House Transportation Committee, led by Chair Sam Graves, R-Mo., told Fox News Digital that the roundtable would help inform legislation being crafted by the panel.

""The committee is in the process of developing a broad, comprehensive surface transportation reauthorization bill – sometimes referred to as the ‘highway bill,' but it also includes policy changes and funding authorizations for federal transit programs,"" the spokesperson said. ""This roundtable will inform that bill development process.""

Graves added, ""Trust in transit overall will continue to erode if we don't take action to stop violent crime on public transit.""

Zarutska, 23, was killed on a Charlotte light rail train on Aug. 22 while on her way home from work. 

Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., who allegedly stabbed Zarutska in an unprovoked attack, was charged with first-degree murder this week.

Zarutska had fled Ukraine in August 2022 after Russia launched its invasion of the sovereign country. She was working at a local pizza shop and studying at a community college at the time of her killing.

The case is now the latest example being held up by Republicans of big cities having too lax a justice system in dealing with crime, including on mass transit.

It comes amid broader partisan divisions over the merits of President Donald Trump deploying the National Guard to major cities in order to deal with violent crime.

And while Thursday's roundtable is bipartisan, Democrats have previously accused Republicans of politicizing the 23-year-old's death.

""I think it's outrageous that people are trying to politicize the death of this wonderful young lady. It's outrageous that anyone would politicize that death. What decency do people have at a moment like this, as opposed to trying to find commonsense solutions?"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said earlier this month.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump travels to Chequers for bilateral meetings with Starmer","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3813163/trump-swaps-windsor-castle-chequers-final-leg-uk-state-visit/","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 12:16:32 GMT","

AYLESBURY, England — President Donald Trump ended his stay at Windsor Castle Thursday morning before heading to Chequers for the final leg of his three-day state visit to the United Kingdom.

Before his departure, King Charles III shook hands with Trump and exchanged pleasantries, prompting Trump to turn to the press and say, “He's a great gentleman and a great king,” before he boarded Marine One.

And just a short helicopter flight later, Trump and the rest of the American delegation arrived at the prime minister's country retreat. Trump traveled from the landing zone to the main house in his presidential SUV, waving to the gathered press, but a number of his aides chose to walk the several hundred yards up the driveway from the green, including White House deputy chief of staff for legislative, political, and public affairs James Blair and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Both men attended Wednesday night's state banquet and made their approval known when asked about the meal. 

“It was great,” Blair said with a smile, while Bessent flashed a thumbs-up. “You can't buy a ticket to that.”

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer greeted Trump upon his arrival at the main house, and the welcome party additionally included 11 Royal Air Force aviators and two bagpipers who played as Trump exited his vehicle.

Thursday's bilateral, the so-called hard business following Wednesday's lavish visit to Windsor Castle, will see Trump and Starmer continue negotiations on the finer points of a bilateral trade deal brokered between the United States and the U.K. over the summer, the first trade deal Trump's White House secured after the president announced his “Liberation Day” tariff rates in April.

Still, Trump seems unlikely to secure the relief two of America's biggest tech companies, Apple and Google, have sought in the face of a new regulatory crackdown from 10 Downing.

American and British government officials tell the Washington Examiner that the leaders will discuss two new trans-Atlantic partnerships that will see the U.S. and U.K. expand their collaboration on artificial intelligence and nuclear energy production. 

LAVISH STATE BANQUET CAPS DAY OF MAGNIFICENT CEREMONY FOR TRUMP IN UK

Chequers, a 16th-century manor located roughly 40 miles west of London, has served as the British “Camp David” for more than 100 years. The property maintains an archive of Prime Minister Winston Churchill's personal effects. Trump has repeatedly pointed to Churchill as one of his political heroes, and Starmer will grant Trump a private tour of Chequers's Churchill archives during Thursday's visit.

Government officials say Trump and Starmer plan to attend a reception with business and technology leaders to announce the aforementioned technology and nuclear partnerships, before ending the day by holding a joint press conference.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

All these things can be true at the same time about ABC's pulling Jimmy Kimmel Live!

First, Kimmel is a dishonest hack who used his show to spread self-indulgent partisan dreck. Private companies, as leftists pointed out only a few years ago, have the option of “deplatforming” anyone they please. Kimmel has no God-given right to be on television. Syndicates like Nexstar and Sinclair, with significant conservative audiences, had a fiduciary responsibility to drop a show that offended large swaths of their viewers. The other night, Kimmel didn't merely mock MAGA or criticize Charlie Kirk. He blatantly lied about the ideology of the shooter to his audience. And not only did he intentionally mislead them, but he also blamed the victims. It was an indecent thing to do. Kimmel, who had plenty of time to apologize, will likely fall back on the fact that he is allegedly a comedian. That doesn't hold water anymore.  

Second, Kimmel is proof that, in many respects, the Right is winning the culture war. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr injected himself into the incident by pressuring syndicators, which only undermines the cause. The government isn't here to make programming decisions for the people. If every lie told on broadcast television now constitutes a “hoax,” and thus becomes a regulatory matter, as some conservatives are now arguing, we could see a massive expansion of state involvement. If the administration precipitated the decision, which Carr insinuated on Benny Johnson's podcast, it is a clear attack on free expression. It's reminiscent of former President Joe Biden threatening Facebook to get them to ban vaccine skeptics. Not long ago, Vice President JD Vance noted that the previous administration had “encouraged private companies to silence people. … Under Donald Trump's leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square.” Doubtful. But, at least, don't engage in the same behavior as Democrats.

Third, Carr might gloat over Kimmel being pulled, but it's unlikely the administration played a major role in that decision. Which makes his comments even more harmful. ABC is probably losing tons of money on an antiquated talk show model helmed by an insufferable mediocrity, and so it jumped at the chance to pull the plug when two major syndicators dropped the show. Stephen Colbert was reportedly hemorrhaging about $40 million yearly, and he had higher ratings. It's not far-fetched to imagine that Kimmel, with his $16 million yearly salary, was losing a business proposition. These celebrity gab fests have become prohibitively expensive to produce at this point. Podcasts can be produced for a fraction of the cost and pull bigger audiences. Add to the fact that Colbert and Kimmel transformed their traditional late-night venues into partisan pep rallies wherein half the nation's audience is demeaned and mocked, and the prospects of the ratings improving are low.

Fourth, Trump administration officials have an incessant, destructive need to be the center of attention all the time. We saw this last week when Attorney General Pam Bondi, who's apparently been reading too many “post-liberal” right-wing influencers, promised that the administration was going to prosecute “hate speech” crimes and force private companies to cater to the right-wing consumers. Both these positions threatened to undermine long-standing policy battles fought by conservatives over speech and free association. Then there is FBI Director Kash Patel, who felt the need to preen on social media about the manhunt of Kirk's assassin with blow-by-blow updates rather than ensuring he had the right person in custody. They're not helping.

THE MARTYRDOM OF KAMALA HARRIS

Fifth, Democrats have zero credibility on free speech grounds. They have spent years championing the deplatforming, demonetizing, and chilling of speech. No Hollywood celebrity spoke up when Roseanne was canceled. No celebrity ever speaks up for any conservative. The Biden administration did much of its censorship behind the scenes. But I can't recall a single elected Democrat complaining about that, either. The Left, indeed, seems more upset about Kimmel than the assassination of Kirk. 

The threat, though, is that soon no one will have any credibility on free speech.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump said Wednesday night that he is designating antifa as a “major terrorist organization.”“I am pleased to inform our many U.S.A. Patriots that I am designating ANTIFA, A SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER, AS A MAJOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. I will also be strongly recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practice,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Antifa is classified as a movement, not a specific group, so it's unclear how Trump will carry out his order.

Trump previously declared antifa a terrorist organization during his first term as president in May 2020 and said earlier this week that he was open to doing it again after conservative activist Charlie Kirk‘s assassination.

“It's something I would do, yeah,” Trump told reporters on Monday at the White House in response to a question. “Also, I've been speaking to the attorney general about bringing RICO against some of the people … that have been putting up millions and millions of dollars for agitation.”

Designating antifa as a terrorist organization could allow Trump to freeze the assets of connected groups or cut off funding sources.

The president suggested his administration would target “radical-left” groups after Kirk's assassination last week.

“My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country,” he said, going on to reference the assassination attempts against himself and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) and the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Alleged Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson wrote the song title “Bella Ciao” on an unfired bullet casing. The song was popularized as an anti-fascist anthem in Italy following World War II.

It's unclear if Robinson was a member of the antifa movement.

An immigration judge has ordered Mahmoud Khalil to be deported to Algeria or Syria, according to court documents filed Wednesday.

Immigration Judge Jamee Comans accused the pro-Palestinian activist of omitting information from his green card application.

She said the court found a “lack of candor on his I-485 form was not an oversight by an uninformed, uneducated applicant.”

“Rather, this Court finds that Respondent willfully misrepresented material fact(s) for the sole purpose of circumventing the immigration process and reducing the likelihood his applications could be denied. This Court cannot and will not condone such an action by granting a discretionary waiver,” Comans said.

Comans, based in Louisiana, denied Khalil's motion for a waiver preventing his removal from the country.

The former Columbia graduate student was born in Syria but fled during the country's revolution in 2013. He was detained by immigration enforcement in March but released in June after a long and publicized detention.

He said the administration is retaliating against him for his use of free speech.

“It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” Khalil said in a statement.

“When their first effort to deport me was set to fail, they resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide,” he continued. “Such fascist tactics will never deter me from continuing to advocate for my people's liberation.”

His attorneys said they have 30 days to appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

ABC News Chief National Correspondent Matt Gutman has issued a formal apology after facing intense backlash for describing text messages from Tyler Robinson, the alleged assassin of conservative figure Charlie Kirk, as “very touching” during a live broadcast.

The remarks came after a Utah County press conference revealed shocking details about Robinson's alleged murder plot and his text exchanges with his transgender partner, Lance Twiggs, following the Sept. 10 shooting at Utah Valley University.

Gutman attempted to highlight what he described as a “duality” in the case, the contrast between the brutality of the killing and the personal, emotional language in the messages between Robinson and Twiggs.

DISGUSTING: ABC's Matt Gutman says he's not sure “if we have seen an alleged murder with such specific text messages” that were “very touching, in a way, that I think many of us didn't expect — a very intimate portrait into this relationship between the suspect's roommate and the… pic.twitter.com/ulPcxoOwM3

“A very intimate portrait into this relationship between the suspect's roommate and the suspect himself,” Gutman said during the segment. “It was very touching in a way that I think many of us didn't expect.”

But the comment struck a nerve with many, who accused Gutman of romanticizing or sympathizing with the alleged killer.

In response to the controversy, Gutman took to X, formerly Twitter, to explain his intent. 

1. Yesterday I tried to underscore the jarring contrast between this cold blooded assassination of Charlie Kirk – a man who dedicated his life to public dialogue – and the personal, disturbing texts read aloud by the Utah County Attorney at the press conference.

Gutman said he had hoped to underscore the “jarring contrast” between what he described as a “cold-blooded assassination” and the “personal, disturbing” messages that were read aloud at the press conference. He referred to Kirk as “a man who dedicated his life to public dialogue,” and admitted that his commentary failed to make that contrast clear.

He went on to express regret, saying he “deeply” wished he had chosen his words more carefully. Gutman also made clear that there should be “zero doubt” about where he stands on the crime, writing that he “unequivocally condemns” the assassination and the suffering it caused — not only to Charlie Kirk's family and those present at the event, but also to “the millions of people he inspired.”

Despite the apology, critics remained unconvinced.

“ABC and Matt Gutman have really reached a NEW LOW,” one user said. “Gutman found the murderer's texts to his lover, sent immediately after shooting a husband and father in the neck, oh so ‘touching.'”

“Just… what? What are you doing, man?” OutKick commentator Mary Katharine Ham posted.

“He really needs to be fired,” another user added. “Read the room. Or better yet, just report the facts. It's called journalism.”

Others responded with biting sarcasm.

“Ah yes, a modern-day Romeo and Julius,” one user said.

The Utah County Attorney's Office released transcripts of messages between Robinson and Twiggs that prosecutors say were sent just hours after Kirk was fatally shot.

In one message, Robinson told Twiggs: “Drop what you are doing, look under my keyboard.”

There, Twiggs reportedly found a handwritten note from Robinson stating: “I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it.”

When Twiggs asked if the message was real, Robinson replied: “I am still ok, my love, but am stuck in Orem for a little while longer yet. Shouldn't be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still. To be honest, I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you.”

POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN THE US: A TIMELINE OF KEY INCIDENTS

Finally, when Twiggs directly asked whether Robinson was the shooter, Robinson responded: “I am. I'm sorry.”

Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, obstruction of justice, and several additional offenses. Authorities say the act was premeditated and carried out in front of a crowd that included children, a factor that could carry serious sentencing implications.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A Spirit Airlines pilot received a stern reprimand from an air traffic controller Tuesday morning after the commercial flight came within several miles of Air Force One, which was transporting President Donald Trump over New York en route to the United Kingdom.

According to live air traffic control audio shared on LiveATC.net, Spirit Flight 1300, traveling from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Boston, was instructed multiple times to alter its course after drifting within 8 miles of the president's aircraft.

“Pay attention, Spirit 1300. Turn 20 degrees right,” the air traffic controller is heard saying.

“Spirit 1300, turn 20 degrees right now.”

“Spirit Wings 1300, turn 20 degrees right immediately.”

🚨 WOW! Air Traffic Control had to SCREAM at a Spirit Airlines flight who was getting too close to Air Force One“Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right IMMEDIATELY! … Pay attention! Get off the iPad!”You couldn't PAY me to fly on Spirit at this point. pic.twitter.com/BUA8d7yWSY

As the Spirit flight hovered at 33,000 feet above Long Island and edged closer to Air Force One, the controller's tone grew increasingly exasperated.

“Spirit 1300, traffic's off your left wing by eight miles — 747. I'm sure you can see who it is. He's white and blue,” the controller snapped, adding, “Pay attention… Get off the iPad.”

The remark was striking in its directness and suggested the pilot may have been inattentive at a critical moment. While commercial pilots are allowed to use iPads and electronic tablets in the cockpit to access navigation charts and checklists, the tone of the exchange sparked questions about situational awareness in a restricted airspace.

Despite the tension in the exchange, aviation authorities confirmed that proper separation was maintained throughout the incident. Data from flight-tracking service Flightradar24 showed that the Spirit plane came no closer than eight miles laterally to Air Force One, which remained at 32,000 feet — just 1,000 feet below Spirit Flight 1300.

In a statement to Fox News, a Spirit Airlines spokesperson reportedly confirmed the aircraft “followed procedures and air traffic control instructions” and “landed uneventfully” in Boston.

“Safety is always our top priority,” the airline said.

The Federal Aviation Administration released a statement acknowledging the incident and confirming it is reviewing the interaction.

“The FAA is aware of social media posts about Air Force One and a Spirit Airlines flight in Boston airspace on Tuesday,” the agency said. “Required separation was maintained between the aircraft.”

Trump was reportedly en route to London for a two-day state visit hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla.

“Woke”-teacher screenings. Trying to get Bibles in schools. A two-part series on how one state is remaking American education.

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

Testing the line between church and school is a recurring American theme. In Pennsylvania in 2004, a school board tried to introduce teaching “intelligent design” as an alternative to evolution. In 2002 in Georgia, a board tried to add a disclaimer to textbooks saying that evolution was “a theory, not a fact.”

And 2025 is, after all, the 100th anniversary of the Scopes “monkey trial,” when Tennessee put a public-school teacher on trial for teaching evolution.

But what's been happening to American public schools lately is different: more coordinated, more creative, and blanketing the nation. Pressure on what kids learn and read is coming from national parents' movements, the White House, the Supreme Court. “There used to be an idea that you could live in a blue state or a red state and sort of encounter the school system a little differently. That maybe if you opposed school-choice programs, especially private-school-choice programs, that you were a little bit immune from this issue if you lived in, say, New York,” says Cara Fitzpatrick, author of The Death of Public School: How Conservatives Won the War Over Education in America. Now there's “this pressure coming from the Trump administration to say we're actually going to get very deeply involved in questions around curriculum and options for children.”

We have paid close attention to how conservatives are systematically trying to overhaul the culture at universities. A similar enterprise is unfolding at public schools. In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we visit Oklahoma, where the official in charge of public schools has pushed the line further than most. State superintendent Ryan Walters recently announced an ideology test for new teachers moving to Oklahoma from “places like California and New York.” He's tried to overhaul the curriculum, adding dozens of references to Christianity and the Bible and making students “identify discrepancies in 2020 elections results.” A group of parents, students, and religious leaders has sued. And just this week, the Oklahoma Supreme Court issued a temporary stay, pausing the standards while it considers the lawsuit.

Walters may eventually lose in court on some of the details. But he's already succeeded in helping create a new template for what public schools can be. For decades, they've been a proving ground for democracy, where people from a community with different views learn to tolerate one another. Walters and a larger conservative movement seem to be trying to redefine public schools as only for an approved type: “If you're going to come into our state,” he said, “don't come in with these blue-state values.”

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: I remember my first day in an American public school. I had just moved here from Israel. I was nervous about what was in my lunch box: pita with things stuffed inside it. But when I sat down at the lunch table, the whole place was like an international food hall: dal, dumplings, jerk chicken—you get the idea. This was P.S. 117 in Queens, one of the most diverse places on the planet.

The term of art back then to describe our situation—families of every race, configuration, and religion sitting down to eat together—was “melting pot,” which makes it sound like a smooth, warm bisque.

It was not. We were mean to each other, made fun of each other's holidays, regularly sniffed each other's lunches and said, “Ew, gross.” Fights broke out nearly every day on the playground.

But every morning, we all showed up and said the Pledge of Allegiance together.

[Music]

Rosin: I didn't think about it at all this way when I was a kid, but on top of the English and math and social studies, we were absorbing another lesson that would serve us throughout our life. It was a lesson on messy democracy: how to be around people who ate and thought and believed different things than we did and that our parents did, hate them on some days, and still wake up the next morning and go to school.

To be honest, I wish I had thought about all this sooner. I wish we all had. Because this role that public schools have played—a training ground on how to live with your fellow citizens who aren't like you—might be disappearing.

I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. This episode, we have something different.

Ryan Walters (from Oklahoma State Department of Education video): We're excited to announce a new office here in the Oklahoma State Department of Education. It will be the Office of Religious Liberty and Patriotism.

Rosin: We took a field trip to Oklahoma, where this war on public schools is probably at its most overt.

Walters: For too long in this country, we've seen the radical left attack individuals' religious liberty in our schools. We will not tolerate that in Oklahoma.

Rosin: This is from a video that State Superintendent Ryan Walters of Oklahoma sent out to school administrators across the state. He told them to play it for every student in class and send it to every parent.

Inviting students to pray along with him in school is just one provocative move he's made.

Walters: I will now say a prayer—and to be clear, students, you don't have to join, but if you so wish, I'm gonna go ahead and pray.

Rosin: But not every move he makes comes as an invitation. As the state superintendent, Walters has the power to enact policies and influence curriculum.

Of course, he's not the first American elected official to try and get religion into public schools—2025, after all, is the 100th anniversary of the Scopes “monkey trial,” when Tennessee put a public-school teacher on trial for teaching evolution.

[Music]

Rosin: But what's been happening lately is different. Pressure on what kids learn and read is coming from all angles: national parents' movements, the White House, the Supreme Court. It's coordinated, it's more creative, and this war on schools is spreading nationally.

Walters: I pray for our parents, teachers, and kids, that they get the best education possible and live high-quality lives.

Rosin: War, by the way, is not my lazy metaphor. In the foreground of the Ryan Walters video, on his desk, is a mug. It says Si vis pacem, para bellum, which is Latin for “If you want peace, prepare for war.”

Walters: —what makes America great and that they continue to love this country. Amen.

Rosin: Before Ryan Walters was elected, when he was still a candidate, he singled out a specific teacher who seemed to embody for him what he thought was wrong with the public schools.

Her name was Summer Boismier. It was August of 2022, and over at Norman High School, south of Oklahoma City, she was getting her classroom ready. The school year hadn't officially started, but things were already off.

Boismier recalls that she and the other teachers were called into a meeting and reminded about H.B. 1775, a new bill known as the critical-race-theory ban. That bill forbids teaching things like, quote, “an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously.” But that's about as specific as it gets.

Boismier says they were told to restrict students' access to any classroom books that could fall under the bill. But restrict how? And which books, exactly?

Summer Boismier: I  remember going back to my classroom after this meeting had occurred, and I have never been more grateful for the office chair that I had.

Rosin: (Laughs.) Why?

Boismier: Because it spun beautifully. And I sat there for—I would imagine it was upwards of half an hour, just spinning. And I thought to myself, What am I going to do?

Rosin: Boismier herself had been a student in Oklahoma public schools, K–12. After she graduated with a B.A. in English from the University of Oklahoma, teaching seemed like the practical career choice—except for one thing.

Boismier:  I remember thinking, I am wildly introverted, and I'm also very awkward. (Laughs.) And I'm sure you'll find out from this conversation. But: How am I going to make connections with young people in my classes if I'm having trouble making connections myself?

Rosin: As a kid in school, Boismier was a voracious reader. She loved YA and science fiction. So as a teacher, she wanted to use her love of reading as a way to reach her students.

Over her nine years of teaching, Boismier amassed a huge library for her own personal classroom: 500 books, which the kids could read in class or check out. Most of the books she paid for herself.

And as she spun in her office chair that day, she considered what she should do: Should she remove all those books from her class, turn their spines facing inwards so students couldn't see the titles, or maybe just cover over the bookshelves with butcher paper?

She chose C.

Rosin:  Wait, you literally covered it over? That's what people—that's the weirdest solution 'cause I would think that the teenagers, knowing teenagers, would just be real curious, you know?

Boismier: Well, I mean, that was one of the options that was presented to me, and I had butcher paper in my room, and so why the heck not? But I remember, too—again, I'm a teacher, as well, and so I love me a good text feature—and so I added the caption Books the state doesn't want you to read.

Rosin: Just wrote it—in black marker, biggish but not too big, and neat enough to read—right on the red butcher paper that covered the bookshelves.

Boismier:  But I remember going home, thinking about my classroom library and what message that sends to students when they walk in. And I thought to myself, It's not enough, because this is a dumb law, and it's meant to force self-censorship. It's meant to scare people.

Rosin: The problem for teachers? There is no official list of banned books. But lots of books have been challenged in Oklahoma. For example, in 2022, a state attorney general reviewed a list of about 50 books that included Lord of the Flies, Of Mice and Men, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings—books that American kids have been reading for decades. He pretty quickly dropped the investigation, saying he would leave it up to parents and local school boards. But that left a problem: How could you possibly know for sure what was and wasn't okay?

Boismier was upset. She cried for a good hour or two about it. And, in the end, she took the provocative route and added to her display.

Boismier:  I created a QR code. I linked it to the library.

Rosin: When you scanned the QR code, it took you to a Brooklyn Public Library program called Books Unbanned, which offers free library cards to teens who may live in places where books are challenged or banned.

Boismier: And  I printed the QR code and slapped it up around the room on those same shelves that bore the caption Books the state doesn't want you to read.

Rosin: Summer, I gotta say, you've described yourself as shy and awkward—this is a bold-ass plan. This is a plan that you—I don't know if you were this certain in the moment, like, in the day, or if this certainty is kind of two years down the road, but I'm just noting that, and I'm curious about that.

Boismier: I remember thinking to myself—and again, I have grown up in Oklahoma, I know Oklahoma education, and I knew what this could cost me.

TV anchor (from KOKH Fox 25): Welcome to the Fox 25 debate between Secretary of Education Ryan Walters and former Teacher of the Year Jena Nelson, your Republican and Democratic nominees for state superintendent.

Good evening—

Rosin: Around the same time, Ryan Walters, then 37, was running for office. He was already secretary of education—he'd been appointed to that position by the governor—and he supported the critical-race-theory ban. But that position is largely symbolic. In Oklahoma, it's the state superintendent who has the real power to change the schools.

Walters was running against a woman named Jena Nelson, who generally talked about school stuff: career readiness, teacher retention, child and food insecurity. Oklahoma public schools have consistently ranked near the bottom for reading and math scores on the Nation's Report Card. In a recent national survey, the state came in 48th in education overall. But Walters, in a debate with Nelson, he talked a lot about war.

Walters (from KOKH Fox 25): What we are seeing right now in the state of Oklahoma is a civil war that's being fought in our schools.

Rosin: And there was one topic in particular that he kept coming back to.

Walters: Pornography. Pornography should not be in our schools. No parent should send their child to school and their child have access to graphic pornography. I mention—

Rosin: What Walters is referring to are a couple of books that conservatives often bring up in these kinds of debates.

Walters: Well,  I'm gonna tell you what a radical position is. Her position that pornography, Gender Queer and Flamer, these books should be in every public school library and should be in our classrooms, that's a radical position. What parents want—

Rosin: Okay, Gender Queer includes pages with a picture of a vibrator and two guys naked, making out. It's meant for a 16-plus audience, so it seems legitimate to question whether it should be on a bookshelf easily accessible to kids younger than that. But it seems less legitimate to pretend that the book is definitely on bookshelves all over your state.

Walters (from Fox News): I began hearing from parents all over the state going, Hey, when we send our kids to school, we are not expecting them to be able to check out a book from the library that's got explicit pornography in it. And unfortunately, this is a tactic we've seen of the far left. They are pushing—

Rosin: So it was while Walters was out on the campaign trail talking about these so-called pornographic books that Boismier put up the QR code. And on the first day of school, a parent complained. The parent told a local news station that she had scanned the QR code and saw a reading event for Gender Queer from the Brooklyn Public Library.

Boismier was called into a meeting at the district office. She wasn't fired, but later that day, she chose to resign.

[Music]

Rosin: And that was that: Boismier was no longer teaching in Oklahoma public schools.

Because of the news, she'd caught the attention of the Brooklyn Public Library, and she was deciding what to do next with her life—like, maybe she would leave the state, try living in a big city. And one day, she got on a Twitter Live—remember those?

Boismier: I  was actually in one of those with some folks from Brooklyn Public Library, talking about the library's initiative and the benefits therein, when I started to, kind of suddenly, as we were in the middle of this conversation, get all kinds of text messages and calls. And no one ever calls me, except my mom.

Rosin: Mm-hmm.

Boismier: But suddenly, I have reporters from all over the OKC area who are texting me saying, Have you seen the letter?

TV reporter (from KOCO 5 News): This tweet Secretary Ryan Walters posted this morning saying, quote, “Sexualizing our classrooms will not be tolerated.” Now he asks—

Rosin: On August 31, 2022, Walters, who was still campaigning for state superintendent, tweeted a statement about Boismier. It read, quote, “In light of recent events involving Norman High School English Teacher Summer Boismier, I am asking the Oklahoma State Board of Education to revoke her teaching certificate immediately.”

Rosin: As you're scanning the letter, were there any words that jumped out at you—his letter?

Boismier:  I think what stands out to me, and I think what hit me the most—not only just because it is patently false, but because of the implications—the word pornographic.

Rosin: The statement from Walters continued: “There is no place for a teacher with a liberal political agenda in the classroom. Ms. Boismier's providing access to banned and pornographic material to students is unacceptable and we must ensure she doesn't go to another district and do the same thing.”

Boismier said she started to get threatening messages. One message called her a “pedophile.” Another listed her apartment number. At one point, she even called the police.

Boismier:  I mean, what we're talking about here—this isn't a job; this is a career. And I am one person in a small state in the middle of the country, and there are accusations featuring the word pornographic on state letterhead with my name in the same paragraph. That is something that, regardless of what happens with any of this, that is something that doesn't go away.

[Music]

TV anchor (from KJRH 2 News): The current Oklahoma secretary of education, Ryan Walters, with 57 percent of the vote. Again, the projected winner here over Jena Nelson, a longtime teacher—

Rosin: Walters easily won the seat in November 2022. For a guy who was pretty new to politics, occupying a meat-and-potatoes-type position, he was remarkably good at building a national brand.

Basically, as I see it, he borrowed some influencer tips on growing your audience: Start beefs, often and loudly. Make friends with people who have way more followers than you do. For example, several months into office, Walters shared a video from the Libs of TikTok account. I know you should never try and explain a TikTok, but it featured a Tulsa librarian lip-synching to Ludacris and seemingly admitting to pushing a “woke agenda.” She was probably kidding, but Walters apparently did not read it that way.

For about a week, the librarian and the school received bomb threats. Walters publicly said he actually got bomb threats too. The whole thing was an early hint of how noisy Walters planned to be. Oklahoma state Democrats called for an impeachment probe, and Walters leaned in harder.

He named the Libs of TikTok account founder, Chaya Raichik—who, by the way, is known for using the term groomer, as in gay people infiltrate schools to groom children—to an Oklahoma state library advisory committee.

Chaya Raichik (from video played at Oklahoma state school-board meeting): We're going to remove porn from the schools, and you can't stop us.

Rosin: Walters also took a no-mercy approach towards the teachers' unions.

Walters (from an Oklahoma House of Representatives video): The teachers' union—I don't negotiate with the teachers' union. They're a terrorist organization that has continued—

(Crowd noise.)

Man: Members. Members.

Rosin: Another time Walters got a lot of attention was when he said teachers could cover the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, where white Tulsans slaughtered hundreds of Black people, but they should not, quote, “say that the skin color determined it.”

Walters accused the media of twisting his words. He said the events that day were, quote, “racist, evil,” and “inexcusable.” He also said that “kids should never be made to feel bad or told they are inferior based on the color of their skin.”

The Onion weighed in with this headline, quote, “Oklahoma Schools to Teach Students That Tulsa Massacre Was Crime of Passion From Loving Black People Too Much.”

[Music]

Rosin: In the early 2000s, I covered the religious right as a reporter for The Washington Post. Back then, the religious homeschooling movement was booming. I wrote a book about it. Their motivating idea was that they had lost the culture war and needed a kind of “quarantine,” as conservative activist Paul Weyrich put it, to protect their children from infection by a culture hostile to Christianity. And so religious families had to create a parallel and protected zone of education for their kids.

Now many of those same religious families are joining forces with Trump. Instead of avoiding public schools, some religious parents are pushing to remake them in their own image. And Trump is on board, vowing to end what he calls, quote, “radical indoctrination” in K–12 schools, threatening to pull funds from schools that teach about gender identity. And he's made it a priority to expand school choice nationwide—which, in many places, is the catchphrase for “creative ways to shift funds from public schools to private and religious schools.”

Jonathan Hunt (from Fox News): Let's bring in Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters, always an interesting voice on matters education-wise. Ryan—

Rosin: A generation ago, someone like Walters would be a fringe state official pushing religion in schools. But now he's at the center of the action.

In June of last year, he directed all Oklahoma public schools to teach the Bible. And in an appearance on Fox News, Walters talked about displaying the Ten Commandments.

Walters (from Fox News): What we've seen in America are the Democrats, the teachers' unions have driven God out of schools, and Americans, Oklahomans, President Trump want God back in the classroom. The reality—

Rosin: That one got Trump's attention. He posted on Truth Social, quote, “Great job by Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters on FoxNews [sic] last night. Strong, decisive, and knows his ‘stuff.'” And then in all caps: “I LOVE OKLAHOMA!”

Speaking of Trump, Walters wanted to spend millions of dollars in state money to purchase 55,000 Bibles. And the Oklahoma Department of Education put out a bids request that specified the Bibles must be the King James Version and must include a copy of the Pledge of Allegiance, Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and “must be bound in leather or leather-like material.”

One of the only Bibles that meets that criteria is the “God Bless the USA Bible,” endorsed by Lee Greenwood and President Trump. It sells for $59.99.

[“God Bless the U.S.A.,” by Lee Greenwood]

Rosin: The Education Department later changed some of those requirements and denied that they were meant to cater to one particular Bible. And the Oklahoma Supreme Court has paused the Bible plan for now.

[Music]

Rosin: But Walters still was not deterred. And what anyone who tracks public education could see is that if there was ever a time to push the limits, it's now.

Jake Tapper (from CNN): The court sided with a group of religious Maryland parents who want the option to keep their elementary-age children out of lessons involving books with LGBTQ content.

Donald Trump (from ABC 7 News – WJLA): I think the ruling was a great ruling, and I think it's a great ruling for parents. It's really a ruling for parents. They lost control of the schools. They lost control of their child.

TV anchor (from KOAA News5): The U.S. Supreme Court, they're gonna hear oral arguments today in a case over the nation's first publicly funded religious charter school in Oklahoma. At the heart of the case is whether public funds should be allowed to support a religious entity. So let's go live—

Rosin: That Oklahoma case, which proposed using taxpayer funds to operate a religious school, is especially significant. The court was split 4–4, and it likely only failed because Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself.

It's a case one education expert told us would have been unimaginable a few years ago. But right now, public schools are shaky for lots of reasons. Parents have been moving kids to charter or private schools. In the last few years, two-thirds of traditional public schools have lost enrollment. School systems in Florida, New Jersey, Tennessee, and dozens of other states have had to hire consultants to encourage parents to enroll their children in local schools.

And in the public schools that do remain, teachers have to be extra careful, lest they trigger a viral parents' rights moment.

[Music]

Rosin: All the moves that Ryan Walters was pulling—the prayer in schools, the Bibles, the civil war, and pornography in the classroom—it struck some people as odd. Because a lot of people knew Walters as someone different: a public-school teacher who taught AP history, who'd been a finalist for Oklahoma Teacher of the Year, whose students loved him.

Starla Edge: I thought he was a closeted Democrat. Raised to be Republican, but I thought he was kind of coming out of it, you know what I mean? The people who are so close. You're so close to getting the big picture here. I thought that was him.

Rosin: That's after the break.

[Break]

 Rosin: What is the first memory either of you have of—what did you call him in school, Mr. Walters?

Edge and Shane Hood: (Speaking simultaneously.) Coach Walters.

Rosin: Coach Walters, great. Okay, what's your—

Edge: I wasn't in sports, but he was still Coach Walters.

Hood: It is pretty common in McAlester school—if they coach a sport, that's what they're called.

Rosin: This is Shane Hood and Starla Edge, both 23. We're meeting with them in Starla's living room in Oklahoma City, where her cats are hiding, but the many stuffed animals are in full view.

Like Ryan Walters, Shane and Starla grew up in McAlester, Oklahoma, a place that Starla describes as the biggest city in the middle of nowhere.

Edge: I'd say up until kind of recently. We just got a new Starbucks. We're getting a Five Below and a T.J. Maxx, and that's all brand new.

Hood: Very rarely do people who are born and raised in McAlester actually stay there—if they can help it.

Rosin: Shane and Starla have known each other since middle school, but they were not friends back then. Starla came out as queer. She was head of the Gay-Straight Alliance, or GSA, her junior year. Shane, meanwhile, signed a petition to end it.

Hood: It's not prohibited to be open-minded, but it's very, very much frowned upon. And so if you did hear me talk about the queer community, LGBTQ—which, at one point in time, I just called them the “alphabet soup” and refused to learn the letters—it was almost never positive.

Rosin: Mm-hmm.

Hood: It was hateful, and I'm sorry about it.

Rosin: But even back then, Shane and Starla did share one thing in common: Coach Walters was one of their favorite teachers.

Rosin: How would you compare him to other teachers in the school? How would you place him in the teacher hierarchy?

Edge: He had an aura about him, that's for sure. So he wears tight suits. He also wore the shoes, you know, just dress shoes.

Hood: Very distinct.

Edge: Yes.

Hood: It was a very distinct sound. You could hear it about—it started about 90 feet away, but it was clear. And here's—

Rosin: Wait, what's the sound? It's like click—how—

Hood: You ever hear a heel hit a hardwood floor?

Edge: It sounds like high heels. It really did.

Hood: Yeah, it sounds like high heels. And we actually referred to him as “High Heels” 'cause it was hilarious.

Rosin: Did he know that people called him “High Heels”?

Edge: Yeah. Oh, yeah. So that's another reason why he became one of my favorites before I even had him as a teacher. He would do little roasts on Twitter. Like, you know how—it was at the time of, like, when Jimmy Kimmel was doing the reading-mean-tweets thing. And he would do that about himself.

Walters (from YouTube): —about me, so I'm gonna go onto my Twitter account right now and read some of them and see what my really nice students have said about me on Twitter.

Rosin: This is from a video that one of the students recorded of the roast.

Walters: “Coach Walters, your pants are so tight, they ripped at the basketball game.” “Coach Walters, is your beard a pumpkin Halloween festival? Because it's patchy.” (Laughs.)

(Students laugh.)

Walters: That's pretty good. That's pretty good.

Hood: We had an in-person roast. I remember staying up all night, writing about 20 jokes. And then she wrote a parody of a Taylor Swift song and sang it.

Edge: Ian wrote the lyrics. I performed it—

Hood: Oh, yeah.

Edge: —and did the chords—figured out the chords and everything.

Hood: “Teardrops on My Scantron” was the name of that parody.

Edge: Yeah.

[Excerpt from a video recording of “Teardrops on My Scantron”]

Edge: “He says we seem depressed; he's finally got it right / I wonder if he knows the quizzes that keep me up at night / I sign up for your class every year, don't know why I do.”

Rosin:  I mean, there's a lot of love that goes into that specific a roast, you know? (Laughs.)

Hood: It was. There was legitimate admiration between whoever took his class and him. Nobody I ever knew personally had a problem with him, which was weird because everybody had something, at least one thing bad to say about every other teacher in that high school. He was the only one that we saw was universally loved.

[Excerpt from a video recording of “Teardrops on My Scantron”]

Rosin: Starla picked Walters as her homeroom teacher because he let her leave to get coffee as long as she brought one back for him. Starla says her girlfriend was in the same class, and they sometimes walked in holding hands. She said she and Walters would sometimes have coffee together and talk—about school things and life things.

Around that time, Walters was named a finalist for Oklahoma Teacher of the Year. Starla and Shane remember he taught world religions and kept a Torah and a Quran in his classroom and that he skimmed through Christianity because this is the Bible Belt, they recall him saying.

Edge:  And that's what he said. He was like, You guys know about this. If you wanna know more, go to fricking church. I'm pretty sure he said that.

Hood: We had the history of Judea covered from his lectures. But after that, getting down to the principal beliefs of Christianity? It was not necessary to discuss that with students at McAlester High School in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma.

Rosin:  Do you recall him ever using the phrase American exceptionalism? Do you recall him ever using the phrase or talking about the idea of American exceptionalism?

Edge: I don't know what that means.

Rosin: Okay.

Hood: American exceptionalism is a school of thought that—and it's a mechanism that they've used in schools forever. But the best way I can describe it is that America is exceptional in everything it has ever done ever, so—

Rosin: Was chosen by God.

Hood: Was chosen by God. So—

Edge: No, because he would show us things that would prove that America was not this all-great country.

Hood: We had weeks-long discussions on Reconstruction and how it went awful. It was: Here's what you've been told. Here's what actually happened.

Rosin: Really?

Hood: Pretty much. The first full-length discussion about Reconstruction and its failures, we had in the Walters classroom.

Edge: His whole thing about wokeism, I truly don't understand, because he was woke. He was woke! (Laughs.) He was a woke teacher.

Hood: No other teacher would've taught us about Emmett Till. That would've never have happened. Basically, if you took a class like that about Jim Crow–era South, it was almost certainly like: Here are the Black Codes. Here's how they overcame them. And we've had racial equality ever since the Civil Rights Acts. Basically, you get a summary like that.

In Ryan Walters's class, we actually get to see pictures of a open-casket Emmett Till funeral. Here's what happened in between them. So you never got a discussion like that. I don't remember the specifics, but I remember learning about Emmett Till, specifically in his classroom. And we would talk about the psychological horrors of segregation. I learned about the baby-doll experiments from him, where, basically, it found that Black children would wanna buy white dolls because they were “better.” You didn't get that discussion anywhere else.

Edge: I don't know if he has ever explicitly said this but how there is a thing where people think you go off to college and it brainwashes you and makes you liberal and everything. I would say that Ryan Walters's class was the closest thing I ever had to something like that in high school. (Laughs.)

Hood: Yeah. It would've made you more moderate, at the very least, to sit through one of his lectures.

[Music]

Rosin: Walters had gone part time and then fully left McAlester High School during Shane and Starla's senior year. Starla says she mailed him a graduation announcement, but it was returned to sender.

Soon after they graduated, Walters's political career was in full swing. He was still in a suit, still in those clickety-clack dress shoes. For what it's worth, Walters has said he's the same guy who taught them history—he hasn't changed. But to them, he was unrecognizable. Shane compared it to how you'd feel about your dad if he remarried a woman you didn't like.

[Music]

Rosin: English teacher Summer Boismier did not stick around to see Walters's overhaul of the public schools. She had taken what was the monumental personal step of moving away from Oklahoma, away from her mom and her sisters, and all the way to her own apartment in Brooklyn.

She was working with the Brooklyn Public Library in 2023 when a hearing officer in Oklahoma concluded that she had, in fact, not violated H.B. 1775, the critical-race-theory ban. The hearing officer recommended that Boismier's teaching certificate not be revoked, which would mean that she could one day, if she wanted, go back to teaching.

Walters (from video played at Oklahoma state school-board meeting): I think we've got a quorum here, so if we can go ahead and I'll call us to order. If you can do a roll call—

Rosin: But Walters and the Oklahoma state board ignored those recommendations and instead put it up to a vote.

Walters: This is possible action on the findings of fact and conclusions on the case of Summer Boismier.

Rosin: Boismier watched the proceedings from her laptop in New York.

Boismier:  I remember I was sitting on the floor of my Brooklyn studio apartment, kind of watching the state school-board meeting unfold.

Woman 1: I make a motion to authorize the chair of the board to sign off on the proposed order for Summer Boismier.

Woman 2: I'll second that.

Boismier: My name was finally on the agenda, after years of stops and starts and things of that nature, and I remember that a vote was taken.

Walters: So we have a motion and a second. Do we have any further discussion?

Boismier: There was practically no discussion. It was: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Walters: Ms. Terrie, can you call roll for us?

Terrie Cheadle: Mr. Burdick?

Donald Burdick: Aye.

Cheadle: Ms. Lepak?

Sarah Lepak: Aye.

Cheadle: Ms. Quebedeaux?

Katie Quebedeaux: Aye.

Cheadle: Ms. Wesson?

Kendra Wesson: Aye.

Cheadle: Mr. Archer?

Zachary Archer: Yes.

Cheadle: Superintendent Walters?

Walters: Yes. Motion passes. Let's take a look there at Item G.

Rosin: In August of 2024, two years after Boismier resigned from her teaching position at Norman High School, the board voted unanimously to revoke her license.

A year after that, she was back in Oklahoma, back at her mom's house, talking to us about that moment.

Rosin:  So once it all sunk in, then how did you feel?

Boismier: There's a part of me that feels and that felt and still does feel very angry. It feels inherently unjust, and there's a part of me that feels incredibly sad and infuriated for my students. But I can also say that there was a sense of pride, in a way. My teaching certificate being unanimously revoked by that state board of education in Oklahoma—if I could put that at the top of my résumé, I would. It will always be a point of pride for me that that board chose to revoke my certificate.

Rosin: Why did you go back to Oklahoma?

Boismier: I went back to Oklahoma because, in all honesty, I was experiencing some very severe health issues. And it had been a very kind of fast—and what people need to understand is it was, in the blink of an eye, really, everything was different for me. And it was so much change, and it was so quick. And so much of it, I really had to handle on my own, but I did not do the best job of that. And it got to a point where I really needed to be—I could not care for myself, and I needed to be with people who could.

And so that is something that I am still struggling with because I am, full disclosure, I'm not back here in Oklahoma of my own accord. I'm back here because I didn't—because I want to live, and this is the way I ensure that happens.

[Music]

Rosin: In Oklahoma, Boismier had family who could support her and keep her safe.

Rosin: Okay, Summer, I understand. I mean, it sounds like intellectually, in terms of your convictions, you didn't really regret anything you did. You did it very quickly. You weren't that ambivalent about it. But the cost was huge.

Boismier: Yes.

[Music]

Rosin: This school year, students started off with Ryan Walters's fingerprints all over the curriculum. For example, for high-school students: “Identify discrepancies in 2020 elections results by looking at graphs and other information.” And: “Identify the source of the COVID-19 pandemic from a Chinese lab.”

But then, just this week, the Oklahoma Supreme Court issued a temporary stay, pausing the standards while it considers a lawsuit challenging them. In that lawsuit, a group of parents, teachers, and religious leaders argued, among other things, that the standards require teachers to present biblical passages as historical facts.

In a statement, Walters called the Oklahoma Supreme Court “embarrassing” and “out of step with Oklahomans.” But Walters can, for now, press ahead with an ideology test for new teachers. Any teachers moving in from “places like California and New York” will have to take an exam designed to guard against “radical leftist ideology.”

[Music]

Walters: How are y'all doin'?

Rosin: Hey, how are you?

Walters: Ryan Walters.

Rosin: Nice to meet you.

Walters: Nice to meet you.

Rosin: In our next episode, we talk to Walters.

Walters: Oh, man, that's a nice-looking microphone right here. Is this—

Rosin: Walters explains what he's trying to do in Oklahoma schools—and whether he is the same person who taught high-school history to Starla and Shane. And, an awkward one, he addresses a scandal—like, a weird incident—that took place only a few days before we got there. It involves something that Walters himself has brought up a lot.

TV anchor (from Fox23 News Tulsa): Tonight, Fox23 talked to and confirmed with two members of the Oklahoma State Board of Education that they saw sexually explicit images of naked women on a screen inside State Superintendent Ryan Walters's office yesterday. Thanks so much for joining us—

Walters: Yeah, they're outrageous liars.  And we're about to be able to show that, so it shows you the lengths at which they will go.

Rosin: That's next time.

“I love Pete,” she writes in her new book. But picking a gay man would have been too risky.

As Kamala Harris rushed to pick a running mate last year, her “first choice” was her close friend Pete Buttigieg, but she decided that it would be “too big of a risk” for a Black woman to run with a gay man.

Buttigieg “would have been an ideal partner—if I were a straight white man,” Harris writes in a passage of her soon-to-be-released book, 107 Days, that I saw. “But we were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man. Part of me wanted to say, Screw it, let's just do it. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk.”

“And I think Pete also knew that—to our mutual sadness.”

Harris instead selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and the two went on to lose to Donald Trump. Her honest recounting of that decision—much more candid than I usually see in political memoirs—highlights one of the core challenges facing Democrats, especially as they try to refocus their message ahead of the next presidential election, in 2028. After years of highlighting and celebrating the historic characteristics of their nominees, many in the party are now embracing a singular focus: who can win.

The constant battle: The first excerpt from Kamala Harris' 107 Days

Harris writes that Buttigieg originally topped the eight names on her vetting list because “he is a sincere public servant with the rare talent of being able to frame liberal arguments in a way that makes it possible for conservatives to hear them.”

“I love Pete,” she wrote. “I love working with Pete. He and his husband, Chasten, are friends.”

Buttigieg fell out of the running before Harris narrowed down her list to a few finalists. A person familiar with their conversations told me that the two did not discuss her reasoning. Spokespeople for Harris and Buttigieg declined to comment.

The two leaders got to know each other as they both ran for president in 2020, when Buttigieg was the party's unexpected breakout star. The former mayor of the small city of South Bend, Indiana, Buttigieg adopted a “go anywhere and say yes to anything” media mantra that put him in front of every camera and microphone possible as he tried to grow his name recognition. Not even 40 years old at the time, the Rhodes Scholar and former naval intelligence officer quickly became one of the party's most effective communicators and nearly won the Iowa caucuses. Even after his bid fizzled, he won admiration from the party's eventual nominee, Joe Biden, who compared him to his late son, Beau, and later appointed Buttigieg as his secretary of transportation.

During Buttigieg's tumultuous tenure at the Department of Transportation, the nation began traveling again after the coronavirus pandemic, and airlines struggled with pilot shortages and an avalanche of flight delays. But he remained a sought-after spokesperson for the party, often venturing where few of his fellow Democrats dared to go—Fox News and other conservative media outlets—to sell the Biden agenda.

When Biden abandoned his reelection campaign in July 2024, after his disastrous debate performance, he handed the party's mantle to his vice president. Buttigieg was suggested as a possible running mate by allies, who touted his high name recognition and ability to act as an attack dog; they also noted that his age (he was just 42) would help Harris make the race about generational change and distance herself from the then-81-year-old Biden.

Democrats are still debating Joe Biden's decision to run

Harris wrote about how her life was upended when she became Biden's running mate in 2020, and her awareness that she was about to “cause the same sudden swerve in someone else's life.”

In the brief passage that I saw, which is separate from and unrelated to the excerpt The Atlantic published last week, Harris doesn't explain to readers whether Walz knew that he wasn't her initial favorite. The Minnesota governor had burst onto the national stage weeks earlier with a series of buzzy national cable interviews, and Harris has said that she liked his mix of Midwest folksiness and progressive bona fides. But after a well-received convention address, Walz became something of a nonentity on the campaign trail and turned in a middling performance in his one debate with J. D. Vance.

Walz announced this week that he will seek a third term as governor. Teddy Tschann, a spokesperson for Walz, told me in a statement that Buttigieg is “outstanding.”

“The party's lucky to have such a deep bench of talent,” he said. “Now we need everyone out on the field making our case ahead of '28.”

Most Democrats do not believe that Harris's choice of running mate played much of a role in the outcome of the election. As they scramble to find their next generation of leaders, Harris is providing a blunt message on just how much diversity voters can handle on a ticket. Ahead of the 2020 election, Harris moved to the left along with most presidential hopefuls and many primary voters, a shift that included an embrace of progressive policies on issues such as policing and immigration. The party debated gender politics, such as pronouns and transgender rights, and there was a heavy focus on the backgrounds and identities of its candidates. By 2024, Democrats seemed out of step with a country that appeared more focused on kitchen-table issues. Trump fanned the electorate's doubts, wielding the word woke as a slur and attacking Harris for being too liberal. One ad, pillorying Harris's defense of transgender rights, was later credited by pollsters for helping him make gains with key voting demographics such as Black and Latino men.

Democrats' previous two attempts to make history with their nominees failed: Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in 2016, and Harris did the same eight years later. Some Democrats wonder whether embracing pioneering candidates cost the party the elections. Last November, Trump continued to gain strong support from white men while also making real inroads with Latinos and smaller strides with Black men and young voters.

The rumored and early list of possible 2028 presidential candidates includes Maryland Governor Wes Moore, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, as well as Buttigieg, Walz, and, of course, Harris. In the weeks after the election, Harris told confidants that she would likely not run again—only to privately say in recent months that she would consider it. Her book, set to be released Tuesday, will surely be viewed by some as a first step toward another possible campaign.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The business of vaccines is getting even more difficult.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The world's market for vaccines, as it exists today, depends on the United States. The U.S. has poured immense resources into the design and development of vaccines, and has paid far higher prices for doses than most other nations can afford. The federal government has issued broad vaccine recommendations, generating strong, consistent demand. “That's a predictable market,” Richard Hughes IV, a public-health-law expert and the former vice president of public policy at Moderna, told me. It's also a huge one. Seth Berkley, the former CEO of Gavi, which supports the immunization of about half the world's children, told me that the U.S. accounts for 35 to 40 percent of global vaccine revenue at a minimum, more than all of Europe combined.

But since the start of this year, when Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—one of the nation's most prominent anti-vaccine activists—took charge of the Department of Health and Human Services, the federal government has signaled that it is no longer a reliable partner in the business of vaccines. The Trump administration has fired vaccine experts, tightened vaccine regulatory policies, restricted vaccine recommendations, and spread misinformation about vaccines' harms. It has halted its funding of Gavi. It has canceled hundreds of contracts for vaccine research across multiple agencies. “Even before the change in policies that are being implemented now, vaccines were a difficult business,” Andrew W. Lo, an economist at MIT, told me. “It's just become that much harder.”

In response, companies are paring back. Multiple vaccine makers suffering from the American government's recent attacks have announced layoffs or a demerger of their vaccine division, as their stocks fall. These include Moderna, which HHS recently stripped of more than $700 million in grant funding for its pandemic-flu shots. Also among them is the Australian biotechnology company CSL, which sells two flu vaccines to the U.S. that contain thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that Kennedy's handpicked CDC vaccine-advisory panel recently recommended against, despite decades of evidence showing the additive is safe. (Last month, CSL noted that a recent dip in flu-vaccine uptake in the U.S. had put “competitive pressure” on its vaccine profit margin; a CSL spokesperson told me in an email that the company expects American vaccination rates to recover. Moderna declined to comment.) More instability is likely ahead. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel meets again today and could vote to restrict guidance for several immunizations, including ones that protect infants against measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, and hepatitis B.

When reached for comment, an HHS spokesperson wrote over email that “Secretary Kennedy serves the American people, not the interests of Big Pharma,” adding that the department was “not limiting access to vaccines, but rather returning focus to the doctor-patient relationship.”

Legitimate critiques can be made of the pharmaceutical industry's incentives and pricing strategies. But from a financial standpoint, vaccines have always been a bit of an underdog for pharmaceutical companies. As preventative products, designed for healthy people, they're held to an especially high safety standard—a requirement that reliably drives up the expenses of development and testing—and they need to be widely accessible, which puts pressure on manufacturers to keep their price tags low. Individual vaccines are also used, at most, a few times over a lifetime—another cap on potential revenue. What's more, “it's very hard to charge money for something that patients don't immediately need,” Lo told me: They might clamor for a new heart medication or cancer drug, but persuading healthy people to inject a foreign substance into their body can be trickier. Throughout the past half century, the vaccine industry has also been threatened repeatedly by lawsuits over potential vaccine side effects.

To their makers, then, vaccines are a big risk for a potentially low reward. That makes the market for them one of the most fragile in the pharmaceutical industry, Rajeev Venkayya, the former head of Takeda Pharmaceuticals' vaccine unit, told me. Those realities have driven plenty of vaccine makers out of the market, experts told me—whether via mergers, bankruptcy, or strategic decisions to focus on other products. In 1967, 26 companies produced vaccines for the U.S.; by the mid-2000s, fewer than half a dozen were left—and the nation was staring down shortages of nine of the 12 childhood vaccines recommended at the time.

In the two decades since, the industry has rallied, Berkley told me, especially as profitable “blockbuster” vaccines, including pneumococcal vaccines, HPV vaccines, and, most recently, COVID-19 vaccines, have grown into billion-dollar markets or more in the United States. The U.S.'s deep pockets helped—as Berkley pointed out, the federal government pays about 20 times what Gavi does for pneumococcal vaccines—but so did federal policies that have increased incentives and lowered risks for manufacturers. And when the public's trust in vaccines has been threatened, often the government has emphasized that American immunizations have been well vetted and urged the public to continue getting them, Jesse Goodman, who served as the FDA's chief scientist until 2014, told me.

Now the Trump administration is doing essentially the opposite—most dramatically, so far, for COVID vaccines. Trump's FDA has limited who can access the shots and made seeking approval for new versions more difficult. The CDC has also muted its COVID-vaccine guidance. Every expert I spoke with for this story expected more changes to the regulatory pipeline that all vaccines must pass though. And the people Kennedy has chosen to oversee vaccine policy and sit on the CDC's vaccine-advisory commitee—COVID contrarians and vocally anti-vaccine researchers—are making the U.S. a highly unappealing market for all vaccine makers, experts told me.

Without clear, strong recommendations, demand will likely be uneven, making it difficult for manufacturers to estimate how much product to make; without vaccine experts using evidence to advise the government, companies can't trust that the clinical-trial data they produce, vouching for vaccine safety and performance, will be fairly or accurately assessed. Across the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Trump officials have also defunded billions of dollars' worth of vaccine-related grants. That includes half a billion specifically for mRNA-based vaccines—jeopardizing the development of future immunizations, including those designed to protect against pandemic flus. And new roadblocks in the approval process will hinder companies trying to bring products to market, making the up-front costs of research, development, and testing that much bigger a gamble. “All of this creates more chaos and uncertainty for vaccine manufacturers,” Grace Lee, a pediatrician and a former chair of ACIP, told me. “Why would you take these additional risks, where it is not clear from week to week what will happen?”

Large, long-established pharmaceutical companies with wide-ranging drug portfolios will likely have the resources to weather a dip in demand. But smaller biotechnology companies, which already tend to operate on thin margins, “will get out of the business,” Lo told me—which, in turn, will likely discourage other vaccine-focused companies from starting up. Venture capitalists have taken note of the circumstances: “The sense right now is that the market's going to be unstable,” Berkley told me. “This is not the time to invest heavily in new or better products.”

The Trump administration could also nudge companies to exit the vaccine business by making them more vulnerable to legal risk. Most immediately, Kennedy could rescind a pandemic-era declaration that has protected COVID-vaccine manufacturers from excessive liability. He has also announced his intention to amend the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which experts worry could take the U.S. back to a time when lawsuits nearly destroyed the vaccine market. Congress established the VICP in the 1980s, after a flood of litigation against the makers of a pertussis vaccine persuaded all but one company supplying the U.S. to stop selling it. (The lawsuits were spurred in part by since-debunked claims that the vaccine caused permanent brain damage.) Today, the program simultaneously acknowledges the rare but very real side effects of vaccines, and gives vaccine makers an important liability shield. Funded by a tax on manufacturers, it offers compensation for certain vaccine injuries that are already backed by evidence; other claims are heard in a kind of vaccine court. Major alterations to the program, Anna Kirkland, the author of the book Vaccine Court, told me, would require Congress to act. Still, some experts told me they fear that Kennedy could push for autism to be added to the list of compensable vaccine injuries, as part of his effort to advance the debunked narrative that vaccines cause the condition. That change could flood the program with claims, rapidly drain it, and give manufacturers another reason to pull away from making vaccines.

The exit of even just a handful of manufacturers from the U.S. market could mean shortages of certain vaccines, on disastrously quick timelines. In 2004, for instance, the U.S. lost half of its supply of seasonal flu vaccine after one of the country's two flu-shot manufacturers at the time, Chiron, temporarily shut down one of its factories because of potential contamination. Several vaccines on the American childhood immunization schedule still rely on only one or two manufacturers, Goodman told me. Among them are the shots that guard against HPV, varicella, and rotavirus.

A wind-down in vaccine manufacturing for the U.S. wouldn't just invite outbreaks of known diseases. The country would also be exceptionally ill-equipped to respond to the next pandemic. Manufacturers managed to debut the world's first COVID-19 vaccines in less than a year—a record—because the government was eager to fund their development and because companies could trust that the government would buy them. That mRNA vaccines would arrive first was never a foregone conclusion, either; Operation Warp Speed succeeded in part because federal agencies offered resources to a wide range of vaccine companies. Several of the experts I spoke with agreed: If a new pandemic were to ignite in the current climate, “Operation Warp Speed Part 2 would not operate at warp speed,” Lo said.

If the U.S. vaccine market shrinks, it can rebound, as it has before. But the amount of time that will take, experts told me, will depend heavily on just how thoroughly vaccine infrastructure is dismantled. Already, the scale of destruction is unlike any they have ever seen before. Perhaps, if the world is fortunate, demand and supply will rebound within a couple of years, Goodman said. But if manufacturers go out of business, if factories close, if some vaccines have their licenses entirely stripped, rebuilding could take decades. For now, most Americans continue to strongly support vaccination. But if Kennedy and the rest of the Trump administration succeed in draining the U.S. of its vaccine supply, Americans could soon be forced into a position where they cannot access immunizations—no matter how badly they may want them.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The great thinker never let his emotions get the better of him. Instead, he used reason to get the better of his detractors.

Imagine that you had dedicated yourself to helping others think a little differently about life so they'd be happier and better off. You've put your whole heart into this work and made a lot of sacrifices in doing so. But you've gotten no appreciation from others—on the contrary, everyone's said your ideas are garbage and you're a rotten person for suggesting them. No doubt, you'd be bitter and disheartened.

That was exactly the situation in which the 17th-century Portuguese Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza found himself: working to make the world a happier, more harmonious place by arguing that God is everywhere, and that humans are one with him. But Spinoza was, in the words of his biographer Bertrand Russell, “considered, during his lifetime and for a century after his death, a man of appalling wickedness.” For his work, he was rejected by his own Jewish community in Amsterdam for questioning the literal truth of the Bible; despised by Christian leaders for denying the personal, interventionist nature of the Divinity; and condemned by the civic-religious authorities as a threat to social stability. In today's terms, Spinoza got canceled.

His cancellation did not harm him economically, because he made a good living not as a philosopher but by producing lenses, microscopes, and telescopes. Yet the repudiation of his life's work had to hurt.

Despite all of this rejection, Spinoza used his philosophical insight to figure out how to manage his emotions and avoid dejection. Centuries before modern neuroscience, he developed an intuitive understanding of the relationship in the brain between emotion and reason and taught himself to maintain equanimity in spite of censure and contempt. Anyone today who faces the wrath of the cancel-scolds for trying to speak the truth can benefit greatly from his approach.

Most people in Spinoza's situation would probably experience anger and fear—and that reaction would certainly be justified if their livelihood or social position was affected by the persecution. One thing that has changed, for the worse perhaps since Spinoza's time, is that the cancel mob can be entirely virtual today. That hardly softens the effect of denunciation: You can feel as though the whole world is against you even if you know none of your tormentors in person. Spinoza would say that this sense of oppression is a form of emotional bondage. “When a man is a prey to his emotions,” he wrote in Ethics, “he is not his own master, but lies at the mercy of fortune.”

Arthur C. Brooks: How to stop freaking out

What Spinoza thought of as fortune, we might today call the limbic system. This primitive console of brain tissue that largely controls emotion includes the amygdala, which is stimulated when you perceive a threat. In the estimation of many neuroscientists, fear is the master emotion because it clears all else and makes you focus on the immediate danger (a phenomenon that has been called an “amygdala hijack”). This may save your life if an actual tiger is after you, but most of the time this mechanism lowers your quality of life by leading you to say and do things you later regret. A hijacked amygdala can make you feel completely freaked out over something relatively insignificant—such as, say, a bunch of trolls attacking you online.

Spinoza had a solution to such emotional bondage: achieving greater consciousness. As he went on to explain in Ethics, for a person to be “scarcely at all disturbed in spirit,” he should be “conscious of himself, and of God, and of things.” The trick is not to eradicate the turbulence stoked by others' disapproval that triggers primordial fears in your limbic system, but to have a rational understanding of exactly what that inner turmoil is. Knowledge, Spinoza argued, gives you power over your emotions.

Science bears this out. Rational observation of negative emotions is called “metacognition”: an awareness that uses the brain's executive function to reach impartial judgment of thoughts and feelings. Metacognition moves the experience of your emotions from the limbic system to the prefrontal cortex, where the emotions can be understood and you can decide whether they're appropriate and productive.

Although metacognition takes practice and discipline, when you do it well, you can give yourself the sort of advice a rational observer of your situation would give you, rather than the hysterical commands a person flailing in terror would issue. So, instead of trying to out-troll the trolls, you would just be able to say to yourself, Delete the app and get on with your life.

You may object that such higher rationality will turn you into Mr. Spock from Star Trek, incapable of the emotional range that brings mystery and spontaneity to life. That isn't Spinoza's objective at all. He doesn't want to eradicate emotions, but to regulate them so that they can be as productive and helpful as possible in any given situation. That could mean, for example, that you're able to respond with courage and dignity when you are under attack—calibrating your anger appropriately, rather than acting out of panic.

Spinoza argued that this rationality sorts out not only earthly problems but heavenly ones as well. Though considered a heretic by Jews and Christians alike, he never lost his faith and maintained his belief in a good God whom he aspired to know more deeply and whom he might love more rationally than emotionally. An “intellectual love of God” was not to “imagine him as present,” Spinoza argued, but to “understand him to be eternal.”

You don't have to embrace Spinoza's theology to benefit from his philosophy of emotions. In times of strife and malice, Spinoza offers the best defense to free you from the fear of unjust reproval. Here are three ways to make use of his wisdom.

1. Take a beat. When you were a child, your mother probably told you that if you're angry, you should count to 10 before speaking. Spinoza would approve entirely: Pausing when you are emotionally aroused gives your rational executive centers time to catch up with your jumpy limbic system and make your self its “master,” as Spinoza might say. The habit of counting to 10 (some scholars recommend 30)—or saving that email in draft or waiting until tomorrow to post a social-media response—is an excellent one to adopt.

2. Understand your emotions. When you are getting hijacked, Spinoza would generally counsel understanding before action—the metacognition I mentioned above and have written about before. You can pick from many practices to assist this; one I like is insight meditation (known by Buddhists as Maha-satipatthana), which allows you to observe your feelings at a distance. If you are religiously inclined, prayers of petition work in the same way. Alternatively, you can simply try journaling your feelings before reacting emotionally.

Arthur C. Brooks: Sit with negative emotions. Don't push them away.

3. Be your own therapist. So you know the difference between emotion and reason, and you have the Spinozan technique for moving from one to the other. Thus armed, try adopting the kind of advice that you would give a close friend—as a way to manage obstructive feelings and embrace emotions that are in your interest. If someone insulted this hypothetical friend, in public or online, you would probably encourage them not to freak out and get into a huge battle, and instead maintain a respectful but firm attitude. Say what you think in the right medium, in a rational and measured way, you might advise, and then move on. Then take that very solid advice from you, and make it to you.

Spinoza's emotional-management protocol sounds simple enough in theory, but how did it work in practice—for him? True, he never won public affection during his lifetime (nor did his reputation improve in the century that followed). But as reviled as he was by all the arbiters who counted in his day, did he succumb to despair and rail against those ignorant scolds? Not a bit. “Unlike some other philosophers, he not only believed his own doctrines, but practised them,” writes Russell, his biographer—and himself a celebrated philosopher. “I do not know of any occasion, in spite of great provocation, in which he was betrayed into the kind of heat or anger that his ethic condemned.”

And he lived out his own ethic to the end. “On the last day of his life he was entirely calm,” Russell writes. Spinoza had canceled his cancelers where it really mattered: in his own mind.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Jimmy Kimmel's suspension from late-night is a chilling precedent that could have deep consequences if it isn't swiftly undone.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

On Monday night, Jimmy Kimmel delivered an opening monologue on his talk show that addressed the online reaction to the arrest of Tyler Robinson, the primary suspect in the shooting of Charlie Kirk. “We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” he said. His comment was aimed not at Kirk but at the maelstrom of news around Kirk's death; it speaks ill not of the dead, but of “the MAGA gang.” Less than two days later, Kimmel's program has been pulled off the air “indefinitely,” according to his network, ABC.

There have already been signs that President Donald Trump's administration is intent on punishing perceived critics in the media, no matter what complaints about free speech might arise, but the chain of events that shut down Jimmy Kimmel Live feels particularly direct. “We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said on Benny Johnson's podcast yesterday. “These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” Within hours, Nexstar, a company that operates 32 of ABC's 200 local affiliates, said it would not broadcast Kimmel's show for the “foreseeable future.” Quickly after that, ABC announced its decision.

On Truth Social, Trump called Kimmel's removal from the air “great news for America.” In a post on X, Carr thanked Nexstar “for doing the right thing” and said, “Local broadcasters have an obligation to serve the public interest. While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community values.” (Disney is the parent company of ABC.) He's right about this being an unprecedented move. CBS chalked up its recent cancellation of The Late Show—whose host, Stephen Colbert, has been a frequent Trump critic—to financial pressure; plenty of observers cited the legal skirmishes its parent company, Paramount, had with Trump as a potential motivator, however. Either way, Colbert is still on the air and likely won't depart until his contract is up next year. Kimmel's show was yanked immediately, and its future is murky.

Read: Why CBS snatched its talk-show king's crown

One assumes there will be widespread debate over the accuracy of Kimmel's offending comments. That is a distraction from the fundamental assault on free speech that is happening here. Kimmel could easily have addressed his comments on another episode or issued a statement in response to complaints; after all, there have been plenty of minor controversies over the years about quips made on late-night shows. Kimmel, though, is an established entertainer who takes great pleasure in tweaking Trump. Watch his monologue from this past Thursday; it's loaded with jokes about Trump's appearance at a 9/11-memorial event.

Of course, mocking the sitting president has long been a cornerstone of pretty much any late-night program throughout the medium's history. Trump has been the butt of countless jokes over the years. What's happened to Kimmel is an escalation in every way, a chilling precedent that could have further consequences if it isn't swiftly undone. How Kimmel himself reacts to the situation will be important—he's a major celebrity, a multi-time emcee of the Academy Awards who's been hosting TV shows since the 1990s. There's a chance network television could become even more reticent to broadcast anything remotely provocative, which in turn could also inspire blowback from their audiences.

The reaction of Kimmel's peers is just as vital. Colbert is still telling Trump jokes on his show; meanwhile, Seth Meyers, the host of NBC's Late Night, is another prominent Trump detractor. But Meyers's lead-in is Jimmy Fallon at The Tonight Show, who tends to occupy a more politically anodyne space. If they and others challenge Kimmel's suspension, that response could balloon into a stronger movement against government interference. But if Trump had his way, Meyers and Fallon would be pushed out, too. “That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC,” he said on Truth Social. “Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Free speech is under assault.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

On Monday night, Jimmy Kimmel commented that American politics had “hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” Kimmel seemed to imply that the man accused of killing the conservative activist Charlie Kirk was a Donald Trump–supporting conservative. This was at best an unconfirmed rumor at the time, and as more evidence has emerged, seems flatly incorrect. Kimmel should have chosen his words more carefully.

Kimmel made a mistake. He said something that was not correct to an audience of millions. Although he is a comedian, not a journalist, it would have been appropriate for him to apologize to his viewers and correct the record, given the breadth of his platform as a late-night host on network television.

Instead, he was silenced by a government and its allies that want to control what you say, what you do, and what you think. The Trump-appointed chair of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, went on a conservative podcast and threatened Disney, which owns ABC, saying, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” In 2023 Carr posted on X that “censorship is the authoritarian's dream.” At the time that was a criticism of censorship; now it reads like a statement of intent.

Charlie Kirk should still be alive. His wife should not be widowed. His children should still have their father. Political murder is an attack on the self-determination of the people, and it should always be condemned in the strongest terms. It is also true that the administration's use of Kirk's death as a pretext to censor its opposition is as cynical as it is destructive to fundamental American rights and freedoms. Conservative outrage over some of what was said after Kirk's murder is understandable—people getting mad at one another over what they say is part of living in a free society. What happened to Kimmel is something different: a state-backed campaign of repression.

As Oliver Darcy reports, Nexstar, the largest owner of local television stations in the United States, announced its intention to pull Kimmel off the air following Carr's threat, after which ABC followed suit, announcing that Kimmel was suspended “indefinitely.” Darcy points out that both Disney and Nexstar are pursuing business deals that require regulatory approval. Kimmel is only the latest comedian to be yanked off the air. In July, Stephen Colbert's show was canceled—CBS insists for financial reasons—shortly after he criticized CBS's parent company, Paramount, for paying Trump to settle a lawsuit.

It is one thing for Trump loyalists like Carr to make threats. It is another for the targets of the threats to capitulate. In the early months of the second Trump administration, we have discovered that many American corporations, including companies that own media outlets, are ready to surrender their First Amendment rights as soon as Trump indicates the slightest displeasure with their politics. Whether they are capitulating because of fear or because they see a financial interest in aligning with the administration is ultimately irrelevant. Their rapid surrender to state coercion points to the absolute rot in these elite echelons, filled with people whose commitment to fundamental rights like free speech is utterly superficial.

Appearing on Sean Hannity's Fox News show last night, Carr clarified that not only was Kimmel targeted for violating conservative sensibilities, but that others might also be subject to similar punishment. “They went from going for applause, from laugh lines to applause lines. They went from being court jesters that would make fun of everybody in power to being court clerics and enforcing a very narrow political ideology,” Carr told Hannity. “Enforcing a narrow political ideology” is of course exactly what Carr is doing—a government official using state power given to him by the people to silence political expression disfavored by the president of the United States. The purpose, the very essence, of the First Amendment is the right to express oneself in ways others, but particularly those in power, might find distasteful. Those free-speech protections do not vanish because someone makes a mistake and angers the powerful.

The landmark 1964 free-speech case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan was actually about a mistake. A civil-rights group had taken out an ad in The New York Times criticizing the state of Alabama's handling of civil-rights protests, which contained some factual errors. The Montgomery public-safety commissioner, L. B. Sullivan, who had stood by idly while segregationist mobs attacked civil-rights protesters, filed a lawsuit that reached the Supreme Court. The justices handed down a unanimous verdict in the civil-rights group's favor.

As one of the justices wrote:

The theory of our Constitution is that every citizen may speak his mind and every newspaper express its view on matters of public concern, and may not be barred from speaking or publishing because those in control of government think that what is said or written is unwise, unfair, false, or malicious.

The larger context of the case was that segregationists frequently sought to use libel law to silence their critics. The Court properly recognized that free speech cannot survive if powerful officials can use flimsy pretexts to crack down on their opposition. You cannot have free speech if people fear being punished by the state because they misspeak or make an honest mistake.

As Carr's comments make clear, the Trump administration does not subscribe to the theory that the Constitution protects speech opposed by people in power. For a long time, Republicans have adhered to a definition of free speech that could be simply summarized as: Conservatives can say what they want, and everyone else can say what conservatives want. That is now the policy of the Trump administration.

Vice President J. D. Vance, who guest-hosted Kirk's show after his death, urged conservatives to snitch on any potential thought crimes: “When you see someone celebrating Charlie's murder, call them out,” Vance said. “And hell, call their employer.” And conservatives have been doing just that, getting regular people fired from their jobs for celebrating Kirk's death, or in some cases, for condemning his killing while also criticizing his views. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who previously styled himself a champion of free speech, has been using his account on X to demand the expulsion of a student for speech he finds offensive and to celebrate the arrest of another. The Pentagon has forbidden any criticism of Kirk from Department of Defense employees, while Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that “there's free speech and then there's hate speech,” a distinction the Constitution does not recognize, precisely because it would give the authorities too much power to dictate what views are acceptable.

It's remarkable how quickly we went from “hate speech is free speech” (one of the few beliefs Kirk and I actually shared) to effectively having a blasphemy law. Nor will mere silence protect you—people have been attacked for committing the thought crime of failing to mourn Kirk publicly, NFL teams criticized for declining to hold a moment of silence, and businesses singled out for not lowering the flag to half-staff in his honor. The Trump-sympathizing Free Press castigated the Emmys for failing to honor Kirk. The self-styled “free-speech absolutist” and Trump-backing billionaire Elon Musk, who owns the social-media platform X, has called for deplatforming, firing, and even imprisoning critics of Kirk.

What happened to Jimmy Kimmel is not about one comedian who said something he should not have said. The Trump administration and its enforcers want to control your speech, your behavior, even your public expressions of mourning. You are not allowed to criticize the president's associates. You do not even retain the right to remain silent; you must make public expressions of emotions demanded by the administration and its allies or incur its disfavor, which can threaten your livelihood. This is the road to totalitarianism, and it does not end with one man losing his television show.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Mehdi Hasan explains why he'll debate (almost) anyone.

The death of Charlie Kirk reignited heated discussions about political speech in America, especially the value of arguing with people you disagree with.

One company, Jubilee Media, has tapped into that sentiment and has been going viral on YouTube these last couple of years with its high-energy and high-drama — and yes, gimmicky — debate shows where one person faces off against a big group of people who disagree with them. (Kirk himself made an appearance on a Jubilee show in 2024: “Can 25 Liberal College Students Outsmart 1 Conservative?”)

Jason Y. Lee says he founded the company to foster debates and build empathy in a polarized country. But critics argue that some of Jubilee's content could be categorized more as voyeuristic clickbait than high-minded discourse. One show has women arranging themselves based on perceived attractiveness and men rearranging them; another involves blindfolded guessing games about which participant is Black or white.

More recently, Mehdi Hasan — author and founder of his own media company, Zeteo, and former host of his own MSNBC show — appeared on Jubilee's flagship debate show, Surrounded. His episode was called “1 Progressive vs 20 Far-Right Conservatives,” and that too made waves.

Hasan said he was prepared to vigorously defend his views, something he's become known for over the years. But when he showed up, he wasn't expecting some of the featured debaters to openly call for his deportation (Hasan is a US citizen originally from England) — or for one to proudly declare himself a fascist. The episode offered unusual insight into the promise and perils of political debate, how we practice politics in the age of algorithms, and the value — and limits — of engaging with those you fundamentally disagree with.

Today, Explained co-host Noel King spoke with Mehdi Hasan about his appearance on Surrounded — and what it taught him about this charged political moment.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Where did you learn to debate?

Where did I learn to debate? I think around the dinner table. My family is very disputatious. The Hasans are known for having strong views. There was a lot of debate around the kitchen table, the dining table, political, social, cultural, religious.

We planned to do a show on the Jubilee debates and the argument about whether they are of value or not. And we called you because you appeared in one of these debates that went very viral, and then Charlie Kirk was assassinated in Utah and many people said Charlie Kirk was doing it right. He was showing up; he was debating people he disagreed with. That's the right way to do politics. Do you agree with that?

No, I don't believe that Charlie Kirk was practicing politics the right way, to quote former Vox boss, now New York Times columnist, Ezra Klein, a good friend of mine. I totally disagree with Ezra on that piece he wrote. I do have to add the standard caveat because Fox keeps clipping some of us on the left out of context.

Obviously [Kirk] shouldn't have been killed. Obviously, we all condemn his murder. Obviously, a political assassination in response to speech you don't like is unacceptable in America and very scary.

But if you're asking me about the content of what Charlie Kirk said when he was alive, it was awful, it was horrific, it was reactionary, it was bigoted. This idea that he was some kind of Socratic debater trying to get to the truth? No, he wasn't. He was doing a “Prove Me Wrong” tour over the years where he and Ben Shapiro and others go to college campuses, find some guy with blue hair who says something provocative and then dunk all over him, and then clip it up and go viral and then have a YouTube video saying, “Charlie Kirk/Ben Shapiro destroys college student.”

All right. What about Jubilee?

So Jubilee's a little bit different. Jubilee claims to be nonpartisan; they say that they are trying to get people from all sides to get in a room together. I mean, on paper what they're aspiring to is at minimum neutral, if not good. What turns up on YouTube is not necessarily always the case.

Tell me why you decided to go on Surrounded.

There were multiple reasons. One is, as I say, I like a good argument and 20 to one — those are good odds. I'll take those odds. The idea of going into the lion's den and debating a bunch of people who disagree with me, I thought would be fun.

Number two, I spoke to my good friend Sam Seder from the Majority Report who had done a Jubilee, and he told me that it's worth doing. It does actually have value — you will reach a whole new audience. And people like my daughter and my nieces and others we're saying, “Oh yeah, Jubilee, we know Jubilee, all the kids watch Jubilee.”

And it's amazing since I did Jubilee how many younger people are now coming up to me in the street versus older people because they recognize me from that circle debate show. So it was a chance to reach a new audience. That was number two.

And number three, it looked like a lot of right-wingers have been dominating that space. Prior to me going on Jubilee, all the top-rated people who had done Jubilee on YouTube with the most views were Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, Candace Owens, Michael Knowles. That was the lean of YouTube and Jubilee. And I thought, well, actually, maybe people like me and Sam Seder can try and give a different point of view.

And what happened?

What happened was the craziest two hours of my professional life as a journalist. I was not expecting — and maybe I should have been — the kind of people I sat across. I'd watched a lot of Jubilees. I'd watched Sam Seder's show. I knew there were a couple of people who came and said white supremacist things and far-right things and dumb things. But I didn't expect one after another person to be telling me to my face that I should leave the country, that I'm not a real American. “I'm a proud fascist,” one person told me very early on in the debate.

What? Normally, people wanna deny the f-word. We spent the last week with Republicans up in arms that anyone would call them fascists, and how that's what led to the death of Charlie Kirk. And yet here I was sitting in a warehouse with a bunch of young, mainly white people saying proudly, yes, we are fascists, we are racist.

How do we debate fascists? Should a person debate fascists?

No. And that's why I said at the time, if you watch that clip, about halfway through the conversation, I said, “What are we doing here? I don't debate fascists.” And all of the right-wingers watching in the circle, they got very upset because Jubilee then moved this guy out. And so many of them spent the next two hours, every time they came up to the chair to debate me, they would say, “Oh, you're banning people you don't agree with.”

And I was like, “That's not what it is. I don't debate fascists because fascists don't believe in democracy. They don't believe in debate. They don't believe in my equal worth as a human being. So why would I debate such people?”

Fascism at its core is an anti-democratic, authoritarian, and yes, very violent ideology. So, no, I don't believe there is value to debating fascists. And if I'd known that people would be sitting down dismissing the Holocaust or saying, “I'm a fascist,” or saying the country was built for white people or whatever it is, I would not have gone on that show, or I would've said, “Get other people.”

Look, I come from a proud anti-fascist tradition on the left where you don't platform fascists, you don't indulge them, you don't meet them halfway. You defeat fascism by defeating the ideology, by offering something better and by being truthful.

You know, a person who appreciated your appearance on Surrounded might say, these fascist-y types are out there. They're influencing young people in a real way. At least you showed up and gave them a run for their money.

That is the silver lining. I guess you could argue if — and this is gonna make me sound very egomaniacal and immodest, so I apologize in advance — I guess people could say, if you're gonna debate fascists, might as well be someone who's good at debating. And that's what I'm known for doing. So it's better me than someone else who goes on and gets their ass handed to them.

So in that sense, I get it, but the counterargument I get as well, a lot of my critics were saying to me: “Just by going on, you legitimize them just by going on. You amplified them just by going on. You gave them credibility and respectability. They were able to clip up their clips and put it online and say, ‘Look, look, look, we own this mainstream journalist. We told them to get the F out of our country.' ”

Do you think you changed anyone's mind by appearing on Surrounded?

Certainly not in that room. No. And that wasn't the goal.

What is the goal in debating if not to change minds?

So my goal is not to change my opponent's mind. Very rarely can you change your opponent's mind. My goal is to change the people watching. When you're debating on stage, as I have done, or whether you're debating on YouTube and 10 or 11 or 12 million people now have watched that Surrounded show, you are hoping that in that 11 or 12 million people, there are a handful of people who are truly open-minded, truly independent people.

Most people are partisans, whether they want to admit so or not, but you hope that you found some independent folks to go, “Hmm, that's a good point that I hadn't heard before, that's a good statistic that I wasn't aware of, that's a good way of framing the issue.” And, look, people have reached out to me over the years. I've spent the last year and a half doing nonstop debates. I've done a lot of debating about Gaza, another very polarizing issue, and people have reached out to me, and I have had messages from people saying, “I have switched my positions on this issue.”

Charlie Kirk and meme culture's violent turn.

The bullet casings authorities recovered during their investigation of Charlie Kirk's killing make at least one thing clear: The alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, was speaking the language of memes.

“Hey Fascist! Catch!”, “If you Read This, You Are GAY Lmao,” and “O Bella ciao…” read some of the engravings on bullets, both used and unused, in the shooting last week. Their meanings are hard to parse — they're ideologically inconsistent, wrapped in layers of irony and earnestness, and reference various online communities and video games.

In a text exchange with his roommate and partner, reproduced by authorities in charging documents, Robinson references the inscriptions, calling them “mostly a big meme.” “[If] I see ‘notices bulge uwu' on fox new[s] I might have a stroke,” Robinson allegedly said.

It all suggests this act of violence, which seems to have been driven by opposition to “hate” Robinson thought Kirk was spreading as well as some left-leaning ideas, was also wrapped up in a kind of dark, nihilistic, deeply online meme culture that has been spawning, or at least inspiring, acts of violence over the last half-decade. Memes started to make more of an appearance in the killings carried out by mass shooters, beginning most notably in 2019, during attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Memes, and deeply online references, also appeared in Luigi Mangione's alleged killing of a health insurance CEO and in school shootings this year in Wisconsin and Minnesota.

It's a complicated world to parse, so we turned to Elle Reeve, someone who has a history of investigating and explaining the shady corners of the internet that have started dealing serious damage in the real world. Reeve is a correspondent for CNN and the author of the book Black Pill: How I Witnessed the Darkest Corners of the Internet Come to Life, Poison Society, and Capture American Politics — all about the kinds of (mostly) men who get sucked into dark worlds online, and as she's put it, “talk themselves into doing strange, cruel, or violent things because it all started with just jokes, man.”

Below is an excerpt of Reeve's conversation with us, edited for length and clarity. Listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

It's been almost a week since Charlie Kirk was killed. What do we know at this point about his alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson?

To me, we still don't know enough. We know that he was a young man, he is referred to as very smart and quiet by a lot of his friends that have talked to the press. He scored well in his ACT, according to a post his mom made, but he dropped out of college after the first semester. He was a big gamer — really into video games. And according to investigators, he was dating his roommate, [who they say is transgender].

The first tranche of information we got about this alleged shooter was when investigators revealed what he allegedly wrote on the bullet casings. Could you help us understand what exactly he wrote?

So the first one is “Notices bulge OWO what's this?” This is a furry meme. This one has thrown a lot of people for a loop. Luckily, people aren't trying to attribute a lot of politics to it because it's so confusing. But it's a reference to furries. It's a 10-year-old meme. It comes from an image that's a drawing of two middle-aged, unattractive men role-playing with each other online, making sexy talk as furries. And if people don't know, that's kind of like a sort of sexual thing where you like imagining yourself as an anthropomorphic animal, usually a specific one…

He wrote a whole bunch of jokes. He wrote dumb internet jokes. Some of them, if it were in a movie, would be funny. But he wrote them before killing a person. That's what's, honestly, pretty chilling. It's one of the details that's hard for me to get past.

So this can be interpreted as a pro-furry joke or an anti-furry joke because hating furries on the internet is a big thing both in the right-wing world and in other very online spaces. But it's also been reclaimed by furries, kind of like the word “queer.” So the point of saying all that is that an outsider trying to establish with certainty what exactly was being expressed by this message — that's a fool's errand. You just don't know. We just don't know. We're getting a few more details, but it's still pretty ambiguous.

Which feels similar to another casing, which said, “If you Read This, You Are GAY Lmao.”

Exactly. That's the fourth cartridge. And that one — again, I saw other people pick this up on the internet — for me, what it conjures is, like a grizzled law enforcement veteran, bulletproof vest, bends down in the dust to pick up a piece of evidence. And it says, “If you read this, you're gay,” right? You're supposed to laugh, or the image is funny. And yet he did it before killing somebody. So it's not a strong statement about how you should vote in the midterms, that's for sure.

What do the rest of them say?

So the second cartridge says, “Hey, Fascist! Catch!” and has these arrow symbols. It's a reference to a video game called Helldivers 2, which is kind of like a fascist satire. The arrow symbols are what bring the biggest bomb in the game. The third cartridge is, “Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Ciao, Ciao.” So that's an old anti-fascist song, history buffs are very familiar with this…I'm told it's a meme among anti-fascists — I have done quite a bit of reporting with them and I had never come across it. But that's the internet, I guess… It's become more popular because it's in a Netflix show called Money Heist. And if you go on TikTok, you can see people doing goofy dances to it while ordering coffee. And it's in a video game as well. But broadly, this could be taken as a left-wing anti-fascist message.

And is this what leads people to immediately say that this guy is left-wing?

That and the bulge thing, I heard Ted Cruz say it was a transgender meme, which is false.

Is there some sort of throughline in what Tyler Robinson may have written on these casings?

Well, he's really into video games. And the dominant pose in these very online chat rooms is ironic detachment — so many layers of irony that you can't even fully understand the author's meaning, other than that they're implying “we're part of an in-group and the people outside don't understand.”

And what do we know about the online spaces that Tyler may have lived in?

We don't know enough. We just don't know enough. We know he was in a few Discords at minimum.

Discord is a gaming chat platform, but you don't have to be using a video game to use it. If you have Slack at work, or something like that, it's kind of like that. There's a group chat function, you can do one-on-one chats, you can talk by audio and by video. I've done quite a bit of reporting in these Discord servers that become cultures unto themselves. They become almost cult-like. I've interviewed incels who spent like 18 hours a day in their Discord server. The Discord server of white nationalists became very important evidence in a federal civil trial involving Charlottesville [and the Unite the Right rally].

How can I put this? The culture, it can become this bubble that leads to very intense groupthink. But what we've seen so far of his messages on Discord — and Discord did confirm that Tyler Robinson had an account — it isn't like that.

We know he had a server with about 30 friends. They messaged him being like, “Bro, you look like these pictures of the alleged shooter.” He's like, “My doppelganger is trying to get me in trouble. Ha ha ha. Better throw away my manifesto and exact copy rifle.” So if he was in a very political space, we have not yet seen evidence of that.

And Discord itself does not necessarily have a right lean or a left lean.

No, no, it's not for that. And there are anti-fascist servers and communist ones and right-wing ones and fascist ones and incel ones.

The part of the culture that is unsettling is that you see in a lot of these spaces is just this nihilistic, black-pilled, ironic culture where nothing is taken seriously. Like you're a loser if you take something seriously.

Which maybe explains why the bullet casings have a bunch of absurdist memes written all over them.

Right. Exactly. Which is how you possibly could get to the place of writing on a shell casing, “if you read this, you're gay.”

Is the bullet casing thing becoming like the new manifesto? It's not the first time we've seen this in one of these high-profile killings in the past year.

So a lot of these mass shooters or public assassinations, they reference each other. So Luigi Mangione [allegedly] wrote on three bullets, “deny, defend, depose,” a reference to how health insurance companies deny people coverage for care that they need. The first time I remember this being a big thing, specifically with messages written on the weaponry in order to be a message to not the wider world, but the circle of online people, the crowd or gang that they hung out in, was with the 2019 Christchurch shooting. That man wrote all kinds of memes all over his guns before killing 51 people in two mosques in New Zealand. That guy had been on this website, 8chan, which is now called 8kun. And…I mean, it was clear from that that he wanted to be a meme. He wrote it for that audience. … It was about speaking to people on 8chan. And he did become a meme there. There are all kinds of illustrations and cartoons and memes about him there. And that's when I started noticing it happening over and over on these weapons.

There was the recent shooting at the Annunciation School in Minnesota. That person also seems to be part of a very strange, nihilistic Discord, and they wrote a lot of messages in English but with Cyrillic letters. But yeah, this is a recurring thing, writing memes on the gun.

And is that to say that these shooters, though they may have very different politics and beliefs, are influencing each other?

Oh, definitely. They obsess over each other. The shooter [who] killed several people at a grocery store in Buffalo in 2022 — his manifesto and actions very directly referenced the Christchurch shooter.

What more did we learn about the alleged Kirk shooter from the charges yesterday?

The really fascinating thing is his texts with his significant other/roommate after the shooting.

It's clear from the transcript that the roommate was surprised by this.

And he's obsessed with the rifle that was his grandfather's rifle, and particularly that his father will be angry if he has lost the rifle. It's one of the other just surreal things in this exchange. You [allegedly] just killed a guy, and all he can think about is, “my dad's gonna be so mad if I don't bring back grandpa's rifle.”

I think it speaks to the unreality of it all. And there's another message that's related to what we've been talking about. He says, “Remember how I was engraving bullets? The fucking messages are mostly a big meme. If I see, ‘notices bulge, uwu' on Fox News, I might have a stroke.”

This whole incident, or at least what we know of it so far, just feels like a very uncomfortable clash of I live online versus I live in the real world.

Yes, yes. And particularly when talking to older colleagues who did not grow up online, it's been very hard to explain. And you see it in the national discourse, too. This is not about supporting Trump, anti-Trump. It doesn't break down into easy political motivations. Many of the young people that I have talked to who are like…locked into these worlds, they think that's absurd, rooting for one party or another. You're a dupe or a fool if you care about that stuff.

It's probably helpful to clarify what we mean by these people being “very online.” It's something very different than what a lot of us know.

Right, it's not just like scrolling Twitter a lot and being appalled by it. Just to talk about the specific people I've talked to, I got really deep into this incel Discord, where people literally were spending 18 hours or more online, sometimes they go on binges, more than 24 hours, and the computer was their whole life. They'd be popping in and out of other related Discord servers, chatting, or going on camera or just going on voice.

The server that I was particularly investigating, these guys were obsessed with not being able to get laid, feeling doomed by the way they looked or their personalities, to never get a woman to have sex with them, much less have a relationship and be a normal part of society. But, well, you could start by going outside.

A guy I interviewed in southern Florida, he lived really close to the beach. But he said he'd only been a couple times. He even said to me that one time he was standing in the water looking out at the waves at the horizon and thought, “This is beautiful, but I would like it better if it were on my computer screen.”

That's grim.

Sometimes I'll interview people, and we're talking about this person [as if they're someone] I should know, a celebrity, and I look them up and maybe it's someone with a YouTube account with 300 subscribers. And I'm like, Why am I supposed to know about this? But it has been an object of fixation within that chat room for so much time, they forget that the outside world doesn't think that way.

One of the reasons this meme world talk has blown up is that policymakers and normal people are wondering, How big is this world? How big is this threat? Is it poisoning the minds of young people? How do we understand the scale of it all?

Well, one way to think of it is like Gen Z and Gen Alpha, for them, the internet is the mainstream media, right? It's not like maybe we watch the Emmys and we're checking Twitter on the side as old millennials. But their main stuff is TikTok, Discord, for whatever they're into.

Does that mean we can expect more of this element of absurdism, deeply layered irony in future violent extremists or shooters or gunmen? Will that be the case because of how widespread this online culture seems to be? 

It kind of depends on the subculture. I did a lot of reporting on accelerationists who are trying to accelerate the collapse of society because they think it's irredeemable. So what comes after will be something valuable, a golden age, something better than what we have now. The people I interviewed, that's how they give themselves permission to do bad things. “I'm bringing down this corrupt society.” So all of that is permitted.

So this isn't something that we should expect to not happen again.

Of course, there will still be people who believe in regular stuff, you know? But it is a very large contingent of online culture.

So what do we do to stop this, to combat this? Is it about isolation and loneliness? Is it about regulating online time?

You can look visually at what a lot of the memes communicate. There are a lot of depictions of lonely men who are sad, standing in the middle of a ruined society, some kind of grim atmosphere, and I think that does speak to the way people are feeling. And also like, a lot of kids who spent their critical years locked up during Covid, and it wasn't good for their brain. I mean, even in regular life, post-Covid, I've talked to a lot of people who feel this way, like the work happy hour is more awkward than it used to be, than it was before Covid when people retreated from the world.

Once you stop forcing yourself to confront social anxiety, it gets bigger and bigger and I think that leads to a lot of alienation. There's a nihilistic blackmail cult called 764, the FBI is investigating it, but they look for kids in these online spaces, convince them to send them nudes, and then blackmail these children into doing horrible things, like killing their own pets.

I'm a parent of a toddler. I just want to be like a crazy fundamentalist about my kid not going on the internet. That can be the adversity you have to overcome — a crazy mom who saw an incel shit his pants on purpose in front of her just to troll her. Like, sorry dude, you're just not going on the internet or you're not getting unfettered access to a phone until you're…I don't know, 35?

This is really grim.

Do you want some hope?

Yeah.

So I have these incels I first interviewed in 2018, I thought doing a story on them, maybe they would see that they're not so hopeless if they just went outside and joined society. They were still chatting me from it four years later, but I just reached out to them during this to ask, “What's your take?” And they've left. They rejoined, they have jobs, they go outside.

Some people that I thought were in like the blackest possible space have left, so it is possible. And when I go in that old Discord server, the incel one, I was scrolling up through it, all the chats were from deleted user, deleted user, deleted user. “Deleted user” being — their accounts are gone.

The do's and don'ts of asking an AI for health advice.

An artist in Germany who liked to draw outdoors showed up at the hospital with a bug bite and a host of symptoms that doctors couldn't quite connect. After a month and several unsuccessful treatments, the patient started plugging his medical history into ChatGPT, which offered a diagnosis: tularemia, also known as rabbit fever. The chatbot was correct, and the case was later written up in a peer-reviewed medical study.

Around the same time, another study described a man who appeared at a hospital in the United States with signs of psychosis, paranoid that his neighbor had been poisoning him. It turns out, the patient had asked ChatGPT for alternatives to sodium chloride, or table salt. The chatbot suggested sodium bromide, which is used to clean pools. He'd been eating the toxic substance for three months and, once he'd stopped, required three weeks in a psychiatric unit to stabilize.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

You're probably familiar with consulting Google for a mystery ailment. You search the internet for your symptoms, sometimes find helpful advice, and sometimes get sucked into a vortex of anxiety and dread, convinced that you've got a rare, undiagnosed form of cancer. Now, thanks to the wonder that is generative AI, you can carry out this process in more detail. Meet Dr. ChatGPT.

AI chatbots are an appealing stand-in for a human physician, especially given the ongoing doctor shortage as well as the broader barriers to accessing health care in the United States. 

ChatGPT is not a doctor in the same way that Google is not a doctor. Searching for medical information on either platform is just as likely to lead you to the wrong conclusion as it is to point toward the correct diagnosis. Unlike Google search, however, which simply points users to information, ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) invite people to have a conversation about it. They're designed to be approachable, engaging, and always available. This makes AI chatbots an appealing stand-in for a human physician, especially given the ongoing doctor shortage as well as the broader barriers to accessing health care in the United States.

As the rabbit fever anecdote shows, these tools can also ingest all kinds of data and, having been trained on reams of medical journals, sometimes arrive at expert-level conclusions that doctors missed. Or it might give you really terrible medical advice.

There's a difference between asking a chatbot for medical advice and talking to it about your health in general. Done right, talking to ChatGPT could lead to better conversations with your doctor and better care. Just don't let the AI talk you into eating pool cleaner.

Plenty of people are talking to ChatGPT about their health. About one in six adults in the United States say they use AI chatbots for medical advice on a monthly basis, according to a 2024 KFF poll. A majority of them aren't confident in the accuracy of the information the bots provide — and frankly, that level of skepticism is appropriate given the stubborn tendency for LLMs to hallucinate and the potential for bad health information to cause harm. The real challenge for the average user is knowing how to distinguish between fact and fabrication.

“Honestly, I think people need to be very careful about using it for any medical purpose, especially if they don't have the expertise around knowing what's true and what's not,” said Dr. Roxana Daneshjou, a professor and AI researcher at the Stanford School of Medicine. “When it's correct, it does a pretty good job, but when it's incorrect, it can be pretty catastrophic.”

Chatbots also have a tendency to be sycophantic, or eager to please, which means they might steer you in the wrong direction if they think that's what you want.

The situation is precarious enough, Daneshjou added, that she encourages patients to go instead to Dr. Google, which serves up trusted sources. The search giant has been collaborating with experts from the Mayo Clinic and Harvard Medical School for a decade to present verified information about conditions and symptoms after the rise of something called “cyberchondria,” or health anxiety enabled by the internet.

This condition is much older than Google, actually. People have been searching for answers to their health questions since the Usenet days of the 1980s, and by the mid-2000s, eight in 10 people were using the internet to search for health information. Now, regardless of their reliability, chatbots are poised to receive more and more of these queries. Google even puts its problematic AI-generated results for medical questions above the vetted results from its symptom checker.

If you've got a list of things to ask your doctor about, ChatGPT could help you craft questions.

But if you skip the symptom checking side of things, tools like ChatGPT can be really helpful if you just want to learn more about what's going on with your health based on what your doctor's already told you or to gain a better understanding of their jargony notes. Chatbots are designed to be conversational, and they're good at it. If you've got a list of things to ask your doctor about, ChatGPT could help you craft questions. If you've gotten some test results and need to make a decision with your doctor about the best next steps, you can rehearse that with a chatbot without actually asking the AI for any advice.

In fact, when it comes to just talking, there's some evidence that ChatGPT is better at it. One study from 2023 compared real physician answers to health questions from a Reddit forum to AI-generated responses when a chatbot was prompted with the same questions. Health care professionals then evaluated all of the responses and found that the chatbot-generated ones were both higher quality and more empathetic. This is not the same thing as a doctor being in the same room as a patient, discussing their health. Now is a good time to point out that, on average, patients get just 18 minutes with their primary care doctor on any given visit. If you go just once a year, that's not very much time to talk to a doctor.

You should be aware that, unlike your human doctor, ChatGPT is not HIPAA-compliant. Chatbots generally have very few privacy protections. That means you should expect any health information you upload will get stored in the AI's memory and be used to train large language models in the future. It's also theoretically possible that your data could end up being included in an output for someone else's prompt. There are more private ways to use chatbots, but still, the hallucination problem and the potential for catastrophe exist.

Even if you're not using AI to figure out medical mysteries, there's a chance your doctor is. According to a 2025 Elsevier report, about half of clinicians said they'd used an AI tool for work and slightly more said these tools save them time, and one in five say they've used AI for a second opinion on a complex case. This doesn't necessarily mean your doctor is asking ChatGPT to figure out what your symptoms mean.

Doctors have been using AI-powered tools to help with everything from diagnosing patients to taking notes since well before ChatGPT even existed. These include clinical decision support systems built specifically for doctors, which currently outperform off-the-shelf chatbots — although the chatbots can actually augment the existing tools. A 2023 study found that doctors working with ChatGPT performed only slightly better at diagnosing test cases than those working independently. Interestingly, ChatGPT alone performed the best.

That study made headlines, probably for the suggestion that AI chatbots are better than doctors at diagnosis. One of its co-authors, Dr. Adam Rodman, suggests that this wouldn't necessarily be the case if doctors would be more open to listening to ChatGPT rather than assuming the chatbots were wrong when the doctor disagreed with their conclusions. Sure, the AI can hallucinate, but it can also spot connections that humans may have missed. Again, look at the rabbit fever case.

“Patients need to talk to their doctors about their LLM use, and honestly, doctors should talk to their patients about their LLM use.”

“The average doctor has a sense of when something is hallucinating or going off the rails,” said Rodman, a hospitalist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and instructor at Harvard Medical School. “I don't know that the average patient necessarily does.”

Nevertheless, in the near term, you shouldn't expect to see Dr. ChatGPT making an appearance at your local clinic. You're more likely to see AI working as a scribe, saving your doctor time taking notes and possibly, one day, analyzing that data to help your doctor. Your doctor might use AI to help draft messages to patients more quickly. In the near future, as AI tools get better, it's possible that more clinicians use AI for diagnosis and second opinions. That still doesn't mean you should rush to ChatGPT with your urgent medical concerns. If you do, tell your doctor about how that went.

“Patients need to talk to their doctors about their LLM use, and honestly, doctors should talk to their patients about their LLM use,” said Rodman. “If we just both step kind of out of the shadow world and talk to each other, we'll have more productive conversations.”

Trump's most brazen attack on free speech yet.

Fearless journalism needs your support now more than ever. Become a Vox Member to support our work today.

Let's be clear about what just happened: Jimmy Kimmel, a prominent late-night comedian, was just taken off the airwaves because the Trump administration didn't like what he had to say — and threatened his employer until they shut him up.

The Trump administration, it appears, has learned to effectively weaponize the regulatory powers of the federal government to punish speech it doesn't like from people it doesn't like. This is a favored weapon of modern autocrats; its deployment against Kimmel is a qualitative escalation even above the administration's previous acts of censorship (like targeting the author of a pro-Palestine op-ed for deportation).

What just happened, in short, shows how far down the authoritarian road the United States has traveled in just eight months.

Kimmel's downfall began with some admittedly ill-advised speculation in Monday's monologue: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

At the time, the evidence suggested the shooter very likely was not a MAGA believer (and evidence released the next day showed that he almost certainly was on the political left).

But Kimmel's aside — in a monologue mostly focused on mocking President Donald Trump — did not justify what came next. During a Wednesday podcast appearance, FCC head Brendan Carr threatened to revoke the broadcasting licenses of any stations that continued to air Kimmel's content.

“It's time for them to step and say this garbage…isn't something that we think serves the needs of our local communities,” he said.

Carr's threat should have been toothless. The FCC is prohibited by law from employing “the power of censorship” or interfering “with the right of free speech.” There is a very narrow and rarely used exception for “news distortion,” in which a broadcast news outlet knowingly airs false reports. What Kimmel did — an offhand comment based on weak evidence — is extremely different from creating a news report with the intent to deceive.

But months before the shooting, Carr had begun investigating complaints under this exception against ABC and CBS stations, specifically allegations of anti-conservative bias. Stations had to take Carr's threat seriously — even though Carr himself had declared (in a 2024 tweet) that “the First Amendment prohibits government officials from coercing private parties into suppressing protected speech.”

Hours after Carr's Wednesday threat, Nexstar — the largest owner of local stations in America — suddenly decided that Kimmel's comments from two nights ago were unacceptable. Nexstar, it should be noted, is currently attempting to purchase one of its major rivals for $6.2 billion — a merger that would require express FCC approval.

“Mr. Kimmel's comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse,” Andrew Alford, the president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said in a statement. “Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time.”

Without access to Nexstar's roughly 200 stations — covering about 39 percent of the national market, the maximally allowed cap — Kimmel would suffer an enormous ratings blow. And so, shortly after Nexstar's announcement, ABC/Disney announced that he'd be suspended indefinitely.

Trump has had it in for Jimmy Kimmel, a prominent critic, for a very long time. After CBS axed fellow late-night Trump critic Stephen Colbert earlier this year, the president repeatedly said that Kimmel was “next.” Kimmel's Kirk comments, which both an FCC commissioner and (reportedly) ABC executives considered well within bounds, seem like a pretext — taking advantage of the pervasive climate of fear and censorship in the wake of Kirk's death to punish a prominent name on the president's enemies list.

The weaponization of seemingly neutral “good government” rules, like broadcast regulation, to punish the enemies of the current president is a familiar turn in the story of democratic backsliding. It was one of the principal tools used by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to batter his country's press into submission, ultimately forcing independent outlets to sell to government-aligned conglomerates who transformed their editorial stance.

It would take quite a bit more work for Trump to consolidate Orbán-levels of control over the media. But what's so striking about the Kimmel case is how swiftly Nexstar (and ABC) rolled over. They didn't even try to put up a fight to defend their own ability to control what goes on their airwaves. They instead apparently decided that fighting the government is costly and risky, putting licenses or even a valuable merger at risk, and that risking that isn't worth it for Jimmy Kimmel.

This is what it looks like when a society's elite rolls over in the face of authoritarianism. It never ends well.

The key is to think like a kid.

You might not consider yourself a creative person anymore, but you almost certainly were at one point. Among childhood's many blessings is the freedom to play and create; art class, recess, and music lessons offer outlets for unbridled imagination and expressiveness. But somewhere along the way, play and creation become uncool, something only little kids do, according to Cas Holman, a toy designer and author of Playful: How Play Shifts Our Thinking, Inspires Connection, and Sparks Creativity. So we stop. We focus on activities we excel in or could make us money instead of ones we enjoy simply for the sake of doing them.

As grown-up responsibilities mount, what limited free time remains might not be dedicated to creative pursuits but to rest, entertainment, doomscrolling. But for all the overwhelm in the world, you might have an itch for a more tactile, creative outlet — one that takes you away from the news, screens, and chaos, and puts you in touch with your more playful side.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Not only are these activities enjoyable, but infusing more creativity into your free time might also make you more creative in other domains, too. The unstructured and exploratory thinking fostered by a hobby can bleed into other areas of your life, says Zorana Ivcevic Pringle, a senior research scientist at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and author of The Creativity Choice: The Science of Making Decisions to Turn Ideas Into Action. Indulging in that creative curiosity at work, for instance, might breed breakthroughs there, too.

Even if you think the creative part of you is long dormant, it's possible to foster your more imaginative side. “That play instinct is still there,” Holman says. “We all became who we are through play, and we can still connect to that play from childhood. But also, there is a play inside of us that has evolved with us and will look and feel different than the play did when we were children.” If you've been wanting to start some sort of creative practice but have felt stymied, here are three simple tips to help you get started and sustain your new habits.

Perhaps the greatest threat to any new or reignited creative habit is waning motivation. At the onset of a new venture, motivation is high, but it tapers over time. But doing something you genuinely like (or used to like) makes it more likely you'll stick with it. “Whatever makes something more fun for you tends to make you more motivated to keep doing it,” says Katy Milkman, Wharton professor and author of How to Change: The Science of Getting From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be. “The broad thing we can say from research is, is it fun and alluring, and does it have a hook for you personally? That's different for every person.”

It can be helpful to remember how you used to play as a kid and try to replicate those feelings, if not the exact scenarios, in adulthood, Holman says. Maybe you sang in your school choir growing up. You don't need to go as far as joining a local a cappella group, but you could make it a point to sing unabashedly in the shower, car, or at karaoke.

Pay attention to the feelings of joy or pleasure, Pringle says. By doing so, you can collect more evidence for why creativity and playfulness are worth prioritizing, giving you more of a reason to continue. For example, drawing has been shown to reduce feelings of sadness and anger. “You can notice, ‘This is doing something for me emotionally,'” Pringle says.

You don't need to go as far as joining a local a capella group, but you could make it a point to sing unabashedly in the shower, car, or at karaoke. 

Gamifying the activity can make it more likely that you'll stick with it, especially if this is an activity you enjoy, Milkman says. Whether that's keeping up your streak on Duolingo, organizing a personal 30-day knitting challenge, or giving yourself a little treat every time you journal, anything that encourages continued behavior helps the habit stick.

When life inevitably gets hectic and you feel short on time, remind yourself that you're making space for this endeavor because it's important to you. “Start with that sense of identity,” Pringle says. “We do those things that are important to who we are as a person. If you realize that, then you can start saying, ‘Well, how am I going to make the time?' But the first step is being rooted in that sense of what is important to you as a human.”

Parents or people who work multiple jobs might not have the luxury of unscheduled hours to devote to extensive creative hobbies. But even the most strapped for time can imbue playfulness in the smaller moments. Notice the people around you on your commute or at the grocery store and try to imagine elaborate backstories for them. In the moments after you've finished dinner but before you start the dishes, pull out some scrap paper and doodle. “It doesn't have to have that much pressure,” Holman says. “It's not about the outcome. It's about sitting for a moment and doodling and playing with the colors and trying to make some stripes.”

If you are resuming an old hobby from your past, don't get hung up on technical proficiency, or lack thereof. It can feel demoralizing to pick up your guitar after many years and realize you're rustier than you remembered. “It can undermine people's confidence instead of building it,” Pringle says.

Confidence is crucial when maintaining creative hobbies, Pringle continues, and it comes from making progress, which only builds more confidence. So don't try to talk yourself out of creating just because you're struggling or your output is less than stellar. While you probably will improve over time, the true benefit comes from the act itself, not the outcome, Holman says. Ask yourself what success actually looks like. Do you need to bake a patisserie-worthy cake or can you throw a bunch of ingredients together and feel satisfied that you actually made something from scratch?

In today's hustle culture, many are enticed to turn their hobbies into money-making ventures. Aside from the obvious motivation — to earn more cash — the impulse to monetize hobbies comes from a desire to share your work, Holman says. Instead of opening an Etsy shop and slapping a price tag on your doodles, you could write a note on them and mail them to friends and family to satisfy that urge.

Leveraging hobbies as side hustles can actually hamstring creativity, Pringle says. Creating in order to turn a profit “puts the pressure of productivity on you,” Pringle says. When you're only thinking about how to make more to sell more, you close yourself off to creative exploration: There's no room for meandering when money is on the line. “We are not willing to do something just for the heck of it. We are not willing to do something although we don't know where it's going to lead,” Pringle says. “All of those things are absolutely necessary for creativity. If you know at every moment what you are doing, you are not doing creative work.”

Leveraging hobbies as side hustles can actually hamstring creativity, Pringle says.

To invite creativity into your life, you need fewer constraints and rules — not more. Try to free yourself from what you believe you “should” be doing or the “right” way to play.

“Play isn't a thing to be good at. This isn't another thing you have to master, another badge,” Holman says. “Play can be in everything you do, and actually will make you feel better about everything else, because you'll be yourself in it.”

The cheapest way to stop animal cruelty, explained.

According to a new commentary paper in the journal Nature Food, some of the worst animal suffering in the world can be prevented at a rate of just a couple of pennies per hour: the extreme pain experienced by chickens raised for meat.

Over the last 75 years, chickens have been bred to grow incredibly large and incredibly fast. Their rapid growth rate has made chicken the most affordable and plentiful meat in the US, where over 9 billion are raised and slaughtered annually.

But it's come at the cost of making chickens suffer terribly throughout their short lives from a range of health and welfare issues, like heat stress, heart failure, and lameness — difficulty walking — which can be so severe that chickens die of dehydration or starvation because they can't even stand and move to get water and food.

It's arguably the largest form of systematized animal cruelty humans have ever invented.

Despite the scale and cruelty of conventional chicken farming — and other forms of livestock production — animal welfare has largely been left out of food policy discussions. The nonprofit Welfare Footprint Institute, composed of a team of animal welfare researchers that led the Nature Food paper, is looking to change that by putting a cost on preventing animal pain.

The group looks at how animals are bred, the conditions in which they're raised, and the prevalence and frequency of problems like injury and disease in those systems to determine how many hours of certain types of pain they experience. Scientific research on animal welfare — using behavioral observations, neurophysiological markers, and response to pain-relieving drugs — informs WFI's work, and the group's population-level estimates try to account for differences in individual animals' experiences.

According to their research, the average factory-farmed chicken experiences:

That's about 700 hours of pain. Considering that chickens raised for meat only live for around 1,100 hours, or 45 days, and sleep for a sizable portion of that, they experience some level of pain for much of their waking life. These painful hours represent a kind of “welfare footprint,” the authors argue.

“As consumers, producers, policy-makers, investors and advocates, we are able to easily find out the prices of products, and we now also have carbon footprints to understand environmental impacts,” Kate Hartcher, a senior researcher with WFI and a co-author of the paper, told me over email. “So, why not have the same for animals?”

One simple change, Hartcher and her co-authors argue, can improve the welfare footprint of chicken meat for mere pennies: switching to slower-growing chicken breeds.

For the last decade, animal welfare groups have campaigned for meat producers and major food brands to adopt what they call the Better Chicken Commitment, a slate of reforms including using slower-growing chicken breeds, which are known to have lower rates of lameness, heart and lung disease, heat stress, and other issues. It also calls for other changes, like giving chickens more space and using a more humane slaughter method.

According to the Welfare Footprint Institute, chickens raised according to these standards suffer about 33 fewer hours of disabling and excruciating pain compared to conventional fast-growing chickens. Poultry companies have resisted calls to switch to slower-growing chicken breeds because they cost more to raise, taking about two weeks longer to reach their lower slaughter weight.

But, according to the Welfare Footprint Institute's new paper, which was written in conjunction with researchers from the Stockholm Environment Institute and the University of Colorado Boulder, the cost is minuscule in terms of how much it costs to prevent pain. Switching to slower-growing breeds, according to their analysis, would prevent at least 15 to 100 hours of disabling and excruciating pain at a rate of 45 cents per pound for producers. (And even that range is a very conservative estimate, Hartcher told me, because it doesn't account for all of the many serious welfare problems on chicken factory farms.)

Put in other words, an hour of these intense forms of pain could be averted at a rate of just half a cent to three cents.

In 2019, agricultural economists estimated that slower-growing breeds raise production costs by 11 percent to 26 percent and increase wholesale chicken prices by 10 to 36 cents per pound. The switch could moderately raise the price of chicken for consumers but, Hartcher said, “instead of focusing on the ‘costs' of improving animal welfare, we show that the cost of preventing pain is tiny, and the benefits are enormous.”

The National Chicken Council, the industry's leading trade group, however, has argued against using slower-growing breeds — not just on economic grounds, but also on environmental ones. To meet current chicken demand with smaller, slower-growing breeds, the NCC says, the US industry would need to raise a lot more birds — an additional 4.5 billion or so per year, an approximately 50 percent increase. That also means using more land, pesticides, and fertilizer to grow chicken feed, all of which contribute to climate change.

This is generally true, even if the National Chicken Council is far from an authority on environmental sustainability (the poultry industry is a major air and water polluter). The National Chicken Council didn't respond to a request for comment on the Nature Food paper.

Exactly how much slower-growing breeds increase greenhouse gas emissions is unclear and can vary depending on the specific breed, feed sourcing, and farming practices. A 2022 study found a 16 percent emissions increase, while a 2022 trial by poultry giant Perdue Farms found a 9 percent to 13.4 percent increase. According to a European chicken industry group, using slower-growing breeds when paired with other welfare reforms increases the climate footprint of chicken meat by 24 percent.

Whatever the exact environmental difference, arguing against treating animals better because it would marginally raise climate emissions implies a disturbing position: That raising animals who've been bred to suffer terribly is permissible so long as it's better for the climate. In surveys, consumers say they care similarly or even more about animal welfare than sustainability.

However, this logic has proven persuasive to influential policymakers, environmental researchers, and some environmental groups. In 2023, when the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization published a road map on how the world can feed a growing population without blowing past climate targets, it wrote that the livestock sector “requires intensified productivity via improved genetics” — in other words, using breeds that make animals grow bigger and faster, and suffer more.

But Hartcher said her and her coauthors' analysis challenges the notion “that the intensification of animal production, including faster growth rates, can be justified by environmental considerations alone, given the disproportionate and severe animal welfare harms and only minimal variations in environmental indicators.”

The switch to slower-growing chickens does, however, present a different dilemma for animal advocates: Is it better to farm fewer chickens who are all suffering a lot, or more chickens who are each suffering somewhat less?

Ultimately, most animal advocates — and some environmentalists, too — try to square the tensions in these trade-offs by recommending that we eat less meat overall and treat each animal better, an approach sometimes called “less but better.”

“Almost in all of these cases, you're never going to land on the optimal thing,” Cleo Verkuijl, a senior scientist at the US branch of the Stockholm Environment Institute and a co-author of the Nature Food paper, told me. But now businesses and policymakers can at least account for animal suffering rather than ignore it, and make more reasoned — and hopefully, more humane — decisions.

Mark Zuckerberg's Meta AI glasses demo went wrong live onstage — twice.

On Wednesday, the CEO took to the stage at the company's annual Meta Connect event to reveal the second-generation Meta Ray-Bans, a neural wristband, Meta Ray-Bans Display with heads-up display, and sports-centered glasses with Oakley.

To drive his point home that AI should serve people and not just ""sit in a data center,"" Zuckerberg connected food content creator Jack Mancuso to the big screen for a live demo on how the newly upgraded Ray Ban Meta glasses could help Mancuso cook — and that is when things began to get awkward.

Mancuso asked the glasses with voice control to show him how to mix a ""Korean-inspired steak sauce"" for his steak sandwich, but instead of starting with the basics, the AI responded that he should use soy sauce and sesame oil. Mancuso pressed the question of what he should do first multiple times, but the AI ignored his inquiries and moved on with its instructions.

""You've already combined the base ingredients, so now grate the pear and gently combine it with the base sauce,"" the AI repeated twice.

Mancuso handed the stage back to Zuckerberg and chalked the incident up to a ""messed-up"" WiFi, and the audience gave an encouraging cheer.

""The irony of the whole thing is that you spend years making technology and then the WiFi at the day catches you,"" Zuckerberg said before moving on.

The second live demo glitch was not long after he revealed the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses alongside a neural wristband, and called it ""one of those special moments.""

The Ray-Ban Display is the newest addition to Meta's smart glasses lineup. Not only does it have voice assist and camera features like the Meta Ray-Bans, which have been out for two years, the Meta Ray-Ban Display also has a heads-up display, or HUD, that appears on the right side of the glasses to deliver notifications and navigation prompts without requiring users to look down at a phone.

During the live demo of the Meta Ray-Ban Display, Zuckerberg used the wristband to type messages to Andrew Bosworth, Meta's chief technology officer.

But the demo had a hiccup when Zuckerberg suggested that Bosworth give him a video call. The CEO repeated hand motions with the wristband in attempts to pick up the calls, but none worked, before Bosworth came to the rescue in person.

""This WiFi is brutal,"" said Bosworth.

""Yeah, I don't know,"" Zuckerberg responded. ""We'll debug that later. You practice these things like 100 times, and then, you never know what's going to happen.""

""I promise you no one is more upset about this than I am, because this is my team that now has to go debug why this didn't work on the stage,"" Bosworth added.

An editor at Business Insider noted that WiFi at large conferences is often spotty. Business Insider reached out to Meta for more information.

Meta shares saw moderate gains of half a percentage point after the demonstrations, and the demo glitches did not seem to lower audience morale. To put it in Bosworth's words, ""this is how we know it's live.""

President Donald Trump on Wednesday celebrated the news that ABC was pulling ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" off the air for comments the host made following Charlie Kirk's death — and he wants other late-night hosts to be next.

""Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. ""Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT.""

Trump appeared to be referencing the NBC late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.

The White House and a representative for NBC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump also referred to Stephen Colbert, whose late-night show on CBS was canceled in July. CBS said the cancellation was ""purely a financial decision.""

ABC, which is owned by Disney, confirmed to Business Insider earlier on Wednesday that it was pulling Kimmel off the air indefinitely. The decision came after the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, publicly condemned Kimmel's comments about Kirk, and after Nexstar, which owns ABC affiliate stations, said it would be pulling Kimmel.

Sinclair, which also owns ABC affiliate stations, said in a post on X that it had also informed ABC it would be pulling Kimmel.

The cancellation followed comments the late-night host made on Monday's episode of ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""

""We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them,"" Kimmel said.

Democratic lawmakers were swift to condemn the cancellation on social media.

""Everybody across the political spectrum should be speaking out to stop what's happening to Jimmy Kimmel,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer wrote. Sens. Ed Markey and Adam Schiff also expressed outrage at the suspension.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","ABC suspends Jimmy Kimmel's show 'indefinitely' over his Charlie Kirk comments after FCC chair's threats","https://www.businessinsider.com/abc-pulls-jimmy-kimmel-off-the-air-indefinitely-2025-9","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:36:00 GMT","

ABC said it pulled Jimmy Kimmel off the air ""indefinitely"" over his comments about Charlie Kirk's killing, in a move that raised questions about how far is too far for a comedian in 2025.

The suspension is the latest example of a company taking action against an employee following comments that were critical of the circumstances around the conservative activist's killing. Hours earlier, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission had slammed Kimmel's remarks and threatened ABC.

On Monday's show, Kimmel made pointed remarks about President Donald Trump and Kirk's killing.

""We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them,"" Kimmel said.

According to charging documents cited by CNN, the alleged killer's mother said he ""had started to lean more to the left — becoming more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented.""

Kimmel also mocked Trump's response to a reporter's question about how he was holding up after Kirk's death. During Trump's answer, the president quickly pivoted to talking about the construction of the White House's new ballroom.

""This is not how an adult grieves the murder of somebody he called a friend,"" Kimmel said on his Monday show. ""This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.""

Kimmel hosts ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!,"" which premiered in 2003. Until this suspension, he was the longest-serving late-night host currently on the air. He's hosted the Primetime Emmy and Academy Awards multiple times.

Disney-owned ABC's decision came after pressure from both the FCC and a prominent company that owns ABC affiliate stations, Nexstar. Affiliate stations carry ABC programming under contract but aren't owned by the network itself.

FCC chair Brendan Carr publicly condemned Kimmel's comments, calling them ""the sickest conduct possible."" In an interview with YouTuber Benny Johnson, Carr also warned that affiliate licenses could come under review, and that broadcasters are required to operate ""in the public interest.""

Nexstar subsequently issued a statement saying it would pull Kimmel from the ABC stations it owned, citing his Kirk comments.

""I want to thank Nexstar for doing the right thing,"" Carr said in a statement to Business Insider after the news that ABC had pulled the show. ""Local broadcasters have an obligation to serve the public interest. While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community values. I hope that other broadcasters follow Nexstar's lead.""

Some context: Nexstar is seeking FCC approval for its $6.2 billion mega deal to acquire TEGNA. The deal would include 13 ABC stations and make Nexstar by far the country's biggest local TV station owner. The FCC would have to raise the 39% ownership cap to let the deal advance.

Sinclair, another major company that owns ABC affiliate stations, said it would not lift the suspension of Kimmel's show on its networks ""until formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability."" It also called on Kimmel to issue a direct apology to the Kirk family, and make a ""meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA.""

The pressure campaign that preceded Kimmel's suspension highlights the government's considerable power to regulate broadcast networks like ABC, as opposed to cable TV and streaming platforms.

Trump cheered the news of the suspension on Truth Social:

The suspension is the latest twist in the culture wars following Kirk's death. Voices on the right have decried certain reactions to Kirk's killing as heartless and horrifying, and others have said such contentions themselves are a form of speech suppression. Meanwhile, defenders of such comments say people on the right who once criticized cancel culture are practicing it.

Some in Hollywood spoke out in support of Kimmel on social media.

The Writers Guild of America West and East said it stood with Kimmel and his writers and against those who oppose free speech. ""Shame on those in government who forget this founding truth. As for our employers, our words have made you rich. Silencing us impoverishes the whole world.""

""This isn't right,"" Ben Stiller wrote.

""This is the actual cancel culture everyone claims to hate so much,"" Alex Edelman of ""The Paper"" wrote.

Several Democratic lawmakers did the same.

""Everybody across the political spectrum should be speaking out to stop what's happening to Jimmy Kimmel,"" Senator Chuck Schumer wrote. Senators Ed Markey and Adam Schiff similarly supported the comedian and expressed outrage at the suspension.

Kimmel's suspension comes a few months after the controversy around the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's late-night show in July. At the time, CBS executives said the move was ""purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night."" Some lawmakers raised concerns that the cancellation could have had a political motivation, noting Colbert had just called out CBS's parent, Paramount, for settling Trump's lawsuit over ""60 Minutes"" for $16 million. Paramount won the FCC's approval to merge with Skydance later that month.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I tried Mark Zuckerberg's new $800 Ray-Bans. They're impressive.","https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-lens-screen-photos-cost-review-2025-9","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:20:00 GMT","

Mark Zuckerberg has figured out a way to get a phone on your face — by shrinking it down and cramming it into a pair of glasses.

Does that sound good to you?

If so, you'll be able to buy a pair in two weeks. They'll cost at least $800.

I've gotten a brief test-drive with Meta's new Ray-Ban Display Glasses. They're fun because they're the kind of thing you've seen and read about in science fiction forever. Except now they're real, and they work.

I'm also not sure how I would use them in real life after the novelty wears off. But I'm reasonably confident some people will be really into them.

And while Meta is pitching this as something that you, a consumer, will want to buy, I think we're most likely to see this kind of tech worn by workers whose bosses require it. Think about cops, soldiers, factory workers, or anyone whose job makes it difficult for them to look down at their phone to get information they need.

Back to the big picture: These new glasses are yet another attempt by the world's biggest companies to get you to wear tech on your face.

So far, none of them have really panned out. There appears to be a modest market for people who want virtual or augmented reality goggles for games, but that's about it. And the list of face-computer flops goes back to Google Glass in 2012, and extends to the Apple Vision Pro in 2024.

For context: Meta considers its original Ray-Bans a surprise success, and they've sold… a couple million of them. Apple sells more than 200 million iPhones a year.

Earlier this year, Zuckerberg made a point of putting out an Apple-like goal for this kind of tech, telling investors that ""This will be a defining year that determines if we're on a path towards many hundreds of millions, and eventually billions of AI glasses.""

I don't think Meta thinks that's happening with these glasses in the near future, but they're going to keep at it. So are its competitors: Earlier this year, for instance, Google announced a line of new headsets that includes something very similar to what Meta is now selling — but hasn't put a price or on-sale date out yet.

Back to Zuckerberg's new Ray-Bans, which I very much encourage you to test-drive, just to see what's possible to jam into glasses right now. The neural wristband, which lets you control images on your screen with a ""Minority Report""-like interface, is particularly impressive.

Meta people swear they'll use these things in everyday life, all the time. But Meta people say the same thing about their first line of Ray-Bans, and the only time I've seen people wearing these outside a Meta building is … when I've seen Meta people outside a Meta building.

I think the place I'd most likely want to use these, for real, would be if I'm traveling and want the information my phone can supply without looking at my phone. The map feature — for pedestrian use only — seems very cool. So does the ability for the glasses to translate Spanish, French, and Italian in real time.

And there are also some features here that I probably wouldn't use, but can see other people wanting to, like the ability to make video calls. Or to provide real-time closed captioning that lets you understand what someone is saying to you in a noisy room, even if you have trouble hearing them yourself.

The con side starts with the price, which is what Apple charges for its lowest-priced iPhone 17. That's a lot for a device that you'll use along with, but not instead of, a smartphone. Of course, I'm assuming this stuff will get cheaper over time.

Then there's the comfort and aesthetics of the device: These look like chunky Ray-Bans, and I'm led to believe chunky glasses are in fashion now. I think some people will carry the look off really well — but the rest of us will look like people wearing tech on our faces.

And while these glasses are way more comfortable than wearing goggles on your face, they're still heavier than regular glasses, and you can feel that weight while you're wearing them. (Meta says the new glasses weigh 69 grams, which is around 3 times what a normal pair of glasses weighs — and maybe 1.5 times more than a pair of tech-free Ray-Bans might weigh.) Meta says the batteries in the glasses (which are one of the reasons they weigh more) will last six hours, but I think I might not want to wear them for that long.

Your mileage may also vary when it comes to wearing Mark Zuckerberg's tech on your face — whether that's for political reasons, or simply because you don't want to wear tech on your face. There's a burgeoning movement to get people off phones and into the real world, but I don't know that moving the phone from your pocket to your head is what those folks have in mind.

But I also very much appreciate it when our tech overlords deliver us something that's genuinely new and intriguing. Or, like smartwatches and these glasses, something we've seen in fiction forever but never in real life. What we do next with them is (still) up to us.

The US Federal Trade Commission and seven states sued Live Nation Entertainment Inc. and its Ticketmaster subsidiary for failing to stem the use of automated ticketing bots and large-scale resale operations.

The consumer protection agency said the nation's largest ticketing platform failed to enforce its own purchase limits, which allowed resellers to buy up large numbers of passes for popular events, according to a lawsuit filed in California federal court Thursday. The agency said that Ticketmaster systematically ignored ticket brokers that bypassed its limits since it earns money from resales.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The Trump administration on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to lift lower court rulings that have blocked President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.

The request came a day after Cook participated in a meeting of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, which decided to cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point.

""This application involves yet another case of improper judicial interference with the President's removal authority — here, interference with the President's authority to remove members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for cause,"" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the Justice Department's filing Thursday at the Supreme Court.

Trump said on Aug. 25 that he was firing Cook from the seven-member Fed Board, citing allegations that she committed mortgage fraud in connection with two residences she owns.

Cook, who denies wrongdoing, sued Trump to block her removal, arguing he lacked the required legal cause to do so.

A federal district court judge in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 9 barred Trump from firing Cook as her suit plays out. The Justice Department asked a three-judge panel on the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington to stay that order, and that the panel do so before the FOMC met.

The appeals panel in a 2-1 ruling on Monday night refused that request, effectively allowing Cook to remain in her job and to participate in the FOMC deliberations.

Sauer said that the Supreme Court, for several reasons, should stay the district court judge's preliminary injunction reinstating Cook to the Fed while her suit is pending.

He said that the Justice Department is likely to prevail in the lawsuit ""because Cook lacks a Fifth Amendment property interest in her continued service as a Governor of the Federal Reserve System,"" and that her job is not protected by due process considerations.

Sauer also disputed the judge's alternative finding that Trump's rationale for firing Cook for ""cause"" is not valid because her alleged conduct occurred before she was appointed to the Fed.

""The Federal Reserve Act's broad 'for cause' provision rules out removal for no reason at all, or for policy disagreement,"" Sauer wrote.

 ""But so long as the President identifies a cause, the determination of 'some cause relating to the conduct, ability, fitness, or competence of the officer' is within the President's unreviewable discretion.""

Sauer said, ""Cook had made contradictory representations in two mortgage agreements a short time apart, claiming that both a property in Michigan and a property in Georgia would simultaneously serve as her principal residence.""

""Each mortgage agreement described the representation as material to the lender, reflecting the reality that lenders usually offer lower interest rates for principal-residence mortgages because they view such mortgages as less risky,"" Sauer wrote.

""When her apparent misconduct came to light, the President determined that Cook's 'deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter' renders her unfit to continue serving on the Federal Reserve Board, and at a minimum demonstrates 'the sort of gross negligence in financial transactions that calls into question [her] competence and trustworthiness as a financial regulator,' ""Sauer wrote.

The solicitor general also argued that the district court judge ""lacked authority to order reinstatement as an equitable remedy for the removal of an officer of the United States, as we have discussed in several recent stay applications.""

If Trump ultimately prevails in firing Cook, he would be poised to have nominated four out of the seven Fed governors.

On Tuesday, the Senate narrowly confirmed White House Council of Economic Advisors Stephen Miran as a Fed governor. Trump nominated Miran to serve the remainder of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's term, which ends Jan. 31.

Kugler unexpectedly resigned in August, without giving a reason.

Miran participated in the FOMC meeting this week.

In this article

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Thursday sued Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, over what it called ""illegal"" ticket resale tactics.

The lawsuit was filed in federal court in California. Seven states joined in the lawsuit, including Florida, Illinois and Virginia.

In the filing, the FTC wrote that the companies ""tacitly worked"" with scalpers, allowing them to ""unlawfully purchase"" tickets to increase their profits.

""[Ticketmaster and Live Nation's] illegal conduct frustrates artists' desire to maintain affordable ticket prices that fit the needs of ordinary American families, costing ordinary fans millions of dollars every year,"" the lawsuit reads.

The lawsuit alleged Ticketmaster has taken a ""bait and switch"" approach, which allows the company to alter its advertising of ticket prices to effectively lift total prices, according to the FTC. It also alleges that the company allows broker to exceed ticket limits on purpose with resale and violates the Better Online Ticket Sales Act.

The FTC alleged that Ticketmaster is effectively ""triple dipping"" by collecting fees from brokers on the primary market, brokers on the secondary market and consumers on the secondary market. The consumer protection agency said the company made $3.7 billion in resold tickets between 2019 and 2024.

The FTC said the alleged practices have caused injuries to consumers and artists on both sides of the Ticketmaster sales.

""American live entertainment is the best in the world and should be accessible to all of us,"" FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. ""It should not cost an arm and a leg to take the family to a baseball game or attend your favorite musician's show.""

According to the FTC, Ticketmaster controls roughly 80% of major concert venues' ticketing, and between 2019 and 2024, consumers spent more than $82 billion purchasing tickets on the platform.

Ticketmaster and Live Nation did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Shares of Live Nation fell roughly 2% after news of the lawsuit.

Ticketmaster is also under investigation in the U.K. over its use of ""dynamic pricing"" for ticket sales for reunion concerts from Britpop band Oasis. Dynamic pricing is a tactic used in many concert sales to reflect broader shifts in the market, justifying higher prices.

Last year, the Justice Department sued to break up Live Nation and Ticketmaster over alleged antitrust violations, claiming the company had too large a monopoly in the ticketing industry. The lawsuit followed a 2022 probe into the company after a rollout of tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour came under intense scrutiny for its botched rollout.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr said Thursday that ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel appeared to ""mislead"" the American public about facts regarding conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing in the days leading up to his show's suspension.

Carr also told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" that ""we're not done yet"" with the changes in ""the media ecosystem"" that are consequences of President Donald Trump's election last fall.

ABC on Wednesday night said it was pulling ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" off the air ""indefinitely"" because of the host's comments, which linked Kirk's alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" movement.

""The issue that arose here, where lots and lots of people were upset, was not a joke,"" Carr said Thursday on CNBC.

""It was not making fun,"" said Carr, who hours before Kimmel's show was pulled off the air suggested the FCC might take action against ABC and its parent company, Disney.

""It was appearing to directly mislead the American public about a significant fact that probably one of the most significant political events we've had in a long time, for the most significant political assassination we've seen in a long time,"" he said.

Utah court documents filed Tuesday in connection with the murder charge against Robinson say his mother told investigators, ""Over the last year or so, her son had become more political and had started to lean more to the left, becoming more pro gay and trans-rights oriented.""

Those documents also say that when Robinson was asked why he killed Kirk, ""Robinson explained there is too much evil, and [Kirk] spreads too much hate.""

A day before those documents were filed, Kimmel, in his show's opening monologue Monday, said, ""The MAGA Gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.""

Trump on Wednesday evening praised Kimmel's suspension and called on NBC to cancel its own late-night shows, ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,"" and ""Late Night with Seth Meyers.""

""Squawk the Street"" anchor Carl Quintanilla asked Carr about that on Thursday.

""I asked earlier about Fallon and Seth Meyers, but is the President's view that they should also be taken off the air, shared by the FCC?"" Quintanilla asked.

Carr replied,""I don't speak for the President, so he speaks to himself on that.""

""Our goal and our obligation here is to make sure that broadcasters are serving the public interest,"" Carr said.

""And if there's local TV stations that don't think that running that programming does it, then they have every right under the law in their contracts to pre-empt it. And we'll see how this plays out.""

""I do think that again, we are in the midst of a massive shift in dynamics in the media ecosystem for lots of reasons, again, including the permission structure that President Trump's election has provided,"" the FCC chief said.

""And I would simply say we're not done yet with seeing the consequences of that,"" he said.

CNBC anchor David Faber followed up on that.

""What does that mean when you say you're done yet?"" Faber asked. ""Then, I mean, will you only be pleased when none of these comedians have a show on broadcast television?""

Carr replied, ""No, it's not any particular show or any particular person. It's just we're in the midst of a very disruptive moment right now, and I just, frankly, expect that we're going to continue to see changes in the media ecosystem.""

Asked by anchor Jim Craker if the U.S. government should ""have someone who reviews the writers before the host says something,"" Carr said, ""No.""

Speaking in England on Thursday, Trump said Kimmel ""said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk, and Jimmy Kimmel is not a talented person.""

""He had very bad ratings, and they should have fired him a long time ago. So, you know, you can call that free speech or not,"" Trump said. ""He was fired for lack of talent.""

Kimmel has not been fired.

The president nominated Carr as FCC chair.

On Wednesday, before ABC yanked Kimmel's show, Carr called Kimmel's comments ""truly sick"" and said there was a ""strong case"" for action against ABC and Disney.

""This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way,"" Carr told right-wing commentator Benny Johnson that day. ""These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.""

""They have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest,"" Carr said.

Hours after Carr's comments were reported by Johnson, Nexstar Media Group said its stations that are affiliated with ABC would preempt Kimmel's show ""for the foreseeable future"" because of Kimmel's remarks.

Nexstar is seeking regulatory approval from the FCC for its planned $6.2 billion merger with Tegna

About 10% of ABC affiliates are owned by Nexstar.

House Democratic leaders on Thursday called for Carr's resignation, alleging that he had engaged ""in the corrupt abuse of power.""

In a statement, the Democrats accused the FCC chairman of ""bullying ABC, the employer of Jimmy Kimmel, and forcing the company to bend the knee to the Trump administration.""

Former President Barack Obama, in a post on X on Thursday, said, ""After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like.""

""This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it,"" Obama wrote.

Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC under a planned spinoff.

In this article

RACINE, Wis. — Microsoft said Thursday that it will allocate $4 billion to build a second data center in Wisconsin. The first one will come online in early 2026, with the software company spending $3.3 billion on it.

The first Wisconsin data center, in nearby Mount Pleasant, will house hundreds of thousands of Nvidia Blackwell GB200 graphics processing units that are capable of handling artificial intelligence models, Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, said at a town hall meeting.

Cloud infrastructure providers are racing to build capacity to meet the needs of companies that want to run AI models. More than 700 million people use OpenAI's ChatGPT, which draws on Microsoft's Azure cloud, and software providers from Adobe to Salesforce have been adding AI feature enhancements to woo customers.

Microsoft plans to match the amount of energy it consumes from fossil fuel sources with carbon-free energy it will contribute to the grid, said Smith, who spent part of his childhood in Mount Pleasant.

""I just want you to know we are doing everything we can, and I believe we're succeeding, in managing this issue well, so that you all don't have to pay more for electricity because of our presence,"" he said.

A solar farm that's under construction 150 miles northwest of the data centers will contribute 250 megawatts of power. The two put together might require more than 900 megawatts, Smith said.

The initial data center is built on land where Foxconn originally planned to built a manufacturing plant. It will use as much 2.8 million gallons of water per year, while Foxconn was permitted to consume over 7 million per day, Smith said.

""It will deliver 10x the performance of the world's fastest supercomputer today, enabling AI training and inference workloads at a level never before seen,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in an X post.

The second data center will be a similar scale as the first and will enter operation in 2027 or after that, Smith said.

""We did pause to think through exactly what we would build for phase two, how we would build it,"" he said.

Wisconsin will be home to the largest number of GPUs under one roof, said the state's Democratic governor, Tony Evers. 

Earlier this week, Smith told reporters that the company has allocated $15.5 billion for additional infrastructure spending in the U.K. through 2028. Separately, Amsterdam's Nebius Group said last week that Microsoft has agreed to spend up to $19.4 billion over five years to rent AI data center capacity.

The IRS and U.S. Department of the Treasury this week finalized rules for certain provisions from the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022, including catch-up contributions for 401(k) and other plans, which apply to workers age 50 and older.

Starting in 2027, catch-up contributions generally must be after tax (also called Roth), rather than pretax, for workers who made more than $145,000 from their current employer during the previous year. But some plans could make the change in 2026 ""using a reasonable, good faith interpretation of statutory provisions,"" the IRS said.

In the meantime, those investors can pick between pretax and Roth retirement catch-up contributions, assuming their workplace plans have both choices and their cash flow permits, experts say.

Here's a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business.

Lawmakers added the Roth catch-up contribution provision to Secure 2.0 as a ""pay-for"" to help fund the legislation.

Roth contributions are after-tax deposits, but the funds grow tax-free. By comparison, pretax contributions reduce your adjusted gross income upfront, but you owe regular income taxes when you withdraw the funds.

Of course, you need to consider your full financial picture when making Roth contributions since a higher AGI can impact eligibility for other deductions.

""Now is the time to work with your advisor or tax preparer to run multi-year tax projections,"" said CFP Patrick Huey, owner of Victory Independent Planning in Portland, Oregon. 

This could help you decide whether to ""accelerate"" pretax catch-up contributions through 2026 or ""embrace the transition to Roth"" sooner, he said.

For 2025, workers can defer up to $23,500 into 401(k)s, and investors age 50 and older can make an extra $7,500 in catch-up contributions. There is also a ""super catch-up"" contribution for workers aged 60 to 63, which raises the catch-up limit to $11,250.

In 2024, nearly all retirement plans offered catch-up contributions, but only 16% of eligible workers made these deferrals, according to a 2025 Vanguard report based on more than 1,400 plans and nearly 5 million participants.

Most catch-up contribution participants earned $150,000 or more, the report found.

However, the choice between Roth vs. pretax catch-up contributions may depend on several factors, including current and expected future tax brackets, experts say.

The ""key takeaway"" for investors is, ""do not sit on the sidelines"" as the rules change, said certified financial planner Jared Gagne, assistant vice president and private wealth manager with Claro Advisors in Boston.

In this article

Nvidia said it will invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a deal to co-develop data center and PC chips with the troubled chipmaker, which took on the U.S. government as an investor last month.

Nvidia is investing its stake at a price of $23.28 a share, a release from the company said. Intel shares jumped 28% to around $32 a share following news of the deal.

""This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem -- a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing,"" said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a release.

Nvidia now joins Softbank and the U.S. government in supporting Intel's turnaround.

Intel shares, which hit their lowest in more than a decade earlier this year, rebounded after finding renewed support from the Trump administration, striking a deal for the U.S. government to invest 10% in the chipmaker in August.

White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said in a statement Thursday that the partnership was a ""major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing.""

SoftBank also made a $2 billion investment with Intel in August.

The government put $8.9 billion into the chipmaker for 433.3 million shares. That stake is now worth $13.4 billion with shares at about $31.

A senior White House official said the administration was not involved with the Nvidia-Intel deal.

""What's unclear is whether this represents token cooperation intended for political purposes, or if it's the start of a wider collaboration that would more significantly benefit INTC,"" wrote Wolfe Research's Chris Caso in a note Thursday following the announcement.

Caso said the biggest question is if Nvidia will manufacture at Intel's fabs.

The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, does not appear to include the manufacturing of Nvidia chips with Intel's foundry. Huang and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan will hold a news conference on the deal at 1 p.m. ET.

Intel will build x86 central processing units for Nvidia's AI infrastructure platforms, according to the release. On the PC front, Intel will build x86 system-on-chips using Nvidia's RTX graphics processing units that will power computers.

Shares of Nvidia, which is in the middle of U.S. and China trade negotiations to get approval to sell less-advanced chips in China, were up more than 3% in morning trading.

Intel shares were pacing for their best day since October 1987, when they gained 26.4%.

Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper said the Federal Reserve could cut rates a bit more, but then risks more inflation and other dangers to the economy and markets if the central bank goes further than that.

In other words, be careful what you wish for.

""If they go too much more on interest rates, depending what happens with the economy ... it gets into the danger territory,"" Tepper said Thursday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""You've got to be careful not to make things too hot.""

His comments come after the central bank lowered interest rates by a quarter point Wednesday, the first cut this year, while signaling two more reductions are coming this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the cut as ""risk management"" rather than something more directed at shoring up a weak economy. President Donald Trump has been pressuring the chief to slash the fed funds rate quickly and aggressively.

Tepper feared that if the Fed lowers rates while inflation hasn't been fully tamed, demand can pick up faster than supply, reigniting price pressures. Meanwhile, too-easy monetary policy could potentially create asset bubbles as investors keep flocking into riskier corners of the markets.

""My view has been that one easing or two easings or even three easings don't matter because we're still in a little restrictive territory with a little bit too high inflation, even without the tariff-induced inflation. So they should be a little bit restrictive,"" Tepper said. ""Beyond that, you're really risking a lot of things, a weaker dollar, more inflation and those sort of things.""

The founder and president of Appaloosa Management noted valuations are high, but he wouldn't bet against stocks yet while the Fed is still in easing mode.

""I don't love the multiples, but how do I not own it?"" Tepper said. ""I'm not ever fighting this Fed especially when the markets tell me ... one and three quarter more cuts before the end of the year, so that's a tough thing not to own.""

The S&P 500 is trading at almost 23 times forward earnings, near the highest level since April 2021, according to FactSet. Valuations for some of the megacap tech names have become sky high. Nvidia's price-earnings ratio is at 30 times, while Microsoft trades at nearly 32 times forward earnings.

""I'm constructive because of the easing right now, but I'm also miserable because of the levels,"" he said. ""Nothing's cheap anymore.""

Tepper, also the owner of NFL team the Carolina Panthers, revealed he's been trading his Nvidia position. At the end of June, Appaloosa held about $277 million worth of the chip stock, owning it as the fund's seventh-biggest bet.

""I do own Nvidia, but I go back and forth a little bit ... trade a little bit,"" Tepper said. ""We've always had some Nvidia position, but not the same size.""

A version of this article appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.

Larry Ellison built the world's second-largest fortune by holding on to his Oracle shares over nearly five decades of ups and downs. At the same time, he's spent billions to fund his philanthropy, vast real estate holdings, sports investments and his son's fast-growing media empire.

How does he manage to spend so much while selling so little?

A close look at the Oracle chairman's finances and shareholdings reveals a fortune built on mountains of leverage and risk, allowing him to borrow against his shares and raise cash without giving up shares or control. At a time when many tech CEOs are following their wealth managers' prudent advice to ""take money off the table"" and diversify through share sale programs, Ellison represents a triumph of old-school, go-for-broke wealth creation, even at the age of 81.

""Ellison does seem to stand out,  not just for his wealth but for the sheer size of his pledged shares,"" said Michael Sury, associate professor of practice in finance and managing director for the Center for Analytics and Transformative Technologies at the University of Texas at Austin. 

According to SEC filings, Ellison owned 1.16 billion shares of Oracle stock as of July, representing 41% of the company's total outstanding shares. His individual share ownership is far and away the largest of any of the top 10 tech billionaires. Elon Musk, for instance, owns less than 20% of Tesla, while Mark Zuckerberg owns about 14% of Meta shares and Jeff Bezos' stake in Amazon is down to about 8% of shares outstanding after selling more than $18 billion worth in the past two years.

Ellison has sold Oracle shares over the years, but mostly to exercise options and pay taxes. According to Smart Insider, Ellison has net a total of $5.1 billion from selling shares – representing a fraction of his stake, now worth over $350 billion. The sales included $900 million of shares he sold in 2001, right before the stock plunged on a disappointing earnings report, which sparked an insider trading lawsuit and eventual settlement.

Oracle has also done its part to turbocharge Ellison's equity stake. According to Barron's, Oracle's share repurchase program has reduced the number of outstanding shares by 36% over the past 15 years. The drop in outstanding shares has boosted Ellison's stake from 23% of outstanding shares to 41%, even though his number of shares has remained stable.

Still, Ellison has continued to spend record sums on real estate, sports, collectibles and other assets. His personal empire includes dozens of luxury properties, the Indian Wells tennis tournament, the Hawaiian resort island of Lanai, a collection of vintage fighter jets, a 288-foot mega-yacht and the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa in Manalapan, Florida, which he bought for $277 million last year. The purchase came after he paid $173 million for the 62,200-square-foot mansion in Manalapan that marked the highest-ever sale price at the time for Florida real estate.   

Ellison has also funded a vast array of private companies. He invested in Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter, now called X, offering Musk ""a billion or whatever you recommend,"" according to a text exchange that was later made public. Ellison has also invested in several longevity and tech startups, and he co-founded global sailing league SailGP.

More recently, Ellison has emerged as a behind-the-scenes media magnate. He backed Skydance Media, run by his son David, in its purchase of Paramount for $8 billion, a merger that closed last month. Now, the Ellison family is reportedly backing Paramount's largely cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery in what could be a more than $70 billion deal. Oracle is also among the companies teaming up to buy TikTok's U.S. operations, although it's unclear whether Ellison himself would personally invest.

Ellison has also given hundreds of millions of dollars to philanthropy and made headlines last year as part of an NIL deal for University of Michigan football recruit Bryce Underwood that was reportedly worth $10 million. A signer of The Giving Pledge, Ellison posted on X in July that he will be ""concentrating his resources"" on the new Ellison Institute of Technology, a partnership with the University of Oxford to find solutions to climate change, disease and world hunger.  

To fund all that spending and still maintain his stake in Oracle, Ellison borrows heavily against his Oracle shares. According to the most recent SEC filing, Ellison has pledged 277 million shares of Oracle common stock as collateral ""to secure certain personal indebtedness."" The shares represent about a quarter of his total Oracle shares and would have a market value of more than $82 billion on Wednesday's closing price.

Most companies prevent or limit executives from borrowing against their shares to avoid a forced sale during a crisis or share decline. Oracle, however, has given its chairman and largest shareholder more leeway. Oracle's governance committee stated in an SEC filing that it ""believes that Mr. Ellison's pledging arrangements do not pose a material risk to stockholders or to Oracle in part because the pledged shares secure personal term loans only used to fund outside personal business ventures."" The board said it also believes that Ellison ""has the financial capacity to repay his personal term loans without resorting to the pledged shares.""

Sury said the size and value of Ellison's pledged shares is ""off the charts,"" and that most boards would never allow that degree of leverage because of the risks to shareholders.

""Ellison is an exception,"" Sury said. ""His wealth and influence make lenders comfortable in a way they would not be with most executives. For many other companies this level of borrowing would raise real governance concerns and likely be viewed as a red flag.""

It's unclear how much Ellison has drawn down on the loans. In a rare comment on his borrowing and spending strategy, Ellison told CNBC in 2012 that a $4 billion line of credit against his shares at the time was never drawn down but kept as potential dry powder for big purchases.

""I've got a line of credit just in case I go shopping and something catches my eye,"" he said, mentioning the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers as a potential example if they came up for sale.

Ellison's hold-and-borrow strategy stands in stark contrast to the sales of Oracle CEO Safra Catz. Catz has continued to sell the options she receives from Oracle as they vest, maintaining a small stake in the company. She exercised and sold options totaling $2.5 billion in the first half of the year, making her the largest insider seller of the year, according to Smart Insider. She sold through a so-called 10b5-1 program, which is a pre-scheduled share sale program, and missed out on the 50% run-up in Oracle stock in the months following.

Bankers and wealth advisors to tech founders and CEOs say there is no right or wrong approach to managing a large stock position in a company.

""It all depends on the person,"" said Solenn Séguillon, technology practice head at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco, who works with many top tech founders and CEOs. ""Everyone has a different comfort level in handling single-stock volatility.""

Most tech founders and CEOs, she said, are bullish on their own companies and want to hold onto their stakes as long as possible to grow their wealth. At the same time, they typically want to fund other tech ventures launched by friends or colleagues. Borrowing against their shares not only provides cash, but also potential tax benefits, since they can often deduct the interest on the loans if the proceeds are used for investments.

While some see share pledges and loans as compounding risk, Séguillon said it can be a form of diversification if the loans are used to fund outside investments.

""Borrowing to invest in a number of assets that are accretive or private companies or a more diversified portfolio can help build a hedge,"" she said. ""We discuss with our clients how to be mindful of the risks so they don't end up in a situation where they're over-levered."" 

When lending to CEOs or founders with concentrated positions, private banks and wealth management firms say they look at a client's entire balance sheet rather than just the stock position.

Kurt Niemeyer, head of Merrill Lending Solutions group, which offers complex loans to the ultra-wealthy, said a loan to a founder or CEO might include a wide range of collateral, such as real estate, art or even a yacht.

""The larger loans are more focused on the entire balance sheet,"" he said.

The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday stateside cut interest rates by a quarter point, bringing the overnight funds rate range between 4% and 4.25%. That move was fully priced in markets — so traders got what they expected.

It was a near-unanimous decision by the Fed. Only Stephen Miran, picked by U.S. President Donald Trump and confirmed to the Fed board just on Monday, dissented and voted for a half-point cut. Prior to the meeting, there was chatter that governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller — both of whom were also appointed by Trump — might advocate for a larger cut.

While Fed unity projects an image of independence, bolstering its credibility in the eyes of financial markets, the expected rate cut did little to cheer markets.

A majority of central bank officials see only one cut in 2026, far fewer than traders had been pricing in, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The dot plot also showed disparity in rate projections for next year, which means uncertainty over economic outlook. And Chair Jerome Powell characterized the cut as ""risk management,"" suggesting that the Fed was lowering rates out of caution rather than seeing it as necessary to support the labor market.

The S&P 500 edged down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.3%. Only the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose, adding 0.6%.

Markets for now have not really cheered the Fed move — awaiting Trump's calls for a 100 basis point cut to materialize?

Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points and sees two more this year. The decision, made Wednesday, was near unanimous — only newly appointed governor Stephen Miran voted for a 50-point cut. Chair Jerome Powell called it a ""risk management cut.""

China reportedly bans Nvidia chip. That's according to the Financial Times, which reported that Beijing had ordered companies not to buy Nvidia's RTX Pro 600D, which was custom-made for the country. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he was ""disappointed.""

Meta unveils first consumer-ready smart glasses. The Meta Ray-Ban glasses cost $799 and come with a built-in display, the company announced Wednesday. The digital display can be controlled by hand gestures via a wristband that detects muscle activity.

U.S. stocks traded mixed on Wednesday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose and hit an intraday high. Markets were mixed in Asia on Thursday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 adding more than 1% to hit an all-time high, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell.

UK's top fintech companies: 2025

The global fintech landscape has been shifting as investors look to countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Singapore for new opportunities. The U.K., however, remains a key hub, thanks to its vibrant financial services sector and venture capital ecosystem.

CNBC and Statista have identified the top 150 fintechs in the U.K, encompassing a diverse set of companies across seven market segments, both within London and beyond. The report builds on a global list of the top 300 fintech companies which CNBC published in partnership with Statista in July.

Novo Nordisk said Wednesday that late-stage trial results for its once-daily obesity pill showed ""significant"" weight reduction and tolerability in line with its blockbuster Wegovy injection, as drugmakers race to get an oral treatment to market.

Results from the phase 3 Oasis 4 trial showed the oral semaglutide pill led to average weight reduction of 16.6% after 64 weeks in patients with obesity or overweight and at least one weight-related comorbidity, the Danish pharmaceutical firm said.

Shares jumped 5.4% by 10:23 a.m. London time (5:23 a.m. ET). 

Dubbed the ""Wegovy pill,"" Novo Nordisk's Chief Science Officer Martin Holst Lange told CNBC that the oral treatment offered patients an important alternative to its existing once-weekly injection.

""Our job was to show that, with the tablet, we could get the same efficacy and the same safety and tolerability as we can with the injectable. That we have now done,"" Lange said by phone.

""That basically means that we can offer patients the choice between the tablet and the injectable, and that will make a difference for some patients,"" he added.

Novo Nordisk's oral treatment relies on the same Semaglutide GLP-1 medication that underpins the company's existing obesity and diabetes treatments, Wegovy and Ozempic. Wegovy was shown to reduce weight by 15% on average in patients with overweight or obesity and at least one weight-related comorbidity in an earlier Novo study.

The pill is currently under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, having been submitted under a New Drug Application in February. A decision is due in the fourth quarter of this year.

If approved, the company said the pill will be made fully in the U.S. It comes as global pharma firms have been ramping up their U.S. investments amid pressure from the Trump administration to bolster domestic production.

There are currently no approved oral versions of GLP-1s on the market, however competition is quickly heating up. Pill treatments are considered a key milestone for firms seeking to make the drugs more accessible, including to those with an aversion to needles.

Analysts told Reuters Tuesday that rival Eli Lilly's competitor obesity pill, Orforglipron, could be fast-tracked for approval within one to two months under the FDA's ""Commissioner's National Priority Voucher"" — a new initiative to further the Trump administration's drug development goals.

Lange said Novo welcomes ""good competition"" but added it was focused on drug outcomes, including long-term adoption rates.

""In this situation, we look at the data,"" Lange said. ""Semaglutide as a tablet has the potential to offer 17% body weight loss and with a good safety and tolerability profile.""

""What we've seen from our competitor is slightly more than 12% weight loss. And, again, we can't do direct comparisons, but at least we can see a discontinuation rate, suggesting that maybe Semaglutide also has a [more] effective safety and tolerability profile.""

In a phase 3 ATTAIN-1 trial released Tuesday, Eli Lilly said Orforglipron resulted in average weight loss of 12.4% at the highest dose after 72 weeks in adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one comorbidity.

Nevertheless, the U.S. drug maker said Wednesday that its pill outperformed Novo's in the first head-to-head study comparing the two medicines' efficacy in lowering blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes. 

Both companies have been experimenting with new so-called next-generation drugs, with Novo on Tuesday flagging promise in its Cagrilintide long-acting amylin analogue — a nascent form of weight loss treatment.

It comes as the Danish company last week announced plans to cut around 9,000 roles as part of a wider shake-up under new CEO Mike Doustdar, who has vowed to reset the company after a period of weaker growth.

""What we are doing now is focusing on our core, which is diabetes and obesity. That will include continuous investment in both diabetes and obesity, and also, as we discussed, the related comorbidities,"" Lange said Wednesday.

BEIJING — Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei announced Thursday new computing systems for powering artificial intelligence with its in-house Ascend chips, as it steps up pressure on U.S. rival Nvidia.

The company said it plans to launch its new ""Atlas 950 SuperCluster"" as soon as next year.

The U.S. has sought to cut China off from the most advanced semiconductors for training AI models. To cope, Chinese companies have turned more to grouping large numbers of less efficient, often homegrown, chips together to achieve similar computing capabilities.

Huawei announced it would roll out three new versions of its Ascend chips through the end of 2028, with the aim to ""double compute"" capabilities with each year's release.

The chips form the basis of Huawei's AI computing infrastructure, in which a supercluster is connected to multiple superpods, which, in turn, are built from multiple supernodes. Supernodes, which form the base, are built on Ascend chips, using system design to overcome technical limitations imposed by U.S. sanctions.

Huawei said its new Atlas 950 supernode would support 8,192 Ascend chips, and that the Atlas 950 SuperCluster would use more than 500,000 chips.

A more advanced Atlas 960 version, slated for launch in 2027, would support 15,488 Ascend chips per node. The full supercluster would have more than 1 million Ascend chips, according to Huawei.

It was not immediately clear how the systems compared with those powered by Nvidia chips. Huawei claimed in a press release that the new supernodes would be the world's most powerful by computing power for several years.

In a speech Thursday, Eric Xu, vice chairman and rotating chairman of Huawei, claimed that its forthcoming Atlas 950 supernode would deliver 6.7 times more computing power than Nvidia's NVL144 system, also planned for launch next year.

Xu even predicted that Huawei's product would ""be ahead on all fronts"" compared with another Nvidia system planned for launch in 2027 — and claimed the Atlas 950 supercluster would have 1.3 times the computing power of Elon Musk's xAI Colossus supercomputer.

""Huawei's announcement on its computing breakthrough is well timed with recent increasing emphasis by the Chinese government on self-reliance on China's own chip technologies,"" said George Chen, partner and co-chair, digital practice, The Asia Group.

While he cautioned that Huawei might exaggerate its technical capabilities, Chen pointed out that the Chinese company's ambition to be a world AI leader ""cannot be underestimated.""

Research firm SemiAnalysis found in April that Huawei's self-developed CloudMatrix system was able to perform better than Nvidia's — despite each Ascend chip delivering only about one-third the performance of an Nvidia processor. Huawei built its advantage by having five times as many chips.

""Computing power has and will continue to be the key for AI,"" Rotating Chairman Xu said Thursday in a statement, translated by CNBC. He was speaking at the opening of the company's annual Huawei Connect event in Shanghai. The event runs through Saturday.

Two years ago at the same event, Huawei announced its Atlas 900 SuperCluster. The company currently sells a ""Atlas 900 AI Cluster"" with ""thousands"" of Ascend chips.

Huawei said Thursday it had deployed more than 300 of its Atlas 900 A3 supernodes to more than 20 customers in telecoms, manufacturing and other industries.

Huawei's announcement comes as China promotes homegrown alternatives to Nvidia. Earlier this week, the two countries wrapped up trade talks in Spain that included a path toward resolving the long-contested U.S. operations of social media app TikTok, owned by Beijing-based startup ByteDance.

In another aggressive signal, China on Monday announced it was extending a probe into Nvidia over alleged monopolistic practices.

Pressure has only risen since on the U.S. chipmaker. Its shares fell more than 2% Wednesday after the Financial Times, citing sources, said China has ordered local tech giants to stop tests and orders of the Nvidia RTX Pro 6000D chip.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told reporters he was ""disappointed"" to hear the news of the reported ban. He's previously described Huawei as a ""formidable"" competitor.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday left Windsor Castle — where he and his wife Melania received the royal treatment — to head to Chequers, the official country residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

The two leaders are engaging in trade and geopolitical talks, as well as meeting with delegations from the U.K. and U.S.

Trump was greeted by Starmer and his wife Victoria, along with another ceremonial guard of honor and bagpipers, when he arrived at Chequers — a 16th-century manor house near London that prime ministers use as a rural retreat and more informal venue for international diplomacy.

Finalizing commitments laid out in the ""economic prosperity deal"" or U.S.-U.K. trade deal of May are expected to take center stage, as well as more thorny matters regarding 25% tariffs on British steel and aluminum that the U.K. wants reduced to zero. The ongoing wars in Ukraine and Middle East are also likely to feature on the agenda.

Speaking to reporters as he boarded Air Force One to travel to Britain on Tuesday, Trump said he was ""into helping"" the U.K. finesse the countries' trade deal.

""They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit,"" he said ""We've made a deal, and it's a great deal, and I'm into helping them,"" he said at the time. ""They'd like to see if they could get a little bit better deal. So, we'll talk to them.""

On Thursday, the U.S. president and U.K. PM will join British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves for a business reception before giving a joint press conference later in the day.

The state visit has already yielded fruit for the U.K., with £150 billion ($204 billion) worth of inward investment announced in the run-up to and during the trip. The British government hailed the investments on Wednesday, stating that these deals would ""boost jobs, drive growth and deliver opportunity for working people up and down the country.""

What could be key to day three of the state visit is that Starmer and Trump appear to truly get on. Just why that's the case — when the two men have such different political backgrounds and perspectives — continues to defy logic.

""The Donald Trump-Keir Starmer friendship is an unlikely pair. Starmer is a center-left human rights lawyer, Donald Trump, being the way that we know he is, what defines their relationship is a bit mysterious,"" Tina Fordham, founder at Fordham Global Foresight, told CNBC on Thursday.

""I'm going to put it in terms of 'soft power' and all of Trump's positive associations [with the U.K.]. Trump doesn't have very many friends on the global stage that are from the left. And it's better than the alternative [of the leaders not getting on],"" she said.

While it's uncertain how the Thursday talks will play out, there's no doubt that the U.K. has pulled out the stops to impress its transatlantic ally.

The U.S. president's visit has captivated the nation, with U.K. and U.S. flags lining the packed streets of Windsor on Wednesday, while onlookers spilled out into the roads and blocked cars, vying for better positions.

As early as 5:30 a.m. Thursday, tents lined the streets, housing numerous journalists and TV cameras.

Among onlookers, CNBC's crew spotted several wearing blue ""Make Britain Great Again"" hats — a spin on Trump's infamous campaigning slogan.

A number of locals commented on the high level of security implemented on site for the president's visit, which some said should not have taken place at all. Indeed, the U.S. president's visit wasn't wholly embraced, with protests against it taking place across Britain.

One American citizen, who said she does not support Trump, nevertheless told CNBC's Ritika Gupta the atmosphere on ground was ""marvelous.""

The U.S. president notoriously delights in a crowd — and has so far signaled that he is enjoying his second state visit to the U.K.

At a glittering state banquet held at Windsor Castle on Wednesday night, Trump told a swathe of guests that included senior royals, top U.S. and British officials and business leaders, that being invited to Britain for an unprecedented second state visit was one of the ""highest honors of my life.""

He then raised a few laughs when he joked that he hoped he'd be the only president to get two state visits.

King Charles, in his own speech, praised the U.S. president's ""personal commitment to finding solutions to some of the world's most intractable conflicts.""

Trumps otherwise basked in the royal limelight on Wednesday, visibly enjoying the pomp and ceremony, which included a royal gun salute, carriage procession through Windsor and guard of honor. Taken with the raft of investments, ""it's been a pretty flawless last 24 hours,"" Duncan Edwards, the CEO of BritishAmerican Business, a transatlantic business networking group, told CNBC Thursday.

""From a U.K. government perspective, they couldn't really have asked for a better slew of announcements coming over the last three days with the civil nuclear, financial services and all the AI announcements,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

Edwards cautioned that ""promised dollars"" were not the same as ""actual dollars"" and that it remained to be seen whether the investments promised over the last few days actually materialize.

""You just need to watch what happens over the next months and years what actually gets committed,"" he said.

In this article

LONDON — Deliveroo CEO Will Shu is set to step down from the food delivery company he co-founded over a decade ago.

Shu, who established Deliveroo in 2013 with childhood friend Greg Orlowski, said Thursday that he will step down as CEO after its takeover by U.S. rival DoorDash is completed.

DoorDash announced its deal to buy the British online takeout platform in May. The acquisition values Deliveroo at £2.9 billion ($4 billion).

""I have decided that now is the right time for me to step down,"" Shu said in a statement Thursday. ""Taking Deliveroo from being an idea to what it is today has been amazing.""

""Today the Company's growth and profitability are accelerating and we are delivering on our mission to transform the way people shop and eat, but after 13 years I want to contemplate my next challenge,"" Shu added.

Deliveroo said that its acquisition by DoorDash ""continues to progress as anticipated"" and is expected to close on Oct. 2 following a scheduled Sept. 30 court hearing to sanction the deal.

Once it closes, the takeover will represent an end to Deliveroo's tumultuous time in the public markets.

Deliveroo saw its shares plunge 30% in 2021 on the day of its initial public offering, dealing a significant blow to London's ambitions to compete with New York for more high-profile tech listings.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

NBA superstar Kevin Durant can't find the password to his Coinbase account, which holds bitcoin that he began buying in earnest when he was playing for the Golden State Warriors in 2016. His agent couldn't be happier.

Durant's predicament has ""only benefited"" the hoopster, agent Rich Kleiman said.

""We've yet to be able to track down his Coinbase account info, so we've never sold anything, and this bitcoin is just through the roof,"" Kleiman said Tuesday at CNBC's Game Plan conference in Los Angeles.""It's just a process we haven't been able to figure out, but Bitcoin keeps going up … so, I mean, it's only benefited us,"" he said.

Durant, who will play for the Houston Rockets this upcoming season, began snapping up bitcoin around 2016, after the U.S. Olympic team legend and Kleiman attended a dinner in which his then-teammates kept discussing the cryptocurrency.

""I just heard the word 'bitcoin' 25 times this evening, and the next day, we started investing in bitcoin,"" Kleiman said. The agent did not say how much bitcoin Durant bought.

Bitcoin sold for between about $360 and $1,000 back in 2016, according to CoinGecko. The leading cryptocurrency is now trading at almost $116,000, or more than 11,000% above its highest price the year Durant was buying.

Durant has been unable to access his Coinbase account for ""a few years"" due to a ""user error on our end,"" Kleiman told CNBC on Wednesday.

""We've already been working directly with the Coinbase team on Kevin's account recovery, which is why it was easy for me to make a joke about it on stage,"" Kleiman said.

Kleiman said he and Durant are also investors in Coinbase Global, and that the company ""has been a valuable resource in growing our business."" In 2021, the duo's Thirty Five Ventures struck a multiyear deal with Coinbase to promote the trading platform, which includes creating content about digital assets for Durant's sports and entertainment website, Boardroom.

Coinbase, in a statement to CNBC, said its users can reset their passwords using self-service tools within the trading platform's app. The platform for buying, selling and storing cryptocurrencies also has an around-the-clock support team fielding account recovery requests and other inquiries, according to a spokesman.

Key Points

The total addressable market for these two assets differs enormously.

Is it preferable to invest in a platform or in a product? In crypto, that question is seldom clear, and it's the basis for a lot of hand-wringing from investors.

That brings us to the current dilemma. On one side is Ethereum, (ETH) a general‑purpose smart contract-capable blockchain with a large roster of developers and a steady cadence of major upgrades; on the other side is World Liberty Financial, (WLFI) a governance token attached to a Trump family company with the same name whose flagship product is the USD1, (USD1)stablecoin. Which is the better buy, and why?

Image source: Getty Images.

Healthy crypto platforms attract developers, assets, investors, and users, then technology upgrades expand what each of those groups can do, while gas fees enable the platform to harvest value from ongoing use.

On the people front, Ethereum still leads on developer share, which historically correlates with the pace of new applications being launched as crypto tokens, as well as the pace of sustained value creation. The reason for that is that the chain's capacity has been expanding at a steady clip over the last few years. The latest upgrade, Pectra, went live on May 7, bringing an improved wallet experience and better scaling features, which are changes that should reduce the friction of onboarding new users and new capital, and also enable richer app design.

But aside from having the human ingredients for a healthy project ecosystem -- and make no mistake, Ethereum's ecosystem is the biggest and healthiest in the crypto sector by a large margin -- where does the next big dollop of incremental demand for buying Ethereum come from?

Real‑world asset (RWA) tokenization, where Ethereum is the largest venue by on‑chain value, is almost certainly one good answer to that question. As of Sept. 16, tokenized RWA value across all cryptocurrency networks is $30.1 billion, with about $9.1 billion hosted on Ethereum, giving it an impressive 54.3% share of the market. The chain's biggest RWA by value is tokenized U.S. Treasuries, of which it has $5.1 billion. As a result, if institutional investors or financial institutions are looking for a place to do business, they're probably going to be attracted to the chain, as it already has the large amount of liquidity they need in precisely the assets they like to use the most.

Put together, Ethereum offers multiple independent paths for value to compound. More apps get produced because there are more developers, investors experience lower friction because the base chain keeps upgrading, and more high‑quality assets are settling on its rails to attract institutional capital.

World Liberty Financial is building a suite of crypto products, headlined by USD1.

Per the project's own legal disclosures, holding the governance token carries no equity, no entitlement to any revenue share, and no claims on assets owned by the parent company. Its sole utility is governance, with explicit language specifying that it provides no economic rights. So, right off the bat, there is a problem for investors in the sense that holding the token does not carry any direct exposure to the company's financial success, nor does it confer any hard control.

As far as the stablecoin product itself, USD1's pitch is essentially the same as every other stablecoin's pitch, namely that it's a way to use fiat currency on the blockchain. There is no indication of USD1 having any competitive advantages or differentiation from its peers, nor is there any indication that World Liberty Financial has any kind of economic moat to prevent other stablecoins from contesting the market share of its coin.

Nonetheless, using USD1 does incur fees and generate value that accrues to its issuer. Unless World Liberty Financial gains a durable, credibly enforced claim on issuer economics, its fundamentals are unlikely to track USD1's scale; its market cap is currently around $2.6 billion.

Could World Liberty Financial still work as a speculative purchase?

It might, but don't bet on it (and don't do financial speculation either; it isn't real investing). Assuming World Liberty develops and ships useful apps, secures major distribution partners for its stablecoin, and aligns its governance token incentives to be entirely different, it could benefit from some market enthusiasm bidding up the price of its token. It could even become a good investment someday, if everything about it changes completely. But right now, it's a bad pick, as there's simply no way that the company's success can flow through to its holders.

Ethereum is, therefore, the dramatically better long‑term buy in my view. It's a platform with multiple compounding loops, plenty of different avenues for growth, a clear upgrade roadmap, and growing participation from traditional finance. Capital is flowing in, and it's getting comfortable -- so you should get some Ethereum exposure.

Ethereum price started a fresh increase above $4,520. ETH is now showing positive signs and might attempt to clear the $4,680 resistance.

Ethereum Price Eyes Steady Increase

Ethereum price extended losses below $4,550 before the bulls appeared, like Bitcoin. ETH price tested the $4,415 zone and recently started a recovery wave.

The price climbed above the $4,500 and $4,520 resistance levels. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,765 swing high to the $4,416 low. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $4,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

Ethereum price is now trading above $4,580 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,635 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,765 swing high to the $4,416 low.

The next key resistance is near the $4,680 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,720 level. A clear move above the $4,720 resistance might send the price toward the $4,750 resistance. An upside break above the $4,750 hurdle might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,850 resistance zone or even $4,880 in the near term.

Another Drop In ETH?

If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,680 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,580 level. The first major support sits near the $4,535 zone.

A clear move below the $4,535 support might push the price toward the $4,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,420 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,350.

Technical Indicators

Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.

Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

Major Support Level – $4,535

Major Resistance Level – $4,680

Oops, something went wrong

Renowned investor Kevin O'Leary expressed his belief on Wednesday that owning only Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) can capture the majority of the cryptocurrency market's volatility and yield.

O'Leary took to X, sharing a clip from his recent interview with Al Arabiya English, in which he said that instead of chasing the hordes of “irrelevant” tokens in the market, one should focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum to “capture the promise” of cryptocurrency.

“You could own Bitcoin and Ethereum, and you would capture more than 90% of the alpha or price volatility of the entire crypto market,” O'Leary, also known as ""Mr Wonderful,"" stated.



He further noted that as Wall Street moves on-chain, through the adoption of tokenized securities, digital payment systems, and stablecoins, the best way to gain exposure to these developments is by owning ETH, something he described as the “number one blockchain product.”

“One is basically digital gold, if you want to call that Bitcoin, and the other is Wall Street going on chain, which is Ethereum,” O'Leary said.

O'Leary has been one of the most vocal advocates of cryptocurrency. He previously revealed investments in companies such as Circle Internet Group Inc. (NYSE:CRL), cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) and tokenized stock provider Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) to bet on the infrastructure side of cryptocurrency.

He said last month that the younger generation, specifically the GenZs, are investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside traditional stocks, a chance he did not get early in his investment journey.

Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was exchanging hands at $117,067, down 0.14% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. ETH traded up 0.55% at $4,576 at last check.Read Next:

Ethereum price prediction is becoming uncertain as 2.6 million ETH worth over $12 billion is lined up in the unstaking queue.

Investors speculate that validators will be selling to book profits after the staked ETH is unlocked, leading to bearish pressure.

However, some of the potential selling pressure on the Ethereum price would be absorbed with the ongoing institutional accumulation.

As uncertainty arises, investors are shifting capital to high-potential altcoins, especially toward high-risk, high-reward meme coins for explosive returns. As a result, the Maxi Doge presale is thriving with investor inflow, raising over $2.3 million.

On Monday, Citigroup stated that its target for Ethereum is around $4,300 by the end of 2025. In contrast, last month Standard Chartered had raised its target from $4,000 to $7,500 by year-end.

The conflicting Ethereum price prediction demonstrates uncertainty in the current market conditions. This also indicates that macroeconomic factors play a crucial role in ETH's short-term movement.

The Ethereum price broke out of the very crucial resistance of $4,095 in early August with remarkable momentum. However, the multi-year resistance near $4,790 has been rejecting ETH's further upward movement for over a month.

The Ethereum price attempted to break out from this resistance and touched a new peak of $4,953 on August 25th, but failed to maintain above the breakout level.

It continues to trade sideways in the $4,095-$4,790 range as trading activity has declined significantly. The daily trading volumes have remained below the 20-day moving average for the past few weeks.

The MACD oscillator remains positive but is converging with the signal line, indicating declining buying pressure. Meanwhile, the RSI has dropped from overbought levels over a month ago to now in the neutral zone with a value of 57.

Considering the above, the bullish case for Ethereum price prediction is $5,750 with a 20% surge after a breakout from the $4,790 level.

That would be a similar move to the recent surge after the $4,095 breakout. In the bearish case, ETH could correct to $3,900 if it drops from the sideways range.

The meme coin market has given astounding returns to investors who got in early. But the market has now shifted from hype-driven coins to hybrid meme coins that are driven by utility and hype.

Many meme projects have been introduced with unique utilities, but few manage to maintain the hype. Maxi Doge is smartly leveraging the existing Doge theme hype and combining it with leveraged trading and staking utility to drive unmatched demand.



The Maxi Doge meme is not just another play on Dogecoin. It is the personification of the ultimate strength and grind of achieving outsized returns in the bull market.

Members of the MAXI community don't require enormous capital like Whales for these outsized returns. Rather, they achieve it with seamless execution of leveraged trading strategies.

You can join the community by holding the MAXI token. Here, every member commits to the lifestyle of grinding every day in front of charts to clutch the green candle.

Most meme coins are not profitable to hold in the long term due to their inflationary tokenomics, but Maxi Doge has a capped total supply of 150.24 billion tokens. This creates a deflationary effect and helps the MAXI token's value rise in the long term as demand rises.

To further boost token value, Maxi Doge has allocated 25% of the total token supply to the MAXI Fund. This will be used to boost project expansion and create strategic partnerships with other DeFi projects.

The numbers reveal the truth about presale performance:



With rising presale momentum and solid utility, Maxi Doge expects a blockbuster listing in Q4 2025. Taking a position in MAXI at undervalued prices could be the best meme coin play in the upcoming meme rally.

 The XRP price prediction has climbed to $3.12, posting a 3.33% gain in the last 24 hours and over 7.5% in a week, according to the latest CoinMarketCap data.  With...

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin dominance has been slipping and could go even lower than it is now—but experts still expect Bitcoin to rise to new highs this year.

Bitcoin dominance, or the ratio of BTC market capitalization to the rest of the crypto market, sits at 57.79% on Thursday morning. In the past day, the price of BTC has gained 1% after the Federal Open Markets Committee met expectations that it would lower federal interest rates with a 25 basis point cut.

In the immediate aftermath, Bitcoin held steady—but then rose to its highest price in more than a month Thursday morning, rising to a recent peak just shy of $118,000.

John Glover, chief investment officer at Bitcoin lender Ledn, said Bitcoin's initially placid reaction to yesterday's rate cut doesn't mean it won't still end the year strong.

“I'm forecasting a BTC price of circa $140K to $145K by year end,” he told Decrypt. “The rate cuts will help to push this narrative as money moves to BTC for safe haven among expectations of a USD devaluation.”

Other analysts have forecast that the long-term outlook for Bitcoin is still extremely bullish. But in the near-term, altcoins have taken the spotlight with larger gains ahead of expected SEC approvals of a wide variety of crypto ETFs.

“Short-term statistics may show that Bitcoin dominance is slipping as traders rotate into altcoins in the hope that the SEC will greenlight new spot ETFs,” BOB co-founder Dom Harz told Decrypt. “That rotation may play out in the short term, but it's important to remember that Bitcoin remains the most secure network, the most proven digital asset, and the one with the deepest institutional conviction.”

At the time of writing, XRP has gained 3% in the past day to trade for $3.12; crypto exchange Binance's BNB has risen about 5% to $996 and set a new all-time high above $1,000 overnight.

Solana, which recently got a massive boost from billions worth of SOL being bought by corporate treasuries, has climbed almost 6% in the past day to $248, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko. Solana is one of the biggest gainers among top assets over the last month, rising 35% during that span.

Users on Myriad, a prediction market owned by Decrypt parent company Dastan, have swung bearish on Bitcoin dominance as enthusiasm for altcoins builds. At the time of writing, 53% of users think Bitcoin dominance will slip further to 53% before it manages to climb back to 63%.

Bitcoin dominance was last that high in the middle of July, when BTC set what was then a new all-time high above $112,000.

BTC broke that record a month later and topped out above $124,000, but it's still given up some ground to altcoins. Even so, Harz said that doesn't change much for institutional investors.

“ETFs alone have seen six straight days of inflows this week,” he added, “pulling in over $2 billion, while 7% of total supply now sits in corporate and government treasuries.”

On September 17, the Fed cut its benchmark rate for the first time since late 2024. The news buoyed the altcoin sector. 

According to CoinGecko, Avalanche (AVAX) led gains among the largest cryptocurrencies by market value, rising nearly 10% over the past 24 hours to $32.9. 

HYPE, the token of the decentralised exchange Hyperliquid, jumped 7% to a record $60. 

Meanwhile, BNB topped $1,000 for the first time. Earlier, media reported that Binance is in talks with the US Department of Justice to end oversight by US authorities.

Solana broke through $246, a level last seen in January. Dogecoin rose 5.1% to $0.28. Cardano and Chainlink gained 5% and 4.7%, respectively. 

Bitcoin edged up 0.4%, holding around $117,000. Ethereum rose 2% to $4,600. 

Analysts offered varied views on the market's current momentum and outlook. 

Benjamin Cowen, founder of ITC Crypto, noted that altcoins traded against Ethereum have been rising steadily for the past four weeks—since the second-largest cryptocurrency set a new all-time high. 

We are now in Week 4 of #ALTs going up against #ETH.

Notice how the bounce occurred right after #ETH put in a new ATH. 

This will likely continue for a few more weeks. https://t.co/ZMcdUx85dG pic.twitter.com/XLvbFAJC3H

— Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) September 17, 2025

 

He suggested the trend could persist, a view supported by the TOTAL3-USD/ETH chart. 

A trader known as Ali backed the notion of sustained bullish momentum in altcoins. He highlighted the positive impact of the Fed's decision, pointing to more than $2.1 billion of USDT and USDC inflows to Binance. 

He said average whale deposits have risen to $214,000.

With the Fed's decision to cut interest rates by 25 bps, CryptoQuant data shows Binance attracting over $2.1 billion in USDT and USDC inflows. Whale deposits now average $214,000 vs. $63,000 in July, suggesting growing institutional activity.

Altcoin deposits are also booming:… pic.twitter.com/5q0ONVBuAL

He noted a sharp rise in altcoin inflows to major exchanges and a near-doubling of address activity since early September. In his view, improved liquidity and institutional activity are supporting the sector's momentum. 

Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Capital, stressed that a significant altcoin rally will begin only after bitcoin stabilizes. 

The more important part; will $BTC break through this crucial resistance zone?

All I'm sure about is that, once #Bitcoin stabilizes, we'll start to see big breakouts on #Altcoins occur. pic.twitter.com/7PdiM99SId

Analysts have named three drivers of an altseason: the Fed's rate cut, rising corporate reserves and the potential launch of new crypto ETFs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Shifting Tides: Investors Pivot Toward Altcoins Amid Bitcoin Slowdown","https://hackread.com/shifting-pivot-toward-altcoins-bitcoin-slowdown/","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 10:56:34 GMT","

In the current cycle, Bitcoin has anchored most of the capital inflow. In 2025, 66% of investors selected Bitcoin as their first digital purchase, driven by more global regulatory clarity and ease of access. With the cycle progressing and Bitcoin dominance falling below 58%, altcoins have gained momentum, with 73% of institutional investors now holding or allocating capital into them. This shift signals a growing trend among investors as they view altcoins as a diversifying strategy.

Interest rate fluctuations are a primary driver for how institutions allocate capital towards risk on assets. Lower interest rates trigger higher investor risk appetite, as patterns indicate stronger inflows into digital assets. Notably, TOTAL3 has increased by 109.43% YoY, highlighting how altcoins often outperform Bitcoin as higher-beta assets during easing cycles.

Bitcoin dominance is showing signs of reversal as the altcoins market jumped from below 35% to 41% in early September, while Bitcoin's dominance slid below 58% for the first time in 2025. Institutional inflows are reinforcing the trend as Ethereum ETFs attracted $3 billion in net flows in a single week.

The global M2 liquidity has expanded by $5.6 trillion in 2025, indicating a notable increase in global liquidity. Consequently, more capital is available for investment following monetary policy easing, with capital historically rotating into altcoins that can outperform Bitcoin up to 200%.

Institutional capital is no longer solely concentrated on Bitcoin. The existing cycle shows a growing institutional interest across multiple crypto verticals. Binance Research (PDF) has highlighted stronger performance in sectors such as DeFi, stablecoins, and RWA. At the same time, research on institutional adoption of DeFi emphasises that 24% of institutions currently engage with crypto products, and this number is expected to triple in the next two years.

DeFi recorded a 44.5% year-to-date gain, while stablecoin had a 38.6% increase. Both sectors outperformed Bitcoin's YTD increase of 19.8% is illustrating why capital is shifting from Bitcoin towards altcoins and infrastructure. As Bitcoin dominance falls below 57%, institutions are diversifying by capitalising on the regulatory tailwind, indicating that institutional interest is no longer confined to a single asset.

Binance France President David Princay recently commented on a potential altcoin season, “If or when BTC prices plateau, institutions and corporations may look to diversify their crypto holdings further. It will be interesting to observe how an altcoin season unfolds in a more mature and regulated crypto market.”

Rising DEX volumes are an early indicator of investors pivoting their strategy to increase altcoin exposure. With many new tokens initially unavailable on centralised exchanges, DEXs capture dislocated liquidity by offering listings ahead of traditional platforms. DEX volumes doubled over the past year, with spot reaching 23.1% and futures climbing to 9.3%.

Additionally, DEX trading volumes reached a combined total of over $1.15 trillion in 2025. Similarly, Ethereum has reached an all-time high monthly DEX volume of $139.63 billion in August 2025, emphasising how investors seek DEXs as alternative trading infrastructures to access new assets.

Fee reductions on Ethereum have supported increased activity and reduced costs for DeFi users. The network has also enabled higher on-chain trading volumes, which more than doubled in 2025 while centralised exchange activity declined. Growing on-chain metrics emphasise the structural shift toward decentralised infrastructure as a driver of market activity.

On-chain data illustrate that DeFi protocols are continuing to grow in value. Total value locked (TVL) on lending increased by 65% to $79.8B for the first time, with investors identifying new opportunities to deploy capital towards on-chain lending.

Larger protocols such as AAVE are capturing the growth with half of the on-chain lending market –  $39.9 billion. Ethereum's DeFi TVL has expanded from $54 billion to over $97 billion while total staked ETH neared 35.8 million ETH. The Paceta accelerated this trend by increasing the validators' stake from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, prompting entities to allocate capital and capitalise on the opportunities.

Regulatory clarity helped drive demand for DeFi products. The SEC's announcement not to classify liquid staking as a security prompted positive institutional momentum. According to DeFi Llama, total liquid staking increased by 103% year-over-year, reflecting growing institutional demand for deploying altcoins to generate reliable yields.

Such developments underline DeFi's role in evolving beyond deposit and towards active use cases. Stablecoin deposits on exchanges climbed to an all-time high of $68 billion, indicating available capital for potential deployment from retail and institutional investors towards digital assets.

As Bitcoin's dominance continues to ease, the rise of altcoins underscores a broader maturation of the digital asset market. What was once seen as a speculative corner of crypto is now attracting serious institutional attention, reshaping portfolio strategies in the process.

If the trend continues, altcoins may move beyond being seen as just “alternatives” to Bitcoin. Instead, they could become core pieces of diversified crypto strategies, signalling a shift in how investors approach the next phase of the digital economy.

As crypto industry growth creates a huge demand for talent, crypto founders need to know how to find and recruit great people — both crypto natives and people with traditional tech experience. One of the biggest questions that come up, however, is whether you need to hire someone who has crypto-native experience, or someone that can learn the industry? It's the source of endless internal debates.

The good news is that crypto is hardly the first industry to struggle with talent pipelines. That means there are well-established practices you can draw on to find the right people with the right skill sets. That's what this guide is for: to help founders and recruiters determine where crypto experience is crucial, where other kinds of experience can have the biggest impact, and what challenges and considerations need to be addressed along the way. 

To keep things simple, think of it like this: There are definitely ways that crypto companies differ from traditional tech firms. But when it comes to the processes and best practices of finding, hiring, and onboarding talent, you're not building a crypto company per se — you're just building a tech company. So be sure to apply those established best practices for finding the right people with the right skillsets. 

As a rule of thumb, crypto-native professionals have a crucial advantage: the ability to hit the ground running. High-stakes projects often operate under tight timelines, where every day counts. And sometimes, native crypto expertise can be indispensable. The roles where this is especially true involve foundational constructs of blockchain technology and its applications, where even the most skilled professionals may face a steep learning curve.

Smart-contract development is a prime example. These self-executing agreements, encoded directly on the blockchain, demand precision and an understanding of decentralized logic that's different from traditional programming. A single vulnerability in a smart contract can be catastrophic and result in millions of dollars in losses, making this a high-stakes discipline where it's important to know the rules of the road.

Onboarding talent into an industry with such a steep learning curve can be a challenge, as the candidate may require time to acclimate to the nuances of blockchain technology — decentralized vs. centralized, more open source, and so on — and the crypto “ethos,” which includes everything from different cultural lingo to mindsets. But there are many areas in which talent from non-crypto companies can fuel crypto's growth, especially as a company begins to scale. For example, traditional professionals with backgrounds in software engineering or operations can bring versatility and a breadth of experience honed through their experiences at larger software companies. These professionals have often worn multiple hats and have had to manage vast amounts of internal bureaucracy and barriers to get things shipped. In crypto's quickly growing multidisciplinary teams, this kind of operational flexibility becomes a powerful asset. 

Experience at scale also plays an important role. Traditional candidates have often worked on products used by millions, and they've confronted (and solved) the challenges that come with such success: Ensuring systems stay up under extreme infrastructure load, optimizing performance at scale, and preparing for unpredictable spikes in demand. This expertise translates directly to web3 products as they move from niche, crypto-savvy audiences to more mainstream adoption.

Candidates that come from fintech firms, for example, may have significant relevant experience in payments technology or financial regulations that may be important in your world too. Building infra? A consumer app? Well there's a world of talent that's been doing this for years at scale.Consider what experience overlaps and where you can ramp them on crypto specific tech to build your unicorn team in house. More broadly, candidates who have experience in design, user experience, scalability, security, and leadership can also help accelerate crypto innovation, as these skills often have domain expertise that transfers well and may even work better than someone who doesn't have this experience.. 

After you've identified the skills and people you need — including determining whether they really need to have crypto-native experience or not — the next step is to go out and recruit them.

The biggest challenge and the biggest opportunity are flip sides of the same coin: You're a crypto company. 

For some candidates coming from established companies, crypto industry volatility, recent regulatory uncertainty, insider jargon, and decentralized products will be too new or unappealing or both. For others, that same unfamiliarity and occasional instability will be exciting — a feature rather than a bug. In recruiting conversations, drill into how the candidate thinks about the stability and comfort of a big company versus the opportunities and challenges of a rapidly growing company. Walk them through a challenge your team encountered in the last few weeks, explain how it was handled and highlight the onus on each team member given the size and stage of the company. Their reaction may tell you how they might have responded in a similar situation and at the very least, will let them know what's expected of anyone at your company when the next situation arises.  

A candidate might not know a ton about crypto when you first make contact, but natural curiosity and interest in the benefits of decentralization are key. A big signal over the recruitment process will be how much their knowledge and engagement deepens along the way: Are they researching things on their own? Are they asking more specific questions based on learning new things from you and others?… and so on. 

To differentiate between the two types of candidates — the crypto-wary and the crypto-curious — and to avoid wasting your time and money, seek to understand people's motivations as early as possible to make sure they and your company are moving in the same direction. This is recruiting 101, but it's worth underlining because it's so important, especially in the crypto industry. 

Every pitch needs to be customized to each specific candidate: What drove them to their current job? What kept them in their past roles? Those same things are likely to be a critical part of their decision-making process this time around, too. Start learning the answers to those questions in your very first call with a candidate.

By the end of the recruiting process, you want to be hiring someone who is aligned with your company's vision and excited about your product. And your team needs to be excited to work with the new hire, too; that will help you align whether the candidate fits your company or not regardless of degree of crypto experience. That's always your north star. 

Since you're going after highly intellectually curious candidates, tailor your pitch accordingly to appeal to them. You might start by explaining the difference between the computer and the casino cultures of crypto (that the first sees blockchains as a way to build new networks powering a new computing movement, and the other is mainly interested in speculation, trading, and gambling). You could then share how the emergent industry offers them a unique chance to reshape the future of technology, not unlike the early days of the internet. 

A useful thought experiment is to figure out how to talk about your product and company without talking about crypto. What problems does your company solve? What inspired you to build it? Why will the world be a better place because of it? This will allow you to sell the premise and promise regardless of the underlying technology without your audience getting tripped up in the details. 

Another good starting point is simply to ask, “What do you know about crypto?” Even if you get skeptical answers — stories from the news, the casino-culture narrative — it will give you an opening, and allow you to listen for what they are really scared about: external factors (policy), intrinsic ones (tech complexity), personal ones (risk tolerance), and so on. You might share that many people in crypto agree with some of that skepticism, and bring the conversation around to the cool technical problems that your project is solving. 

Not everyone's primary motivation will be money, but be ready to highlight the financial rewards available, too. Historically, top talent has been reluctant to join early-stage companies for three reasons: (1) a grindfest culture, (2) bad work-life balance, and (3) lack of liquid compensation. Even if you solve for the first two, the third can eliminate a significant portion of your potential candidate pool. 

Compensation innovation, such as token-based structures, can provide both financial upside and liquidity at early-stage companies — compared to the rare liquidity events like an IPO or acquisition that you see in web2. Be sure to use a vesting/token grant schedule that locks people into the long term to some extent. Compensation is a complicated topic and is obviously top of mind for candidates, so make sure you're thoroughly prepared to talk about it. 

If you do these steps well, you'll have a solid chance of getting top talent from outside the industry interested in your company. Next, you'll want to help them see exactly how they can contribute their best work in their day-to-day roles.

Integrating new talent into web3 companies is about educating your new hires to shorten their ramp-up time. You'll know each person's gaps because you identified them in the interview process. Use that knowledge to design onboarding experiences that specifically close those gaps, and as quickly as possible. 

For example, new hires may need help to see beyond the technicalities of blockchain and decentralized systems, so they understand the real-world problems they'll be solving and gain confidence in their roles. 

Regular knowledge-sharing session between new hires and veteran employees with deeper crypto experience will foster collaboration and allow team members to learn from one another's strengths. Mentorship programs can pair newcomers with experienced web3 professionals to provide invaluable hands-on learning. Even better, you can structure the program so that crypto “unicorn” talent (someone who has all the skills, knowledge, and background) is paired with newcomers who can develop over time into crypto unicorns of their own.

Upskilling and education are also essential, and will remain so as the industry keeps evolving. Resources like blockchain-focused blogs, podcasts, and education courses -– in things like how to use a smart wallet, how to stake, tokenomics, smart contract design, or basic concepts around how blockchains are being leveraged in different use cases– offer a strong starting point for continual learning. Mentorship roles with established crypto organizations can provide practical experience, while thought leaders in the industry can offer insights through reports (including our own State of Crypto report). 

The key takeaway is, whatever your new hires need to excel, your job is to help them learn, find, or access it from day one. 

***

Regardless of whether you hire someone crypto-native or crypto-curious, your mantra should always be to: Hire smart people to build products that serve users. 

The transition to crypto isn't just about adopting new technology. It's about cultivating a shared vision that blends the best of both worlds. Experienced professionals bring critical expertise in scaling, usability, and strategic leadership, while crypto-native talent offers specialized knowledge of blockchain systems and decentralized principles. Together, they form the ideal team to tackle the challenges of a rapidly evolving industry.

But this won't all happen organically. To succeed, your organization must invest in thoughtful onboarding, collaborative team structures, and continuous education to set them up for that collaboration and success. This includes helping experienced talent see beyond the technicalities of crypto to understand the real-world problems they'll help solve and the transformative potential of their work. By fostering shared purpose and bridging gaps in knowledge and culture, the industry can accelerate innovation and unlock the full promise of crypto for all.

Banking institutions that aim to get involved in activities related to virtual currencies should consider adopting blockchain analytics tools for additional risk management capabilities, New York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris said Wednesday (Sept. 17).

Blockchain analytics tools can enhance banking institutions' compliance programs and prevent illegal activities, Harris said in a press release announcing new guidance on the use of the tools by New York State-regulated banking organizations that are considering or already conducting virtual currency-related activities.

According to the release, blockchain analytics can be used to assess risk exposure through customer wallet screening and funds verification involving virtual asset service providers; conduct holistic monitoring for illicit activity exposure and risk management of third parties; augment due diligence controls to evaluate expected versus actual activity of customers engaged in virtual currency activity; and weigh the risks associated with virtual currency products or services.

“As traditional banking institutions expand into virtual currency activities, their compliance functions must adapt, onboarding new tools and technologies to mitigate new and different risks,” Harris said in the release.

The release said this guidance for banking institutions builds upon guidance that was issued to New York State-regulated virtual currency entities in April 2022.

In that guidance, Harris established the use of blockchain analytics tools as a best practice for these entities to prevent and manage financial risks and suspicious activities.

Blockchain analytics has made it easy to conduct transaction monitoring and determine whether a transaction came from, for example, a regulated institution or a darknet market, Caitlin Barnett, director of regulation and compliance at Chainalysis, told PYMNTS in an interview posted in November 2022.

“I remember the first time I saw blockchain analytics,” Barnett said. “I saw that we were getting very clear information that funds were either coming from an OK source or a risky source. We were seeing very clearly if we were getting funds from a darknet market or if a customer was sending funds to a darknet market.”

PYMNTS reported in April that Washington's evolving regulatory stance is poised to potentially reshape how banks and custodians engage with digital assets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","RWA-friendly L1 blockchain adds native EVM and CosmWasm with protocol-level compliance","https://cointelegraph.com/news/rwa-friendly-l1-blockchain-adds-native-evm-and-cosmwasm-with-protocol-level-compliance","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

 The latest mainnet upgrade brings native EVM and CosmWasm to a single chain. Backed by a VARA-regulated VASP license, the chain focuses on tokenization with institutional guardrails. 

Mantra has upgraded its mainnet to natively run both the Ethereum Virtual Machine and CosmWasm, bringing a MultiVM architecture to an RWA-focused layer 1 so developers can use familiar tooling on a chain tuned for tokenization.

Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) presents an addressable market that analysts estimate at about $16 trillion. But progress has been slowed by fragmented developer tooling, uncertain regulatory pathways and limited interoperability across ecosystems.

To close those gaps, the RWA-focused layer-1 blockchain Mantra has upgraded its mainnet to add native support for both the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and CosmWasm — a smart-contract framework for Cosmos that compiles to WebAssembly.

The upgrade embeds specific requirements at the protocol level and is backed by Mantra Finance's virtual asset service provider (VASP) license from Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).

Mantra's upgrade marks a notable first for RWA-focused layer-1 chains: a MultiVM design that unifies EVM depth with CosmWasm in production. MultiVM means the chain can run more than one smart-contract virtual machine side by side, so teams keep familiar tooling while gaining a base layer with compliance checks wired in, designed for institutional workflows.

“Mantra Chain is at the heart of the Mantra ecosystem,” said Mantra founder and CEO John Patrick Mullin. “With this EVM upgrade, we're not just improving performance; we're further embedding compliance into the protocol, opening the door to a new era of accessibility, trust and regulatory clarity when tokenizing RWAs. It's another important step toward making the future of finance more open and efficient for everyone.”

Many blockchains add controls only through application-level contracts, yet those can vary from app to app and create uneven enforcement. Shifting certain requirements into the base protocol is meant to provide consistent guardrails across the network, which reduces ambiguity for compliance teams and simplifies risk reviews for institutions that must evidence controls end-to-end.

Here's what changes for developers and institutions:

Deploy as-is: Developers can launch Solidity-based decentralized applications (DApps) on Mantra Chain without code changes and can fork DeFi protocols for RWA use.

EVM depth: The chain supports low-level EVM instructions (opcodes) and optimized system contracts (precompiles), along with low fees and RWA-oriented infrastructure.

Institutional pathway: EVM-compatible, self-sovereign chain coupled with Mantra Finance's licensed infrastructure.

Bridging next: Straightforward transfers from other EVM chains are on the near-term roadmap.

From here, the team says it will scale adoption, onboard new asset issuers and demonstrate how tokenized finance can run with clear audit trails, permissioning and policy enforcement.

Mantra's announcement follows several weeks of updates. In August, the project announced a strategic partnership with Inveniam to build an institutional RWA stack anchored in the UAE and the United States. Governance and decentralization have advanced as Mantra onboarded Binance, Nansen and Inveniam as validators while winding down internal ones.

“Two critical factors that distinguish Mantra from the competition are our VASP license from Dubai's VARA, and our compliance-driven infrastructure,” Mullin summarized:

Next up, Mantra plans permissioned liquidity pools, institutional compliance frameworks and deeper interoperability with other blockchains. It will also host Agentic., a two-day summit in Abu Dhabi on Oct. 21–22 focused on tokenization, market structure and capital flows.

Mantra's MultiVM upgrade unifies native EVM and CosmWasm under an architecture with compliance built into the protocol designed for RWA use cases.

Key Points

If all goes right for Alphabet's new blockchain, it could eventually eat XRP's lunch.

Alphabet's (GOOGL 0.52%) (GOOG 0.52%) Google Cloud unit just announced that it's in the process of developing the Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL), a new Layer-1 (L1) blockchain intended for financial institutions. Pilot programs have begun with capital markets players, and broader trials are slated ahead of its planned 2026 launch.

Given the niche being targeted by Google with the GCUL, the immediate question is whether holders of XRP (XRP) should worry. Let's take a closer look at what the plans are and how they compare to what Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL) is trying to do.

Image source: Getty Images.

GCUL's stated mission is to be institutional-grade financial plumbing for tokenized assets and transaction settlement, with interoperability for various legacy systems and smart contract support in the Python programming language. That ambition immediately suggests that it will be a direct competitor to XRP, but there's still a long journey from today to the new chain having durable liquidity and functioning features that the target market wants.

Historically, Google Cloud's crypto work has been infrastructure and tooling for other chains, such as its managed Blockchain Node Engine. That's very different from operating a blockchain and corralling users to develop on it, but it indicates that there is a base of experience in the sector to build on rather than starting from a blank slate. In other words, GCUL aims to move Google from being a niche crypto vendor to a mainstream blockchain provider.

Whereas Google Cloud already serves financial institutions with computing, enterprise storage, and regulatory compliance frameworks, it is not itself a regulated financial services provider. At this juncture, it's unclear whether it will seek that designation. Institutions will thus, at least for now, still need their usual roster of custodians, banks, and other services to make GCUL production-grade.

It's also not yet known if the GCUL will launch with a native token. If it does, that token will likely be used to pay the equivalent of the chain's gas (user) fees, and it will also likely sap capital from elsewhere in the crypto sector. But it's also entirely possible that Google will opt to make fees payable in stablecoins, which would abrogate the need for a native token. Taking such a route would additionally make the chain look more like a professional piece of financial infrastructure rather than a platform for speculation, so with all things considered, it's fairly probable that investors won't be able to invest in the GCUL directly.

One potential issue is that Alphabet's sketchy reputation for sunsetting products could chill mission-critical adoption at the margin. Simply put, many users and developers feel that Alphabet has a long-standing habit of launching ambitious new services only to abandon them a couple of years later after a sub-maximal effort to make them succeed. Financial institutions do not want to have to switch over key pieces of their infrastructure because their provider got bored.

None of this means GCUL will fail. It means investors should calibrate their expectations about its competitive impact. New venues can take years to earn trust and scale.

As things stand today, the GCUL is not an existential threat to XRP, though it could slow its growth somewhat.

XRP's investment thesis has always hinged on being useful plumbing for cross-border money transfers, payments, and managing tokenized assets with institution-friendly compliance controls. And Ripple is currently seeking a national bank charter in the U.S., which could give it key legal capabilities to expand and market the XRPL as a platform -- so it's ahead of the game relative to GCUL on that front. That matters because it lowers the integration friction for banks, brokers, and asset issuers that have specific reporting requirements.

Could GCUL contest XRP's market share as the value of the payments, transfers, and asset tokenization markets grow? Yes, especially if Google pairs the ledger with incentives, seamless on-ramps for its cloud customers, and interoperability that reduces switching costs. Even if its experience in fintech is minimal, and even if app developers have many quibbles about its product strategy, the Google brand is globally known, far more so than XRP and Ripple combined.

In practice, incumbents often keep winning while newcomers try to find their footing, even when they're backed with vast resources. XRP is positioned to keep courting asset issuers that want tight, protocol-level controls and cheap, fast transaction settlement. It also has a highly committed investor base, and a clear roadmap for how to develop its financial infrastructure value chain further to capture more value over time.

In contrast, GCUL must first prove staying power, recruit and retain real capital, and survive procurement committees that remember Google's limited patience with non-core products. Until those boxes are checked, XRP's long-run thesis is intact, and near-term disruption from a new competitor preparing to enter the scene looks to be limited.

Tokenization — the process of creating a digital representation of the rights to an asset and storing it on a blockchain — is a booming business. A report by Ripple and Boston Consulting Group estimates that the tokenization of real-world assets could grow from about $0.6 trillion in 2025 to $18.9 trillion by 2033.

The lion's share of this growth is expected to come from fiat currencies, known as stablecoins. In July, Congress passed the first federal law to create a regulatory framework for their issuance. Yet, stablecoins are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to trading the rights to real-world assets on public ledgers. Here are six of the weirdest things that people have tokenized and traded on blockchains.

The global portfolio of tokenized real estate is expected to grow from $0.3 trillion in 2024, to $4 trillion by 2035, according to Deloitte estimates. The priciest deal reported yet: In January Dubai developer DAMAC Group partnered with blockchain platform MANTRA to tokenize assets in the Middle East worth at least $1 billion.

Private equity funds are increasingly issuing security tokens that represent shares in PE vehicles, recorded and traded on blockchains. This allows traditionally illiquid investments to be fractionalized and traded more easily, lowering entry thresholds for smaller investors while improving secondary market liquidity. 

In July, retail trading platform Robinhood began to offer users indirect exposure to OpenAI and SpaceX equity, by tokenizing its ownership stake in a special purpose vehicle. “Our giveaway plants a seed for something much bigger, and since our announcement we've been hearing from many private companies that are eager to join us in the tokenization revolution,"" Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said in a post on X.

The meme features Zoë Roth as a 4-year-old, smirking at the camera while a house fire burns behind her. In 2021, Roth sold a non-fungible token of the original photograph for 180 Ethereum tokens, which at the time was worth about $473,000-$500,000.

Even after selling the NFT, Roth and her family retained the copyright to the image and arranged to receive 10% royalty on any future resales. Roth used some of the proceeds to help pay off student loans but said the sale was partly about regaining control over how the image is used. The “Disaster Girl” NFT is often cited as a milestone case in how content owners can monetize their content via blockchain technology.

Cyber Eau de Parfum was released in April 2021 as a limited-edition fragrance project that experimented with linking the scent formula itself to an NFT. Each buyer received both a physical bottle of perfume and a digital token containing the encoded recipe of the fragrance. 

The idea was to treat the formula like intellectual property on the blockchain, creating a kind of digital provenance for smell. It was framed as a futuristic crossover between luxury goods and decentralization — turning perfume, one of the most ephemeral commodities, into something that could be owned, traded, and verified on-chain.

Maurizio Cattelan's artwork Comedian — a banana duct-taped to a wall — became infamous when it sold for $120,000 at Art Basel Miami in 2019, sparking debates about what counts as art. In 2021, a number of digital artists and collectors made unofficial NFT versions inspired by Comedian. These were not created by Cattelan himself but by others tokenizing digital images or reinterpretations of the banana-on-the-wall concept. For example, the group Banana Zone DAO issued banana-themed NFTs linked to the artwork's notoriety. 

The idea was to illustrate how tokenization can assign lasting monetary value to something as fleeting as a moment and as perishable as a piece of fruit. It's often cited as a satirical example of how far markets will go in valuing scarcity and symbolism over material substance.

Taking the stunt to its culmination: Justin Sun, a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur and billionaire, purchased the original Comedian for $6.2 million at a Sotheby's auction in  2024. He later fulfilled his promise to eat the artwork, declaring it tasted ""much better than other bananas.""

In 2021, German tennis player Angelina Graovac tokenized 15 centimeters of space on her arm, according to Sportico. The buyer of the NFT would gain the right to decide what tattoo or design would be inked permanently in that segment. Part of the deal: the winning bidder could resell the token for a higher price when she makes it to Wimbledon or Roland Garros. 

Graovac succeeded in selling the rights to the part of her limb for 3 Ether, equivalent to $5,415, to user ""JumpHigh,"" although it has not been disclosed how they used the license. The move was pitched as a novel blend of sports sponsorship and blockchain technology, turning part of her own body into a scarce, tradable advertising space, pushing the boundary of what it means for an athlete to commodify their body.","{'href': 'https://qz.com', 'title': 'Quartz'}","cryptocurrency"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Best Upcoming ICO [Top List 2025]","https://coincentral.com/best-upcoming-ico-top-list-2025/","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 13:30:12 GMT","

What happens before a token goes public?

How can you tell if a project is building something sustainable or simply preparing for a quick launch?

These are the questions that matter when looking at the best upcoming ICOs. The public often sees the moment of launch as the starting point, but in reality, it's the result of months, sometimes years of preparation. The work done before the token meets the market is what often determines its stability and adaptability in the future.

Before an ICO is announced to the world, teams are already working on:

It's the same as inspecting a building before it's painted or furnished. The appearance might change later, but the foundation will not.

After a launch, projects often get caught in the fast-moving cycle of price speculation, exchange listings, and community expectations. Before that point, there is a period of relative quiet.

Why is this period so important? Because it's where the essential work happens:

This phase rarely makes headlines, but it defines how prepared a project is to face the unpredictable demands of a live market.

From observing multiple launches over time, a consistent pattern emerges:

A token without a defined role is like a restaurant without a menu. It might attract attention at first, but sustaining interest becomes difficult.

Before a restaurant opens:

From the outside, none of this is visible. But if you could step inside early, you would quickly see whether the team is ready or improvising.

The ICO stage works the same way; those who examine it early can read the signals before the public launch reveals them to the market.

Not every upcoming ICO shares the same purpose:

The common thread: all are still shaping their direction at this stage.

When reviewing this list, the goal is not just to recognize a brand or a catchy symbol. The real focus should be on:

It's in these early, often quiet months that the actual direction of the project is set.

Before moving into the detailed analysis, here is a short profile of each ICO, summarizing its primary objective at this early stage.

Tapzi is reimagining blockchain gaming by putting skill, not luck, at the center of the experience. Players stake $TAPZI tokens to compete in real-time matches in games like Chess, Checkers, and Rock-Paper-Scissors, where winners claim the prize pool. Matches last around 5-15 minutes.



The platform is browser-based, mobile-friendly (via progressive web app), with no downloads needed. Strong anti-cheat systems, including ELO-based matchmaking and bot-detection, help ensure fairness. Tapzi supports multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Solana.

Beyond gaming, Tapzi serves as a launchpad for Web3 skill-gaming developers, aiming to enable game studios to integrate staking and participate in Tapzi's competitive ecosystem. Its tokenomics are transparent: presale 20%, liquidity 20%, team 10%, treasury 15%, airdrop 10%, development 10%, marketing 10%, reward pool 5%, with vesting schedules clearly defined for presale and team allocations.

By combining competitive play, meaningful rewards, and developer-friendly infrastructure, Tapzi positions itself as a strong contender in the “Skill-to-Earn” gaming space.

Why it's among the Best Upcoming ICOs:

Tapzi isn't launching as a finished product. It is launching as a skill-to-earn framework designed to evolve, adapt, and be shaped by the players who build within it.

BlockDAG is shaping up to be a rare mix of high-speed blockchain tech and real-world adoption before its Mainnet is even live. Instead of waiting for launch to prove itself, it's already gathered millions of miners through its X1 mobile app and professional-grade X-Series rigs, building both community and computing power in advance.

Its hybrid design merges Proof-of-Work security with a DAG structure, enabling parallel block processing that could scale from 10 to over 100 blocks per second while staying decentralized. Developers get EVM compatibility and no-code tools, making it easy to port or build dApps, NFTs, and DeFi platforms.

With over 4,500 developers, 300+ dApps, and high-profile sports partnerships in Seattle, BDAG's ecosystem is set to launch strong. Its presale has raised hundreds of millions, backed by transparent tools like a live trading simulator dashboard. If it delivers on its August 2025 mainnet target, BDAG could enter the market with momentum few ICOs can match.

Remittix is turning cross-border payments into something instant, affordable, and built for the crypto era. Instead of dealing with slow bank wires or costly FX fees, it lets you send crypto and have the recipient get local currency directly in their bank account with no middlemen, no hidden charges.

Its upcoming multi-chain Web3 wallet (launching Q3 2025) will handle over 40 cryptocurrencies with real-time FX conversion, Staking, gas optimization, and developer-ready APIs. This isn't just a payment tool; it's an entire PayFi ecosystem aimed at freelancers, global businesses, and underbanked communities.

Backed by a CertiK security audit and already raising nearly $19 million in presale, Remittix has momentum well before launch. With support in 30+ countries, strategic beta access for top community members, and plans for CEX listings once the $20M mark is hit, it's positioned to solve real payment problems at scale.

If it delivers on its roadmap, RTX could become a go-to standard for crypto-to-bank transfers worldwide.

Snorter Token powers a Telegram-native trading bot built for the speed and chaos of meme-coin markets. Instead of juggling wallets, charts, and risky swaps, traders can open a wallet, set up snipes, and execute protected trades directly in chat.

The bot's Solana routing engine delivers sub-second execution with front-running protection, scam detection, and features like limit orders, automated launch sniping, copy-trading, and real-time portfolio tracking. Ethereum and BNB Chain support are next in the multi-chain roadmap, with Polygon and Base to follow.

$SNORT's fixed supply of 500 million tokens spans both Solana and Ethereum, with seamless bridging between chains. Holding it unlocks lower fees (0.85%), unlimited snipes, advanced analytics, staking rewards from a 25M token pool, and future governance rights.

With a presale running until October 2025 and up to 60% of supply available, Snorter combines high-speed execution with user-friendly access. If adoption grows as planned, it could become the go-to trading companion for the next meme-coin cycle.

Little Pepe isn't just riding the meme wave; it's building its own Layer-2 surfboard. Designed for speed, ultra-low fees, and zero taxes, $LILPEPE blends meme culture with serious blockchain infrastructure. The project positions itself as a full-fledged Layer-2 chain on Ethereum, delivering fast finality and secure transactions while keeping the fun, community-driven energy of classic meme coins.

With a 100 billion token supply, $LILPEPE allocates significant reserves for chain operation, staking rewards, and deep exchange liquidity, ensuring smooth market entry. The presale offers early supporters a large slice of the supply, alongside incentives like staking yields and planned CEX listings.

Marketing is core to its growth, with a strategy built around viral memes, influencer campaigns, and unexpected publicity stunts. The roadmap promises a transition from presale hype to top-exchange listings, massive adoption, and a push toward becoming a recognized Layer-2 player.

If it delivers both the tech and the community engagement, Little Pepe could be more than a meme; it could be a cultural and technical contender in the Layer-2 arena.

NexChain is positioning itself as a next-generation Layer-1 blockchain where AI meets high-performance infrastructure. Instead of relying solely on traditional consensus, it blends Proof-of-Stake with AI-driven validation, enabling adaptive network management and ultra-fast transactions targeting up to 400,000 TPS with fees as low as $0.001.

Its architecture combines sharding and DAG technology, allowing seamless cross-chain operations and scalable growth. Beyond speed, NexChain is built for resilience, integrating post-quantum cryptography, AI-powered anomaly detection, and self-healing capabilities to isolate threats before they spread.

The NEX token fuels the ecosystem, covering transaction fees, staking rewards, governance votes, and AI service payments. Holders also share a portion of gas fees, adding ongoing utility. With a fixed 2.15B supply, fair vesting, and anti-whale measures, distribution is designed for long-term stability.

Currently in presale with over $8.4M raised, NexChain is attracting attention for its enterprise-ready performance, Certik-audited security, and $5M airdrop campaign. If it delivers on its Q4 2025 mainnet launch, it could set a new standard for AI-powered blockchains.

HexyDog blends blockchain innovation with real-world pet care, creating a utility-driven token that goes beyond speculation. Built to support both everyday users and animal welfare initiatives, $HEXY offers seamless crypto payments at pet stores, transparent on-chain donations to shelters, and a growing ecosystem of pet-focused services.

Its 20B fixed supply is distributed with long-term sustainability in mind from staking rewards (25%) and liquidity pools (15%) to charity allocations (5%) and community incentives. Holders can stake for passive rewards, join the Hexy Ambassador Program, access exclusive merchandise, and participate in DAO governance to shape future development and donation priorities.

Security and transparency are core pillars, with team KYC verification, third-party Smart Contract Audit, and liquidity locking to protect participants. Partnerships with pet businesses and NGOs aim to scale adoption globally, while the HexyPay system will make crypto-based pet care purchases simple and accessible.

By merging DeFi utility with a mission to improve animal welfare, HexyDog positions itself as one of the most impactful upcoming ICOs in the space.



The ICO stage is where a project's real foundation is built. It's the period when technical structures are tested, ecosystems are mapped out, and the role of the token is clearly defined. By the time a token reaches public markets, much of its trajectory has already been shaped by decisions made in these early moments.

The projects in this list, from innovative gaming ecosystems like Tapzi to other forward-looking blockchain initiatives, represent a diverse set of approaches to addressing real challenges in the digital space. Some aim to connect worlds, others to accelerate transactions, enable cross-chain collaboration, or reshape how communities engage online.

What unites them is not their category or target audience, but their stage: they are still being shaped, tested, and refined. Observing them now offers far more insight than any price chart could. The best upcoming ICOs aren't just about launch day; they're about the strength of the groundwork that supports everything that follows.

Among the upcoming 2025 launches, Tapzi stands out for its skill-based Web3 gaming model. Players stake TAPZI tokens, compete in fair matches, and earn based on performance, supported by audited smart contracts and multichain access. Its focus on transparency, real competition, and mobile-friendly design makes it one of the most promising ICOs of 2025.

Selection was based on four main factors:

Look at the fundamentals before the marketing:

Yes, when they go beyond branding. Meme-themed ICOs that integrate functional utilities such as staking, NFTs, or community governance can maintain relevance. Without these elements, they often struggle to sustain long-term engagement.

Bitcoin's first meme-driven layer 2, Bitcoin Hyper, could soon prove to be one of the most explosive propositions from 2025's burgeoning presale market. 

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed past $117,000 on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 0.25 points. For weeks, BTC had struggled to stay above $115,000 as traders waited for clarity from the FOMC meeting. 

Now, with the market eyeing a return to its peak, investors believe an even bigger push will be needed to retest all-time highs. One contender is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), the fastest Bitcoin Layer-2 in development, which has already raised $16.5 million in its ongoing ICO.

Bitcoin Hyper is being billed as a potential new demand driver for BTC by creating an ecosystem where bitcoins can finally move beyond passive storage and into applications that were never possible on the base chain.

The current presale round offers HYPER at $0.012935 per token for the next 22 hours before the price moves to the next tier.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to cut interest rates by 0.25 points, its first policy shift in months. Markets had largely priced in the move after a series of softer inflation prints and mounting pressure to ease financial conditions. 

🚨JUST ANNOUNCED: The Federal Reserve has just CUT RATES by 0.25%. Thanks, President Trump! #BullMarketFed Chair Jerome Powell: ""Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower our policy interest rate by 1/4 percentage point.""THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA BEGINS RIGHT… pic.twitter.com/2Y6HImPR4q

Fed officials also indicated that two more quarter-point cuts are likely this year, depending on how economic data unfolds.

In light of this, crypto markets saw a broad bump, with Bitcoin breaking above $117,000 as traders bet easier monetary policy could fuel the next leg higher. At its current price, BTC is only 5.7% away from its all-time high, and further cuts in the last quarter – historically Bitcoin's strongest months – could set the stage for a new peak.

Yet, some analysts believe that rally could extend much further. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes has suggested Bitcoin could hit $200,000 before the end of the year and argued in a recent interview with Kyle Chasse that the bull cycle is far from over and could potentially run well into next year. 

🚨 THE BIG PRINTING HASN'T EVEN STARTED 👀@CryptoHayes believes this market could run well into 2026, with Trump expected to juice the economy by mid-2026.He says politicians fear change, investors are underpricing the upside across assets, and we're NOT at the end yet.… pic.twitter.com/N96Y7aRh0f

To Hayes, liquidity created by currency debasement will inevitably flow into a hard asset like Bitcoin, reinforcing its role as a store of value. 

However, the open question is whether rate cuts alone will be enough to push BTC toward his $200,000 target – or if additional sources of demand, such as Bitcoin's expanding use in DeFi and other applications, will play a role.

That broader utility is what Bitcoin Hyper is aiming to unlock, potentially strengthening Bitcoin's path higher while opening new opportunities of their own.

Its team developed Bitcoin Hyper as Bitcoin's fastest Layer-2, designed to make the network programmable at scale. 

It achieves this by integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), the same execution layer that powers some of the fastest and most cost-efficient applications in crypto. This gives developers the ability to deploy high-performance dApps in Rust while still tying their activity back to Bitcoin.

Settlement remains anchored to Bitcoin through a canonical bridge, the sole entry point into the Hyper ecosystem. Users lock BTC into the bridge, which then mints an equivalent wrapped BTC inside the Layer-2. 

That wrapped BTC becomes the medium of exchange across dApps, and when users want to exit, the wrapped version is burned and the original BTC is released back to them.

In practice, this design merges the best of both worlds: dApps running at Solana-grade speed and efficiency, while ultimate security and settlement remain secured by Bitcoin's base layer – the most decentralized and immutable ledger in existence.

At its core, HYPER is the utility token of the Bitcoin Hyper network. It powers every transaction as gas, secures the chain through staking, and serves as the governance asset that shapes the Layer-2's future. 

Every dApp, stablecoin, lending protocol, or game deployed on Bitcoin Hyper will require HYPER to function – making it the medium of activity for Bitcoin's programmable economy.

At its current presale price of $0.012935, HYPER carries a fully diluted valuation of about $272 million based on its 21 billion token supply. 

On the surface, that may sound sizable, but in the context of Layer-2 tokens it's tiny. Ethereum's leading Layer-2s command multi-billion valuations – Mantle (MNT) at around $5.5 billion, Arbitrum (ARB) at $2.7 billion, and Optimism (OP) at $1.4 billion.

Now layer in Bitcoin's upside. If just 1% of BTC's circulating supply, or about 195,000 BTC, were bridged into Hyper at a $200,000 Bitcoin price, that would represent nearly $39 billion of value circulating inside the ecosystem. 

Against HYPER's $272 million valuation today, that's more than 140 times the locked value compared to the token's market cap. Even if HYPER captured only a fraction of that – say a valuation in line with Ethereum's L2 leaders – early buyers would be looking at multiples well beyond the presale entry price.

The only way to avoid arriving too late is by securing HYPER while it's still in presale. Right now, tokens are available at early-stage pricing, which is the perfect window to get tokens before major exchange listings drive valuations higher.

Investors can purchase HYPER directly through the Bitcoin Hyper website using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card. 

The Bitcoin Hyper team recommends using a Web3 wallet like Best Wallet, one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets in the market. You can already find HYPER under Best Wallet's “Upcoming Tokens” – making it easy to buy, track, and claim once live.

Businesses experienced an estimated 7.7million cyber crimes over the past year, according to government figures. Most small businesses hold personal information and conduct business digitally, so cyber security must be a priority.

Here are some practical steps businesses and their staff can take to improve their data security and resilience:

Back up your data 

Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication 

Be aware of your surroundings

Be wary of suspicious emails

Install anti-virus and malware protection

Protect your device when it's unattended

Make sure your Wi-Fi connection is secure

Limit access to those who need it

Take care when sharing

Don't keep data for longer than you need it

Dispose of old IT equipment and records securely

If an organisation experiences a data breach as a result of a cyber attack, they should report it to the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of it.

For more advice on protecting personal information, visit the ICO's security guidance for organisations.

For further support on cyber security, visit the National Cyber Security Centre's website and the Cyber Essentials programme, a Government-backed certification scheme that helps keep your organisation's – and your customers' – data safe from cyber attacks.

Ian Hulme, Executive Director for Regulatory Supervision at the ICO, said: “Cyber attacks have been hitting the headlines again recently, serving as a timely reminder for all businesses to check their own security measures. When people share their personal information with your company, they need to feel confident you'll do as much as possible to keep that information secure.

“While cyber attacks can be very sophisticated, we find that many organisations are still neglecting the very foundations of cyber security. As the data protection regulator, we want to support organisations to get this right and these simple steps will help to protect both your customers and your business.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","The impact of the U.S. CBDC ban on Europe","https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/cbdc-ban/","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 06:00:00 GMT","

The U.S. has banned a digital dollar. Meanwhile, Europe is racing ahead with its digital euro.

On July 17, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill prohibiting the Federal Reserve from creating a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Lawmakers consider the technology a threat to financial privacy and freedom, calling it incompatible with America's fundamental democratic principles.  

The bill also codifies U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order from January, which forbids federal agencies from pursuing the development of any form of government-controlled digital money. Monetary innovation should remain in the hands of the people, not the administrative state, argued Congressman Tom Emmer, the lead sponsor of the so-called Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. The new legislation states: “Unelected bureaucrats can never unilaterally issue a CBDC or weaponize a digital dollar to erode our freedoms.”  

The bill would effectively halt what American financial technology strategist and GIS expert Dante Disparte has described as a “tax-payer borne science experiment with money.” The decisive U.S. stance runs sharply counter to a global trend: Over 90 percent of the world's central banks are actively exploring digital versions of fiat currency, including the European Central Bank (ECB).  

Following four years of study and preparation, the ECB, under Christine Lagarde's leadership, is expected to decide by year's end whether to launch a “digital euro.” Pilot programs could start as early as 2026. If approved by the European Parliament, a full-fledged retail CBDC could be in circulation in the eurozone by 2028. 

The U.S. ban raises an important question: If Americans reject CBDCs as a gateway to mass surveillance and state control, why should Europeans embrace them – and what exactly are they signing up for? 

The ECB's official messaging highlights the digital euro's advantages but largely glosses over its possible downsides. The digital euro, we are told, is merely an electronic form of cash, meant to complement rather than replace physical euro banknotes and coins.  

Convenient, risk-free and widely accessible, it would “make people's lives easier.” Users would just have to set up a digital wallet, fund it via a linked bank account or cash deposit and use it for everyday payments.  

The CBDC reform is framed as key to modernizing financial infrastructure amid a booming digital economy and a steady decline of physical cash. However, if successful, it could seriously disrupt the traditional banking and payments system, and ultimately the entire monetary system. The ECB might imperil the very intermediaries it relies on to transmit its monetary policy.  

Imagine millions of Europeans shifting funds from commercial banks into ECB-issued wallets. This would amount to a massive digital bank run, with potentially disastrous consequences for financial stability, notably in times of crisis.  

Former ECB Supervisory Board member Andreas Dombret warned that even in normal times, people might come to prefer holding CBDCs over bank deposits, eventually triggering a credit crunch and, at the same time, a major expansion of the central bank's balance sheet. Sooner or later, the ECB may face pressure to issue loans directly to households and businesses – a major shift that would blur the line between central banking and retail banking in an unprecedented way, with far-reaching implications. 

To minimize risks, the ECB proposes a cap on individual digital euro holdings, reportedly around 3,000 euros per person. The digital euro would carry no interest and serve solely as a means of payment, not a store of value. If this is how it works, what incentives would users have to adopt the digital euro over existing private-sector solutions such as payment cards or mobile apps?  

And why should digital cash be better than physical cash? After all, cash requires no power supply, internet connection or digital devices. It is immune to technological obsolescence, power outages, cyberattacks and data breaches. Nor does it depend on a complex, shifting, legal and technological infrastructure. So what is the point? As one observer put it, the digital euro may simply be “a solution in search of a problem.” 

A common argument in favor of introducing a digital euro is that it could provide accessible payment services to the European Union's estimated 13 million unbanked adults. It could, however, also lead to new forms of social exclusion. Those lacking reliable internet, digital skills or smartphones might find themselves further marginalized in an increasingly cashless future. The ECB is aware of these risks and has said it is committed to addressing them effectively, aiming to ensure that a digital euro enhances financial inclusion rather than deepening existing divides. 

Privacy remains a key concern. According to former ECB Executive Board member and chair of the Eurosystem High-Level Task Force on a Digital Euro, Fabio Panetta, “protecting privacy is a vital feature of the digital euro.” The central bank promises the “highest standards of privacy” for this “cash-like” instrument – though not the full anonymity of physical cash. Instead, it proposes a tiered approach to privacy: anonymity, or rather, “pseudonymity” for small (essentially offline) transactions, and traceability for larger ones.  

For now, what qualifies as “small” or “large” remains undefined. Is it 100 euros? Less? More? Eventually, it turns out that even for the smallest and most trivial transactions, like buying a cup of coffee, anonymity may not be guaranteed. As Mr. Dombret pointed out, legislative acts such as the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and an increasing number of anti-money laundering laws require all digital currency transactions to be traceable, regardless of the amount involved or the issuer, whether private entities or central banks. 

The ECB claims the digital euro would follow EU rules aimed at “balancing privacy with security.” How exactly that tradeoff will be managed is unclear. The digital euro drafters simply assert that Europe's legal framework offers the “strongest privacy protections in the world.” They also pledge that the ECB will not use consumers' personal data for commercial purposes. Does that mean no data will be collected? Probably not. The real question is: What happens to the data in the end? Who will have access to it and, ultimately, who will control it? 

Policymakers insist that personal data will be safer with the ECB than with global tech companies, to which millions have already handed over their privacy with little hesitation.  

In fact, the idea of a digital euro first emerged in 2019 as a defensive response to Facebook's (now Meta) plan to create its own virtual currency: Libra, later rebranded Diem. The ECB feared the tech giant could exploit its vast global user base to build a private payment network outside regulatory oversight. Although Meta's project ultimately failed, the underlying threat that such powerful market initiatives could pose to monetary sovereignty still remains.  

The growing dominance of U.S.-based payment platforms like PayPal or Apple Pay, along with the rapid expansion of private digital currencies (notably Bitcoin's stateless rise) and dollar-backed stablecoins such as USDT (Tether) or USDC (Circle), continues to be a major concern for the ECB. And the worry goes far beyond data privacy. As more Europeans adopt these systems, the ECB fears losing control over the broader payment infrastructure and, eventually, the money supply – one of a central bank's most essential functions.  

In many ways, the ascent of fiat-backed stablecoins and the near-launch of Libra/Diem served as a wake-up call. Central banks realized that in a digital economy, control over currency can no longer be taken for granted. A digital euro would provide a public (that is, sovereign) alternative, ensuring that Europe's monetary system stays anchored by the ECB, rather than being steered by private, largely foreign, actors that are operating beyond its reach.  

Another oft-cited argument in favor of CBDCs is their potential to enhance the transmission of monetary policy. Unlike conventional stimulus tools, they could enable authorities to deliver financial support with pinpoint precision to those who need it most. This capability could significantly accelerate and strengthen fiscal and monetary responses during crises, be it a pandemic, natural disaster or economic shock.  

A state-owned digital currency with automated rules or built-in payment conditions (so-called “programmable money”) could also facilitate the delivery of recurring government programs, such as social security or unemployment benefits. In theory, however, the same technology might allow authorities to deduct funds from the digital wallets of wealthier individuals and redistribute them – a controversial prospect that central banks, unsurprisingly, tend to sidestep in their public communications.  

When asked whether the digital euro will incorporate features allowing public oversight of its use, such as of how, where or with whom it is spent, the ECB's response is unequivocal: “No, never.” Officially, such controls are categorically ruled out.  

Yet the underlying technology could, in principle, enable functionalities of programmable money that verge on the Orwellian: automatic expiration dates for money, spending limits by category, expense tracking or, more generally, real-time monitoring of financial behavior. While such possibilities are downplayed in central bank communications, they could well be embedded in the digital euro's design. Whether they would ever be activated is another matter. For now, we are left to take the ECB at its word. 

In light of the recent developments in the U.S., where lawmakers have blocked the introduction of a digital dollar by invoking the “principle that money should be free from political manipulation and government surveillance,” one might expect European policymakers to pause for reflection. But that is clearly not the case.  

In a press release dated July 16, 2025 – just one day before the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act passed the U.S. House of Representatives – the ECB reaffirmed its commitment to moving steadily toward implementation.  

Marking the release of the institution's third official report on the digital euro preparation phase, Executive Board member and chair of the High-Level Task Force on a Digital Euro, Piero Cipollone, stated: “We are pleased to see that our efforts remain on track as we keep working to deliver on the request of EU leaders to accelerate progress on a digital euro.” He added: “In light of today's geopolitical and economic challenges, we welcome an ambitious pace for the legislative work.”  

In short, there is no sign of hesitation, let alone retreat. All indications point toward a continued and determined push to bring the digital euro to life. 

In a geopolitical environment where leadership in digital finance is increasingly tied to questions of security and sovereignty, the ECB's objective appears clear: fill the void left by Washington and assert itself as the standard-setter among Western central banks.  

As Chris Giancarlo, former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and founder of the Digital Dollar Project (a private-sector initiative dedicated to research and experimentation on the digital modernization of the U.S. dollar), rightly noted, the race to set global standards for CBDC interoperability has become a critical challenge for monetary authorities. And if no major Western central bank takes the lead, others – notably the People's Bank of China – are more than ready to step in. 

Since the rollout of the digital yuan (e-CNY) during the 2022 Winter Olympics, China has made no secret of its ambitions to internationalize its already well-advanced CBDC project. Beyond promoting cross-border use, Beijing is actively exporting the digital yuan's underlying infrastructure – establishing the rules, protocols and technical architecture that could shape the future of global digital finance.  

According to Mr. Giancarlo, this represents not only an economic challenge but also a normative one: Should China become the dominant supplier of CBDC infrastructure, emerging economies – or even advanced ones – may find it more practical to adopt Chinese-designed systems rather than build their own. In doing so, they could (inadvertently or not) import elements of China's deeply authoritarian governance model into their digital financial systems. 

For the ECB, this only reinforces the sense of urgency. The goal is not just to preserve monetary sovereignty within Europe, but to ensure that the global evolution of digital currency remains anchored in liberal democratic values.  

But in seeking to match the pace and scale of China's progress, the ECB risks opening the door to similar technologies of surveillance and control, raising the uncomfortable question of whether defending democratic principles abroad might come at the cost of eroding them at home.

The Reform Party has dismissed CBDC as governmental overreach, while advocating for a thriving private stablecoin market.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

The United Kingdom's minority party Reform has formally rejected the Bank of England's proposal to cap stablecoin holdings and its broader plan to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

In a Sept. 18 statement on X, the party's head of policy, Zia Yusuf, alongside party figurehead Nigel Farage, warned that the measures would damage Britain's competitiveness in the global digital economy.

Last week, the Bank of England proposed restricting stablecoin exposure for individuals and businesses. Under the draft proposal, citizens would be limited to holding between £10,000 and £20,000 in systemic stablecoins, while businesses would face a maximum cap of £10 million.

The regulator argues that the plan aims to reduce financial risks as digital assets become more mainstream.

However, the Reform party leaders framed the proposal as an attack on innovation rather than a safeguard.

They argued that limiting the use of stablecoins risks choking off demand for British government debt while strengthening the position of global rivals.

According to the statement, dollar–pegged stablecoins like USDC and USDT funnel significant liquidity into US Treasuries, reinforcing the dollar's dominance in digital finance. By contrast, the UK lacks any mechanism equivalent to a backstop demand for gilts.

Yusuf wrote:

“Now ask yourself: where is the British equivalent? Where is the pound-backed stablecoin with deep liquidity, one that global markets can trust, one that channels fresh demand into UK gilts? It doesn't exist, because policymakers here have been openly hostile to innovators. Instead of building the future, Britain's regulators have smothered it.”

Considering this, Yusuf argued that “stablecoins are not a danger to financial stability.” Instead, he described the assets as:

“[A] bridge between the digital world and the traditional banking system. A bridge between entrepreneurs and customers, between investors and opportunity. They are simply new wrappers around money – safer, faster, programmable money that can settle instantly across borders without costly intermediaries.”

The Reform Party has also fought hard against the creation of a digital pound.

According to the party, a state-backed CBDC would hand the Bank of England “unprecedented control” over financial activity, stifling competition and discouraging private-sector innovation.

Instead, they advocate for regulated, privately issued stablecoins that could drive growth without giving government entities direct control over citizens' wallets.

To support that approach, the party said it would advance its proposed Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill to establish a transparent and proportionate regulatory framework.

By creating rules that balance consumer protection with market freedom, Reform argues the UK could emerge as a leader in the global stablecoin race and generate new employment opportunities in fintech and digital finance.

The stance marks another step in the party's embrace of crypto. Earlier this year, it became one of the first political groups in the UK to accept donations in Bitcoin and other digital assets.

[Editor's Note: Context on UK politics.  Reform holds five parliamentary seats within the current government behind Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, SNP, and Sinn Féin. It has minimal sway in current UK legislation.

However, a collapse in support for Labour has placed Reform at the top of YouGov polling for the over-50s around a hypothetical snap election. The next election is scheduled for 2029.]

CBDCs are tools of sovereignty in a world shifting eastward, edging away from dollar dominance

We are living in a rapidly transforming financial landscape. 

In July the US passed the Genius Act, the first formal federal framework for stablecoins. It mandates full reserve backing in US dollars or short-term treasuries – a bid to make America the “crypto capital of the world”, funding deficits while reviving the dollar's long-cherished “exorbitant privilege”.

The prize is tempting. Global cryptocurrency value has rocketed from just $5 billion in 2015 to more than $3 trillion by mid-2025, fuelled by technology, institutional adoption, exchange-traded funds and speculative fever. 

Yet crypto's story is one of boom and bust. Volatile prices, thin reserves and fragile pegs have repeatedly triggered bank-run dynamics. Stablecoins, e-money and cryptocurrencies are “currencies” in name only: they lack the unit of account, the store of value and the state guarantee that underpin true money.

That's why the next chapter won't be written by private tokens but by central banks. 

The digital economy already accounts for $16 trillion – 14 percent of global GDP – and it is being supercharged by artificial intelligence. Such a system demands infrastructure with security, trust and scale. 

Enter central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

CBDCs come in two forms. Retail CBDCs extend digital cash to the public. Wholesale CBDCs streamline interbank payments and settlements. Both can cut costs, enhance security and integrate seamlessly with tokenised assets. 

More strategically, they are becoming tools of sovereignty in a world shifting eastward, fragmenting and edging away from dollar dominance. 

For many states, CBDCs are no longer optional – they are defensive shields against US financial power and offensive tools for economic inclusion.

The UAE has grasped this early. Its planned digital dirham could be live by the end of 2025, supporting domestic payments, cross-border trade and e-commerce. 

It builds on the UAE's role as a crypto hub – home to Vara, the world's first independent virtual asset regulator and to pioneering tokenisation projects in real estate. Fractional ownership platforms let investors buy into Dubai property for as little as AED2,000 ($550). Tokenised assets are moving from theory to practice.

A digital dirham will make the payment system more efficient, facilitating transactions between individuals, businesses and governments, securely and at a lower cost.

It will widen access. Millions of expatriate workers and small businesses in the Gulf remain excluded from formal finance. 

A state-backed digital currency can bring them into the fold securely, lowering remittance costs and expanding economic participation. Smart contracts will add automation, creating new efficiencies in trade and finance.

Globally, the race is on. As of July, 137 countries are exploring CBDCs; 72 are in advanced development and three have already launched. 

China leads with its e-CNY, piloted in 29 cities with transactions topping $986 billion. The UAE, meanwhile, has conducted joint CBDC trials with Saudi Arabia and China through the Bank for International Settlements-backed mBridge project, and with Riyadh through Project Aber. 

These efforts hint at an alternative financial architecture – one not reliant on the dollar. 

Today, the greenback still accounts for nearly half of all international payments and dominates trade finance with an 82 percent share. But 98 percent of stablecoins are also pegged to the dollar, reinforcing its grip.

The stakes are geopolitical as much as financial. Imagine a trade transaction flowing between China and the UAE, settled instantly in e-CNY and digital dirham without touching dollars or the Swift payments system. That is no longer hypothetical – it's already been tested. 

Such flows foreshadow a future in which cross-border transactions are faster, cheaper and less dollar-dependent.

The UAE is well placed. It is the third-largest crypto adopter in Mena and among the top 40 globally, handling more than $30 billion in transactions in the year to June 2024, according to Chainalysis. 

Decentralised finance usage in the country has grown 74 percent year on year, and the Dubai Land Department predicts tokenised real estate could reach $16 billion by 2033.

But the opportunity is also a challenge. Unless the UAE and other forward-leaning economies scale CBDCs quickly, they risk ceding ground to dollar-denominated stablecoins. 

Washington has made its intentions clear. Beijing has already built its alternative framework. The global financial system is being redesigned – and whoever controls it will shape trade, power and trust in the digital age.

 An exchange-traded fund that tracks a cryptocurrency created for the fun of it began trading today.


 The Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF, which uses the ticker symbol ""DOJE,"" now trades in U.S. markets. It's the first Dogecoin ETF listed in the U.S. market, and it's in some ways hard to believe it—or the coin that underpins it—exists at all.


 Dogecoin, or ""DOGE,"" is a meme-based cryptocurrency created in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to bitcoin. Dogecoin's most notable backer is Elon Musk, who has in the past influenced the price of the asset by posting about on the social-media network now known as X.


 Now the coin has inspired an exchange-traded product. Dogecoin currently changes hands at around 28 cents; it has risen some 15% over the past week as traders awaited the listing of the ETF, according to Tradingview. The joke, it seems, has legs: The market cap of Dogecoin is above $42 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.


 Rex-Osprey has a number of other crypto ETFs live or in the works; one that follows XRP also began trading today. A Rex-Osprey TRUMP ETF currently under review at the SEC, which is for the controversial meme coin associated with current U.S. President Donald Trump.


 The ETF arrives as investors have lately flocked to a range of new crypto- and crypto-linked assets, from IPOs—among them Bullish (BLSH) and Circle (CRCL)—to bitcoin and altcoin Treasury stocks and tokens.


 There could soon be a rush of new exchange-traded products in particular, with Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart earlier this year telling Investopedia to expect a spate of crypto products to get regulatory approval in the second half.

Banking institutions that aim to get involved in activities related to virtual currencies should consider adopting blockchain analytics tools for additional risk management capabilities, New York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris said Wednesday (Sept. 17).

Blockchain analytics tools can enhance banking institutions' compliance programs and prevent illegal activities, Harris said in a press release announcing new guidance on the use of the tools by New York State-regulated banking organizations that are considering or already conducting virtual currency-related activities.

According to the release, blockchain analytics can be used to assess risk exposure through customer wallet screening and funds verification involving virtual asset service providers; conduct holistic monitoring for illicit activity exposure and risk management of third parties; augment due diligence controls to evaluate expected versus actual activity of customers engaged in virtual currency activity; and weigh the risks associated with virtual currency products or services.

“As traditional banking institutions expand into virtual currency activities, their compliance functions must adapt, onboarding new tools and technologies to mitigate new and different risks,” Harris said in the release.

The release said this guidance for banking institutions builds upon guidance that was issued to New York State-regulated virtual currency entities in April 2022.

In that guidance, Harris established the use of blockchain analytics tools as a best practice for these entities to prevent and manage financial risks and suspicious activities.

Blockchain analytics has made it easy to conduct transaction monitoring and determine whether a transaction came from, for example, a regulated institution or a darknet market, Caitlin Barnett, director of regulation and compliance at Chainalysis, told PYMNTS in an interview posted in November 2022.

“I remember the first time I saw blockchain analytics,” Barnett said. “I saw that we were getting very clear information that funds were either coming from an OK source or a risky source. We were seeing very clearly if we were getting funds from a darknet market or if a customer was sending funds to a darknet market.”

PYMNTS reported in April that Washington's evolving regulatory stance is poised to potentially reshape how banks and custodians engage with digital assets.

The online casino industry is experiencing a significant change, and it is all owed to crypto casinos. Gambling is being transformed with the emergence of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, with platforms such as the best poker sites leading the pack in this regard. These online technologies are rocking the boat as they provide players with faster, more secure, and more anonymous methods of playing and a greater level of transparency than conventional gambling systems. It is a change that is similar to what is occurring in the beer industry, with a rising trend of craft breweries and online ordering systems that are transforming the way people are finding, sharing, and consuming their favorite pints in a more open and more choice manner than ever before.

For poker enthusiasts, platforms offering rewards like wpt rakeback are enhancing the experience by offering even more incentives for loyal players. With the ever-increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies in industries, online gambling is not left out. The so-called crypto casinos are a new spin on the online gambling industry with the benefits of increased privacy, faster transactions, and reduced fees, which distinguishes these casinos from the traditional ones. Wondering how this industry is being transformed by blockchain and cryptocurrencies? This is a closer look at the emergence of crypto casinos, their advantages, and the challenges they may encounter.

Cryptocurrency casinos are much different than other conventional online casinos, and blockchain technology is the center of these websites. The decentralized characteristic of blockchain also means that the games will be fairer, more transparent, and less manipulative. As an example, websites such as Best crypto sites have access to casinos playing smart contracts to verify that the results of the game can be verified by players. Unlike conventional casinos that are operated by centralized entities, crypto casinos eliminate the chances of any central authority interfering with the games, thereby creating a sense of trust and fairness among players.

Moreover, blockchain technology will provide a greater degree of protection for the money and personal data of players. The fact that transactions are encrypted and cryptocurrencies are decentralized makes it significantly harder to be hacked, which may offer some level of protection that even traditional casinos will not be able to provide. Crito transactions are as well, and they do not have the delays that are prevalent with conventional banking systems. Such fast transactions are also an important attraction to those who want to withdraw winnings in a hurry.

The first advantage of crypto casinos is that they provide better financial privacy. The conventional online casinos usually make the players fill in a lot of personal and financial details, such as bank account details, which some players might find worrying. On the other hand, crypto casinos enable users to gamble anonymously as long as they have a digital wallet address. Such a high degree of privacy is a massive benefit to those who appreciate the privacy of their data and want their gambling habit to remain confidential. Besides privacy, there is another massive advantage that comes with the speed of transactions. Being decentralized, cryptocurrencies also enable almost instant deposits and withdrawals, making them a game-changer for players who require fast access to their money. The withdrawals can be very frustrating since it may take a person many hours or even many days to receive the withdrawals, as opposed to traditional casinos, where one can get the cash immediately. Breweries and online casino platforms both understand that waiting dulls the experience, which is why speed and reliability have become key expectations in both spaces.

In addition, crypto casinos do not usually have to face the fees charged by traditional banking systems, and the players can keep a bigger portion of their gains. One more perk of crypto casinos is that they can provide improved chances and bigger winnings. Since they have lower overhead expenses than traditional casinos, they can offer better chances and larger payouts.  This contributes to the popularity of crypto-casinos among high-rollers and regular gamblers who seek the most beneficial financial prospects. With the rise of the crypto gambling industry, the number of gamers that will fill the sites is likely to increase, and this is likely to lead to increased privacy and maybe more financial benefits.

The more the crypto casinos gain popularity, the more difficult it becomes to regulate. Conventional gambling platforms are also under stringent rules that are administered by financial authorities in different countries. But, since cryptocurrencies are decentralized and work within the conventional financial system, the regulatory authorities can hardly enforce cryptocurrency casinos. Other nations are already proceeding to control this new industry. The Netherlands, as an example, has started to build the legal frameworks that will guarantee the compliance of crypto casinos with a set of rules that safeguard the consumers. They have laws that are against underage gambling, the policy on anti-money laundering, and transparency among operators. This move towards regulation is to ensure that the players have a sense that they are playing in a safe and legal environment, as well as making it difficult for bad actors to take advantage of the system.

Governments in Europe and other parts are in the process of developing coherent gambling laws that would encompass the traditional and crypto-based establishments. As an operator, it would be necessary to ensure that they are in touch with these changes in the law to ensure that they remain credible and trusted by the players. By following these rules, crypto casinos will be able to consolidate their image in the casino sector and promote responsible gambling. The same principle compels most beer producers who follow brewing standards and quality legislation and gain trust not only with the taste but also with transparency and responsibility.

The online gambling industry is becoming more competitive daily, and crypto casinos must continue to innovate to maintain their edge. Traditional gambling platforms are already beginning to adopt digital currencies, meaning crypto casinos must provide something unique to stay ahead of the curve. To do this, many crypto casinos are expanding their offerings, collaborating with other companies, or acquiring smaller platforms to broaden their market share. One way crypto casinos are expanding is by offering a wider variety of games that appeal to different types of players. Beyond classic table games like poker and blackjack, many crypto casinos now incorporate virtual reality (VR) and live dealer experiences to make the gaming environment more immersive. These developments aim to provide an exciting and engaging experience that keeps players coming back for more.

Education will also play a crucial role in the future of crypto casinos. As cryptocurrencies are still relatively new for many players, crypto casinos must help users understand the volatility of digital currencies and the risks associated with gambling. These casinos can foster a loyal and responsible user base by providing educational resources and tools to help players make informed decisions. The market for crypto casinos is growing, but to thrive, these platforms must stay ahead of the technological curve and navigate the complex regulatory landscape. The crypto casinos that succeed will balance innovation, compliance, and user education while providing a seamless gambling experience that capitalizes on the unique benefits of blockchain and digital currencies.

Blockchain is the main technology of crypto casinos, which provides transparency and fairness that cannot be equaled by traditional gambling platforms. With blockchain technology, a decentralized registry is used to store all historical transactions so that all bets and wins, as well as payouts, can be traced and confirmed by any individual accessing the blockchain. This brings about a sense of trust which is very hard to find in the traditional casinos where players must trust the honesty of the casino operator.

Besides providing fairness, blockchain technology is also simplifying the process of players checking the odds and results of a game. Cryptocurrency casinos operate on many smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts where the terms of the contract are directly coded in code. This is to make sure that the players, as well as the operators, will be confident in the fact that the terms of the game will be fairly applied without any chance of manipulation. Certainly, with the further development of blockchain technology, we will be able to witness even more innovations in the work of the crypto casinos. The possibilities to innovate are limitless since it can be integrated with new cryptocurrencies and added to the list of available games. Crypto casinos are on the leading edge of such transformations, and as the technology evolves, it is probable that we shall witness more thrilling advances in online gambling.

Casinos based on cryptocurrencies are changing the nature of online gambling, where people have a higher privacy level, transactions are quicker, and more transparent. Although some factors, such as regulation, are still there, the prospects of expansion in this industry are monumental. It reflects the manner in which the beer aspect is still progressing, as there is an opening of possibilities in new brewing techniques and distribution channels, but there remains the issue of control and custom.

As crypto industry growth creates a huge demand for talent, crypto founders need to know how to find and recruit great people — both crypto natives and people with traditional tech experience. One of the biggest questions that come up, however, is whether you need to hire someone who has crypto-native experience, or someone that can learn the industry? It's the source of endless internal debates.

The good news is that crypto is hardly the first industry to struggle with talent pipelines. That means there are well-established practices you can draw on to find the right people with the right skill sets. That's what this guide is for: to help founders and recruiters determine where crypto experience is crucial, where other kinds of experience can have the biggest impact, and what challenges and considerations need to be addressed along the way. 

To keep things simple, think of it like this: There are definitely ways that crypto companies differ from traditional tech firms. But when it comes to the processes and best practices of finding, hiring, and onboarding talent, you're not building a crypto company per se — you're just building a tech company. So be sure to apply those established best practices for finding the right people with the right skillsets. 

As a rule of thumb, crypto-native professionals have a crucial advantage: the ability to hit the ground running. High-stakes projects often operate under tight timelines, where every day counts. And sometimes, native crypto expertise can be indispensable. The roles where this is especially true involve foundational constructs of blockchain technology and its applications, where even the most skilled professionals may face a steep learning curve.

Smart-contract development is a prime example. These self-executing agreements, encoded directly on the blockchain, demand precision and an understanding of decentralized logic that's different from traditional programming. A single vulnerability in a smart contract can be catastrophic and result in millions of dollars in losses, making this a high-stakes discipline where it's important to know the rules of the road.

Onboarding talent into an industry with such a steep learning curve can be a challenge, as the candidate may require time to acclimate to the nuances of blockchain technology — decentralized vs. centralized, more open source, and so on — and the crypto “ethos,” which includes everything from different cultural lingo to mindsets. But there are many areas in which talent from non-crypto companies can fuel crypto's growth, especially as a company begins to scale. For example, traditional professionals with backgrounds in software engineering or operations can bring versatility and a breadth of experience honed through their experiences at larger software companies. These professionals have often worn multiple hats and have had to manage vast amounts of internal bureaucracy and barriers to get things shipped. In crypto's quickly growing multidisciplinary teams, this kind of operational flexibility becomes a powerful asset. 

Experience at scale also plays an important role. Traditional candidates have often worked on products used by millions, and they've confronted (and solved) the challenges that come with such success: Ensuring systems stay up under extreme infrastructure load, optimizing performance at scale, and preparing for unpredictable spikes in demand. This expertise translates directly to web3 products as they move from niche, crypto-savvy audiences to more mainstream adoption.

Candidates that come from fintech firms, for example, may have significant relevant experience in payments technology or financial regulations that may be important in your world too. Building infra? A consumer app? Well there's a world of talent that's been doing this for years at scale.Consider what experience overlaps and where you can ramp them on crypto specific tech to build your unicorn team in house. More broadly, candidates who have experience in design, user experience, scalability, security, and leadership can also help accelerate crypto innovation, as these skills often have domain expertise that transfers well and may even work better than someone who doesn't have this experience.. 

After you've identified the skills and people you need — including determining whether they really need to have crypto-native experience or not — the next step is to go out and recruit them.

The biggest challenge and the biggest opportunity are flip sides of the same coin: You're a crypto company. 

For some candidates coming from established companies, crypto industry volatility, recent regulatory uncertainty, insider jargon, and decentralized products will be too new or unappealing or both. For others, that same unfamiliarity and occasional instability will be exciting — a feature rather than a bug. In recruiting conversations, drill into how the candidate thinks about the stability and comfort of a big company versus the opportunities and challenges of a rapidly growing company. Walk them through a challenge your team encountered in the last few weeks, explain how it was handled and highlight the onus on each team member given the size and stage of the company. Their reaction may tell you how they might have responded in a similar situation and at the very least, will let them know what's expected of anyone at your company when the next situation arises.  

A candidate might not know a ton about crypto when you first make contact, but natural curiosity and interest in the benefits of decentralization are key. A big signal over the recruitment process will be how much their knowledge and engagement deepens along the way: Are they researching things on their own? Are they asking more specific questions based on learning new things from you and others?… and so on. 

To differentiate between the two types of candidates — the crypto-wary and the crypto-curious — and to avoid wasting your time and money, seek to understand people's motivations as early as possible to make sure they and your company are moving in the same direction. This is recruiting 101, but it's worth underlining because it's so important, especially in the crypto industry. 

Every pitch needs to be customized to each specific candidate: What drove them to their current job? What kept them in their past roles? Those same things are likely to be a critical part of their decision-making process this time around, too. Start learning the answers to those questions in your very first call with a candidate.

By the end of the recruiting process, you want to be hiring someone who is aligned with your company's vision and excited about your product. And your team needs to be excited to work with the new hire, too; that will help you align whether the candidate fits your company or not regardless of degree of crypto experience. That's always your north star. 

Since you're going after highly intellectually curious candidates, tailor your pitch accordingly to appeal to them. You might start by explaining the difference between the computer and the casino cultures of crypto (that the first sees blockchains as a way to build new networks powering a new computing movement, and the other is mainly interested in speculation, trading, and gambling). You could then share how the emergent industry offers them a unique chance to reshape the future of technology, not unlike the early days of the internet. 

A useful thought experiment is to figure out how to talk about your product and company without talking about crypto. What problems does your company solve? What inspired you to build it? Why will the world be a better place because of it? This will allow you to sell the premise and promise regardless of the underlying technology without your audience getting tripped up in the details. 

Another good starting point is simply to ask, “What do you know about crypto?” Even if you get skeptical answers — stories from the news, the casino-culture narrative — it will give you an opening, and allow you to listen for what they are really scared about: external factors (policy), intrinsic ones (tech complexity), personal ones (risk tolerance), and so on. You might share that many people in crypto agree with some of that skepticism, and bring the conversation around to the cool technical problems that your project is solving. 

Not everyone's primary motivation will be money, but be ready to highlight the financial rewards available, too. Historically, top talent has been reluctant to join early-stage companies for three reasons: (1) a grindfest culture, (2) bad work-life balance, and (3) lack of liquid compensation. Even if you solve for the first two, the third can eliminate a significant portion of your potential candidate pool. 

Compensation innovation, such as token-based structures, can provide both financial upside and liquidity at early-stage companies — compared to the rare liquidity events like an IPO or acquisition that you see in web2. Be sure to use a vesting/token grant schedule that locks people into the long term to some extent. Compensation is a complicated topic and is obviously top of mind for candidates, so make sure you're thoroughly prepared to talk about it. 

If you do these steps well, you'll have a solid chance of getting top talent from outside the industry interested in your company. Next, you'll want to help them see exactly how they can contribute their best work in their day-to-day roles.

Integrating new talent into web3 companies is about educating your new hires to shorten their ramp-up time. You'll know each person's gaps because you identified them in the interview process. Use that knowledge to design onboarding experiences that specifically close those gaps, and as quickly as possible. 

For example, new hires may need help to see beyond the technicalities of blockchain and decentralized systems, so they understand the real-world problems they'll be solving and gain confidence in their roles. 

Regular knowledge-sharing session between new hires and veteran employees with deeper crypto experience will foster collaboration and allow team members to learn from one another's strengths. Mentorship programs can pair newcomers with experienced web3 professionals to provide invaluable hands-on learning. Even better, you can structure the program so that crypto “unicorn” talent (someone who has all the skills, knowledge, and background) is paired with newcomers who can develop over time into crypto unicorns of their own.

Upskilling and education are also essential, and will remain so as the industry keeps evolving. Resources like blockchain-focused blogs, podcasts, and education courses -– in things like how to use a smart wallet, how to stake, tokenomics, smart contract design, or basic concepts around how blockchains are being leveraged in different use cases– offer a strong starting point for continual learning. Mentorship roles with established crypto organizations can provide practical experience, while thought leaders in the industry can offer insights through reports (including our own State of Crypto report). 

The key takeaway is, whatever your new hires need to excel, your job is to help them learn, find, or access it from day one. 

***

Regardless of whether you hire someone crypto-native or crypto-curious, your mantra should always be to: Hire smart people to build products that serve users. 

The transition to crypto isn't just about adopting new technology. It's about cultivating a shared vision that blends the best of both worlds. Experienced professionals bring critical expertise in scaling, usability, and strategic leadership, while crypto-native talent offers specialized knowledge of blockchain systems and decentralized principles. Together, they form the ideal team to tackle the challenges of a rapidly evolving industry.

But this won't all happen organically. To succeed, your organization must invest in thoughtful onboarding, collaborative team structures, and continuous education to set them up for that collaboration and success. This includes helping experienced talent see beyond the technicalities of crypto to understand the real-world problems they'll help solve and the transformative potential of their work. By fostering shared purpose and bridging gaps in knowledge and culture, the industry can accelerate innovation and unlock the full promise of crypto for all.

To coincide with the agreement of a “Tech Prosperity Deal” between the U.K. and the U.S. on Wednesday, American firms unveiled £31 billion ($42.3 billion) of planned investments in the U.K.

Leading the charge, Microsoft committed  to spending $30 billion over the next four years to fund its ongoing operations in the country and build new AI infrastructure.

Half of the money, which represents Microsoft's largest ever investment in the U.K., will be used to expand its data center footprint in the country. It will help finance a new supercomputer equipped with 23,000 Nvidia GPUs the firm said would be the largest in the country. 

Overall, Nvidia said  it plans to ship 120,000 Blackwell processors to the U.K., “representing the largest AI infrastructure rollout in the country's history.”

The chipmaker announced a fresh £500 million investment from BlackRock in partnership with Digital Gravity Partners, which will be used to upgrade existing data centers with new Nvidia tech. It also touted previous commitments to invest up to £11 billion in the U.K. 

Meanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang, who joined Donald Trump at Wednesday night's state banquet with the king, announced  that Nvidia would acquire a £500 million stake in NScale. 

The British AI infrastructure startup is a major beneficiary of the recent flurry of Big Tech investments, being a partner in Microsoft's supercomputer project and a joint venture with OpenAI and Nvidia announced on Tuesday.

Stargate UK plans  to deploy 8,000 GPUs in the first quarter of 2026, with the potential to scale to 31,000 processors over time.

Against Microsoft's headline investment, other hyperscaler's U.K. data center plans paled in comparison. 

On Tuesday, Google committed  £5 billion over two years to support AI research and cloud infrastructure development in the country. Meanwhile, Coreweave will spend  an additional £1.5 billion boosting its data centre capacity in the U.K.

Amid a whirlwind of announcements highlighting transatlantic collaboration on AI, crypto has so far been absent from the government's rhetoric. 

Prior to Trump's arrival in London, the crypto sector lobbied the government to include digital assets and stablecoins as a “core strand” of any deal with the U.S. 

According to the Financial Times, British officials still hope to agree on closer U.S.-U.K alignment on the issue. But as of Thursday, no such deal had been announced. And regardless of whether they reach an agreement on crypto, it doesn't appear to be a top priority for Westminster. 

Where the White House has centered crypto in its economic and technological vision for America, Kier Starmer's government has been far more reserved.

In May, then-Economic Secretary to the Treasury Lucy Reynolds ruled out establishing a national Bitcoin reserve equivalent to the one proposed by Donald Trump in the U.S. 

The U.K.'s approach to crypto is less bombastic. Lawmakers are focused on steady legislative progress rather than headline-grabbing initiatives and partisan battle lines.

A framework  drafted by the Treasury in April largely resembles proposals developed by the previous government, granting the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) new powers to regulate the crypto sector.

As it prepares for its expanded remit, the FCA has signalled  that it will exempt the sector from some of the strictest rules it imposes on traditional financial firms.

“We want to develop a sustainable and competitive crypto sector – balancing innovation, market integrity and trust,” David Geale, the FCA's executive director of payments and digital finance, said on Wednesday.

The first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offering exposure to XRP and dogecoin DOGE$0.2839 started trading in the U.S. on Thursday.

Products offered by Rex Shares and Osprey Funds listed on the Cboe BZX exchange under the tickers DOJE and XRPR and follow Rex-Osprey Solana ETF, which debuted in July. DOJE was recently trading at $26.90 and XRPR at $25.73.

DOJE will differ slightly from similar products for the other tokens, however, in that it will not hold DOGE directly. Instead, it will use a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary to gain exposure through futures and other derivatives. 

While XRPR is structured to hold XRP directly, it will also invest in spot ETFs from outside the U.S. to achieve exposure, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart wrote on X.

XRP, the native token of the financial institutional payments-focused network XRP Ledger, and memecoin DOGE are the third-largest and eighth largest crypto tokens by market cap, according to CoinDesk data.

Spot crypto ETFs debuted in the US. in January 2024 after many years of rejections and delays by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin BTC$117,545.53 funds were approved first, followed a few months later by ETFs offering spot exposure to ether (ETH).

Buying shares of ETFs offers exposure to assets without having to take ownership of the underlying asset themselves. As such, crypto ETFs offer a means of direct exposure to cryptocurrencies without having to worry about storage, custody and so on, making them a more practical and secure means of investment for deep-pocketed institutional investors.

XLM Technicals Signal Bullish Strength Amid 4% Rally

Analysts told CoinDesk early this week that major cryptocurrencies led by bitcoin would resume their slow grind higher following Wednesday's Fed rate cut. 

That's exactly what has happened since the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points to 4% late Wednesday. The central bank also hinted rapid easing in the next 12 months.

Bitcoin BTC$117,545.53, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, topped $117,900, the highest level since Aug. 17, ending the sideways trend since Friday and resuming the slow recovery from early September lows near $107,200, CoinDesk data show. As of writing, the cryptocurrency was up nearly 1% on a 24-hour basis.

Ethereum's ether (ETH) token, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was up 2.7%, but remained locked within the four-week-long narrowing price range, or contracting triangle, as noted by CoinDesk early this week.

Other majors such as dogecoin DOGE$0.2839, solana SOL$251.54 and BNB (BNB) were up over 4% while the payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP traded nearly 3% higher, looking to build upside momentum in the wake of a bullish descending triangle breakout.

Programmable blockchain Solana's SOL token briefly topped $245, almost testing the weekend high, as CME's decision to offer SOL options from Oct. 13 raised hopes of increased institutional participation. These options will help institutions manage their exposure more effectively. The CME is also going to debut XRP options on the same day.

Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said that the Fed's openness to accelerate the pace of easing is creating an asymmetric setup for bitcoin.

""The dots [interest rate projections] leaned more dovish, signaling the Fed is open to accelerating the pace of easing if conditions demand it. That repricing risk is now front and center - creating an asymmetric setup for Bitcoin. While today's 25bps cut provided the spark, it is the path implied by the dots - more than the cut itself - that may set the stage for Bitcoin to challenge new highs into year-end,"" Mena said in an email to CoinDesk.

He added that bitcoin could set an all-time high above $124,000 by the end of October, with ether topping the $5,000 psychological barrier.

The path to new lifetime highs, however, may not be smooth, as the dollar is showing signs of life.

Despite the dovish Fed rate projections, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, including the euro, has bounced to 97.30, quickly recovering from the initial drop below the July 1 low of 96.37.

Perhaps the Fed's dovishness is already factored in by the foreign exchange markets. After all, the DXY has dropped 10% this year largely on the back of Fed rate cut bets. BTC, too, has rallied by 25% this year, hitting new highs above $124,000 in August, supported by dovish Fed expectations.

The dollar's resilience likely reflects Chairman Jerome Powell's emphasis that rapid, successive rate cuts are not guaranteed. He also highlighted that quantitative tightening (balance sheet runoff) remains in effect and inflation continues to run high. These remarks dampened the optimism sparked by the dovish dot plot projections.

A strong bounce in the DXY could lead to financial tightening, potentially weighing on BTC and other risk assets.

Sophisticated market participants are pricing tail risk, according to crypto financial platform BloFin.

Tail risk refers to low-probability, high-impact events, such as market crashes or major economic crises, that cause disproportionately large losses, often occurring at the ""tails"" of a probability distribution.

""As one of the most interest rate-sensitive assets, the recent increase in interest rate risk has led to a growing demand for tail protection, prompting market makers and traders to incorporate more interest rate risk into their pricing. Meanwhile, block trades data also includes a short-dated (about 4DTE) put spread order with 2,000 contracts (clearly intended for tail protection), which is not often seen,"" BloFin told CoinDesk.

A put spread is a strategy designed to profit from a decline in the price of the underlying asset, in this case, BTC.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Tether, Tokenization Pioneers Unveil STBL Protocol Splitting Principal From Yield","https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/18/tether-tokenization-pioneers-unveil-startup-focused-on-genius-aligned-digital-dollars","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 11:03:45 GMT","

Traditional finance has long had a way of splitting capital from coupons, allowing investors to separate interest-payment flows from the principal. Now, a team of stablecoin and blockchain-based real-world asset (RWA) pioneers is doing the same for tokenized assets.

A new startup, STBL, emulates TradFi's zero-coupon strip structures by converting digital assets into a dollar-pegged stablecoin and yield-bearing non-fungible token (NFT). Just as with the traditional equivalent, the components can be held separately, allowing investors to keep the part that appeals to them and sell the other bit to counterparties with different attitudes to risk.

The product, currently in beta testing, goes beyond just packaging risk into different tranches. It also widens the stablecoin issuance model. With regular stablecoins, like USDT, the issuing company, in this case Tether, keeps the returns on the Treasuries they hold to maintain the token's peg to the dollar. It's profitable business, Tether reported $4.9 billion net profit in the second quarter. With STBL, whoever deposits a tokenized asset into the system becomes the minter and keeps the returns.

“Our mission at STBL is to evolve stablecoins from corporate products into public infrastructure,” said STBL co-founder Reeve Collins, who was also a cofounder of Tether. “For the first time, minters, not issuers, retain the value of reserves. This is the defining shift of Stablecoin 2.0: money that is stable, compliant, and built to serve the community.”

When a yield-bearing on-chain asset — this could be any yield-bearing RWA, such as Franklin Templeton's BENJI, BlackRock's BUIDL or Ondo's USDY — is deposited and locked into the STBL protocol, it splits into a stablecoin (USST) that can circulate and serve as collateral or reserves in decentralized finance (DeFi) and a separate, yield-accruing non-fungible token (NFT) called YLD.

The design is intended to remain a non-security in spirit and align with the U.S. GENIUS Act and other regulatory frameworks by separating principal from yield, said CEO Avtar Sehra, who is also a co-founder of the project and was CEO and founder of Kaio (formerly Libre Capital).

“When a user who's already whitelisted with a Franklin Templeton or BlackRock fund locks that asset into STBL, they receive an NFT that controls the vault,” Sehra said in an interview. “You hold the NFT and accrue interest, while the stable asset can be used as collateral, as reserves, or to mint an ecosystem-specific stablecoin aligned with GENIUS Act requirements.”

In the year or so before STBL started up, Sehra and Collins were looking at how RWAs or tokenized securities could be used in DeFi; asking how they worked as collateral; how money market funds became the reserves for minting stablecoins, and so on.

There had been a view that wrapping an asset, that is taking a tokenized security and placing it into a vault, meant the asset no longer counted as a security as far as U.S. regulations were concerned. But it's not clear that wrapping something ""deviates from or extracts the security-like essence"" of the asset, Sehra said.

To ensure the USST stablecoin component isn't viewed as a security required a mechanism to maintain the dollar peg. This is achieved by ensuring it is slightly over collateralized coupled with an incentive system related to mint fees and burn credits should deviation happen in a volatile market. Sehra referred to STBL's peg-maintenance system as “synthetic” rather than “algorithmic.”

“The reason I call it a synthetic is because, even though it has this interest-rate algorithmic component to it, it is 103% over collateralized with pure money market assets,” he said. “As a result of this novel structure, eligible participants that hold permitted RWAs can mint and burn compliant stablecoins. So while minters can hold the yield, the stable asset can be openly used without breaking the non-yield bearing requirements of the GENIUS Act. That's exactly how STBL operates.”

The protocol's decentralized governance token, also called STBL, has been added to Binance Alpha, Binance Futures and Kraken Spot, and will list on other spot exchanges soon, Sehra said.

The Sept. 16 debut of the STBL governance token has been lauded as one of the most successful token generating events of 2025, Sehra added. It launched at $100 million fully diluted value, and demand pushed it over $1 billion. It is currently at $1.3 billion, having hit an all time high of about $2.3 billion within 24 hours.

The next steps involve a $100 million minting using Franklin Templeton's BENJI token, Sehra said, and also the announcement of several other partnerships, including with a U.S. based payments firm. The protocol is due to open to the public in the fourth quarter.

Spot bitcoin BTC$117,545.53 ETFs saw their first daily outflows in over a week on Wednesday, shedding a net $51.28 million, as investors reacted to the Federal Reserve's unexpectedly cautious outlook on future policy.

The outflow broke a seven-day streak that had brought in nearly $3 billion. Assets under management remain above $150 billion, according to SoSoValue data, but the tone in markets shifted after Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized economic uncertainty and signaled fewer cuts ahead than traders had hoped.

As expected, the Fed lowered its benchmark rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to a range of 4.00% to 4.25%, in its first cut of the year. But the real surprise came from the central bank's updated projections, which indicated just two more cuts in 2025 and fewer in 2026 than markets had priced in.

In a cautious press conference, Powell warned of “elevated” inflation and rising “downside risks” to employment, striking a tone that left traders wary. Markets interpreted the move as a hawkish cut, triggering a mild pullback in risk assets.

Ethereum ETFs also saw redemptions, with net outflows for a second straight day. Withdrawals amounted to $1.89 million following the exit of $61.7 million the day before.

Cryptocurrency prices edged higher. Bitcoin rose around 0.3% in the last 24 hours while ether moved up 1.7%. The broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index rose 2%.

 HYPE tokens closed at nearly $60 in an all-time high after 8% daily gains, while Binance-backed rival ASTER surged 350%. 

The native token for the decentralized crypto derivatives exchange Hyperliquid hit a new peak price level on Thursday as altcoins outperformed on Fed rate cuts.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) hit an all-time high of $59.29 during early trading on Thursday following a daily gain of around 8%. 

The asset, which has a market capitalization of just under $16 billion, has surged almost 40% over the past month, massively outperforming the top three cryptocurrencies by market capitalization: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP). 

Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange for perpetual futures, derivative contracts without an expiry date, allowing speculators to take leveraged positions on crypto assets without owning them.

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes was one of the first to comment on the milestone on Thursday, calling it an “All-time Hype.”

In August, Hayes said that the token has a potential 126 times upside, adding that stablecoin expansion would push the DEX's annualized fees to $258 billion, from its current annualized revenue of $1.2 billion. 

Nansen highlighted one trader who has a leveraged long position on HYPE with a position value of $30 million. 

The analytics platform reported that the trader is currently holding an unrealized profit of $1.39 million and is still adding to the position. They first started longing around three hours ago, and have been adding around 123 HYPE to their position every 30 seconds.

HYPE is one of today's top altcoin performers, with only Avalanche (AVAX) doing better in the top 40 with a 9.5% gain. 

A few hours prior to the HYPE peak, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao posted a chart for ASTER, the native token of a rival derivatives DEX.

ASTER, which launched as Aster Chain in July, is a new crypto derivatives exchange backed by CZ-affiliated YZi Labs, formerly Binance Labs and BNB Chain's leading DEX PancakeSwap, as a direct competitor to Hyperliquid. 

The native token, which began trading on Wednesday, has already surged more than 350% to an all-time high of $0.50, according to CoinMarketCap. 

“CZ rarely shares charts. But he posted ASTER. Why? Because it's a direct Hyperliquid rival, and Hyperliquid keeps stealing Binance's market share,” commented Hunters of Web3 founder “LANGERIUS.”

In April, Cointelegraph reported that Hyperliquid trading volumes were cutting into Binance's share. However, the DEX has a long way to go with a current daily volume of $790 million, compared to Binance's $34 billion, according to CoinGecko.

 DBS, Franklin Templeton and Ripple will offer tokenized trading and lending services on the XRP Ledger to attract institutional investors. 

DBS, Franklin Templeton and Ripple have joined forces to roll out tokenized trading and lending services for institutional investors, built on the XRP Ledger and powered by tokenized money market funds and stablecoins.

The trio signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to help investors better manage market volatility by offering a way to shift funds between stablecoins and yield-generating assets, according to a Thursday announcement.

“Digital asset investors need solutions that can meet the unique demands of a borderless 24/7 asset class,” said Lim Wee Kian, CEO of DBS Digital Exchange. “This partnership demonstrates how tokenized securities can play that role while injecting greater efficiency and liquidity in global financial markets,” Kian added. 

DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx) will list sgBENJI, a tokenized version of Franklin Templeton's US Dollar Short-Term Money Market Fund, alongside Ripple USD (RLUSD). This setup will allow clients to trade between RLUSD and sgBENJI at any time, helping them rebalance portfolios quickly and earn yields during uncertain market conditions.

In the next phase, DBS plans to let clients use sgBENJI as collateral to unlock credit, either through repurchase agreements with the bank or third-party lending platforms, with DBS acting as the collateral agent. 

Franklin Templeton will issue sgBENJI on the XRP Ledger, which was chosen for its low fees and high-speed settlement. 

Ripple's Nigel Khakoo called the effort a “game-changer,” noting that investors can move between a stablecoin and a tokenized fund within a “single, trusted ecosystem, unlocking real-world capital efficiency, utility and liquidity that institutions demand.”

The move targets a growing demand from institutions looking for regulated, onchain products. According to a recent survey by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon, 87% of institutional investors expect to allocate funds to digital assets by 2025.

Cointelegraph reached out to DBS and Franklin Templeton for comment, but had not received a response by publication.

DBS, Franklin Templeton and Ripple's plan to launch tokenized lending comes as tokenized assets are gaining ground in global capital markets.

As Cointelegraph reported, SBI Shinsei Bank has partnered with Singapore's Partior and Japan's DeCurret DCP to explore multicurrency tokenized deposits for cross-border settlements. The trio signed an MOU to develop a blockchain-based framework that enables real-time clearing across various currencies.

 Australia's financial regulator has granted licensing exemptions for intermediaries distributing AFS-licensed stablecoins, starting with AUDM. 

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has introduced licensing exemptions for intermediaries involved in the distribution of stablecoins issued by licensed entities.

Under the newly published ASIC Corporations (Stablecoin Distribution Exemption) Instrument 2025/631, intermediaries distributing a stablecoin issued by an Australian financial services (AFS) licensee are no longer required to hold their own AFS, market or clearing and settlement facility licenses.

“ASIC is committed to supporting responsible innovation in the rapidly evolving digital assets space, while ensuring important consumer protections are in place by having eligible stablecoins issued under an AFS licence,” the regulator said in a Thursday announcement. 

According to ASIC, the exemption only applies to stablecoins classified as financial products under the current Corporations Act and issued by eligible AFS-licensed entities.

Related: Coinbase, OKX push crypto into Australia's retirement system

Currently, the exemption applies to a single issuer, Catena Digital Pty, which issues the AUDM stablecoin. However, ASIC said it may extend the scope of the exemption as more stablecoin issuers obtain AFS licenses.

The exemption covers a range of financial services related to secondary stablecoin distribution, including providing general advice, making a market, dealing in (but not issuing) the stablecoin and custodial services.

The measure follows public feedback on a recent consultation paper that explored updates to ASIC's crypto asset guidance. Industry stakeholders flagged the burdensome compliance costs for intermediaries under current licensing rules, especially during a transitional period.

ASIC said this relief will be a bridge until those reforms, particularly a proposed licensing framework for payment stablecoins, are fully implemented. The exemption is temporary and will expire on June 1, 2028, unless repealed earlier.

Australian crypto users continue to face restrictions from banks when depositing funds into exchanges, according to a new Binance survey. Of the 1,900 respondents, 58% called for easier, unlimited deposits, while 22% reported switching banks to gain better crypto access.

The friction persists despite notable regulatory progress, including Anti-Money Laundering rules for exchanges since 2018 and the launch of spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs in 2024.

 Rich Dad, Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki says he believes in accumulating gold, silver, oil, Bitcoin and Ether, which he deems “hard money.” 

Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki, a strong proponent for Bitcoin, says it is “criminal” that kids are being taught from a young age to work for an inflationary currency while arguing the virtues of Bitcoin. 

“Go to school, get a job, work hard, save money, and invest in a 401(k) full of garbage,” Kiyosaki said during a podcast hosted by Bitcoin Collective Co-Founder Jordan Walker on Wednesday. 

Kiyosaki pulled no punches as he lambasted central banks, equating them to “criminal organizations” and even calling them “Marxists,” as he says that every time central banks print money, it makes the rich richer, while the other economic classes suffer.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' headline inflation calculator, a person holding $1,000 from August 2000 to August 2025 has lost nearly 47% of their purchasing power due to headline inflation.

The Federal Reserve has set a target of 2% inflation per year; however, since 2021, the agency has not managed to get inflation to that mark. August's headline inflation came in at 2.9%, while core inflation stood at 3.2%.

Meanwhile, BTC has rallied more than 900% in the past five years, from around $11,670 to approximately $117,200 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko.

The American author stated that it took him a long time to understand Bitcoin, but he started buying Bitcoin at the $6,000 mark and currently holds 60 BTC, worth around $7 million.

“And Bitcoin, when it came out, it took me a while to figure it out. Like I bought it at $6,000, and I'm still saying, ‘Why didn't you buy more, asshole?' But today, I don't have that many. I have about 60 Bitcoin, you know,” Kiyosaki said.

Kiyosaki said he now uses the proceeds from his rental properties to accumulate oil, gold, silver, Bitcoin and Ethereum.

In April, Kiyosaki predicted that Bitcoin would reach the $1 million milestone by the next decade.

Despite being bullish on BTC, Kiyosaki had previously taken a contrarian view on the asset, saying that “odds are gold, silver and Bitcoin will bust too,” and that's when he will start accumulating more of these assets.

He further advised investors to be cautious of ETFs, as these are “paper assets” and are thus vulnerable to a bank run; however, the American author admitted that ETFs are the easiest way for retail investors to invest in assets.

Kiyosaki's claims in the podcast have some merit. Inflation, especially hyperinflation, erodes the purchasing power of ordinary people.

Interestingly, people in nations where inflation is eating away at their hard-earned money increasingly turn to crypto to protect themselves financially.

The people of Venezuela have begun using stablecoins, especially Tether (USDT), as part of their daily life, as the annual inflation rate touched 229%.

At the start of the year, one US dollar could be traded for 51.95 Venezuelan bolívar. Today, the same dollar can buy 161.74 Venezuelan bolívar, according to foreign exchange processor Xe.

Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Standard author Saifedean Ammous has stated that investors will flock towards the US dollar and Bitcoin, as he expects the Argentine peso's devaluation will cause people to dump the currency and the country's bonds.

Real Vision co-founder and CEO Raoul Pal has also called on investors to hold more crypto and NFTs to protect themselves from exponential currency debasement.

It's all thanks to a titanium beam.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has announced a new way to reliably make element 116, livermorium. The results, made by using a titanium beam to irradiate a sample, could point toward the elusive “island of stability” for even heavier nuclear elements—and show researchers a route to create the next feasible element, number 120.

Many of us remember a time when the periodic table appeared with some curious blank spots. Your age determines what those blank spots were, but they've been consistent, because discovery of elements has never been in full numerical order. Their availability has depended on location, stability, and accessibility of both the naturally occurring forms and a method to separate them. 

After a certain point, the elements transition from naturally occurring to laboratory-prepared. These elements may exist somewhere in the universe, but Earth is not cold enough, high-pressure enough, and so forth to create those conditions outside a lab. But inside labs like Berkeley, they use increasingly advanced technologies to jam more protons inside the nuclei of atoms in order to create these new elements.

In their preprint paper, a large team of scientists explain that we've reached the limits of a current generation method to make new heavy elements. The heaviest discovery to date, element 118 oganesson, was made using a beam of calcium isotope 48 particles. Calcium 48, with its definitive 20 protons plus 28 neutrons, is a common and very effective starter for physical chemistry. 

At the same time, we've now run out of materials to beam Calcium 48 into in order to produce new elements. While it's true that we only need to keep pumping protons into existing nuclei, the atoms we start with need to have a lot of protons in order to support that reaction. To make elements 119 or 120, the researchers explain, they'd need einsteinium (99)  or fermium (100). “Unfortunately, neither of these elements can be produced in sufficient quantities to produce a suitable target,” they write.

So, what's a super heavy element enjoyer to do? The next big thing in physical chemistry, it seems, is titanium. 

Titanium 50 has 22 protons plus 28 neutrons and is very stable. These scientists brought it in as titanium 50 oxide, reduced it to just titanium, and then cooked it into a beam of ions using a special oven. Over a period of 22 days, the beam irradiated a plutonium foil and triggered the nuclear reactions that create element 116, livermorium. The researchers were pleased with how well the beam held together and performed.

The titanium 50 beam is proof of concept after a period of intensive research and experimentation. If heavy element chemistry were a sports franchise, they won the world championships with calcium 48, and then had to take time to rebuild after everyone retired. Now, a new generation of players is ready to take over full time. The titanium 50 beam has new benefits and drawbacks, and its potential is even better in the long run.

You may wonder why these heavy elements are worth all this exploration and experimentation. The thing is, we just don't know yet what might happen when using these extraordinary and strange elements. Scientists want to find out, and that research could reveal properties and use cases we can't even dream of today—but we can only make a few atoms at a time, and they last for just microseconds before the protons spray back out of the nucleus. It's impossible to do further research.

For decades, scientists have predicted the existence of an island of stability in the extended catalog of elements and their isotopes. Cramming nuclei full of protons is inherently unstable because the protons act like the wrong ends of a magnet, but the island of stability may hold isotopes that last far longer without decaying. There are scientific explanations for this, including theories about layers of particles in the nucleus, and “magic numbers” of protons and neutrons that may be stable in combination.

If we can find stable super heavy elements, scientists may be able to make much larger samples that can be subjected to more rigorous experimentation. Elements have always had the capacity to surprise us, like mercury, which is a liquid metal at room temperature; bismuth, which always repels magnets; and copper, which is responsible for almost a rainbow of naturally occurring colors by itself.

What's the mercury or bismuth of the super heavy elements? We can only find out once there's enough to play with. The titanium 50 beam, or something similar inspired by it, could unearth the next half dozen elements—and one or more could be our stable holy grail.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Nestled between Hawaii and the western coast of Mexico lies the Pacific Ocean's Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 4.5 million-kilometer-square area of abyssal plain bordered by the Clarion and Clipperton Fracture Zones. Although this stretch of sea is a vibrant ecosystem filled with marine life, the CCZ is known best for its immense collection of potato-sized rocks known as polymetallic nodules. 

These rocks, of which there are potentially trillions, are filled with rich deposits of nickel, manganese, copper, zinc, cobalt. Those particular metals are vital for the batteries needed to power a green energy future, leading some mining companies to refer to nodules as a “battery in a rock.”

However, a study reports that these nodules might be much more than simply a collection of valuable materials for electric cars—they also produce oxygen 4,000 meters below the surface where sunlight can't reach. 

This unexpected source of “dark oxygen,” as it's called, redefines the role these nodules play in the CZZ. The rocks could also rewrite the script on not only how life began on this planet, but also its potential to take hold on other worlds within our Solar System, such as Enceladus or Europa. The results of this study were published in the journal Nature Geoscience. 

“For aerobic life to begin on the planet,” Andrew Sweetman, deep-sea ecologist with the Scottish Association for Marine Science and lead author of the study said in a press statement, “there had to be oxygen and our understanding has been that Earth's oxygen supply began with photosynthetic organisms. But we now know that there is oxygen produced in the deep sea, where there is no light. I think we therefore need to revisit questions like: where could aerobic life have begun?”

The journey toward this discovery began more than a decade ago when Sweetman began analyzing how oxygen levels decreased further into the depths of the ocean. So it came as a surprise in 2013 when sensors returned increased levels of oxygen in the CCZ. At the time, Sweetman dismissed the data as the result of faulty sensors, but future studies showed that this abyssal plain somehow produced oxygen. Taking note of the nodule's “battery in a rock” tagline, Sweetman wondered if the minerals found in these nodules were somehow acting as a kind of “geobattery” by separating hydrogen and oxygen via seawater electrolysis. 

A 2023 study showed that various bacteria and archaea can create “dark oxygen,” so Sweetman and his team recreated the conditions of the CCZ in a laboratory and killed off any microorganisms with mercury chloride—surprisingly, oxygen levels continued rising. According to Scientific American, Sweetman found a voltage of roughly 0.95 volts on the surface of these nodules, likely charging up as they grow with different deposits growing irregularly throughout, and this natural charge is enough to split the seawater. 

This discovery adds more fuel to the already-fiery debate over what to do with these nodules. Mining outfits like the Metals Company, the CEO of which coined the phrase “battery in a rock,” sees these nodules as the answer to our energy problems. However, 25 countries want the governing body—the International Seabed Authority (ISA) Council—to implement a moratorium, or at the very least a precautionary pause, so more research can be conducted to see how mining these nodules could affect the ocean. This is especially vital considering that the world's seas are already facing a litany of climate challenges, including acidification, deoxygenation, and pollution. 

In response to this discovery, Scripps Institution of Oceanography's Lisa Levin, who wasn't involved with the study, highlighted why such a moratorium is so important for protecting these deep-sea nodules in a comment to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition: 

The ISA is still negotiating with key players on deep-sea mining regulations. 

So while the future of the world's oceans is approaching a critical moment of conservation or exploitation, science has proven once again that disrupting these ecosystems could have consequences we can't even imagine.

The ocean is a wondrous place—let's keep our waste out of it.

Here's what you will learn when you read this story:

From the 1930s until the 1970s, multiple government agencies approved the dumping of hazardous materials, including chemicals such as DDT and other caustic waste, at 14 locations off the coast of California. According to the Los Angeles Times, the idea at the time was that “dilution was the solution to pollution,” essentially using the immensity of the world's oceans to dilute harmful chemicals to a harmless level of parts per million (ppm).

The idea did not go according to plan, a disconcerting prospect with an estimated half a million barrels still underwater today. 

Armed with the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) SuBastian aboard the research vessel Falkor, scientists from UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography took a closer look at these barrels littering the ocean floor and found something distressing. There appeared to be a ghostly halo emanating from many of them, suggesting something was leaking out into the ocean environment. In a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) Nexus, the authors detail the concerning results of humanity's broad disregard for oceanic ecosystems. 

While the researchers were expecting to find concentrations of DDT—a pesticide that serves as the main chemical antagonist of Rachel Carson's famous book Silent Spring, and whose use is now illegal in the U.S.—they instead discovered that the halos were created from alkaline caustic waste that form an extremophile environment. The team says the halos mimic the conditions of areas such as hydrothermal vents.

“DDT was not the only thing that was dumped in this part of the ocean and we have only a very fragmented idea of what else was dumped there,” Johanna Gutleben, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “We only find what we are looking for and up to this point we have mostly been looking for DDT. Nobody was thinking about alkaline waste before this and we may have to start looking for other things as well.”

The halos formed a thick, concrete-like crust, which was difficult for the ROV to collect using coring devices. Instead, the SuBastian relied on its robotic arm to tear off pieces for further analysis. The research shows that when alkaline waste leaked from the barrels, its reactions with magnesium in the seawater created brucite, the mineral form of magnesium hydroxide. Where this high pH material meets seawater at the edges, it forms calcium carbonate—the chalky, outer edge of the halo. 

“It's shocking that 50-plus years later you're still seeing these effects,” Paul Jensen, another co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “We can't quantify the environmental impact without knowing how many of these barrels with white halos are out there, but it's clearly having a localized impact on microbes.”

Unfortunately, removing these ecological disasters isn't simple, as disturbing the ocean floor would likely create sediment plumes that spread the contamination further throughout the water column. The best hope is to study the DDT-poisoned sediments and see what microbes could possibly break down the chemical and slowly clean-up this short-sighted, human-made disaster. 

Whether its DDT, caustic waste, microplastics, trash, or other kinds of refuse, the mindset of viewing the ocean as the world's dumping ground is one that's sadly still alive and well to this day.

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. If detected early, it can be efficiently treated, but the cost and discomfort of colonoscopies -- the main diagnostic method currently in use -- often result in delayed diagnosis. Using machine learning algorithms, a team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) identified for the first time all human gut bacteria to a level of detail that makes it possible to understand the physiological importance of the different microbial subgroups. This inventory was then used to detect the presence of colorectal cancer according to the bacteria present in simple stool samples, a non-invasive and low-cost screening tool. The potential applications are vast, ranging from the diagnosis of other cancers to a better understanding of the links between gut microbiota and health. These findings are published in Cell Host & Microbe.

Colorectal cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage when treatment options are limited. This underscores the need for simpler, less invasive diagnostic tools, particularly in the face of a still unexplained rise in cases among young adults. While it has long been known that gut microbiota plays a role in the development of colorectal cancer, translating these findings into clinical practice has proven challenging. This is because different strains of the same bacterial species can have opposite effects, with some promoting the disease and others having no effect.

""Instead of relying on the analysis of the various species composing the microbiota, which does not capture all meaningful differences, or of bacterial strains, which vary greatly from one individual to another, we focused on an intermediate level of the microbiota, the subspecies,"" explains Mirko Trajkovski, full professor in the Department of Cell Physiology and Metabolism and in the Diabetes Centre at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine, who led this research. ""The subspecies resolution is specific and can capture the differences in how bacteria function and contribute to diseases including cancer, while remaining general enough to detect these changes among different groups of individuals, populations, or countries.""

With the help of machine learning

The first step was to analyse huge amounts of data. ""As a bioinformatician, the challenge was to come up with an innovative approach for mass data analysis,"" recalls Matija Trickovic, PhD student in the laboratory of Mirko Trajkovski and first author of this study. ""We successfully developed the first comprehensive catalogue of human gut microbiota subspecies, together with a precise and efficient method to use it both for research and in the clinic.""

By combining this catalogue with existing clinical data, the scientists developed a model that can predict the presence of colorectal cancer solely based on the bacteria present in stool samples. ""Although we were confident in our strategy, the results were striking,"" enthuses Matija Trickovic. ""Our method detected 90% of cancer cases, a result very close to the 94% detection rate achieved by colonoscopies and better than all current non-invasive detection methods.""

By integrating more clinical data, this model could become even more precise and match the accuracy of colonoscopy. It could become a routine screening tool and facilitate the early detection of colorectal cancer, which would then be confirmed by colonoscopy but only in a selected group of patients.

A new world of applications

A first clinical trial is being set up in collaboration with the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) to determine more precisely the cancer stages and the lesions that can be detected. However, the applications go beyond colorectal cancer. By studying the differences between subspecies from the same bacterial species, researchers can now identify the mechanisms of action by which the gut microbiota influences human health. ""The same method could soon be used to develop non-invasive diagnostic tools for a wide range of diseases, all based on a single microbiota analysis,"" concludes Mirko Trajkovski.

Nitazenes -- a class of highly potent synthetic opioids -- are rapidly emerging as a major contributor to the overdose crisis, according to a Pain Medicine review published on Sept 14 by authors from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

Originally developed in the 1950s but never approved for clinical use, these substances are over 20 times more potent than fentanyl and hundreds to thousands of times more potent than morphine.

They can come in liquid, pills or powder form and have been found in substances sold via social media and on the illicit drug market since 2019.

Created as a potential pain reliever but never approved for medical use in humans or studied in a clinical trial, nitazenes are an illegal Schedule I drug that can be difficult to detect with standard drug tests and are often mixed into counterfeit pills or other street drugs.

""For patients, especially those with opioid use disorder or those exposed to illicit substances, nitazenes pose a serious and often hidden threat,"" said co-author Shravani Durbhakula, MD, associate professor of Anesthesiology, Division of Pain Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

""Because these drugs may not show up on routine toxicology screens, clinicians could miss a critical piece of the diagnosis during overdose treatment. Patients may also need higher or repeated doses of naloxone to reverse their effects,"" she said.

The Tennessee State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (TN SUDORS) identified a total of 92 nitazene-involved fatal drug overdoses among Tennessee residents from 2019-2023.

In Tennessee, naloxone was administered in only one in three deaths involving nitazenes, and in all nitazene-involved deaths the drug was laced with other substances, most commonly fentanyl and methamphetamine.

""Many people consuming nitazenes don't even know they're taking them,"" Durbhakula said. ""These substances are often adulterants in pills sold as other opioids, making public education more important than ever.

""We also want to stress that this is not just a drug issue; it is a public health emergency. Addressing it will require collaboration between clinicians, public health officials, law enforcement and community organizations to implement harm-reduction strategies, support addiction treatment, and raise awareness about these evolving threats,"" she added.

The authors recommend expanding access to new test strips that can detect nitazenes and for at-risk patients to have access to take-home naloxone, addiction treatment and education about counterfeit pills.

""Nitazenes are an emerging class of synthetic opioids that are even more potent than fentanyl and often undetected by routine drug tests,"" said corresponding author Ryan Mortman, MD, a resident in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

""Their rapid spread in the illicit drug market, combined with the difficulty of reversing overdoses, underscores the urgent need for public awareness, early recognition, and expanded access to harm-reduction tools such as naloxone,"" he said.

Co-authorTrent Emerick, MD, associate professor of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine and Bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine, said next steps are to generate human clinical data to better understand nitazenes' effects, especially long-term health impacts, metabolism and response to treatments like naloxone.

""The opioid crisis continues to evolve, and a thorough understanding of the mechanisms and risks of nitazenes is crucial for pain physicians, anesthesiologists and other providers,"" Emerick said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists build micromotors smaller than a human hair","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918025025.htm","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 07:53:45 GMT","

Researchers at the University of Gothenburg have made light-powered gears on a micrometer scale. This paves the way for the smallest on-chip motors in history, which can fit inside a strand of hair.

Gears are everywhere - from clocks and cars to robots and wind turbines. For more than 30 years, researchers have been trying to create even smaller gears in order to construct micro-engines. But progress stalled at 0.1 millimeters, as it was not possible to build the drive trains needed to make them move any smaller.

Researchers from Gothenburg University, among others, have now broken through this barrier by ditching traditional mechanical drive trains and instead using laser light to set the gears in motion directly.

Gears powered by light

In their new study, the researchers shows that microscopic machines can be driven by optical metamaterials - small, patterned structures that can capture and control light on a nanoscale. Using traditional lithography, gears with an optical metamaterial are manufactured with silicon directly on a microchip, with the gear having a diameter of a few tens of micrometers. By shining a laser on the metamaterial, the researchers can make the gear wheel spin. The intensity of the laser light controls the speed, and it is also possible to change the direction of the gear wheel by changing the polarization of the light.

The researchers are thus close to creating micromotors.

A new way of thinking 

""We have built a gear train in which a light-driven gear sets the entire chain in motion. The gears can also convert rotation into linear motion, perform periodic movements and control microscopic mirrors to deflect light,"" says the study's first author, Gan Wang, a researcher in soft matter physics at the University of Gothenburg.

The ability to integrate such machines directly onto a chip and drive them with light opens up entirely new possibilities. Since laser light does not require any fixed contact with the machine and is easy to control, the micromotor can be scaled up to complex microsystems.

""This is a fundamentally new way of thinking about mechanics on a microscale. By replacing bulky couplings with light, we can finally overcome the size barrier,"" says Gan Wang.

Cell size

With these advances, researchers are beginning to imagine micro- and nanomachines that can control light, manipulate small particles or be integrated into future lab-on-a-chip systems. A gear wheel can be as small as 16-20 micrometers, and there are human cells of that size. Medicine is a field that is within reach, believes Gan Wang.

""We can use the new micromotors as pumps inside the human body, for example to regulate various flows. I am also looking at how they function as valves that open and close.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Tiny protein pairs may hold the secret to life's origin","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250917221005.htm","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 13:57:49 GMT","

Genes are the building blocks of life, and the genetic code provides the instructions for the complex processes that make organisms function. But how and why did it come to be the way it is? A recent study from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign sheds new light on the origin and evolution of the genetic code, providing valuable insights for genetic engineering and bioinformatics.

""We find the origin of the genetic code mysteriously linked to the dipeptide composition of a proteome, the collective of proteins in an organism,"" said corresponding author Gustavo Caetano-Anollés, professor in the Department of Crop Sciences, the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, and Biomedical and Translation Sciences of Carle Illinois College of Medicine at U. of I.

Caetano-Anollés' work focuses on phylogenomics, which is the study of evolutionary relationships between the genomes of organisms. His research team previously built phylogenetic trees mapping the evolutionary timelines of protein domains (structural units in proteins) and transfer RNA (tRNA), an RNA molecule that delivers amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis. In this study, they explored the evolution of dipeptide sequences (basic modules of two amino acids linked by a peptide bond), finding the histories of domains, tRNA, and dipeptides all match.

Life on Earth began 3.8 billion years ago, but genes and the genetic code did not emerge until 800,000 million years later, and there are competing theories about how it happened.

Some scientists believe RNA-based enzymatic activity came first, while others suggest proteins first started working together. The research of Caetano-Anollés and his colleagues over the past decades supports the latter view, showing that ribosomal proteins and tRNA interactions appeared later in the evolutionary timeline.

Life runs on two codes that work hand in hand, Caetano-Anollés explained. The genetic code stores instructions in nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), while the protein code tells enzymes and other molecules how to keep cells alive and running. Bridging the two is the ribosome, the cell's protein factory, which assembles amino acids carried by tRNA molecules into proteins. The enzymes that load the amino acids onto the tRNAs are called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. These synthetase enzymes serve as guardians of the genetic code, monitoring that everything works properly.

""Why does life rely on two languages - one for genes and one for proteins?"" Caetano-Anollés asked. ""We still don't know why this dual system exists or what drives the connection between the two. The drivers couldn't be in RNA, which is functionally clumsy. Proteins, on the other hand, are experts in operating the sophisticated molecular machinery of the cell.""

The proteome appeared to be a better fit to hold the early history of the genetic code, with dipeptides playing a particularly significant role as early structural modules of proteins. There are 400 possible dipeptide combinations whose abundances vary across different organisms.

The research team analyzed a dataset of 4.3 billion dipeptide sequences across 1,561 proteomes representing organisms from the three superkingdoms of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. They used the information to construct a phylogenetic tree and a chronology of dipeptide evolution. They also mapped the dipeptides to a tree of protein structural domains to see if similar patterns arose.

In previous work, the researchers had built a phylogeny of tRNA that helped provide a timeline of the entry of amino acids into the genetic code, categorizing amino acids into three groups based on when they appeared. The oldest were Group 1, which included tyrosine, serine, and leucine, and Group 2, with 8 additional amino acids. These two groups were associated with the origin of editing in synthetase enzymes, which corrected inaccurate loading of amino acids, and an early operational code, which established the first rules of specificity, ensuring each codon corresponds to a single amino acid. Group 3 included amino acids that came later and were linked to derived functions related to the standard genetic code.

The team had already demonstrated the co-evolution of synthetases and tRNA in relation to the appearance of amino acids. Now, they could add dipeptides to the analysis.

""We found the results were congruent,"" Caetano-Anollés explained. ""Congruence is a key concept in phylogenetic analysis. It means that a statement of evolution obtained with one type of data is confirmed by another. In this case, we examined three sources of information: protein domains, tRNAs, and dipeptide sequences. All three reveal the same progression of amino acids being added to the genetic code in a specific order.""

Another novel finding was duality in the appearance of dipeptide pairs. Each dipeptide combines two amino acids, for example, alanine-leucine (AL), while a symmetrical one -- an anti-dipeptide -- has the opposite combination of leucine-alanine (LA). The two dipeptides in a pair are complementary; they can be considered mirror images of each other.

""We found something remarkable in the phylogenetic tree,"" Caetano-Anollés said. ""Most dipeptide and anti-dipeptide pairs appeared very close to each other on the evolutionary timeline. This synchronicity was unanticipated. The duality reveals something fundamental about the genetic code with potentially transformative implications for biology. It suggests dipeptides were arising encoded in complementary strands of nucleic acid genomes, likely minimalistic tRNAs that interacted with primordial synthetase enzymes.""

Dipeptides did not arise as arbitrary combinations but as critical structural elements that shaped protein folding and function. The study suggests that dipeptides represent a primordial protein code emerging in response to the structural demands of early proteins, alongside an early RNA-based operational code. This process was shaped by co-evolution, molecular editing, catalysis, and specificity, ultimately giving rise to the synthetase enzymes, the modern guardians of the genetic code.

Uncovering the evolutionary roots of the genetic code deepens our understanding of life's origin, and it informs modern fields such as genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and biomedical research.

""Synthetic biology is recognizing the value of an evolutionary perspective. It strengthens genetic engineering by letting nature guide the design. Understanding the antiquity of biological components and processes is important because it highlights their resilience and resistance to change. To make meaningful modifications, it is essential to understand the constraints and underlying logic of the genetic code,"" Caetano-Anollés said.

The paper, ""Tracing the origin of the genetic code and thermostability to dipeptide sequences in proteomes,"" is published in the Journal of Molecular Biology Authors include Minglei Wang, M. Fayez Aziz and Gustavo Caetano-Anollés.

The study was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (MCB-0749836 and OISE-1132791), the United States Department of Agriculture (ILLU-802-909 and ILLU-483-625) and Blue Waters supercomputer allocations from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications to Caetano-Anollés.

Wildfire activity has increased in the US and is projected to accelerate under future climate change 1–3. However, our understanding of the impacts of climate change on wildfire activity, smoke, and health outcomes remains highly uncertain, due to the difficulty of modeling the causal chain from climate to wildfire to air pollution and health. Here we quantify the mortality burden in the US due to wildfire smoke fine particulate matter (PM2.5) under climate change. We construct an ensemble of statistical and machine learning models that link climate to wildfire smoke PM2.5, and empirically estimate smoke PM2.5-mortality relationships using data on all recorded deaths in the US. We project that smoke PM2.5 could result in 71,420 excess deaths (95% CI: 34,930 - 98,430) per year by 2050 under a high warming scenario (SSP3-7.0) – a 73% increase relative to estimated 2011-2020 average annual excess deaths from smoke. Cumulative excess deaths from smoke PM2.5 could reach 1.9 million between 2026-2055. We find evidence for mortality impacts of smoke PM2.5 that last up to three years after exposure. When monetized, climate-driven smoke deaths result in economic damages that exceed existing estimates of climate-driven damages from all other causes combined in the US 4,5. Our research suggests that the health impacts of climate-driven wildfire smoke could be among the most important and costly consequences of a warming climate in the US.

Global warming intensifies wildfires and exacerbates greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions1. However, global projections remain incomplete, hindering effective policy interventions amid uncertain warming futures2. Here, we developed an interpretable machine learning framework to project global burned areas and wildfire emissions. This framework accounts for the impacts of future climate change on fire activity and quantifies associated premature deaths and radiative forcing from fire-induced particulate matter (PM2.5). Here we show that from 2010–2014 to 2095–2099, fire carbon emissions are projected to increase by 23% under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2-4.5. Increased fire-related aerosols reduce the 0.06 W m⁻² cooling effect north of 60°N. Projections show a surge in premature deaths from wildfire smoke, reaching 1.40 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.66–2.25) million annually during 2095–2099, roughly 6 times higher than current levels. Africa is projected to experience the greatest rise in fire-related deaths (11-fold), driven by emission changes and an aging population. Europe and the U.S. would experience a 1–2-fold increase under SSP2-4.5, linked to rising fire occurrences in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere. Overall, the health burden would become more evenly distributed across nations of differing development levels than present patterns, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts.

Nature Aging

                         (2025)Cite this article


The mechanisms of aging are becoming increasingly well mapped; however, there remains ongoing debate about the ultimate and proximate causes of aging. The recent development of highly precise aging clocks led to a resurgence of arguments in support of a biological program of aging. However, the declining force of natural selection after the onset of reproduction means that cellular function could deteriorate without requiring a specific program. Here, we argue that aging clocks do not imply an intrinsic program but rather reflect the stochastic accumulation of molecular errors and damage. Damage accumulates due to insufficient maintenance and repair and contributes to system-wide entropy. In support of this, cross-species comparisons indicate that enhanced DNA repair capacity is a key determinant of exceptional longevity in mammals. By better understanding the nature of the stochasticity that governs the aging process, we will have a stronger mechanistic basis for developing geroprotective interventions to promote healthy aging in humans.

Climate change has large economic costs for society. An important effect is the disruption of natural resource supply by climate-mediated disturbances such as wildfires, pest outbreaks and storms. Here we show that disturbance-induced losses for Europe's timber-based forestry could increase from the current €115 billion to €247 billion under severe climate change. This would diminish the timber value of Europe's forests by up to 42% and reduce the current gross value added of the forestry sector by up to 15%. Central Europe emerges as a continental hotspot of disturbance costs, with projected future costs of up to €19,885 per hectare. Simultaneous climate-related increases in forest productivity could offset future economic losses from disturbances in Northern and Central Europe but not in Southern Europe. We find high disturbance-related cost of unmitigated warming, highlighting that climate change adaptation in forestry is not only an ecological but also an economic imperative.

Climate change has strong impacts on global ecosystems1,2. These impacts are likely to result in high economic costs for society3. Recent studies estimated economic losses related to climate impacts on global ecosystems to several trillion dollars4, with income reductions of 19%5, several hundred billions of dollars needed to compensate for loss and damage6, and reductions in the gross domestic product of 1.2% per 1 °C increase in global mean temperature7. In particular, the already observed8 and projected future9,10,11 increases in frequency and intensity of extreme events, such as droughts, wildfires and floods, have severe consequences for the global economy4,12.

Forest ecosystems are particularly prone to climatic extremes because trees are sessile and long lived13,14. As forest products are central to a bio-based economy15,16,17, changing extreme events pose a major challenge for a wider use of bio-based materials. A major concern in this regard are forest disturbances, that is, large-scale pulses of tree mortality from wildfires, pest outbreaks and storms18,19. Forest disturbances have increased in frequency and severity in many parts of the globe in recent decades20,21 and are expected to further increase under continued climate change22. A hotspot of changing forest disturbances is Europe, where disturbance rates doubled in less than 20 years for major disturbance agents20, and a massive recent pulse of tree mortality was unprecedented in at least 170 years23. Societies in Europe are strongly dependent on forests for providing jobs, supporting rural livelihoods, and contributing to environmental and economic well-being24. Yet, the continental-scale economic impacts of climate-mediated disturbances remain unclear so far.

Understanding the economic impacts of disturbances is complex, as interactions with other climate-induced changes have to be considered. For instance, climate change affects forest productivity, with decreases projected for water-limited regions25 but broad-scale increases expected due to CO2 fertilization25,26,27 and an extension of the growing season particularly in boreal and mountain ecosystems28,29. Changing forest productivity interacts with disturbance costs: increasing productivity increases the growing stock, which in turn enhances the timber value of forests. Simultaneously, productivity-related increases in harvest levels lead to higher returns that might partly or completely offset the economic costs of increasing disturbances30,31. These interactions require a joint evaluation of the economic consequences of changing disturbance and productivity30,31.

Here we present an estimate of the current and future economic costs of forest disturbances at continental scale, accounting for climate-mediated changes in both forest productivity and disturbance in Europe. Specifically, we investigated the historical costs of disturbance on the timber-based forest value (under the climate conditions of the reference period 1981–2005) and how they are likely to evolve under scenarios of future climate change (representing the climate conditions expected for the period 2076–2100). We assessed hotspots of economic disturbance impact in Europe and whether increasing forest productivity can offset economic losses from disturbance under climate change.

To address our questions, we coupled three crucial elements, (1) spatially explicit (16 ×16 km) forest growth simulations at the level of individual tree species, (2) >150,000 Monte Carlo simulations of forest disturbances informed by latest remote sensing data and (3) economic models to quantify the costs of changing productivity and disturbance across continental Europe focusing on the commercially most relevant species (a total of 91 million ha, or two-thirds of Europe's forest area). We studied a total of 1,536 scenarios under three different representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario families and quantified the cost of disturbance by comparing scenario simulations to the counterfactual of simulations without disturbance under the same climate conditions. Economic effects were quantified by converting simulated time series of planned (that is, business-as-usual management) and unplanned (that is, disturbance-related) timber harvests to economic cashflow, which was subsequently discounted and summed to obtain forest value (Extended Data Fig. 1). We translated the present value of total disturbance costs into annual costs by multiplying with a discount rate of 1.5%. Disturbances are discrete events in space and time, and averaging over extended spatiotemporal scales masks their immediate local effects12. Hence, we report costs for both the average (mean across all stochastic simulations) and the extreme case (defined as the average of the worst 5% of simulations, conditional value at risk), with the latter being particularly informative for planning under the precautionary principle32.

Under historical conditions (1981–2005), the economic costs of natural disturbances in Europe (loss of forest values) were €115 ± 3 billion (mean ± s.d., Fig. 1), with an average annual cost of €1,729 ± 48 million yr−1 and an average cost per unit area of €1,265 ± 35 ha−1. These costs were the result of on average 74.5 million m3 of timber disturbed per year (Table 1). Disturbances reduced the total forest value of Europe by 28.6 ± 0.7% compared with the counterfactual of no disturbance. Under climate change, total future timber harvest increased by 17.1%, from 259.6 to 304.1 million m3 yr−1 (for the period 2076–2100) under scenario RCP4.5 (increases of 12.9% and 28.0% under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively), resulting from both increasing productivity (increasing planned harvest) and increasing disturbance (increasing unplanned harvest; Table 1). Distinct increases in unplanned, that is, disturbance-induced, harvests increased costs of disturbance to €186 ± 8 billion under RCP4.5, and up to €247 ± 15 billion under RCP8.5 (RCP2.6: €146 ± 3 billion). This reduced the potential forest value relative to the counterfactual of no disturbance by up to 42.1 ± 2.5%, and translated to average annual costs of €2,783 ± 116 million yr−1 under RCP4.5 (RCP2.6: €2,191 ± 42 million yr−1; RCP8.5: €3,711 ± 218 million yr−1), and average costs per unit area of €2,037 ± 85 ha−1 (RCP2.6: €1,603 ± 31 ha−1; RCP8.5: €2,715 ± 160 ha−1). Simulating a moderate shortening of the rotation period by 10 years as a measure to adapt to changing climate and disturbance regimes reduced the cost of disturbance by up to €10 billion under scenario RCP8.5 (Extended Data Fig. 2). All economic results were sensitive to varying discount rates, with higher costs of disturbance at lower discount rates (Extended Data Fig. 3). Different climate model projections within the same RCP family resulted in similar trajectories (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Bars show the timber-based forest value losses from disturbances relative to the counterfactual of undisturbed forest development under the same climate scenario. Data denote mean ± s.d. across all simulations (N = 300). ‘Historical' assumes climate conditions from 1981–2005, while RCP scenarios are for projected future climate conditions for the period 2076–2100.

The economic costs of natural disturbances varied widely across Europe (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 1). Hotspots of future disturbance costs were mainly located in Central Europe (especially in parts of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic; Fig. 2c), where disturbances lowered the economic value of forests on average by €3,233 ha−1 under moderate climate change (RCP4.5), and €2,460 ha−1 and €4,375 ha−1 under mild (RCP2.6) and severe (RCP8.5) climate change, respectively (Fig. 2a). Extreme costs in this region (that is, the average of the economically worst 5% of simulations, conditional value at risk) were €17,067 ha−1 under RCP4.5 (€13,932 ha−1 and €19,885 ha−1 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively). In contrast to the high disturbance costs in Central Europe, forests in Northern Europe had 60–65% lower economic costs of disturbance, with average losses of €1,164 ha−1 under RCP4.5 (€966 ha−1 and €1,523 ha−1 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively). Nonetheless, local extremes were also high in Northern Europe, exceeding €10,000 ha−1 (RCP2.6: €9,747 ha−1, RCP4.5: €12,370 ha−1, RCP8.5: €14,664 ha−1, Extended Data Table 1). Generally, the continental-scale differences in disturbance costs decreased when considering extreme values (Fig. 2). Disturbance costs in Southern Europe (Fig. 2c) were between those in Northern and Central Europe (Extended Data Table 1).

The increase in forest productivity under climate change (Table 1) overcompensated the economic losses from disturbances in Europe overall, but regional variation was high. The productivity-related increase in forest value can be attributed to two effects: higher initial growing stocks and increased sustainable harvest levels from elevated tree growth (Extended Data Fig. 5). These effects were strongest under scenario RCP8.5, yet in this scenario, disturbance-induced losses also increased most strongly (Fig. 3a). The economic effects of productivity and disturbance increased at similar rates across climate scenarios, resulting in little variation in overall forest value with climate change (RCP2.6: €337.9 ± 12.6 billion, RCP4.5: €328.6 ± 20.8 billion, RCP8.5: €340.8 ± 34.9 billion). However, scenario uncertainty was lowest under RCP2.6 and increased considerably with increasing severity of climate change (Fig. 3b). Productivity-related offsets of disturbance losses varied distinctly across Europe. In Northern Europe, economic gains from increasing productivity clearly outweighed disturbance-mediated losses under climate change (Fig. 3c,d). In contrast, productivity stagnated or declined in Southern Europe while disturbances increased, resulting in decreasing net forest values under climate change. In Central Europe, productivity was projected to increase, albeit at a lower rate than in Northern Europe. Here, economic losses from disturbances are compensated by gains in productivity, yet the offset capacity decreases with increasing severity of climate change (Fig. 3c,d). Only under the mild climate scenario RCP2.6 was the forest value of all European regions (and 92% of all European countries, Extended Data Fig. 6) projected to increase relative to historical levels, when considering the net effects of both changing productivity and disturbance.

Here we provide a continental-scale estimate of forest disturbance costs for Europe. Our findings suggest that disturbance costs could more than double under climate change. Under severe climate change, the annual losses estimated here correspond to up to 15% of the current gross value added of the forestry sector in Europe24. We furthermore highlight considerable differences in the economic costs of forest disturbances throughout Europe, identifying particular hotspots in Central Europe. Local-scale studies from this region show that disturbance costs could be even higher than estimated here, when only considering disturbance impacts on the economically most valuable tree species32. Nonetheless, our results of disturbance-based losses on the timber-based forest value of up to €19,885 ha−1 suggest that disturbances could posit major economic challenges for timber-based forestry in the future. Our results also indicate that simultaneous increases in forest productivity under climate change could offset economic losses from increasing disturbances. The finding that Northern Europe is the main beneficiary of climate change, with increasing forest values in Europe's boreal zone, is in agreement with previous studies on the economic effects of climate change33. In contrast, the timber-based forest value in Southern Europe is already considerably lower than in other parts of the continent24 and will decrease further under climate change. The negative impacts of climate change on Southern Europe identified here correspond well with previous assessments9,25,33,34.

Important limitations need to be considered when interpreting our results. First, our estimates of the cost of disturbances are likely conservative, because we only focused on timber-related forest values. Although timber remains the main marketable good from forests throughout Europe, disturbances have broad impacts beyond timber35, and the societal costs of disturbance impacts on non-marketable ecosystem services were not considered here. Similarly, we focused on the economically most important tree species and did not study the effect of tree species change in response to changing climatic conditions. More broadly, the consideration of alternative silvicultural strategies was beyond the scope of our analysis. Rather, we assumed even-aged management as the most widely used silvicultural strategy across the continent24,36,37 and considered local differences in productivity and their effect on rotation periods. While this approach is not able to capture the full variability of forest management regimes applied in Europe24,36, it approximates the dominant management of the simulated tree species well36,38, and provides a robust and consistent baseline for quantifying continental-scale disturbance costs. We also omitted income from thinning, likely underestimating Europe's forest value. However, previous studies showed that considering thinnings does not substantially reduce disturbance costs32. The increasing volatility resulting from disturbances may also drive risk-averse forest owners to exit the market39, which can have considerable economic effects beyond the ones considered here. Moreover, we only incorporated the three most important forest disturbance agents in Europe, namely, wildfires, windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks. The advent of novel disturbances such as invasive alien pests and pathogens could considerably alter future disturbance regimes at the continental scale40 and further increase economic costs of disturbance. Another important assumption in our analysis is that some of the disturbed timber is salvage harvested and thus enters the timber market. This is the current default management response to disturbances in Europe41,42, yet the practice is increasingly criticized for its ecological impacts43,44. Lower salvage rates would likely further increase the economic costs of forest disturbances32,43.

While our quantification of disturbance costs is likely conservative, the estimate of the compensatory effect of increasing productivity might be optimistic. Productivity gains offset disturbance losses because they simultaneously increase initial forest values and periodic returns in our analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5), yet the assumptions with regard to initial values are uncertain (that is, similar forest age structure at higher productivity levels). Furthermore, effects of reduced water use efficiency45 or acclimation effects in response to elevated CO246 were not considered here. In fact, recent studies already indicate declining forest growth even in some areas of Northern Europe47. While we here used best available modelling approaches at continental scale, these uncertainties call for further research on economic effects of both changing productivity and disturbance34,48.

The high economic costs of disturbance identified here have important implications for forest policy and management. First, losses from disturbances need to be considered more explicitly in forest planning and the economic valuation of different forest management strategies. While even-aged coniferous forests were propagated throughout Europe on the basis of economic grounds in the past, these considerations ignored the substantial disturbance risk of these silvicultural systems13,49, and hence also the associated costs. As disturbances are likely to increase further under climate change, future considerations of forest planning and management need to explicitly account for their impacts50. Second, we show that considerable adaptation efforts are needed to reduce disturbance impacts in Europe's forests. While these efforts (including measures such as planting less disturbance-prone tree species and managing for structured and mixed forests49,51) require resources, they will also reduce disturbance risk49,51 and thus disturbance-related costs. This highlights that there is not only an ecological but also an economical imperative to climate change adaptation in forestry. We show that moderately reducing rotation lengths might reduce disturbance costs, illustrating the potential of climate change adaptation measures in silviculture. However, such measures could also have unintended consequences on other ecosystem services such as forest carbon storage and habitat value36,52, and should thus only be applied after careful consideration of local trade-offs. Efforts should particularly focus on hotspots of disturbance impacts in Central and Southern Europe, where the expected rise in disturbance-related costs could become increasingly prohibitive for regular forest management in the absence of adaptive measures. Lastly, our results underline the importance of climate change mitigation. Only when climate change was limited to mild levels (scenario RCP2.6) did net positive economic effects of changing productivity and disturbance emerge throughout the European continent. In contrast, largely unmitigated climate change (scenario RCP8.5) could lead to severe economic losses from disturbances, particularly in Southern and Central Europe. We thus conclude that mitigating climate change can avoid substantial disturbance-related costs in the forestry sector.

We modelled forest development explicitly for 16 × 16 km grid cells across Europe at 10-year time steps using a matrix model (Extended Data Fig. 1). In each grid cell, we considered the forested area of the four economically most important tree species in Europe38, namely, European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and deciduous oaks (Quercus robur L. and Quercus petraea Matt. Liebl.). Together, these species account for more than 95% of the European timber market53 and two-thirds of Europe's forest area (91 million hectares). Stand age distributions were extracted from an analysis based on remote sensing54, and tree species shares for each 10-year age-class bin were considered proportional to the species composition at grid-cell level. For each 16 × 16 km grid cell, the forest area was thus distributed to 104 classes (4 tree species × 26 age classes).

For the sake of parsimony and to consistently compare the effects of disturbance and productivity change across Europe, we assumed a single silvicultural system for all simulated forests. As the clear-cut system is still the dominant silvicultural system in Europe for the tree species considered here24,36,37, we simulated even-aged stand development followed by clear cutting and planting. We accounted for local variation in management intensity across Europe by deriving rotation lengths at the cell level. Specifically, we calculated economically optimal rotation lengths (that is, the age of final cutting that maximizes forest value) contingent on tree species and local site productivity for each cell (see Supplementary Table 1 and section ‘Calculation of the economically optimal rotation age' in Supplementary Methods for more details). For the calculation of optimal rotation lengths, we assumed timber production to start from bare ground and we disregarded disturbances.

Forest managers are actively adapting their management to the emerging changes in environmental conditions. While a comprehensive assessment of the economic effects of climate change adaptation measures is beyond the scope of our analysis, we considered two elements of climate change adaptation in our simulations: First, we simulated an adaptation of optimal rotation periods to the emerging changes in productivity under climate change. This was implemented by deriving optimal rotation periods separately for each climate scenario and grid cell (see section ‘Climate data' in Supplementary Methods for more details). Thus, rotation periods are effectively shortened in locations where productivity increases, and rotation periods are extended in areas where productivity decreases, simulating dynamic adaptation of managers to changing environmental conditions. Second, we tested the effect of adapting the rotation length from its local economic optimum value in a sensitivity analysis, varying rotation period length by up to ±20 years from the economic optimum (Extended Data Fig. 2). In Europe, reducing rotation period length is a measure that is frequently discussed in the context of dampening the impacts of disturbances52,55, while extending rotation periods can increase forest carbon storage and habitat value36. Thinnings were disregarded in our simulations32, and we simulated no tree species change, that is, species were replanted in their current proportions after final harvesting or disturbance (but see refs. 53,56).

We assessed the effect of climate change by considering two time slices, one representing historical climate (1981–2005) and one future climate (2076–2100). For each time slice, we simulated 500 years of forest development starting from current forest conditions, with climate conditions averaged for each time slice. We chose this approach over transient scenario simulations as it better quantifies the long-term economic consequences of changing climate and disturbance regimes, given that discounting in economic analyses strongly reduces the weight of future changes in transient analyses. We chose a simulation period of 500 years, as it contains multiple rotations, and aggregated cash flows beyond this period have little influence on the forest value because of discounting. Additional to the time slice representing historical climate, we considered 3 climate scenarios (representing different radiative forcing levels, that is, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 from CMIP5) each derived from 3 different climate models, downscaled to our 16 × 16 km grid cells (for details see section ‘Climate data' in Supplementary Methods). This resulted in 12 different climate scenarios considered in the analyses. Climate affected both productivity and disturbance in the simulations, as described in the following paragraphs.

Forest productivity and its response to climate change was quantified by dynamically simulating the potential net primary productivity (NPP) per grid cell and species. Potential NPP was defined as the NPP of a fully stocked pure stand of a species under a given climate, during the stand development stage in which tree growth culminates. Potential NPP for each grid cell and scenario was estimated using a deep neural network trained on data generated by the process-based simulation model iLand57,58. To derive training data for the deep neural network, we used iLand to simulate NPP values of the four tree species across the full climate and soil gradients of Europe and under the 12 different climate scenarios considered. In iLand, NPP increases with temperature (as long as temperatures are below optimal temperatures for photosynthesis) and atmospheric CO2 concentration, while water availability (in the atmosphere and soil) and plant-available nitrogen limit the carbon uptake of trees (a detailed description of iLand and the mechanisms used to calculate NPP can be found in refs. 57,58 and on the model website https://iland-model.org). We ran simulations on the basis of daily climate data for each climate scenario (see section ‘Climate data' in Supplementary Methods) and extracted the resulting annual NPP values. We developed a feedforward convolutional deep neural network with 13 layers and 189,000 trainable parameters. We subsequently trained the deep neural network on 14 million datapoints derived from iLand to predict annual potential NPP values for the four tree species under study, contingent on the soil and climate conditions prevailing at a grid cell (see section ‘Forest productivity under climate change' in Supplementary Methods). The deep neural network was well able to learn the responses of the underlying process-based model and generalized well between climate change scenarios. Predicted potential NPP values for current climate conditions were evaluated against independent observations from satellite data (see section ‘Forest productivity under climate change' in Supplementary Methods). To derive merchantable timber volume in our matrix model simulations, we used species-specific yield table estimates (see section ‘Yield tables' in Supplementary Methods for more details), dynamically calculating the respective yield class from potential NPP values per cell. Specifically, we used a quadratic link function to capture the nonlinear relationship between NPP and yield class (see section ‘Mapping of NPP values to yield tables' in Supplementary Methods), assuming correspondence between the range of potential NPP values predicted in simulations under historical climate and the range of yield class values covered in yield tables. In this way, we combined the robust estimates of merchantable timber volume from yield tables with dynamically simulated productivity changes under climate change, resulting in realistic projections of future timber production at cell level.

To comprehensively assess the impact of natural disturbances, we considered two types of disturbances in the simulation: first, climate-sensitive ‘background' disturbances were derived on the basis of statistical survival probabilities estimated on the basis of continental-scale forest inventory data59 (see section ‘Background disturbances' in Supplementary Methods). This disturbance type represents small- to medium-scale events that happen regularly (for example, small-scale mortality from drought or insect infestations, small-scale windthrow), but do not lead to larger-scale economic implications such as market crashes. They were sensitive to changing mean annual temperature, maximum temperature of the warmest month, minimum temperature of the coldest month, annual precipitation sum and precipitation sum of the warmest quarter in our simulations59. For each grid cell and tree species, we simulated these disturbances within each time step by resetting a proportion of the cell's area to age class zero and replanting the area, with the proportion affected by disturbance derived from a climate-sensitive hazard probability function59. Second, to account for economic risks from rare but large disturbance events, we simulated stochastic, landscape-scale extreme events, such as severe fires, windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks, using biome-specific remote sensing data60,61,62. Extreme events were defined for each scenario as those affecting more than twice the area disturbed in an average year of the scenario. To estimate the occurrence of such extreme disturbance events, we first calculated historical biome-specific average disturbance rates (1986–2005). We subsequently developed scenarios of potential future changes in average disturbance rates based on expected increases in drought intensity and frequency in Europe2, as well as on other best available estimates for future disturbance change20,22 and the already observed responses to recent climate change (Supplementary Table 2). On the basis of these analyses, we assumed mean disturbance increases by a factor of 2, 4 and 6, respectively, for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and investigated the sensitivity of our results to a wide range of different potential future disturbance changes (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). Subsequently, the specific frequencies and magnitudes of extreme events were derived using Taylor's power law equations fit to remote sensing data63 (Supplementary Fig. 1), estimating the temporal variance of disturbance rates per agent and biome under historical and increased future mean disturbance rates. The occurrence of extreme events in a simulated time step was determined at the level of biomes by drawing from Poisson distributions. The affected area in each biome was calculated by multiplying the number of extreme events in each time step by their magnitude. Affected cells were then drawn randomly until the estimated disturbed area was reached. In disturbed cells, depending on the disturbance agent (see section ‘Extreme disturbances' in Supplementary Methods), all or most of the forest area was reset to age class zero.

Revenues from timber-based forest management were calculated from tree diameter- and species-dependent timber prices and establishment costs53 (Extended Data Table 2). Revenues were discounted and summed over the whole simulation period to quantify forest value32,53 (default discount rate of 1.5%, but see Extended Data Fig. 3 for a sensitivity analysis of different discount rates). Simulated increases in productivity under climate change influenced forest value via increased timber harvests, which positively affected forest value. Simulated disturbances had a range of nuanced economic impacts in the simulation (Extended Data Table 3). For climate-sensitive background disturbances, we assumed that the impacted timber is sold with a 50% decrease in net revenue due to a loss of timber quality and increased harvesting costs (see section ‘Prices' in Supplementary Methods). For extreme disturbance events, revenues from disturbed timber were set to zero for the affected grid cell, assuming a collapse of the timber market in the region as a result of large quantities of disturbed timber flooding the market32. For extreme events, planting costs for the next cohort of trees were assumed to increase by a factor of two, to reflect higher post-disturbance expenses from planting large areas and to account for typical shortages in nurseries after large disturbance events. To assess the sensitivity of our results to additional market effects of disturbances (that is, price drops from extreme disturbance events radiating out to larger areas), we conducted an auxiliary analysis in which we reduced the timber prices of regular harvests in cells adjacent to those affected by extreme disturbance events (see section ‘Prices' in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 7).

To account for the stochastic nature of disturbances, we used Monte Carlo simulations32 to consider a wide range of potential future disturbance impacts. This method involved running multiple simulations for each studied scenario. Within each simulation, different random disturbance events were generated to capture a wide range of disturbance sequences and their corresponding economic outcomes. This allowed us to quantify the variability of the economic impacts of disturbances. Monte Carlo approaches have been widely used in economics and ecology64,65,66,67, and are particularly suited to capture the impacts of highly variable events32. Specifically, we ran 100 Monte Carlo simulations for each scenario and cell with different random numbers used for (1) drawing extreme disturbance events in each time step and (2) choosing which cells are affected by these events. To assess the economic impact of disturbances, we calculated losses as the average difference in economic value between simulations with and without disturbances across all simulations. In other words, simulations without disturbances in the respective climate scenarios served as the counterfactual to quantify the economic impacts of disturbance. Since disturbances, particularly extreme events, disproportionately impact the fat tail of skewed economic damage distributions (Supplementary Fig. 2), and mean comparisons cannot fully capture the effects of increasing frequencies of rare events12, we also analysed extreme values from our Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, for each scenario and simulated cell, we calculated the average of the worst 5% of economic losses across all Monte Carlo runs (conditional value at risk). To transform losses in net present value into annual costs, we calculated an annuity by multiplying the losses by the assumed discount rate of the simulation (1.5%). Regional analyses were conducted for European regions as suggested in the Forest Europe report24 (Fig. 3c). Within each region, hotspot areas were defined as cells above the 99th percentile of all values in that region (Extended Data Table 1). To estimate economic costs per unit forest area, the total costs were divided by the forested area for each cell.

We successfully evaluated our simulation approach against independent data for several key metrics. The simulated standing timber volume and annual timber extraction rates under historical climate matched observed values well (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). The model estimated that 28.7% of the annual timber harvest was due to natural disturbances under historical climate, which amounted to 74.5 million m3 timber yr−1 (Table 1). These values are well within the range of empirical data from recent decades, reporting 42.6–78.5 million m3 of timber disturbed annually and 12%–32% of unplanned canopy openings from disturbances relative to the total harvested timber volume for the period 1986–200520,68. These results highlight the robustness of our simulations; full details of the evaluations conducted are provided in Supplementary Methods (see sections ‘Standing timber volume' and ‘Amount of extracted timber'). We used TensorFlow69 in combination with Keras API70 in Python for implementing the deep neural network. All other simulations and analyses were done using the R programming environment71 in R Studio72 v.2023.12.1.402.

We initialized the simulated forests (16 ×16 km grid cells) using recent species distribution maps38 and age class information extrapolated from NFI data for continental Europe54. Forest growth was simulated based on soil- and climate-sensitive NPP estimates for each tree species, derived from a deep neural network trained on simulations of a process-based forest growth model. NPP values were mapped to yield tables to obtain information on merchantable timber volume and mean tree diameter. We simulated an even-aged clear-cut system (pictograms in top row), with the rotation length varying between cells. To calculate optimal rotation length per cell, we converted extracted timber volumes into economic cashflow and computed the net present value for each possible rotation length (from 0 to 260 years in 10-year intervals), assuming a discount rate of 1.5%. The optimal rotation length was defined as the one that maximizes net present value. After final harvest, we assumed the area was regenerated with the same tree species. To quantify the effect of disturbances, we explicitly simulated two types of disturbances: First, climate-sensitive, background disturbances derived from empirically parameterized hazard probabilities59 (center row), and second, stochastic extreme disturbance events informed by observations from remote sensing61 and scaled to future scenarios using Taylor's power law equations63 (bottom row). In the event of a disturbance, the revenues from timber were reduced for background disturbances, and set to zero for extreme disturbances, representing the combined effects of market price responses, wood devaluation, and increased harvesting costs in the wake of disturbances32. Figure created with BioRender.com.

Changing rotation periods from their economic optimal values can be used in silviculture to reduce disturbance risks, and to improve other forest functions such as forest carbon storage and habitat value. Changes in the rotation period have two effects: (1) they result in economic losses because the rotation period is no longer at its economically optimal value (blue bars), and (2) they affect the economic costs of disturbance (orange bars). Bars indicate average values, whileE error bars indicate the standard deviation (N = 300), and points are the net effect and its standard deviation of both economic implications. A positive net effect means an overall increase in forest values compared to default rotation lengths.

Lower discount rates decrease forest value due to higher costs of disturbance. The overall effect of climate change on the costs of disturbance is apparent for all evaluated discount rates and climate models used. Each bar indicates the average disturbance costs (N = 300 for panel ‘All', N = 100 for each climate model), while the error bars show the average costs ± the standard deviation of simulated costs. The ‘All' panels include results of all simulated climate models. Raw data is shown as points.

The color of each point represents the cost per hectare of forest within a 16 by 16 km cell, and the size of each point corresponds to the forested area within that cell. Panel (a) shows average disturbance costs across all simulations, while panel (b) indicates extreme values, expressed as the mean over the 5% highest costs. For visibility, only cells with a forest cover of at least 5 % are displayed. For comparability with Fig. 3, we kept the color scale the same as in Fig. 3. We note, however, that 0.1% of the extreme disturbance costs under RCP8.5 are beyond the color scale used. The map uses the ETRS89-LAEA Europe projection (EPSG:3035).

Changes in forest value at the continental (a) and regional (c) scale under future climate compared to historical values as in Fig. 3. Blue bars represent losses due to increasing disturbances, green bars show gains from increasing productivity. Productivity-related gains are attributed to effects on initial growing stock (derived relative to growing stock levels under historical productivity) – indicated by the transparent portions of the bars – and effects related to increased sustainable harvest levels over the simulation period (solid portion of the bars). Dots indicate the net change in forest value compared to historical values. Dots within the transparent area of the bars indicate high uncertainty of net positive economic effects, as economic effects would turn negative in these cases if initial forest values were to remain constant with increasing productivity. Continental (b) and regional (d) forest values under different climate scenarios as in Fig. 3. Gains due to a productivity-related increase in initial forest value are indicated as the transparent portion of the bars. In all panels, data show the mean ± s.d. across all simulations (N = 300) in the respective stratum. Regions were defined as in Fig. 2c.

Chatbots give positive, human-like responses to prompts from users.Credit: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty

Accounts of people developing psychosis — which renders them unable to distinguish between what is and is not reality — after interacting with generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have increased in the past few months.

Supportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health

Supportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health

At least 17 people have been reported to have developed psychosis, according to a preprint posted online last month1. After engaging with chatbots such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, some of these people experienced spiritual awakenings or uncovered what they thought were conspiracies. 

So far, there has been little research into this rare phenomenon, called AI psychosis, and most of what we know comes from individual instances. Nature explores the emerging theories and evidence, and what AI companies are doing about the problem.

Psychosis is characterized by disruptions to how a person thinks and perceives reality, including hallucinations, delusions or false beliefs. It can be triggered by brain disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, severe stress or drug use.

That AI can trigger psychosis is still a hypothesis, says Søren Østergaard, a psychiatrist at Aarhus University in Denmark. But theories are emerging about how this could happen, he adds. For instance, chatbots are designed to craft positive, human-like responses to prompts from users, which could increase the risk of psychosis among people already having trouble distinguishing between what is and is not real, says Østergaard.

UK researchers have proposed that conversations with chatbots can fall into a feedback loop, in which the AI reinforces paranoid or delusional beliefs mentioned by users, which condition the chatbot's responses as the conversation continues. In a preprint published in July2, which has not been peer reviewed, the scientists simulated user–chatbot conversations using prompts with varying levels of paranoia, finding that the user and chatbot reinforced each other's paranoid beliefs.

Studies involving people without mental-health conditions or tendencies towards paranoid thinking are needed to establish whether there is a connection between psychosis and chatbot use, Østergaard says.

People who have already experienced some kind of mental-health issue are at the greatest risk of developing psychosis, Østergaard says. It seems that some people can experience their first psychotic break from interacting with chatbots, he adds, but most of them will already be susceptible to developing delusions or paranoia owing to genetics, stress or misuse of drugs or alcohol. Østergaard also theorizes that chatbots could worsen or trigger mania, a period of extremely elevated energy and mood associated with bipolar disorder, because they reinforce symptoms such as elated mood. 

People who are isolated and do not interact with friends, family or other people are also at risk, says Kiley Seymour, a neuroscientist at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia. Interacting with other people protects against psychosis, she adds, because “they can offer those counterfactual pieces of evidence to help you think about how you're thinking”.

But the risk of developing psychosis for people without a predisposition is the same whether they do or don't interact with chatbots, adds Seymour.

Chatbots can remember information from conversations that occurred months earlier, which can trigger users to think that they are “being watched or that their thoughts are being extracted, because they can't remember ever sharing that information”, says Seymour. Grandiose delusions, in which users think they are speaking to a god through the chatbot or have discovered a truth about the world, can also be reinforced, she adds. In an analysis of chats posted online, the Wall Street Journal reported finding dozens of instances in which chatbots validated mystical or delusional beliefs or made claims that they were in contact with extraterrestrial beings.

Cybercriminals have a new way of sending millions of scam text messages to people. Typically when fraudsters send waves of phishing messages to phones—such as toll or delivery scams—they may use a huge list of phone numbers and automate the sending of messages. But as phone companies and telecom services have rolled out more tools to detect scams in texts, criminals have started driving around cities with fake cell phone towers that send messages directly to nearby phones.

Over the last year, there has been a marked uptick in the use of so-called “SMS blasters” by scammers, with cops in multiple countries detecting and arresting people using the equipment. SMS blasters are small devices, which have been found in the back of criminals' cars and sometimes backpacks, that impersonate cell phone towers and force phones into using insecure connections. They then push the scam messages, which contain links to fraudulent websites, to the connected phones.

While not a new type of technology, the use of SMS blasters in scamming was originally detected in Southeast Asian countries and has increasingly spread to Europe and South America—just last week, Switzerland's National Cybersecurity Centre issued a warning about SMS blasters. The devices are capable of sending huge volumes of scam texts indiscriminately. The Swiss agency said some blasters are able to send messages to all phones in a radius of 1,000 meters, while reports about an incident in Bangkok say a blaster was used to send around 100,000 SMS messages per hour.

“This is essentially the first time that we have seen large-scale use of mobile radio-transmitting devices by criminal groups,” says Cathal Mc Daid, VP of technology at telecommunication and cybersecurity firm Enea, who has been tracking the use of SMS blasters. “While some technical expertise would help in using these devices, those actually running the devices don't need to be experts. This has been shown by reports of arrests of people who have been basically paid to drive around areas with SMS blasters in cars or vans.”

SMS blasters act as illegitimate phone masts, often known as cell-site simulators (CSS). The blasters are not dissimilar to so-called IMSI catchers, or “Stingrays,” which law enforcement officials have used to scoop up people's phone data. But instead of being used for surveillance, they broadcast false signals to targeted devices.

Phones near a blaster can be forced to connect to its illegitimate 4G signals, before the blaster pushes devices to downgrade to the less secure 2G signal. “The 2G fake base station is then used to send (blast) malicious SMSes to the mobile phones initially captured by the 4G false base station,” Mc Daid says. “The whole process—4G capture, downgrade to 2G, sending of SMS and release—can take less than 10 seconds,” Mc Daid explains. It's something people who receive the messages may not even notice.

The growth of SMS blasters comes at a time when scams are rampant. In recent years, technology firms and mobile network operators have increasingly rolled out greater protections against fraudulent text messages—from better filtering and detection of possible scam messages to blocking tens of millions of messages per month. This month, UK telecom Virgin Media O2 said it has blocked more than 600 million scam text messages during 2025, which is more than its combined totals for the last two years. Still, millions of scam messages get through, and cybercriminals are quick to try to evade detection systems.

Because blasters operate outside of traditional mobile networks, the messages they send are not subject to the security measures that have been put in place by mobile providers. “None of our security controls apply to the messages that phones receive from them,” says Anton Reynaldo Bonifacio, the chief information security officer and chief AI officer at Philippines communications firm Globe Telecom. “Once phones are connected to these fake cell sites, they can spoof any sender ID or number to send the scam message.”

Back in 2022, Globe Telecom made the decision to stop delivering SMS messages that contain URLs, and Bonifacio says he believes scammers use the blasters to “bypass” these measures. “The technology used to be more niche, but I think sales and assembly of these IMSI catcher devices have become more prevalent for criminal organizations,” he says. Researchers have found SMS blasters being sold openly online for thousands of dollars.

Samantha Kight, the head of industry security at the mobile operator industry group the GSMA, says the Asia-Pacific region has been most impacted by SMS blasters so far, but there are cases appearing in Western Europe and South America. “It might be a problem in one or two regions, but then we tend to see these things pop up in different regions,” Kight says. Reporting from Commsrisk and Risky Business, have highlighted reports of SMS blasters being used in Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, New Zealand, Qatar, Indonesia, Oman, Brazil, Hong Kong, and more in recent months. Law enforcement officials in London say they have so far seized seven SMS blasters, and in June, a student from China was sentenced to jail for more than a year after being caught using one of the devices.

Kight says that tackling SMS blasters involves telecom operators and government regulators being aware of the devices, law enforcement agencies taking actions, as well as people recognizing and reporting scam messages to the relevant authorities. “As the mobile industry, we want to be able to find these, we want people to trust what's on their device, and we want to be able to protect them,” Kight says.

Yomna Nasser, a software engineer at Android, says people can stop their phones connecting to 2G networks in their settings. “Once enabled, your device will no longer scan for or connect to 2G cell towers,” Nasser says, adding the only exception is if an emergency call is being made and 3G, 4G and 5G are not available. Android's Advanced Protection mode will also disable 2G automatically on some newer phones. Apple did not answer WIRED's request for comment by the time of publication, although its Lockdown Mode will disable 2G connections.

Ultimately, you may not know if an SMS blaster is used to send you a scam. Ben Hurley, a detective sergeant with the City of London's Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit, which is investigating cases locally, says that while the delivery is different, the actual scams themselves haven't changed. Phishing messages are often designed to get you to click on a malicious link and hand over your personal information. “It's a new way of doing the same thing,” Hurley says. “It's changed how we have to investigate it, but actually it's not changed the end result,” he says, adding that people should always be cautious of clicking links in unknown messages and take a moment before acting if the message feels suspicious.

As with all cybercrime, though, there is a chance that those operating the schemes and blasters could evolve their tactics. “The actual SMS blaster devices they use are relatively unsophisticated so far,” Mc Daid says, adding that the type of technology originally came from the world of governments, law enforcement, and militaries. If criminals are able to gain access to more sophisticated technology and expertise, he says, “this could be the beginning of a cat and mouse game.”

It Speaks Volumes About What's Wrong With Them","https://www.wired.com/story/metas-new-smart-glasses-got-a-subtle-name-change-it-speaks-volumes-about-whats-wrong-with-them/","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

In the early days of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg and his team famously adopted the motto “Move fast and break things.” Posters with the phrase reportedly adorned the company's Silicon Valley headquarters, alongside other, similar sentiments like “Done is better than perfect,” and “Fail quicker.” The focus for the young company was clear: Being first was more important than getting it right first time.

As the company grew, Zuckerberg—in an interview with WIRED— started to distance himself from, or at least temper, those mantras. But with Wednesday's announcement of the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses, it feels like some of that old mentality might have started to creep back in.

“Our goal is to build great-looking glasses that deliver personal superintelligence,” said Zuckerberg yesterday at the very start of the Meta Connect event. He then immediately outlined some “clear values” that Meta holds sacrosanct for smart glasses. Number-one for Zuckerberg was “they need to be great glasses first” with “refined aesthetics” that “shave every millimeter” from the hardware. No doubt Meta has shaved every millimeter it can from its new flagship specs, but in a rush to fully realize these next-gen glasses it looks like Meta has broken that primary value right out the gate.

I got a chance to demo the Meta Ray-Ban Display, ahead of Meta Connect, at a preview event in London. The big news is they feature a small display built into the right lens that gives users visual prompts and guidance. They come with a wristband that understands hand gestures, which can be used to interact with the things displayed on the screen. Meta has labeled them the “world's most advanced AI glasses,” and having tried them, it‘s easy to agree. They are undoubtedly impressive, and I think most people who get to try them will like them.

The display appears in the right lens.

The whole experience—from the quality of the display itself, to the gesture controls and the on-glasses capabilities—all feels polished and intuitive, particularly considering this is Meta's first commercial stab at such a product.

But here's the problem: As impressive as they are, I still wouldn't buy them. Outside of tech fans and early adopters, I don't think a lot of people will. Not this iteration, anyway. And that's not even because of the arguably punchy $800 price tag.

The thing that truly lets them down is their aesthetic, and that's not what I expected from the company that made such a success of the original Ray-Ban Metas because of their design. While the originals (and their just-announced successors) basically look like Ray-Ban glasses, these, in what can only be described as a glaring faux pas, are far from being fashion-first. They look like smart glasses, but the old kind you don't really want to be seen wearing.

The chunk factor cannot be ignored.

Oh, there is a whiff of the Wayfarer about the Meta Ray-Ban Display; you can tell the intention is there to try and replicate the success of the most popular Ray-Ban style. But somehow distant alarm bells are ringing. Even though “statement glasses” are fashionable, these are just a bit too chunky to blend in.

At a glance, you can tell that something is going on with them. We've arrived in the uncanny valley of smart glasses, where the subtle bulges and added girth of the frames demand your attention, but not in a good way.

Interestingly, there is a subtle nod to this shift in aesthetics in the naming structure. While the original Ray-Ban Meta glasses lead with the Ray-Ban branding in their name, the Meta Ray-Ban Display switch that focus around. Which of the two brands made that call hasn't been made clear, but these are Meta's self-branded, tech-first glasses, and that feels a like misstep, especially considering the experience Meta already has in the market.

The new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses on a human model.

In her recent piece for WIRED, Amy Francombe notes how vitally important aesthetics are in creating mass acceptance of products such as this: “In the world of wearable tech, aesthetics have killed more ideas than poor battery life. Frames are fashion. No one wants to wear a prototype on their face.” Too right.

Meta knows how to build the platforms, she adds, but not necessarily the products people want to wear. It's why Essilor Luxottica, the company that owns Ray-Ban, has proved such a valuable ally in this journey so far—so valuable in fact, that Meta invested $3.5 billion for a minority stake in the business back in July.

Having shown off its prototype Orion AR glasses at Meta Connect last year, the announcement of Meta Ray-Ban Display this year feels like a forced attempt to solidify the company's position as the leader of the product category, but by embracing the old mantras of its founding company and moving first.

This creates an aesthetic compromise, where the tech is clearly not quite ready to fit into the tried and tested formula that Meta, and Essilor Luxottica, knows sells in its millions.

The original Ray-Ban Meta glasses are sleek and fashionable—and look very much like regular glasses.

But perhaps Meta isn't ready for that anyway. We know that the Meta Ray-Ban Display are going to launch initially in the US only, and in limited numbers. An in-store fitting requirement will also slow adoption, as will a high price that makes them far from a spontaneous purchase.

With the Meta Ray-Ban Display, it feels like Meta is dipping its toe in, testing the water, while simultaneously bragging about what it's capable of and seeing if customers will swallow this compromise of form and function.

It's a bold move for a company that has already proved the model for success, and yet so quickly is actively choosing to go against it. Yes, the Display glasses look fine—we're nowhere near Google Glass or Snapchat Spectacles territory here—but I would definitely feel self-conscious walking around with these on my face in a way I don't in Ray-Ban Meta.

The good news is that when the tech does catch up, and the design aligns more with what buyers have come to expect from the Ray-Ban Meta partnership (in that order), the experience on the glasses will already be waiting. As will the consumers that so loved the original Ray-Ban Metas.

A new trend is emerging in psychiatric hospitals. People in crisis are arriving with false, sometimes dangerous beliefs, grandiose delusions, and paranoid thoughts. A common thread connects them: marathon conversations with AI chatbots.

WIRED spoke with more than a dozen psychiatrists and researchers, who are increasingly concerned. In San Francisco, UCSF psychiatrist Keith Sakata says he has counted a dozen cases severe enough to warrant hospitalization this year, cases in which artificial intelligence “played a significant role in their psychotic episodes.” As this situation unfolds, a catchier definition has taken off in the headlines: “AI psychosis.”

Some patients insist the bots are sentient or spin new grand theories of physics. Other physicians tell of patients locked in days of back-and-forth with the tools, arriving at the hospital with thousands upon thousands of pages of transcripts detailing how the bots had supported or reinforced obviously problematic thoughts.

Reports like this are piling up, and the consequences are brutal. Distressed users and family and friends have described spirals that led to lost jobs, ruptured relationships, involuntary hospital admissions, jail time, and even death. Yet clinicians tell WIRED the medical community is split. Is this a distinct phenomenon that deserves its own label, or a familiar problem with a modern trigger?

AI psychosis is not a recognized clinical label. Still, the phrase has spread in news reports and on social media as a catchall descriptor for some kind of mental health crisis following prolonged chatbot conversations. Even industry leaders invoke it to discuss the many emerging mental health problems linked to AI. At Microsoft, Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of the tech giant's AI division, warned in a blog post last month of the “psychosis risk.” Sakata says he is pragmatic and uses the phrase with people who already do. “It's useful as shorthand for discussing a real phenomenon,” says the psychiatrist. However, he is quick to add that the term “can be misleading” and “risks oversimplifying complex psychiatric symptoms.”

That oversimplification is exactly what concerns many of the psychiatrists beginning to grapple with the problem.

Psychosis is characterized as a departure from reality. In clinical practice, it is not an illness but a complex “constellation of symptoms including hallucinations, thought disorder, and cognitive difficulties,” says James MacCabe, a professor in the Department of Psychosis Studies at King's College London. It is often associated with health conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, though episodes can be triggered by a wide array of factors, including extreme stress, substance use, and sleep deprivation.

But according to MacCabe, case reports of AI psychosis almost exclusively focus on delusions—strongly held but false beliefs that cannot be shaken by contradictory evidence. While acknowledging some cases may meet the criteria for a psychotic episode, MacCabe says “there is no evidence” that AI has any influence on the other features of psychosis. “It is only the delusions that are affected by their interaction with AI.” Other patients reporting mental health issues after engaging with chatbots, MacCabe notes, exhibit delusions without any other features of psychosis, a condition called delusional disorder.

With the focus so squarely on distorted beliefs, MacCabe's verdict is blunt: “AI psychosis is a misnomer. AI delusional disorder would be a better term.”

Experts agree that delusions among patients are an issue that demands attention. It all comes down to how chatbots communicate. They exploit our tendency to attribute humanlike qualities to others, explains Matthew Nour, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the University of Oxford. AI chatbots are also trained to be agreeable digital yes-men, a problem known as sycophancy. This can reinforce harmful beliefs by validating users rather than pushing back when appropriate, Nour says. While that won't matter for most users, it can be dangerous for people already vulnerable to distorted thinking, including those with a personal or family history of psychosis, or conditions like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

This style of communication is a feature, not a bug. Chatbots “are explicitly being designed precisely to elicit intimacy and emotional engagement in order to increase our trust in and dependency on them,” says Lucy Osler, a philosopher at the University of Exeter studying AI psychosis.

Other chatbot traits compound the problem. They have a well-documented tendency to produce confident falsities called AI hallucinations, which can help seed or accelerate delusional spirals. Clinicians also worry about emotion and tone. Søren Østergaard, a psychiatrist at Denmark's Aarhus University, flagged mania as a concern to WIRED. He argues that the hyped, energetic affect of many AI assistants could trigger or sustain the defining “high” of bipolar disorder, which is marked by symptoms including euphoria, racing thoughts, intense energy, and, sometimes, psychosis.

Naming something has consequences. Nina Vasan, a psychiatrist and director of Brainstorm, a lab at Stanford studying AI safety, says the discussion of AI psychosis illustrates a familiar hazard in medicine. “There's always a temptation to coin a new diagnosis, but psychiatry has learned the hard way that naming something too soon can pathologize normal struggles and muddy the science,” she says. The surge of pediatric bipolar diagnoses at the turn of the century—a controversial label critics argue pathologizes normal, if challenging, childhood behavior—is a good example of psychiatry rushing ahead only to backpedal later. Another is “excited delirium,” an unscientific label that is often cited by law enforcement to justify using force against marginalized communities, but which has been rejected by experts and associations like the American Medical Association.

A name also suggests a causal mechanism we have not established, meaning people may “start blaming the tech as the disease, when it's better understood as a trigger or amplifier,” Vasan says. “It's far too early to say the technology is the cause,” she says, describing the label as “premature.” But should a causal link be proven, a formal label could help patients get more appropriate care, experts say. Vasan notes that a justified label would also empower people “to sound the alarm and demand immediate safeguards and policy.” For now, however, Vasan says “the risks of overlabeling outweigh the benefits.”

Several clinicians WIRED spoke with proposed more accurate phrasing that explicitly folds AI psychosis into existing diagnostic frameworks. “I think we need to understand this as psychosis with AI as an accelerant rather than creating an entirely new diagnostic category,” says Sakata, warning that the term could deepen stigma around psychosis. And as the stigma attached to other mental health conditions demonstrates, a deeper stigma around AI-related psychosis could prevent people from seeking help, lead to self-blame and isolation, and make recovery harder.

Karthik Sarma, a computer scientist and practicing psychiatrist at UCSF, concurs. “I think a better term might be to call this ‘AI-associated psychosis or mania.'” That said, Sarma says a new diagnosis could be useful in the future, but stressed that right now, there isn't yet evidence “that would justify a new diagnosis.”

John Torous, a psychiatrist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, says he dislikes the term and agrees on the need for precision. But we'll probably be stuck with it, he predicts. “At this point it is not going to get corrected. ‘AI-related altered mental state' doesn't have the same ring to it.”

For treatment, clinicians say the playbook doesn't really change from what would normally be done for anyone presenting with delusions or psychosis. The main difference is to consider patients' use of technology. “Clinicians need to start asking patients about chatbot use just like we ask about alcohol or sleep,” Vasan says. “This will allow us as a community to develop an understanding of this issue,” Sarma adds. Users of AI, especially those who may be vulnerable because of preexisting conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, or who are experiencing a crisis that is affecting their mental health, should be wary of extensive conversations with bots or leaning on them too heavily.

All of the psychiatrists and researchers WIRED spoke to say clinicians are effectively flying blind when it comes to AI psychosis. Research to understand the issue and safeguards to protect users are desperately needed, they say. “Psychiatrists are deeply concerned and want to help,” Torous says. “But there is so little data and facts right now that it remains challenging to fully understand what is actually happening, why, and to how many people.”

As for where this is going, most expect AI psychosis will be folded into existing categories, probably as a risk factor or amplifier of delusions, not a distinct condition.

But with chatbots growing more and more common, some feel the line between AI and mental illness will blur. “As AI becomes more ubiquitous, people will increasingly turn to AI when they are developing a psychotic disorder,” MacCabe says. “It will then be the case that the majority of people with delusions will have discussed their delusions with AI and some will have had them amplified.

“So the question becomes, where does a delusion become an AI delusion?”

During a keynote address at Meta's Connect event today, CEO Mark Zuckerberg further laid out his vision for what he sees as the future of his company's hardware efforts: smart glasses.

The new models include a set of frames made for action sports, an update to Meta's original design, and a more capable model with display technology built into the lenses that lets the wearer see text, images, and video overlaid onto their field of vision.

Face computing is a vein Meta has successfully mined for a couple of years. The company has fast become the leader of the smart glasses race, having sold millions of units since launching its partnership with Ray-Ban in 2023. In July of this year, Meta further solidified its priorities by investing an estimated $3.5 billion to secure a minority stake in the eyewear company EssilorLuxottica, which owns Ray-Ban, Oakley, and numerous other eyeglass brands.

Meta sees its wearable tech as a natural conduit for its AI efforts, including its voice-controlled chatbot. During an earnings call earlier this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he believes that in the future, people who don't wear smart glasses will find themselves at a “significant cognitive disadvantage” compared with people who do wear them.

The new smart glasses were officially revealed at Meta Connect despite the fact that Meta had scooped itself by accidentally leaking the news of its new glasses two days earlier.

We had a chance to try on all the new spectacles, both at Meta Connect in Menlo Park, California, and at an exclusive preview event in London. Here are the details on all the glasses Meta showed off.

The frames and the wristband.

The display is on the right lens.

The band's sensor array.

The new flagship product in the Meta glasses lineup is the Meta Ray-Ban Display, a wearable computing system for augmented reality. It feels like the first commercial step towards realizing the Orion glasses Meta teased at Connect last year.

As the name implies, this is the first pair of Meta glasses you can buy that displays text, images, and video directly on the lens, allowing users to see WhatsApp messages, Instagram Reels, and video calls all completely within the glasses. The display window pops up in the right eye lens. The resolution is 42 ppd (pixels per degree). If you close your left eye and just look through the eye in front of the screen, the display view looks great. Trying to read the display while looking through the glasses with both eyes feels like crossing your eyes and takes quite a bit of getting used to.

Interacting with the Display requires the use of Meta's Neural Band, a wristband that can detect a range of subtle hand gestures. The gestures it can recognize include a tap of the index and middle fingers to select, go back, or to wake and sleep the display; a swipe of the thumb across the index finger to navigate menus; and pinch and twist movements for controlling music volume or camera zooms. There's also a double thumb tap for manually waking up the Meta AI chatbot instead of using a wake word.

It takes time to realize you don't have to hold your hand out in front of you for these gestures to be recognized, but a surprisingly short amount of time to find yourself using them with very little second thought.

Of course talking to Meta AI remains a key way of interacting with the glasses, but Meta hopes that adding the visual elements will enhance the chatbot experience. For example, live speech captioning and language translation is still switched on by voice—but with Meta Ray-Ban Display, you can see the translations and captions appearing in real time on the glasses rather than on your phone's screen. This is the same with commands like “Hey Meta, what am I looking at?” which can now offer more visually rich information about whatever the front-facing cameras are pointing at. Asking Meta to navigate to a local attraction results in the glasses displaying turn-by-turn directions directly on top of the real world as you walk.

For times when talking might be difficult, Meta also showed off a feature that tracks handwriting input as an alternative to voice commands. Aimed at quick messages, the user can “draw” letters with an outstretched finger on a flat service (or your leg), and the Neural Band will turn it into text. Though the feature was part of the demo we received, Meta says it won't be available to users at launch, but will arrive soon. Who knows, maybe this will be the thing that helps save handwriting.

Meta has acknowledged some limitations with features at launch. For example, the built-in Spotify integration is only able to show what's playing on your phone and give you basic playback controls, and Instagram is currently limited to just Reels and messages. Meta intends to broaden out the capabilities soon.

Also notable: The Orion prototype we saw last year required an external puck to power its most computing-intensive capabilities. But that prototype design provides a full range of augmented-reality features. The AR feature set of this new Display model is more limited, so the puck isn't needed. Also, this means the Display's frames are slimmer. Meta does eventually plan to offer a full slate of wearable options to consumers: smart glasses, display glasses, and full AR glasses.

The Ray-Ban Displays will be available in either black or sand colors starting on September 30 for $799 and will initially only be available as in-store purchases in the US. Meta says you need to buy them in person because the wristband has to be fitted correctly to the wrist of your dominant hand. Also, the folks selling you the system will show you the hand gestures that control the glasses—though there will be a tutorial walk-through when you first power on the glasses too.

Be ready to move quickly if you want them, though. Meta says there are limited quantities available, and other countries won't get them until early 2026.

The Vanguard.

Louder speakers are built into the arms.

The ultrawide camera is right in the middle.

Following on from the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses announced earlier this year, Meta's newest Oakley collaboration evokes the timeless look of a pair of wrap-around Oakley Sphaera glasses—but with a twist. That twist of course is a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera with a 122-degree field of view that's positioned smack in the middle of the lens, right on the bridge of your nose. This is the optimum placement for recording POV action-sports videos at up to 3K, as well as for capturing scenes in the glasses' new slow-mo and hyperlapse modes.

The Vanguards are very much being marketed to sports enthusiasts—those who might be inclined to choose the Meta glasses over a GoPro, for instance. To that end, the Vanguards have an IP67 waterproof rating, the best waterproofing on any pair of Meta glasses. The speakers built into the arms of the frames are 6 decibels louder to make up for any loss of clarity caused by wind noise, and a new five-mic array lets your commands be clearly heard even when an arctic gale is blasting you in the face while you careen down the slopes.

They get nine hours of battery life on a single charge, which is the longest battery life of any Meta glasses. And a fun detail: The controls, which include a new customizable Action button, are mounted along the bottom of the arms instead of the top, so they are easily accessible when you're wearing a helmet. There are three interchangeable nosepads in the box, so you can find the best fit.

Sporty types will also be pleased to hear the glasses support Strava and Garmin integrations, which allow you to ask Meta AI for performance metrics and have your stats spoken back to you in real time.

This integration also allows the Vanguards to understand your output and progress, so the glasses can (if you choose) automatically capture pictures and video at key milestones along your ride, hike, or run. Depending on the historical data collected by the glasses, the videos and photos that are auto-captured could be of you hitting a certain speed, altitude, or distance in your activity. The glasses will just decide what feels worth capturing.

Once you're done, you can then overlay your Garmin or Strava stats onto your footage and post it for bragging rights.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard shades will be available on October 29 and will come in a choice of four totally radical colors. They will cost $499, with swappable Prizm lenses available separately if you'd like to customize them further.

The Gen 2 Ray-Bans.

The same frame shapes are still available.

Get them with different types of lenses.

The smart glasses that started it all, the Ray-Ban Meta, are entering their official second generation. The Gen 2 frames adopt an “if it ain't broke” mentality; they look identical to their predecessor, but pull in a few new features that you'd find in Meta's Oakley models.

This includes a 2x better camera for capturing up to 3K footage, and the addition of the new slow-mo and hyperlapse video modes. Meta has also doubled the glasses' four-hour battery life, promising eight hours of mixed use from a single charge on the Gen 2. There are no new designs (yet), but each of the three frame styles gets a new “seasonal” color: the Wayfarer gets Cosmic Blue, the Headliner gets Shiny Asteroid Grey, while the Skyler gets Mystic Violet.

The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) cost $379 and are available starting today.

In my ongoing quest to put as many of the popular indoor hydroponic garden systems as I can through their paces, I have noticed something irritating.

Many, if not most, of these systems require—or at minimum, strongly suggest—ordering proprietary seed pods, inserts, or capsules from the company itself. You can jury-rig, of course, but usually at your own hassle and failure risk. If you order through the companies, not only can the excess packaging be wasteful, the costs add up quickly (competitor Click & Grow's pods, for example, are almost $5 each).

When I saw the Auk (pronounced “owk”) and its four little pots of coconut coir advertised on my social media feed, I was immediately intrigued. Finally, an open-system indoor garden where you can grow your own seeds! There's got to be a catch, I thought. But there isn't. After testing it for six weeks, I can report that the Auk fully delivers on its promise of “herbs made simple.”

Although its ads make it seem like a newcomer, Norway-based Auk has actually been in business since 2021. It's perhaps best known for its original Auk 1 hydroponic garden, which features a more complicated water reservoir, nutrient mixer, and lighting setup that garnered mixed reviews online for inconsistent light cycles and watering. The herb-focused Auk Mini, on the other hand, is not that.

Released in May 2024, it features four oval pots with slotted bottoms that sit atop a 3-liter reservoir. This 17.5 x 8.5 x 14.5-inch base is flanked by two wooden poles, which hold a tension-set full-spectrum light bar. A little wheel on the side indicates the water level, with a red dot indicating when it's empty.

Simply fill the pots with the included coconut coir (fibers from the exterior of coconuts), plant your seeds, add squirts of the included nutrients (the bottles say how many on the side), plug in the light bar, and position it 4 inches above the pots to start. That's it. There's no pump, and the light bar will stay on for 17.5 hours—hold the button underneath the light for five seconds to set the “sunrise” time. Finish options include oak or walnut, with white or black pots.

The Mini comes with basil and parsley seeds, with helpful information on the back about how many seeds to plant and where to place them amid the coconut fiber. However, any brand's seeds should work. Auk sells other seeds on its website, of course, along with replacement substrate, but that is also widely available.

Though Auk is made for herbs, there's also a “chili and tomato mode” for the light bar, which offers boosted light brightness (tap the button three times to activate). The nutrient bottles also have specific “tomato & chili” dispensing instructions. I tested the Auk with basil, cilantro, and parsley, and did not try tomatoes or chilis, but given my experience with other gardens that feature overhead light bars, I'm dubious those would thrive—plants of this size usually grow past a 12-inch light bar early on, leaving them with insufficient light to flower.

Basil was first to sprout, followed by cilantro and then parsley—all within a week—and were harvestable a few weeks after that. Herbs are considered fully grown in four to six weeks, and Auk recommends harvesting no more than one-third of a plant at a time for optimal plant health.

One thing to note is that as much as the Auk tries to sanitize and simplify the growing process, plants are still wildlife, and wildlife be wildin'. Within about a month, my beautiful Scandinavian showpiece was replaced by an unkempt bush of leggy parsley and floppy cilantro. I'm sure this process was not helped by a weeklong vacation during which I was not able to harvest. By the time I got home, the Auk's walnut poles and stylish pots were obscured. The aluminum light bar, despite being at its tallest setting, was touched by basil leaves with burned edges and spots where they had grown too close to the LEDs. It was, in a word, ugly.

But it was also fecund. Basil harvests throughout my six-week test consisted of not just a handful of leaves but an entire bowlful—enough to make pesto. Perpetual bunches of parsley and cilantro provided garnishes for multiple meals each week. I also look forward to the possibility of growing less common herbs like epazote and savory.

One risk of pumpless systems like this is the potential for mold. I inspected the underside of the Auk's pots regularly and didn't spot any, but the room it was in was cool, below 70 degrees Fahrenheit—in warmer climates, this could well be a concern.

Just about any user will have success in the Auk—there's no fussing with pump tubing, timers, or pH (the coconut fiber works as a pH buffer, according to Auk), and you can grow legitimately harvestable amounts of herbs instead of just the one stalk that you get with pod-style gardens. If you're on the fence, there's a 100-day money-back guarantee.

It's also worth noting that, aside from the design, there's nothing particularly innovative about the components—there's no obvious reason, aside from R&D, that it should cost twice as much as traditional pod-style planters like the Aerogarden. It does seem silly to pay for looks when the main focal point is a living thing that may or may not cooperate with your aesthetic vision—leaves will drop, stems will die, stalks will twist this way and that in their competition for light. But until this happens, the Auk will look darn good on just about any kitchen island or counter.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Anti-Trump Protesters Take Aim at ‘Naive' US-UK AI Deal","https://www.wired.com/story/climate-activists-unite-in-london-to-protest-trump-visit-uk/","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 10:49:00 GMT","

They banged drums. They played extremely loud music. They let off foul-smelling smoke from a can. Thousands of people gathered on Wednesday in central London to protest against Us president Donald Trump's presence in the UK, accusing the UK government of kowtowing to him by hosting him for a state visit for the second time.

Some of the placards read “Trump poisons democracy's blood,” “Trump's a wanker,” and “Tiny dicktator.” On one banner, surrounding a depiction of the US president as an infant wearing a diaper, were the words “Get the baby out of here”—a reference to the giant orange Trump Baby balloon that flew in the capital during Trump's 2018 state visit and which has been reportedly donated to the Museum of London.

Almost 23 miles away, behind the locked gates of Windsor Castle, Trump's second state visit has been happening mostly in private. Even so, he has not been able to escape his critics. Four men were reportedly arrested in Windsor for allegedly projecting gigantic images of Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein on the side of the castle building on Tuesday. Authorities claim the men, from the protest organization Led by Donkeys, used a projector to beam the images from a nearby hotel.

Some protesters at the march held pro-Palastine placards, some pro-Ukraine. But many were attending for environmental reasons. Protesters WIRED spoke with were concerned and angry about the AI deal announced this week between the US and the UK, which will involve big tech companies Nvidia and Microsoft investing up to $45 billion into scaling up data centers, supercomputers, and AI R&D. Several protesters pointed out that the fine print of the deal—and how the tech companies involved will benefit from it—has not been made public.

At the heart of the AI deal is a British startup, data center builder Nscale, which will use this funding to build more data centers and—according to new investor Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang—generate more than $68 billion in revenue over six years. Critics of the UK's AI plan claim that data centers already guzzle up too much power and water and are being erected across the UK despite local opposition. And in the wake of the deals with US giants being announced, protesters were also questioning claims that they will help the UK create sovereign AI or more jobs.

Nick Dearden, director of the campaign group Global Justice Now and a spokesperson for the Stop Trump Coalition, which organized the march, says that people are beginning to be really concerned about what AI means for them, how AI companies are going to be regulated and taxed, and what they are actually going to get out of them.

“We have not seen the text of the deal,” Dearden says. “We don't know what we have given away. We know that some of the tech barons accompanying Trump want us to drop parts of our regulation, want us to drop the digital services tax, want us to make it easier for them to acquire and merge with each other to become even bigger monopolies, so we are worried about that.”

The AI deal has been presented to the British public “as if it were a great thing,” Dearden says, but he believes it hasn't been interrogated at all. “When people see these things being built and they realize the scale of them, it's going to be a real clash between the government and the public on this issue.”

The suggestion that investment from major US companies will lead to a surge in British sovereign AI has also been criticized. “I don't see there's anything here that to me looks like that,” Dearden says. “Sure, the companies involved may not be doing every bit of the process, but as long as they essentially command and control what's going on, ultimately, this is building their monopolies.”

Sarah, who gave only her first name, was representing a campaign group called Cut the Ties to Fossil Fuels, which is affiliated with the environmentalist group Extinction Rebellion. She says she has lost trust in the government. “We know we are talking massive scale [of emissions,] but we don't really know what that looks like,” she explains. “Our government is just falling at the knees of whoever pays the most money … we can't trust anything they do or say.

“It was so important to come here today because there is such a wide mix of groups. The guy [Trump] on every level should not be in power, he should not be allowed in front of any TV camera, let alone as president of the United States, and to have him here, on a state visit with the royal family—that I do generally believe care—this is just not on. It really is not on.”

Like other protesters, Sarah was quick to reference the far-right march in London last Saturday, which attracted over 100,000 people and exposed deepening divisions within UK society, as a reason to protest.

“To have this guy here and for our government and our royal family to welcome him is such a fucking grave error,” she says, describing Trump as the “epitome of hate and violence.” “We are angry. We are all really angry.”

Clive Teague, who was at the protest supporting Extinction Rebellion Waverley and Borders in Surrey, says that this AI deal is one of many things the government is getting wrong. Trump “is there [in Windsor] because we're here. If we weren't here, he'd be coming down the Mall. We are here to stop him.”

Teague says he isn't against the use of AI, as long as it is done with new, clean energy sources, not existing power. “We can't keep burning fossil fuels to keep feeding into these data centers, because it'll swamp the requirements for the rest of the world.” This sentiment was echoed on the march by other environmental groups, like Greenpeace, which objects to huge data centers being approved without what it considers to be a proper assessment of the impacts on local water systems and the power grid.

“Greenpeace is not opposed to AI,” Greenpeace UK chief scientist Doug Parr said in a written statement to WIRED. “The multibillion-pound tech giants building new data centers should be forced to take some responsibility for funding solutions, whether it's cooling methods using much less water or running on new, clean renewable power. It's time for the government to lay down some rules and take responsibility instead of just cheerleading for the AI sector.”

Rob Maitland, a cheerful older man with a ponytail who says he decided to march for the first time in his life, described the protest as “wonderful.” “I've been watching this whole situation very carefully since 2017 when Trump got in the first time,” he says. “And I said if Trump gets in again, I'm getting the first spaceship out of here, because it's going to be dreadful.

“But of course he got in for a second time, and ever since then I've been feeling that surely there should be something I can do,” he says. “People have turned up en masse because one person is a voice in the wilderness but 10 million voices make it possible.”

“Sometimes you've just got to show your disgust,” Maitland's wife, Jane, interjects. “What happens over there happens over here.”

Standing behind a “Dump Tesla” banner, Theodora Sutcliffe from Tesla Takedown UK says that the notion that the British people will get any return on the tech deal announced this week is “naive.” “We should be trying to develop our own AI industry. We've got some quite good self-driving-car companies, for example, we've got good computer labs, and we should be trying to home-grow our own for all sorts of reasons, but not least because we can control it and regulate it ourselves,” she says. Sutcliffe described UK prime minister Keir Starmer as “a bit of a technocrat and a bit naive about technology; he's probably thinking AI is going to fix things.”

Sutcliffe is among those at the protest who strongly believe there is a link between Trump's politics, billionaire profiteering, and the rise of the far right.

When I ask her what her message to Trump would be, she pauses. “That's a good one,” Sutcliffe says, thinking. “Stop being a fascist?”

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

In an e-commerce twist almost worthy of The Twilight Zone or Black Mirror, Amazon is now officially supporting orders placed on Walmart.com — allowing sellers to tap into Amazon's logistics network to fulfill purchases made on the site of its biggest retail rival.

The move, announced Thursday at Amazon's Accelerate seller conference, is part of a broader expansion of its Multichannel Fulfillment (MCF) service. Amazon is also deepening its Shopify support and plans to begin fulfilling orders from fast-fashion juggernaut Shein later this year.

It's part of a larger effort to offer services to sellers beyond the virtual walls of Amazon.com, and one of a series of updates to its Supply Chain by Amazon initiative at the conference. The company is pitching itself as an end-to-end logistics partner, offering the ability to move products from manufacturer to customer regardless of sales channel.

In the process, it's competing more directly with services from rivals like ShipBob, FedEx, UPS, and DHL, in addition to services from Walmart and Shopify themselves. 

Amazon already supports fulfillment of orders from sites including eBay, Etsy, Temu and others. But using MCF for unsupported platforms requires a manual, cumbersome process. 

“This is now a direct integration, so that anytime you get a Walmart order, we'll just fulfill it,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon's vice president of selling partner services, in an interview.

This doesn't mean Walmart online shoppers will see the smiling Amazon logo on the box they receive. But they won't have the blue and yellow Walmart logo, either. Walmart prohibits deliveries in Amazon boxes, so the products go out in boxes and envelopes without logos.

It's one slice of a big business for Amazon. The company's revenue from third-party seller services — which includes commissions, fulfillment and shipping fees, and related services — reached $156 billion in 2024, or nearly a quarter of its total revenue of $638 billion.

PayPal announced on Wednesday a new multi-year partnership with Google that will see the payments giant using Google's AI technology to create new AI-powered shopping experiences. PayPal's solutions, meanwhile, will be integrated across Google's products, and PayPal will work with Google Cloud on hosting and improving its technology infrastructure.

The companies did not detail what specific types of agentic shopping experiences they would work together to create but said Google would contribute its AI technology and expertise, and PayPal would leverage its global payment infrastructure, personalization, and identity solutions.

In addition, both companies will join others to advocate for the adoption of Google's new Agent Payments Protocol, announced on Tuesday. This open protocol is meant to enable purchases that are initiated by AI agents and has already been backed by over 60 merchants and financial institutions.

As part of the deal, PayPal will be listed as a key payment provider for card payments in areas like Google Cloud, Google Ads, and Google Play. Other products being integrated by Google include PayPal's branded checkout, Hyperwallet payouts service, and PayPal Payouts service.

Nvidia has agreed to buy a $5 billion stake in Intel as part of a broader deal to together develop “multiple generations” of data center and PC products.

Nvidia will acquire the Intel stock for $23.28 per share, a slight discount on the company's previous trading price. According to Reuters, the deal would make Nvidia one of Intel's largest shareholders, owning about 4% of the company. Intel shares were up as much as 30% in early trading on Thursday morning.

The companies will integrate their two architectures using Nvidia's NVLink interface, which enables data and control code transfers between CPUs and GPUs. NVLink enables faster transfers between chips compared with other standards like PCI Express; that's crucial for AI applications, which require many GPUs to run together and process immense workloads.

For data centers, Intel will manufacture a new line of x86 CPUs specifically customized for Nvidia's AI infrastructure platforms, to be offered to enterprise and hyperscale customers.

For the consumer PC segment, Intel will build x86 system-on-chips that will incorporate chiplets of Nvidia's RTX GPUs, which will no doubt give Intel an edge over rival AMD's CPUs. The companies are calling these chips “x86 RTX SoCs” at the moment, and claim these chips will power a “wide range of PCs.”

The deal comes after a rough few years for Intel, which has struggled to capitalize on the AI chip race unlike its new partner. Intel brought on a new CEO, laid off thousands of staff as it sought to shore up margins, and spiked manufacturing projects to prioritize more financial discipline.

The deal comes on the heels of another record quarter for Nvidia, which has grown into both the world's most lucrative semiconductor company and, by market cap, one of the largest companies the world. Over the same period, Intel has struggled to keep pace with the fluctuations of market demand, particularly the intense semiconductor demands of AI. As a result, the collaboration could allow Intel to win back market share from rivals like AMD.

“Intel's leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry,” said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan in a statement.

The House Oversight Committee has requested that the CEOs of Discord, Twitch, Reddit, and gaming platform Steam testify on October 8 about their platforms' alleged involvement in any online “radicalization” and the “incitement to commit politically motivated acts,” according to letters sent from the House committee to the four tech CEOs. 

In a statement, Rep. James Comer, chairman of the Oversight Committee, referenced the murder of Charlie Kirk and “other acts of politically motivated violence” as reasons why Congress has a “duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,” he said. 

“To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes.” 

TechCrunch reached out to the companies summoned.

Discord told TechCrunch it looked forward to testifying in October. 

“We continuously engage with policymakers on these critical issues and look forward to continuing this important dialogue next month,” a spokesperson said. 

Reddit, meanwhile, told Reuters it was investigating the link between its platform and Kirk's death, saying it hasn't yet seen proof that the suspect in Kirk's death was an active Reddit user. The company told the outlet that it “has strong policies against hateful content and content that incites, encourages, glorifies or calls for violence.”

Kirk was a prominent conservative activist and a close ally of President Trump. Suspect Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Utah resident, has been arrested for shooting and killing Kirk last week while Kirk spoke at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Robinson appeared to have confessed to committing the crime in a chat on Discord shortly before his arrest. The bullets used were also apparently engraved with memes and references to video games. 

This piece was updated to add a statement from Discord's spokesperson.

Productivity software giant Atlassian is making its largest acquisition yet to add a developer productivity tool to its product suite.  

Atlassian announced Thursday it has agreed to acquire the developer productivity insight platform DX for $1 billion in cash and restricted stock. Enterprises use DX to analyze how productive their engineering teams are and identify bottlenecks slowing them down.

DX was launched five years ago by Abi Noda and Greyson Junggren. Noda told TechCrunch in 2022 that he founded the company to find a better way to understand what hampered engineering teams. At the time, he felt the metrics he was using as a product manager at GitHub weren't giving him the full picture, and he wanted to build something better that didn't make developers feel like they were being surveilled.  

“The assumptions we had about what we needed to help ship products faster were quite different than what the teams and developers were saying was getting in their way,” Noda told TechCrunch at the time. “Even teams didn't always have awareness about their own issues and leadership.” 

DX came out of stealth in 2022 and has since tripled its customer base every year. The company now works with more than 350 enterprise customers, including ADP, Adyen and GitHub, among others, while raising less than $5 million in venture funding.  

Atlassian co-founder and CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes told TechCrunch that after trying to build an in-house developer productivity insight tool for three years, his Sydney, Australia-based company realized it made sense to look for an external, existing option.

DX was a natural choice, Cannon-Brookes said, considering 90% of DX's customers were already used Atlassian's project management and collaboration tools as well.

“DX has done an amazing job [of] understanding the qualitative and quantitative aspects of developer productivity and turning that into actions that can improve those companies and give them insights and comparisons to others in their industry, others at their size, etc.,” Cannon-Brookes said. 

He added that the timing was right due to the rise of AI tools and companies looking for ways to measure how they are being used.  

 “You suddenly have these budgets that are going up. Is that a good thing?” Cannon-Brookes said. “Is that not a good thing?  Am I spending the money in the right ways? It's really, really important and critical.” 

He added that there was a great cultural fit, too. Cannon-Brookes said he's always felt an affinity for Utah-based entrepreneurs — DX is based in Salt Lake City — and he liked that both companies were able to scale without taking on much outside funding.  

The feeling was mutual.  

Noda told TechCrunch this week that he thinks DX and Atlassian are better together than apart and that many of Atlassian's tools are complementary to the data and information that DX's platform gathers.  

“We are able to provide customers with that full flywheel to get the data and understand where we are unhealthy,” Noda said. “They can plug in Atlassian's tools and solutions to go address those bottlenecks. An end-to-end flywheel that is ultimately what customers want.” 

DX's platform will be integrated into the broader Atlassian product suite. 

This is Atlassian's second acquisition this month. The company announced it was buying AI-browser developer The Browser Company in early September.

Google announced Thursday that it's rolling out Gemini in Chrome to all Mac and Windows desktop users in the U.S. after previously limiting the capability to Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra subscribers. The tech giant also announced that it's bringing agentic capabilities to Chrome in the future, adding its AI Mode search feature to the address bar, launching new Gemini features, using AI to combat AI-generated scams, rolling out automatic password resets, and more.

U.S. users who have their language set to English can now ask Gemini to clarify complex information on any webpage they're reading using the Gemini icon in the top-right corner of their Chrome window. For example, you could open up a page that features a banana bread recipe and ask Gemini to make the recipe gluten free.

Gemini can now work across multiple tabs, allowing users to quickly compare and summarize information across multiple websites. For example, you could be planning your flight, hotel, and vacation in multiple tabs and work with Gemini to organize your trip. Or, you might be shopping for a new mattress and want to compare all of the different models you're looking at in multiple tabs.

Gemini will soon be able to retrieve web pages you've previously visited, making it easier to return to past browsing sessions without sifting through your browser history. That means you will be able to ask something like “On which site did I see the walnut desk last week?” or “What was that blog I read on back to school shopping?”

Additionally, Google is launching a deeper integration between Gemini in Chrome and other Google apps, like Calendar, YouTube, and Maps. Google says this will allow users to do things like schedule meetings, see location details, and more more without having to leave the page they're on. For example, if you're trying to find a a specific spot in a YouTube video, you can ask Gemini to take you there. 

Google notes that the AI assistant will be able to complete tedious tasks, like booking a haircut or ordering weekly groceries. Gemini will navigate to the site, add things to your cart, and let you take the final action by checking out with your payment option.

Google says the new agentic capabilities will be coming to Chrome in the coming months. It's worth noting that OpenAI launched Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously, earlier this year.

Google is also bringing AI Mode, its advanced search feature, directly into the Chrome address bar. With AI Mode, users can ask complex questions with follow-ups to dig deeper into topics. For example, instead of searching for “best mattress,” you could type out “I'm a side sleeper with occasional lower back pain, make me a table comparing the different mattress types” directly in the address bar. From there, you could ask follow-up questions and keep your search going with queries like, “How long do memory foam mattresses typically last?”

This update will be rolling out later this month in English in the U.S.  and expanding to more countries and languages in the future. 

Also coming to the address bar is the ability to ask questions about the page you're on. Chrome can now suggest relevant questions based on the context of the page to kickstart your search in the address bar. Google says users will get a helpful AI Overview and the option to ask follow-up questions with AI Mode. 

Google says Chrome will also soon be able to use its Gemini Nano model to detect and protect against scams, such as fake virus alerts and fraudulent giveaways. These scams often impersonate trusted brands and use generative AI to create convincing phishing attempts, Google notes. 

Google also announced that it's using AI to help users fix compromised passwords with a single click on supported sites, like Coursera, Spotify, Duolingo, H&M, and more. If Chrome warns you that you password was exposed in a data breach, you can allow it to create and save a new one for you.

Google's Nano Banana image-generation model, officially known as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, has fueled global momentum for the Gemini app since launching last month. But in India, it has taken on a creative life of its own, with retro portraits and local trends going viral — even as privacy and safety concerns begin to emerge.

India has emerged as the No. 1 country in terms of Nano Banana usage for now, according to David Sharon, multimodal generation lead for Gemini Apps at Google DeepMind, who spoke at a media session this week. The model's popularity has also propelled the Gemini app to the top of the free app charts on both the App Store and Google Play in India. The app has also climbed to the top of global app stores' charts, according to Appfigures.

Given India's scale — the world's second-largest smartphone market and second-biggest online population after China — it is no surprise the country is leading in adoption. But what is catching Google's attention is not just how many people are using Nano Banana, it is how: Millions of Indians are engaging with the AI model in ways that are uniquely local, highly creative, and in some cases, completely unexpected.

One of the standout trends is Indians using Nano Banana to re-create retro looks inspired by 1990s Bollywood, imagining how they might have appeared during that era, complete with period-specific fashion, hairstyles, and makeup. This trend is local to India, Sharon told reporters.

A variation of the retro trend is what some are calling the “AI saree,” where users generate vintage-style portraits of themselves wearing traditional Indian attire.

Another trend local to India is people generating their selfies in front of cityscapes and iconic landmarks, such as Big Ben and the U.K.'s retro telephone booths.

“We saw a lot of that in the beginning,” Sharon said.

Indian users are also experimenting with Nano Banana to transform objects, create time-travel effects, and even reimagine themselves as retro postage stamps. Others are generating black-and-white portraits or using the model to visualize encounters with their younger selves.

Some of these trends did not originate in India, but the country played a key role in helping them gain global attention. One example is the figurine trend, where people generate miniature versions of themselves, often placing them in front of a computer screen. The trend first emerged in Thailand, spread to Indonesia, and became global after gaining traction in India, Sharon said.

In addition to Nano Banana, Google has observed a trend where Indian users are utilizing its Veo 3 AI video-generation model on the Gemini app to create short videos from old photos of their grandparents and great-grandparents.

All of this has helped drive Gemini's popularity on both the App Store and Google Play in India. Between January and August, the app saw an average of 1.9 million monthly downloads in the country — about 55% higher than in the U.S. — accounting for 16.6% of global monthly downloads, per Appfigures data shared exclusively with TechCrunch.

India downloads have totaled 15.2 million this year until August; the U.S., on the other hand, has had 9.8 million downloads so far this year, per Appfigures data.

Daily downloads of the Gemini app in India significantly surged following the release of the Nano Banana update, beginning on September 1 with 55,000 installs across both app stores. Downloads peaked at 414,000 on September 13 — a 667% increase — with Gemini holding the top overall spot on the iOS App Store since September 10 and on Google Play since September 12, including across all categories, Appfigures data shows.

Despite India leading in downloads, the country does not top in-app purchases on the Gemini app, which has generated an estimated $6.4 million in global consumer spending on iOS since launch, per Appfigures. The U.S. accounts for the largest share at $2.3 million (35%), while India contributes $95,000 (1.5%). However, India posted a record 18% month-over-month growth in spending, reaching $13,000 between September 1 and 16 — compared to an 11% global increase during the same period. That puts India seven percentage points above the global rate and more than 17 points ahead of the U.S., where growth was under 1%.

That said, as with other AI apps, there are concerns about users uploading personal photos to Gemini to transform their appearance.

“When a user asks us to fulfill their query, we do our best to fulfill that query. We don't try to assume what the user's intent is,” Sharon said while addressing questions on how Google is dealing with data misuse and privacy concerns among users in India and other top markets. “We've really tried to improve that, and we have improved that to be bold and fulfil your request.”

Google places a visible, diamond-shaped watermark on images generated by the Nano Banana model and also embeds a hidden marker using its SynthID tool to identify AI-generated content. SynthID allows Google to detect and flag whether an image was created using its models.

Sharon told reporters that Google is testing a detection platform with trusted testers, researchers, and other experts. The company also plans to launch a consumer-facing version that would allow anyone to check whether an image is AI-generated.

“This is still day one, and we're still learning, and we're learning together. There are things that we might need to improve on in the future, and it's really your feedback from users, press, academia, and experts that helps us improve,” Sharon said.

Then, suddenly, they called us 2 days ago and said they are going to de-activate the Hack Club Slack, including all message history from 11 years, unless we pay them $50,000 USD this week and $200,000 USD/year moving forward (plus additional annual fees for new accounts, including inactive ones)For anyone reading this, we would really appreciate any way to contact people at Salesforce to discuss time to migrate because deactivating us in 5 days destroys all the work of thousands of teen coders at Hack Club and alum unnecessarily. We are not asking for anything for free. This was an underhanded process by the sales team to raise our rate exorbitantly from a qualified educational 501(c)(3) charity serving young developers or destroy all their projects, DMs and work forever. If Salesforce's goals have changed- ok. Give us a reasonable amount of time to migrate- and don't club us over the head like this. We have had an 11 year great relationship with Slack- and have introduced the company to many many future engineers and founders. My email if you can help us: christina@hackclub.com

The shadow IT model isn't the dominant one in the space where Salesforce play. They used that to a degree too when they were small, but they now lean towards enterprise sales. Shadow IT is sold as a risk by them. Want something secure, safe, and compliant? Work with us because we'll sign up to these things contractually (even if delivery is questionable.)This means that a slack salesperson has to choose between targeting a department and pissing off IT versus working on a company-level deal. This changes behavior significantly. It also changes lots of the economic expectations. Previously, these little deals here and there could add up. On top, you might get credit from driving engagement. Now you carry a much larger quota where engagement is important in practice, but not in how sales is executed.This drives the behavior you see here. Someone is reevaluating each of the current deals with this new lens. In practice, they can maximize revenue with these bullying tactics. Many times, in the enterprise space, it's better for a customer to be cut off, or give up, even if this is temporary. The intention is for the customer to return and agree to different terms even if the financials are adjusted to something more favorable.

Here it likely was the exact opposite: the long tail of low-paying clients is annoying to manage compared to how much they bring cumulatively. So the client had been given a choice of either becoming a high-paying client or stop being a client altogether.

This is a thought I'm having lot as I get older. I've taken to judging people on how much what they say they work for in the world aligns with the profile of who they choose to work for. Not so much for unskilled in minimum wage work, but massively so for anyone who works in tech.It pains me to see so many engineers younger than me convinced that they're bringing around positive changes with their career whilst working for companies and people who are demonstrably against everything they claim they're working for.

But they are horrible at integrating with anything else, making engineers happy, make data and AI people happy. They wall everything in. Guess what, you are not their customer. The sales people are.So yeah, I hate them, but even more reluctantly, I admit that despite the multi million dollar invoice they send each year, we haven't really found a worthwile replacement. And most of our staff is actually quite positive about them because the old system was MS Dynamics, which is even worse.

It's sold as the magic sales tool that does everything. And it does do everything, as long as a developer builds whatever everything is you need first. Otherwise it doesn't do anything. That's pretty heartbreaking to watch people realize on repeat.

I urge every user of Hacker News to read Peter Thiel's book, Zero to One. It's the definitive statement on software capitalism.The goal, which Thiel embraces unabashedly, is to use technology to create new and unique monopolies, and once you've created them, extract as much rent as possible from the users. Obviously the users hate that part once it kicks in.Thiel really seems to believe this is a good thing and there's a sense in which he's right: the tech industry has created more gadgets and created (or consumed?) a level of economic activity on par with industrialization itself. We have been introduced to all manner of innovations and conveniences, and the winners at this game have won bigger than anybody else.But it is undoubtedly anti-consumer and anti-user. They give you something good, you get hooked, and then they enshittify it once you can't get out, and it's all part of the plan. Again, and again, and again, for more than 40 years now.That's why once you're done with Thiel, you should read the GNU Manifesto. Richard Stallman identified the basic dynamics here as far back as the 1980s, and started his movement from the perspective of a user of computer systems who didn't want everything to be trapped and enshittified once again. By encouraging programmers to adopt the GNU license he aimed to prevent the rent seeking stage of this process.Both camps succeeded partially. Thiel's camp succeeded more, especially economically. Which camp you join is up to you when you write a line of code or you use a piece of software. I personally think the world is complicated and there are elements of value in both. Regardless these are the two written works which together will give you the full context about the software industry, how it works, how it got this way, and even why modern life is the way it is.And then you will see how it is by design for Salesforce to fuck nonprofits because it works. It was in the plan from day one. They knew. They will do it again.

I'm paraphrasing here, it's been a long time, but his thesis is that in a competitive situation life of a company is nasty, brutish and short.  And that might be true, but that doesn't mean that life for customers or shareholders or workers is anything like that.Part of why companies have it so hard in harsh competition is that they have to pay workers well in order to attract them, and they have to offer customers real value for money (if they want to keep getting their money), and companies also have to give decent returns to shareholders.

The harsh truth: Alienating some free or highly discounted users can be a net win for companies if it allows them to raise their prices for remaining customers.This is an extreme example, but it happens all the time. The free or discounted years are always angry, justifiably, but dropping the free plan is a common growth phase for companies looking to reduce their support load, server count, and increase their revenue per user.> But it is undoubtedly anti-consumer and anti-user. They give you something good, you get hooked, and then they enshittify itThe key word here is “give”. The free plans were always supposed to be a hook for getting people familiar with the platform so they would buy it later or spread the word. Free plans disappear once the market matures because the free plan no longer serves that purpose. They don't need to spread the word because everyone knows about Slack. It's a pop culture word, now, not something that needs to be spread around so people talk about it to their bosses.

Also, whenever you create a team in Teams, it creates a SharePoint site for that team. So we are the engineering team and want all our docs in engineering. But to spin up a cross-team project team means it gets its own SharePoint site and now files are scattered. Want to add a Loop workspace? That's per channel, not per team. And teams are exchange groups - so it makes handling exclusive email groups more difficult because if your team is public then anybody can join your email group.That's my biggest gripe about Teams. But also notifications have never worked well for me. The integrations, even with Microsoft products, are poor. Want to send a well-formatted Azure Monitor alert to a Teams channel? You have to set up a complicated and fragile logic app (power automate) and figure out how to transform the message from the ""common alert schema"".And message management is harder. In Slack I could always use the built-in remind-me-later. It'd put the message in Later and notify me again. The best we have in Teams is the power automate workflow to resend the message. But it's just too much friction typing in the exact date and time I want it resent vs Slack where I could just click ""remind me tomorrow"".End rant

We did the migration in stages, basically this:    - Provide access to Teams
    - Create all of the new teams / channels there
    - Make Slack read-only but still keep the lights on
    - Allow folks to search and reference historic data as needed with Slack
    - Ensure everyone was moved over to Teams and felt ok enough using it
    - Remove access to Slack
    - Perform Slack export / PDF creation of important channels
    - Attach Slack PDFs to important Teams channels
    - Cancel Slack subscription

In the end, most people never even needed to use the PDFs because they got everything they needed out of Slack before access was removed, but they are there for peace of mind and a last resort.We also took this as an opportunity to stop using chat as a source of truth for long lived information. Anything that should be stored long term made its way somewhere else (Jira, Confluence, etc.).

Over time the business gravitated towards putting anything long lived into other sources but since migrating off Slack was essentially a kill switch on our data we wanted to make sure we had ways to access this historic data if needed.There's no way non-developers were going to parse JSON files for text. We wanted a quick and dirty way to attach the archived PDF file for a channel as a file attachment to the new Teams channel. It gave everyone peace of mind that they could find anything later.It all worked out in the end and was worth the few hours of dev time to make the 1 off script.Btw I wasn't the one responsible for making the tech choice to use or leave Slack for Teams. I was the one who was tasked to help with the migration and help make things as streamlined as possible for the business to switch.One of the biggest pain points was going back to a bunch of Google Drive, Jira, Confluence, etc. sources and finding + updating the links to Slack to be screenshots of the conversation. Another one was converting a bunch of Slack app / webhook integrations over. Teams is absolutely horrendous for this compared to Slack.

Extensibility and integrations with learning management systems, as well as owning all your data, makes it sound like a great option in particular for an education-oriented organization.And I imaging the AWS or GCP costs for hosting it won't be as high as what Slack wants.

The biggest issue is the abrupt change in policy.  Slack had wanted Hack Club's patronage and had supported it.

It's more a tacit admission by Slack that their pricing model can't possible work for orgs that don't match a strict employer-employee model.Nobody would agree to pay per-seat for every customer who uses a support tool, for example (which is much closer to the model this nonprofit is operating)

On a smaller scale it happens on a monthly basis with telecomms - almost never with rates, but they amend privacy policy and stuff - as a customer a change in the contract gives you an opportunity to say you're not accepting new contract, within certain timeframe, and walk away.I guess this is simmilar - they told them they are changing the contract, and under new circumstances they will have to pay this and that, but they are free to walk away and pay nothing.Still a dick move.

If your rates were raised and you have not received new contract, if you can drop the service at that point, they can't collect including any cancellation fees.If you want to continue using the service, that's a bit trickier.

You probably should expect large bill increases over time from ransomware-as-a-service companies like Slack.  Not all of them—people are capable of behaving decently—but probably the nature of the category is such that you should expect it of most of them.When switching providers is impossible, the pricing of maximum profit for the provider is the pricing where the buyer is exactly zero.  Slack presumably doesn't have quite enough information about their clients' businesses to calibrate this exactly, but if they can approach it approximately, they'll make a lot of money; even though they drive some of their customers out of business, those losses are compensated for by the higher revenues from their surviving customers.

The chance of actually booking that 200K are next to 0.2) Microsoft learned a long time ago the value of getting young developers using your software to learn. Once those teens start working, maybe starting their own companies or choosing which tools to use at their future empoyers, if they know Slack they are very likely to pick Slack.

Once those teens start working, maybe starting their own companies or choosing which tools to use at their future empoyers, if they know Slack they are very likely to pick Slack.

This is so important these days. A lot of project send users to discord, slack for documentation and help but they are not made for this purpose. Searching in chat channel for a specific problem is not a good way to handle documentation. I can't even use search engines to search that.

I just wanted to highlight this. I am so happy seeing this written down explicitly and finally.Throughout the years I struggled so much finding relevant and accurate information about a feature of a product because it was scattered in chat channels, inadequate for providing reliable data (out of date or uncertain staleness, evolving or straight up wrong suggestions found, tangential only, patial, ...). Big names do it (Unity3D, DevExpress, ...). To make the matter worst both official support personel and power users promote its use, defend its use against critique to the last blood, despite of the obvious shortcomings and unreliability for average users. It is just the lazy excuse of providing the necessary knowledge.

So why don't all of these people simply write it down in a notion/document store and meticulously keep it all up to date?Because the business does not want that. We demand efficiency, so we understaff engineering departments sufficiently that there is always a little crunch, so that slightly-too-few engineers have to work slightly-harder-than-they-want to make the business successful. The end result of this intentionally engineered ""lack of time"" is that things like maintaining meticulous documentation are ignored, and the only time the knowledge is shared is in a frantic slack message.The business is designed to do this. It's not laziness. It's the standard operating procedure to increase efficiency and profit.

Notably, they do have some ""source-available"" code that goes into the enterprise release, at https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/tree/master/server/...This mainly seems to relate to metrics and fuzzy search, though it's possible more will move here in the future (it looks like this is a relatively recent development). Until recently they also had experimental support for Bleve full-text search (now seemingly deprecated), but the elasticsearch enterprise feature seems to be the replacement (otherwise they use postgres's ILIKE for built-in text search)So, all told, Mattermost was open source, and may be moving to open core. Which means now is probably the best time to create a community-maintained fork. The team edition, and almost all features, are currently still open source.

And if they were worried about abuse, or about cutting into their B2B bottom line, they could still do things like ""users who spend less than X minutes a month browsing/posting, and join only community-visible channels, are considered community tier"" so that employees who spend more than that (or even who want to have a single private DM) are still charged. And have a generous nonprofit/open-source/startup-accelerator program.But by forcing every company to treat every active user as a fully licensed user, they ceded the community space to Discord entirely, an unforced error that likely lost them an entire generation or more of customers.

In California, companies must provide clear written notice of any material change to renewal terms and obtain consent before billing under new terms.

Surprisingly not as much as I'd thought when they took it over. They just never adjusted pricing to remain competitive. The experience is still some of the best you can get for RoR apps.

I think even multiple buildpacks at once only came a couple years after acquisition.Possibly they were in the pipeline before acquisition, sure.But I'd agree, heroku is still a better DX than almost any competitors, although it's features and pricing have really stagnated.

But it hasn't really been 'ruined' in any way, it just started appearing frozen in amber some years ago.The new 'fir' platform is promissing, before that I didn't really know that any actual development was taking place in heroku, but it's a big move, modernizing things and setting the stage for more. Including slightly improved resource-to-pricing options. We'll see if it all works out...

Yes Digital Ocean did all this, they were very feature-close to Heroku. We have over time migrated everything stable/prod to AWS just because AWS has more products and hence you have everything in one place inside a VPC (e.g. vector db)For Replit, i'd use it for anything I can in early-stages. It helps to prototype ideas you are testing. You can iterate rapidly. For PROD we'd centralize onto AWS given the ecosystem.

reply

and last q :-) re AWS - once you moved there, did you use something like elasticbean or app runner? or did you roll your own CI/CD/logging/scaling...?

reply

We started with Lambdas because you can split work across people and keep dependencies to a minimum. Once your team gels and your product stabilizes, it is helpful to Dockerize it and go ECS, that is what we did. Some teams in the past used EKS but IMHO it required too much knowledge for the team to maintain, hence we've stuck with ECS.All CI/CD via Github --> ECS. This is a very standard pipeline and works well locally for development also. ECS does the scaling quite well, and provides a natural path to EKS when you need the scale bigtime.For logging, if I could choose I'd go Datadog but often you go with whatever the budget solution is.

Glue AI can be invoked at any time in any context and you can choose whether or not you want to share your conversation with other people after the fact. MCP is also well supported so you get good integration with lots of services like Linear or Notion.The agent isn't quite as proactive as updating documentation without being prompted right now, but it's regularly done by telling Glue AI to update pages in Notion with info from a thread.* https://glue.ai

But the enforced 10 day limit means you HAVE to properly document conversations and decisions outside of the chat platform.  It completely eliminates any reliance on the chat platform - we could switch to something new tomorrow and (except for some grumbling about have to relearn a new interface) nobody would really care.

I'm not defending Slack here, but allowing this to hit the wall and then raising a stink online does everyone a disservice.Edit: by ""you"", I mean ""the organisation of Skyfall"". It's already pretty clear from the number of people chiming in on behalf of the company that this problem has been handed out piecemeal.

There's a couple of interpretations here.1. The sales rep really thought they would be able to retain good pricing for them and it fell through, and at the last minute hackclub was blindsided by their inability to retain the pricing.2. The sales rep thought that hackclub was likely to jump ship if they had time to plan based on the new pricing, and lied to them about the possibility of retaining pricing.  And thought that by doing so they could force at least one year of higher cost.3. Hack Club is misrepresenting their communications with Slack to drum up public approval.My guess is that option 1 is the most likely, and the optimism of the sales rep ended up being a net negative, and human nature being what it is, Hack Club thought things would work out, and everyone is already busy so why borrow trouble.As for complaining online, sadly it seems that bad press is the only lever that most people have as a forcing factor for companies these days.  I honestly only had a Twitter account for a long time, just so I could complain about companies in public to get them to do the right thing, so unfortunately complaining online does actually help.

Unfortunately,this should be the sentiment with all SaaS projects.When a platform, like in this case, is inherent to the value proposition and can not easily be exchanged (building programs around it), one should consider self hosting.

I'm curious what they were actually getting for even the $5000/month and how many users there are? Going off the prices on Slack's homepage, for regular users to pay $200,000/year would mean they're working with ~900 users in a work group. I'm wondering if perhaps there's some automation that is kicking in when it shouldn't be?

Teams is good at what it does and serves its niche well, however unless your daily matters are not well aligned with the particular framework Teams is designed for expect significant friction. It's not really the team size that matters, but rather how you structure your daily work.A lot of the power of teams comes from integration with Active Directory, Sharepoint and Office. Sharing a presentation in a meeting that viewers can browse (e.g. to check back on something in a previous slide), calendar syncing with scheduling assistant, meetings scheduled in a team, meeting recordings and recaps, linking directly to a single page in OneNote, etc. are all quite powerful features, but most of the power is relevant if your organizational matters are structured more or less as a traditional enterprise and around AD/Office.Inviting third parties or contractors can be quite a pain, especially if chat history is relevant. Meetings having their own chat can create information searchability issues. Integrating with third party tools is less straightforward and consequentially ecosystem of integrations is a bit of wasteland.

Trying to speak dispassionately as someone who lives their life in Element X iOS, I find it is way more reliable than WhatsApp (where I get way more “waiting for message…” e2ee bugs than Element X these days), and more featureful than iMessage. You can't compare with TG given TG isn't E2EE.I am not disputing the lived experience on your side, but something big must be different. Is the server underpowered or misconfigured or something? Or is it using a beta server like Dendrite?

I compared it with those Messengers because that's what we as users are used to.
I know that TG is not E2EE and therefore not comparable on a technical level, but that's still what users of Element are used to.I personally use iMessage the most as my Messanger and in the last >10 years I never had any problems with a message not being able to be decrypted. And iMessage not being as featureful as Element is not an excuse for having more bugs especially in key areas of the service. Again, iMessage being just an emxample.

Calls are better in teams, much better to be precise than slack. We rarely used slack for calls (it had nice feature of drawing on colleague's  screen) which I think is also available in teams.I think that integration is crippled in teams but I didn't have time to experiment with it.So overall I'd suggest: go for teams if you want to call meetings and are not using slack as a main knowledge base, as we used to in my previous company. Especially considering matters highlighted in this article

It is NOT a good place to share docs.Each chat is its own SharePoint, so it is really simple to lose documentation through things getting siloed.The calls are fine though, and the chat is substandard. A bunch of teams use it for support channels, however there doesn't appear to be a way to join the group for support without being pinged by @channel_name. So you join for support and then you are alerted by everyone else who is looking for support.At least they have stopped fucking around with ""newest on top/bottom"", there was A/B testing last year (or maybe the year before) and you couldn't tell which way you had to scroll from one day to the next.

That's a feature not a bug.Chats are for quick collaboration on documents. You share it, you get immediate collaborative editing, you do what you have to do and then you eventually archive the document somewhere it makes sense to archive it which in MS Teams would be a Team.I really like the break down between Team which persists and chat for one off things but I know it really throws off some people.

I tried running a community on it and it was a collosal failure. The onboarding flow sucks, if you want to send email logins it implicitly requires them to make matrix.org or whatever accounts (or something along those lines, details escape me), and you can have a custom server for that but it wasn't well documented and there was no canonical FOSS project for that custom server, I guess you were expected to just write your own if you wanted to truly control your whole stack.And then, it was just high friction enough to where people wouldn't use it. Nobody downloaded the client apps other than me, even though the android one was really good, and even though you're spoiled for choice - you can even use it in Thunderbird! So everyone used the webapp, but then they'd switch computers and not do whatever you have to do to be able to read encrypted messages on the new machine, and so they'd lose all their messages and then stop participating.And so on.We moved the community to discord and all of our metrics have 10x'd: new users, existent user engagement, hell even revenue (we're an engineer-owned dev shop).I really, really wish we could have made matrix work.

Yes thank you that was what I was trying to remember. We really wanted to have the invite flow as part of the email we sent with other login details for other tooling, but we never got it working, not even with matrix's identity URL.We were hosting through etke.cc, some issues may have been due to the specific decisions they made, however they were quite capable it seemed to me.This was two years ago so the identity server was difficult to find, I think sydent may not have been as officially ""canonical"" back then or perhaps not quite so easy to set up? It could be on me but I recall it being a blocker I didn't have time to resolve after taking a crack at it.I'm happy to hear you're working on things for element x however we recommended our members not to use the element x app since it didn't have the full featureset of element such as threading, which was critical to our usage (threads for gigs for example). Perhaps it has threads now though!I support your project, I loved having the duplicators or whatever they're called mirroring slack messages and Instagram messages to matrix, that was part of our co-op's selling pitch for a while: ""get access to a working matrix deployment running duplicators for Instagram, slack, some other things, so you can use these apps for messaging without having them installed!"" I really wanted it to work but we had to choose the lame easy option with the lock in in the end. I am sure we will pay for it one day when discord enshittifies.

Considering the low interest in the identity server functionality and the amount of concerns around the concept, we took the latter bad decision - that way we don't offer a self-hosted identity server but don't limit customers in using the matrix.org's one (even with their own Matrix server). That seems like an acceptable trade off. After all, even Sydent's README contains the following:> Do I need to run Sydent to run my own homeserver?
>
> Short answer: no.
>
> Medium answer: probably not. Most homeservers and clients use the Sydent instance run by matrix.org, or use no identity server whatsoever.PS: I'm Aine, one of the etke.cc developers

To address the rest of the comments in the thread though... most pricing structures are to incentivize growth or to maximize profit.  In the days of Bill Macaitis Slack was a growth company, and they were trying to build as much good will as possible, because good will is good for growth (especially to reduce cost on marketing). Salesforce doesn't care about good will or growth at this point, because the market penetration phase is basically over. Retaining good will over maximizing profit at this stage won't help them with what they are trying to do, and they aren't that kind of company anyway. Its not like Patagonia bought slack or something.The lesson, if there is one, is that as a consumer to keep the companies honest we need more competition (and no I'm not talking about Microsoft teams). However this is exactly the opposite of what investors want. Think about that when you decide to buy a product from a well funded VC backed startup. Being cheap and moving fast aren't the end state.

A move this aggressive (e.g. pushing companies on Slack to pay 10x more, immediately, or get lost) is not isolated and probably the result of institutional forces. It's not like the random sales person in charge of this decided to be destructive. Salesforce the company is getting squeezed and this is one of the outgrowths of that pressure. And it speaks to the insane dysfunction that must be taking place in the bowels of Salesforce right now, I'm sure it's crazy.[1] https://qz.com/salesforce-beats-q2-earnings-ai

Slack is designed for small groups of people that all know and trust each other. That security model falls apart when you scale to large low-trust organizations.

We used Zulip at a company I was at (about a decade ago) and everyone on the engineering team refused to switch from it to Slack, even when it looked like Dropbox might end the product because it was so loved (it's completely independent now so that's not been a concern for a long time).

It's super simple to build with Stream and far lower costs than Slack. (i'm the CEO, founder so don't take my word for it). But we have quite a few customers building either communities into their app or large companies running integrated chat workflows. (think airline operations, construction collaboration etc.)

(Element Classic used a mix of legacy Matrix voip calling for 1:1 and Jitsi for group calling; Element X has switched to native MatrixRTC (Element Call) for E2EE for both 1:1 and group, but is technically still beta as we're still finishing the 1:1 UX. On Android, notifications are a known problem on Element X Android but if you give the app total permission to run in the background they should work.)

If everyone using your software has trouble using your software (or tracking the bugfixes supposedly resolved in the never ending rewrites, rebrands, etc), maybe you should stop pushing it until it's ready.Every experience I have had with using Matrix has been a bad one: with the old client app, with the new client app, with the web app, trying to run the server, etc.  It's clunky and slow when it does work.  It phones home to the Vector servers by default, despite being selfhosted.  It's a pain in the ass for end users to point it at a different hosted instance.Maybe the answer is just “the whole thing, client, server, protocol - it's all still in beta and you shouldn't expect it to work well”.  If that's the answer, I wish people
would stop recommending it until such time it works well.

Having your people doing part-time, non-core operations of an important service they are not experts in can be a huge distraction (and this is a hard thing for us tech people to admit!).But you need to go into SaaS thinking about how you'd get out: maybe that's data export, maybe it's solid contracts. If they don't offer this or you can't afford it... well, don't use it. Or take the risk and just pray your house doesn't burn down.

Part of being in business is anticipating risks and having a plan -- which could be deciding to accept the risk.

It's certainly true that some providers are worse than others, but I don't think any of them are ""safe"" in the long term.  Self-hosting is one solution, but even apart from that, a competitive market of multiple providers makes rugpulls like this less likely, because in such an environment even people who are not directly screwed may decide to jump ship to avoid being screwed later.

reply

It was things like ""internally hosted wikis were too hard to use for non-technical staff"", ""even though they work, the internal apps are old"", ""we want something that is standard"", ""we can't fall behind the other firms"". The point about cloud provider apps all being familiar is valid but none of this stuff was that hard. It felt like the reason we switched (apart from persistent rumors about deals between sales teams) was because executives decided our internal apps lacked a cool factor. So good luck convincing non-technical executives that the cloud apps they are accustomed to seeing shouldn't be used.

Enterprise software—software bought by people who don't have to use it—is as a rule abysmal.  My model of how this happens is that there are large barriers to entry, and actually working well is not one of them, because the guy signing the PO doesn't have visibility into whether they work well or not.  I don't know what the barriers are, but I suspect they include hiring people who already know CTOs, bribing ignorant shills like the Gartner Group, and having a convincing appear you'll still be in business in 10 years.

>However, two days ago, Slack reached out to us and said that if we don't agree to pay an extra $50k this week and $200k a year, they'll deactivate our Slack workspace and delete all of our message history.>One could argue that Slack is free to stop providing us the nonprofit offer at any time, but in my opinion, a six month grace period is the bare minimum for a massive hike like this, if not more.This summary from your website misses a lot of relevant detail. I love to rag on big corp as much as the next free thinker, but the dishonesty makes me much less sympathetic to this particular story.

The transition away from Slack's nonprofit pricing is also a key element to this story, but that is glossed over.

Think of it, this example alone is a $250k risk and it seems from this point forward that $250k risk is significantly high and the impact is major, considering there's a short decision fuse on the extortion.Would you be ready to retain data; set up, deploy, transition, restore, and scale alternatives to Slack within a week or your institution be forced to pay such blackmail/extortion?

Their ""threads"" feature was also great: it was just like replies in Discord (all go into the channel) but you could open up the thread to get it isolated. Worked way better than slack replies which just devolve instantly into you losing all track and messages can't be found again.

They were currently being paid some amount, and got their product in front of the next generation of Software Engineers. People who hopefully will like the product, and grow up to evangelize it in their workplace.Instead now, they'll get paid $0 (because obviously the non-profit can't afford the new price) and they won't get their product in front of those students.See similar example of Microsoft losing mindshare with the next generation in the early/mid 2000's by locking down paid access to all their developer tooling/documentation.

For many businesses, this is a feature, not a bug.Internal communications are discoverable in litigation. If you have records, you can be compelled to turn them over.I used to work in healthcare. Internal messages had a maximum retention of 30 days. That wasn't driven by IT or the users. That was a decision made by legal. In that space, you are always being sued by somebody. The lawyers want to minimize exposure and that's a fight they're basically always going to win.To be clear: it's better if that's a decision made by the business. But it's also one of those cases where what the decision makers care about isn't necessarily aligned with what the users care about, so there's ultimately not a lot of incentive for Slack to care.

It did? I used IRC pretty frequently back in the day, and the only logging I ever saw was through your own client. This was in the days of dialup, so you'd miss any conversations from when you weren't logged in. If you were fancy, you'd have a bouncer set up on an always-on remote server to log messages when you were away. But I never saw any centralized logging à la Slack/Teams/Mattermost. It's certainly not something supported by any IRCd I'm aware of. Maybe a few channels had custom bots that logged everything to a centrally searchable location, but I never saw such a thing.Indeed, some here even tout the ""ephemeral nature of IRC as a feature, not a bug.""

In some cases, as Slack says, there may be a legal mandate to log employee conversations, but in other situations there may be legal restrictions on reading employee-to-employee conversations. That all probably varies by jurisdiction.And then you have more complicated situations, like companies that use Slack to offer tech support to their customers, or random open-source projects or local volunteer projects using Slack. They might pay for a business license for various features, but it's probably not clear to every member that that would mean whoever set up the Slack account should get to read everyone else's correspondence.You also want some kind of safety check to make sure that a random IT guy who set up the Slack system at a small company isn't reading through people's DMs and private channels to stalk people or access confidential information.

And since we actually pay for Google Workspaces, we could switch to their chat solution. I haven't actually bothered even trying that so far. Because they'll probably cancel it in a few years. And there are a gazillion alternatives. I've used everything from news groups, irc, icq, hip chat, discord, etc. in the past quarter century or so. And that's just for work related communication. The main reason for me to use Slack is that it's there and cheap and it kind of works. I have no big pressing need to switch. Or to pay anyone for this stuff.Slack was the cute sexy new thing about ten years ago. Then they got acquired by Salesforce and now it's just yet another corporate thing; so enshittification is a given. But they might want to remember that the only reason they got this big is through their generous freemium offering. Cut that off and the rest just bleeds out as well. Along with all the revenue. They wouldn't be the first chat solution that joins the ranks of the once big and long forgotten.

People naturally love coding, especially teens. It's addictive. And it no longer leads to any career prospects, or chances to contribute to society, or money, or anything really. It's over as a mass occupation. Addicting teens to it does them a bad service. In the future, personality traits that will lead to happiness and success will be opposite to those nurtured by coding, or are typical among professional coders: empathy, likability, social skills... Kids who got hooked on coding now, are heading for a life of misery.

I thought maybe integrations, but those tend to be webhooks that display an alert. Of course you don't want to have to change them, but it's limited how much pain it causes to switch to some other chat service.If I look at the chats I'm in at the moment, moving off would be annoying, but if I got a massive bill I would certainly do it.

I really don't want to try to promote Slack as 'one tool to rule them all' or advocate for its features, but it definitely more bandwidth than email. Not sure have you received any of the long quoted emails recently, I have, and it can be a nightmare (and ridiculous that an email client from a USD 3 trillion dollar company cannot render it properly).Given that Slack has integrations with various tools (incident reporting, various bots, feed submissions, apps of all sorts), video/voice chats, file storage, rich messages, advanced notifications, and, most importantly, seamless communications with clients using it, it is just a tool that has replaced so many different tools.Sure, it is not perfect, and many other tools offer same things as Slack, this pricing situation is ridiculous, but there is a reason why nearly every single startup or a team formed in the last decade uses it or its equivalent.It is not indented to cover all possible usages out there, and in academia I could see email working better than Slack, but as we are on the topic of Hack Club, it would be hard to argue it would exist in this form without Slack-like tools.

why has this post been taken off the front page, and why has the title been editorialized?

reply

The title edit is standard practice though - the word ""extorted"" is too baity for HN's frontpage (see https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html: ""Please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait.""). Making titles somewhat more factual/neutral is normal HN moderation. That's not a criticism of the OP, mind you! - we'd feel the same way too in their position.

reply

reply

Indeed, the HN guidelines:> please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait; don't editorialize

> please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait; don't editorialize

reply

In this case, that wasn't at issue. The operative clause is ""unless it is misleading or linkbait"". A word like ""extorted"" is too baity for HN's frontpage. This is nothing personal against the OP! It's actually better for them and for Hack Club if the HN title is relatively neutral while still conveying the critical information.

The thing that changed is that we aren't dealing with Slack anymore, all of a sudden we're dealing with Salesforce. I can only assume they are shaking the money tree at all levels of the organization since their recent disappointing earnings report (I guess they've had a lot of those lately).I appreciate the nuanced perspective you're bringing here but it really is as scummy as it's written in the post. They are asking us to pay $50k in the next 5 days, just for the privilege of not having our 11 years of history deleted. They don't owe us continued access to their platform on the cheap, but to demand this much money on that kind of time frame? I don't know what to call that other than extortion.

The intention wasn't to ""kill"" the story, but to try and get more details so it would address the questions that came up for me and that I assumed would come up for other readers (which indeed they have [1]). My words ""must be more to the story"" weren't intended to suggest Salesforce are likely to be in the right, but just that it would be helpful to know. I.e., does this affect all nonprofits/educational organizations? Is this change just targeted at this org? If so why? But I didn't know it was written by a student/teenager, who may not be on top of those details. And given it's late at night and there's such a short timeline for cutoff, we're happy to let the story stay on the front page now.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45284260

Strix became less hidden for me personally after listening to The Life Scientific interview with John Taylor [1]. There is plenty of fascinating information, probably because Jim Al-Khalili is a great scientific interviewer. Recently, I recalled it in the context of AI, self-driving, and safety. Strix controllers have a second level of protection if the main automatic shut-off circuit fails. That's probably why we never hear of fires or other incidents due to a failed Strix controller.[1] https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b42z87

In some sense, what seems important is a business culture that has a mission or meaning to exist other than make shareholders money. I'd wager their employees will absolutely geek out about what the companies do throughout the organization. A lot of corporations these days, once you get above a couple of layers of management, is all fluff. I can't think of the last time I talked to a mid-level or above ""engineering"" manager in a tech company about any nuanced or interesting discussion about technology.

Technology allowed companies to expand and centralize on a national scale, and capital pushed that to the conclusion we're at now, where there are a few gigantic players (at most) and almost all recourse against bad faith has been precluded. Nowadays if a customer is taken advantage of, they can't drive 5 extra minutes in the opposite direction and take their business elsewhere, or shame the owner in the local paper. Only impenetrable monoliths remain.

And Kübler-Ross did not describe a linear progression of grief. It was meant to be enough of a framework to start conversations, to put experiences in perspective, to help reflect. And plenty of times, life still has to go on even with devastation -- no time to grieve and reflect until crises has passed.The wording of the co-founder's comment and the post did not strike me as grief.

I'm not too familiar with Slack pricing but it suggests in the Fair Billing policy[0] that they bill per active member. Without any discounts, the Pro pricing is $7.25 per active user per month, if paid annually.[1] If they are needing to pay $200,000 annually, then I think that means they have over 2,000 active members in their Slack which does not sound like a ""small nonprofit"" to me.[0]: https://slack.com/help/articles/218915077-Slacks-Fair-Billin...[1]: https://slack.com/pricing/pro

This pricing model makes no sense for a non-profit that is trying to teach coding to teenagers worldwide. They will have a lot of users (remember) who might only send one or two messages once in a while. having to pay $7.25, for some who just asked a single question, is essentially extortion for a non profit like that who's primary purpose involves reaching out to as many people a possible.> then I think that means they have over 2,000 active members in their Slack which does not sound like a ""small nonprofit"" to me.those are not employees, but most likely the people they are trying to help.

I don't know anything about slack, but a lot of the saas programs I've supported do something similar where they negotiate a price per 'user' but then during the setup try to get you to start including a bunch of users or change how users are defined to include extra people that are only tangentially related to the day to day operations. One I support, I found out I get charged extra for users of one of the modules beyond the seat charge to already have them in the program.

Maybe that doesn't move the needle on whether they're a small non-profit or not for you, but it's different than a massive non-profit like, say, the Prevent Cancer Foundation, which also receives millions of dollars per year to facilitate their mission.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Clean hydrogen is facing a big reality check","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/18/1123818/hydrogen-reality-check-china/","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Forecasts aren't looking quite as rosy for the green fuel, though China is still a bright spot.

Hydrogen is sometimes held up as a master key for the energy transition. It can be made using several low-emissions methods and could play a role in cleaning up industries ranging from agriculture and chemicals to aviation and long-distance shipping.

Can the vast and sparsely populated African country translate its renewable power potential into national development?

This moment is a complicated one for the green fuel, though, as a new report from the International Energy Agency lays out. A number of major projects face cancellations and delays, especially in the US and Europe. The US in particular is seeing a slowdown after changes to key tax credits and cuts in support for renewable energy. Still, there are bright spots for the industry, including in China, and new markets could soon become crucial for growth.

Here are three things to know about the state of hydrogen in 2025.

1. Expectations for annual clean hydrogen production by 2030 are shrinking, for the first time.

While hydrogen has the potential to serve as a clean fuel, today most is made with processes that use fossil fuels. As of 2025, about a million metric tons of low-emissions hydrogen are produced annually. That's less than 1% of total hydrogen production.

In last year's Global Hydrogen Report, the IEA projected that global production of low-emissions hydrogen would grow to as high as 49 million metric tons annually by 2030. That prediction has been steadily climbing since 2021, as more places around the world sink money into developing and scaling up the technology.

In the 2025 edition, though, the IEA's production prediction had shrunk to 37 million metric tons annually by 2030.

That's still a major expansion from today's numbers, but it's the first time the agency has cut its predictions for the end of the decade. The report cited the cancellations of both electrolysis projects (those that use electricity to generate hydrogen) and carbon capture projects as reasons for the pullback. The cancelled and delayed projects included sites across Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Australia. 

2. China is dominating production today and could produce competitively cheap green hydrogen by the end of the decade.

Speaking of electrolysis projects, China is the driving force in manufacturing and development of electrolyzers, the devices that use electricity to generate green hydrogen, according to the new IEA report. As of July 2025, the country accounted for 65% of the installed or almost installed electrolyzer capacity in the world. It also manufactures nearly 60% of the world's electrolyzers.

Hydrogen can be used in chemicals and as a green fuel. Vast underground stores could help make it an economical option.

A major barrier for clean hydrogen today is that dirty methods based on fossil fuels are just so much cheaper than cleaner ones.

But China is well on its way to narrowing that gap. Today, it's roughly three times more expensive to make and install an electrolyzer anywhere else in the world than in China. The country could produce green hydrogen that's cost-competitive with fossil hydrogen by the end of the decade, according to the IEA report. That could make the fuel an obvious choice for both new and existing uses of hydrogen.

3. Southeast Asia could be a major emerging market for low-emissions hydrogen.

One region that could become a major player in the green hydrogen market is Southeast Asia. The economy is growing fast, and so is energy demand.

There's an existing market for hydrogen in Southeast Asia already. Today, the region uses about 4 million metric tons of hydrogen annually, largely in the oil refining industry and the chemical business, where it is used to make ammonia and methanol.

International shipping is also concentrated in the region—the port of Singapore supplied about one-sixth of all the fuel used in global shipping in 2024, more than any other single location. Today, that total consists almost exclusively of fossil fuels. But there's been work to test cleaner fuels, including methanol and ammonia, and interest in shifting to hydrogen in the longer term.

Clean hydrogen could slot into these existing industries and help cut emissions. There are 25 projects under development right now in the region, though additional support for renewables will be crucial to getting significant capacity up and running.

Overall, hydrogen is getting a reality check, revealing problems cutting through the hype we've seen in recent years. The next five years will tell whether the fuel can live up to the still-lofty hopes.

For the first time, scientists have uncovered a large amber deposit in South America containing fossilized insects and other preserved creatures. The small, half-transparent fossils hold a rich assortment of ancient bugs—and a slice of life from little-known ecosystems from over 100 million years ago.

A Communications & Earth Environment study published today details amber samples from Ecuador's Genoveva quarry—the first discovery in South America to yield fossilized insects and other life forms. The team, led by paleobiologist Xavier Delclòs from the University of Barcelona in Spain, employed a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the fossils in fine detail. Their efforts unveiled the prior existence of a vibrant, tropical rainforest as the Earth underwent major environmental shifts.

“It is the largest Cretaceous amber deposit ever found in the Southern Hemisphere—and in terms of volume, it even surpasses the richest deposits of the North,” Delclòs told Gizmodo.

Indeed, the sheer volume of the deposits gave the team a rare opportunity to study and identify about 21 bio-inclusions, or living things that get stuck in amber. The discovery “opens a new window into the forests of South America at the time of the dinosaurs, preserving creatures so small and delicate that they almost never fossilize,” Delclòs said.

Amber is fossilized resin, also known as tree sap. Resin remains sticky for a couple of days to several months, trapping the occasional insect or organism that stumbles across its path. Eventually, exposure to the air hardens the resin, fastening the molecular bonds within and turning it to hard amber—along with whatever poor creature was stuck inside.

Paleontological records indicate that trees have produced resin for over 320 million years, but it's only been within the last 120 million years that amber has “formed in large enough quantities” to create sizable fossil deposits, Delclòs explained. While amber can preserve smaller animals less likely to fossilize, the long process quickly decomposes bodily parts weaker than the exoskeleton of arthropods.

Of course, nature sometimes works miracles, and some amber deposits keep muscles, organs, and even brains intact. The new discovery, for instance, found fragile, thin strands of spider silk. The team also discovered some of the oldest flowering plants ever found in western South America. That said, DNA molecules are the fastest to go, so “the Jurassic Park dream remains science fiction,” Delclòs added.

“And this is just the beginning,” he said. “In a very small sample, we already identified six different insect orders. The site promises to be a treasure trove.”

To make every observation count, the team relied on a highly multidisciplinary approach involving methods from geochemistry and paleobotany. Studying the amber from these angles helped them pinpoint the exact age of the fossils, as well as the plants that may have produced the resin. They even borrowed a synchrotron—that is, a particle accelerator—to light the samples and “reveal the fine anatomical details of insects,” Delclòs explained.

“Together, these lines of evidence allow us to reconstruct, with unprecedented accuracy, the ecosystem of a Cretaceous rainforest that once thrived where today lies the Amazon,” he said.

The researchers believe there are more undiscovered amber deposits in South America. The next step is to explore further—which Delclòs is already doing. (No, seriously—he responded to Gizmodo's interview request while out in the field.)

By identifying and studying the amber, we'll soon have a better idea of “how this ecosystem started and evolved at the very heart of the equator—something we have never been able to do before in South America,” Delclòs said.

There's one thing people want to know when they see my first-gen Ray-Ban smart glasses, and it's got nothing to do with AI, or cameras, or the surprisingly great open-ear audio they put out. They want to know what's probably front-of-mind right now as you're reading this: Do they have a screen in them? The answer? Sadly, no… until now.

At Meta Connect 2025, Meta finally unveiled its Ray-Ban Display smart glasses that, as you may have gathered from the name, have a screen in them. It doesn't sound like much on the surface—we have screens everywhere, all the time. Too many of them, in fact. But I'm here to tell you that after using them in advance of the unveil, I regret to inform you that you will most likely want another screen in your life, whether you know it or not. But first, you probably want to know exactly what's going on in this screen I speak of.

See Meta Ray-Ban at Amazon

See Meta Ray-Ban at Best Buy

The answer? Apps, of course. The display, which is actually full-color and not monochrome like previous reporting suggested, acts as a heads-up display (HUD) for things like notifications, navigation, and even pictures and videos. For the full specs of that display, you can read the news companion to my hands-on here. For now, though, I want to focus on what that screen feels like. The answer? A little jarring at first.

While the Ray-Ban Display, which weigh 69g (about 10 more grams than the first-gen glasses without a screen) do their best not to shove a screen in front of your face, it's still genuinely there, hovering like a real-life Clippy, waiting to distract you with a notification at a moment's notice. And, no matter what your feelings are about smart glasses that have a screen, that's a good thing, since the display is the whole reason you might spend $800 to own a pair. Once your eyes adjust to the screen (it took me a minute or so), you can get cracking on doing stuff. That's where the Meta Neural Band comes in.

The Neural Band is Meta's sEMG wristband, a piece of tech it's been showing off for years now that's been shrunk down into the size of a Whoop fitness band. It reads the electrical signals in your hand to register pinches, swipes, taps, and wrist turns as inputs in the glasses. I was worried at first that its wristband might feel clunky or too conspicuous on my body, but I can inform you that it's not the case—this is about as lightweight as it gets. The smart glasses also felt light and comfortable on my face despite being noticeably thicker than the first-gen Ray-Bans.

More importantly than being lightweight and subtle, it's very responsive. Once the Neural Band was tight on my wrist (it was a little loose at first, but better after I adjusted), using it to navigate the UI was fairly intuitive. An index finger and thumb pinch is the equivalent of “select,” a middle-finger and thumb pinch is “back,” and for scrolling, you make a fist and then use your thumb like it's a mouse made of flesh and bone over the top of said fist. It's a bit of Vision Pro and a bit of Quest 3, but with no hand-tracking needed. I won't lie to you, it feels like a bit of magic when it works fluidly.

Personally, I still had some variability on inputs—you may have to try to input something once or twice before it registers—but I would say that it works well most of the time (at least much better than you'd expect for a literal first-of-its-kind device). I suspect the experience will only get more fluid over time, though, and even better once you really train yourself to navigate the UI properly. Not to mention the applications for the future! Meta is already planning to launch a handwriting feature, though it's not available at launch. I got a firsthand look… kind of. I wasn't able to use handwriting myself, but I watched a Meta rep use it, and it seemed to work, though I have no way of knowing how well until I use it for myself.

But enough about controls; let's get to what you're actually doing with them. I got to briefly experience pretty much everything that the Meta Ray-Ban Display have to offer, and that includes the gamut of phone-adjacent features. One of my favorites is taking pictures in a POV mode, which imposes a window on the glasses display that shows you what you're taking a picture of right in the lens—finally, no guess and check when you're snapping pics. Another “wow” moment here is the ability to pinch your fingers and tweak your wrist (like you're turning a dial) to zoom in. It's a subtle thing, but you feel like a wizard when you can control a camera by just waving your hands around.

Another standout feature is navigation, which imposes a map on the glasses display to show you where you're going. Obviously, I was limited in testing how that feature works since I couldn't wander off with the glasses in my demo, but the map was quite sharp and bright enough to be used outdoors (I did test this stuff in sunlight, and the 5,000 nits brightness was sufficient). Meta is leaving it up to you whether you use navigation while you're in a vehicle or on a bike, but it will warn you of the dangers of looking at a screen if it detects that you're moving quickly. It's hard to say how distracting a HUD would be if you're biking, and it's something that I plan to eventually test in full.

Another interesting feature you might actually use is video calling, which pulls up a video of the person you're calling in the bottom-right corner. The interesting part about this feature is that it's POV for the person you're calling, so they can see what you're looking at. It's not something that I'd do in any situation, since usually the person you're calling wants to see you and not just what you're looking at, but I can confirm that it works at least.

Speaking of just working, there's also a live transcription feature that can listen in on your environment and superimpose what the other person is saying onto the display of the smart glasses. I had two thoughts when using this feature: the first one is that it could be a game-changer for accessibility. If your hearing is impaired, being able to actually see a live transcript could be hugely helpful. Secondly, such a feature could be great for translation, which is something that Meta has already thought of in this case. I didn't get a chance to use the smart glasses for translating another language, but the potential is there.

One problem I foresee here, though, is that the smart glasses may pick up other conversations happening nearby. Meta thought of this too and said that the microphones in the Ray-Ban Display actually beamform to focus just on who you're looking at, and I did get a chance to test that out. While one Meta rep spoke to me in the room, others had their own conversations at a fairly normal volume. The results? Kind of mixed. While the transcription focused mostly on the person I was looking at, it still picked up stray words here and there. This feels like a bit of an inevitability in loud scenarios, but who knows? Maybe beamforming and AI can fill in the gaps.

If you're looking for a killer feature of Meta's Ray-Ban Display smart glasses, I'm not sure there necessarily is one, but one thing I do know is that the coupling of the glasses with its Neural Band should be nothing short of a game-changer. Navigating the UI in smart glasses has been a constant issue in the space, and until now, I haven't seen what I thought was a killer solution, but based on my early demos, I'd say that Meta's “brain-reading” wristband could be the breakthrough we were waiting for—at least until hand or eye tracking at this scale becomes possible.

I'll know more about how everything works when I get a chance to use Meta Ray-Ban Display on my own, but for now I'd say Meta is still clearly the frontrunner in the smart glasses race, and its head start just got pretty massive.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Microsoft's AI Copilot Invades Congress","https://gizmodo.com/microsofts-ai-copilot-invades-congress-2000660385","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 13:10:43 GMT","

AI has swiftly taken over much of the economy, and now, it appears to be invading our nation's hallowed halls of power. Axios reports that Microsoft's AI chatbot, Copilot, will be made available to staff in the House of Representatives, where lawmakers will use it to…well, that part isn't exactly clear yet.

The House will soon begin using M365 Copilot as part of a broader effort to integrate AI “into its daily operations,” Axios says. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is expected to announce the rollout of the chatbots for staff at an upcoming Congressional Hackathon, the outlet notes.

The deal appears to be part of a new trend where AI companies offer their services to the government for just a dollar. In an email obtained by Axios, House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine Szpindor explained that the government was mulling multiple offers like this and that it was “actively engaging in discussions to determine whether these short-term offers are viable for the House and how we can test these platforms' enterprise levels over the next year.”

Axios claims that the chatbots used by Congress will have “heightened legal and data protections,” although it's not entirely clear what that means. Gizmodo reached out to Microsoft and to the House for more information.

For whatever reason, it really seems like Congress shouldn't be using an experimental new technology that it is in the process of trying to figure out how to regulate. AI has occasionally proven itself to have bizarre and, in some cases, potentially dangerous psychological side effects on its users. Let's face it, this Congress does not need anything to make it more mentally unbalanced. It also has the potential to be a huge data privacy hazard, and, in many cases, has led to litigious battles over copyright issues (just this month, Anthropic agreed to pay a $1.5 billion settlement for downloading pirated books to train its LLM).

Most importantly, AI has a habit of being wrong about all kinds of stuff. As such, it really doesn't feel like a tool that Congress should be relying on to get its information. Congress, a largely geriatric class of managerial bumpkin, already seems fairly clueless when it comes to the laws they are passing and what they are about. We don't really need AI to join in with the corporations and their NGO allies to help write the laws in this country.

Usually, there are sports movies and there are horror movies, and the two don't really cross over. In Friday the 13th, Jason Voorhees wears a hockey mask, but he doesn't take a slap shot. A killer might swing a baseball bat, but they aren't stepping up to the plate. Him, the new film from Justin Tipping, is one of the first, and maybe biggest, films to ever blend horror and sports, which, just for that, is worth being excited about. The film uses the violence of football, as well as the hero worship, drug use, aggression, obsessions, and cold, hard cash at its core, to tell a multifaceted tale with lots of intensity and unease. Whether or not all of those ideas come together in a satisfying way is another story.

Him stars Tyriq Withers as Cameron Cade, a star college quarterback with an eye on being drafted into the pros. His favorite team is the Saviors, whose quarterback, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), has won eight championships. He's the greatest of all time. The GOAT. And when Cameron is mysteriously and violently attacked, Isaiah invites him to his compound to train and ready himself for the draft.

Some of Him‘s problems start right there. While Tipping does a very good job of bringing his audience into this world and introducing all its characters, the inciting incident is so out of left field and largely forgotten about for the majority of the film that there's an initial sense that not all of this was as thought-out as it could've been. It's a feeling that permeates the entire film.

Thankfully, another feeling that permeates the entire film is dread. As Cameron arrives at Isaiah's home, everything instantly feels wrong. Isaiah's got worshipers camped outside the gates. He has yes-men who'll do whatever he says. There are monuments to his greatness everywhere, all of which clash against his seemingly down-to-earth personality. He also, creepily, employs a doctor to give him blood when he's not feeling great and his training methods are more than a little intense. But Cameron, like the audience, goes with it.

Wayans is a revelation as Isaiah. He's got all the confident swagger you'd expect from the pro sports legend, and just the right amount of evil boiling below the surface. As he and Cameron train and bond, we're on the edge of our seats, begging to learn more about what the hell is going on here, especially as things get darker and weirder.

Unfortunately, every time things get darker and weirder, Him finds a way to dial things way back. Cameron wakes up, works out, and parties, and yes, all of that is peppered with weird, potentially culty stuff, but it never feels like it's the point. More than anything, most of the tension in the film comes from the film's exploration of sports in general.

Big chunks of Him are dedicated to Isaiah talking about everything he had to give up to become the best of all time. Cameron has to struggle with whether he's ready to do the same. We spend time with some of Isaiah's obsessive fans and their agent (played with perfectly muted comedic relief by Tim Heidecker) and listen as they wax poetic about the glory of victory and the agony of defeat. As much as we think Him is going to be exclusively about weird, culty horror stuff, it's surprisingly, and almost disappointingly, tangential. More than anything, the film is about the horrors that fame and fortune can bring and what it takes to achieve them.

Thankfully, all of that leads to a wild third act where everything comes together in a fantastic, gory, and wholly satisfying way. You just wish that pace and excitement were more evenly seeded throughout the film. As it plays here, it all happens so fast and without warning that you can't help but feel like there's more to the story. But, once the credits roll, Him leaves you with a lot to talk about, both in terms of the narrative and the themes. You just can't help but feel like it's all a bit too much and way out of balance.

In the end, Withers gives a star-making performance as Cameron, more than holding his own against the equally excellent Wayans. As a result, Him is more interesting than not. It's just not quite as entertaining and engaging as it aims to be.

Him opens Friday, September 19.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses Now Have a Screen and a Magic Wristband","https://gizmodo.com/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-now-have-a-screen-and-a-magic-wristband-2000659760","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 13:54:20 GMT","

Meta's Ray-Bans are back with a new generation, and this time they're finally giving people the one thing they really want—a screen. At Meta's annual Connect developer conference, the company officially took the wraps off its Meta Ray-Ban Display, which are, as the name suggests, its first pair of AI-infused smart glasses to come with a full-color in-lens display.

The smart glasses, which still bear the same Ray-Ban branding, will cost $799 and are available for preorder today. As you might expect, they can do quite a few things that their predecessor can't, including message notifications, turn-by-turn navigation, and telling you when queries to Meta AI are processing. There are several app integrations, including WhatsApp and Instagram, allowing you to watch reels and make video calls natively in the glasses. One major upgrade on the message notifications front is that the Meta Ray-Ban Display will not be limited to only WhatsApp, meaning it will be able to show notifications on both iOS and Android devices.

See Meta Ray-Ban at Amazon

See Meta Ray-Ban at Best Buy

That's not the only major shift in this generation. Meta says its first-ever display has a 600 x 600 resolution and 20-degree field of view. The display is monocular, which means it's only in one lens—at the bottom right-ish corner—and has a refresh rate of 90Hz. Brightness goes up to 5,000 nits and as low as 30 nits, which makes them usable outdoors in full light. One of the coolest parts of the display is that Meta claims that there's less than 2% light leakage, which means that you can't see when someone has their display activated.

Speaking of light leakage, all of Meta's Ray-Ban Display smart glasses will come with transition lenses. On one hand, that feels like a weird choice, but it also makes sense since this is a gadget you're going to want to use indoors as well as out, and for $800, you should be able to use them for as long as you like without having to take them off. “As long as you like,” in this case, will be no more than 6 hours, according to Meta, which is a lot longer than I was expecting. That solid battery life is thanks in part to what Meta is calling “ultra-narrow steelcan batteries.” I wish I knew exactly what that meant, but for now, I can only look forward to getting more of a deep dive in the future.

Glasses are only half the appeal of Meta's Ray-Ban Display, though. The other half is its sEMG wristband that you use to control the UI in the glasses.

The Meta Neural Band, as Meta is calling it, is arguably the most innovative part of its new Ray-Ban package, since no other product like it exists on a commercial scale. Outside of being a first, it also offers a potential solution to a problem that no other maker of smart glasses has quite solved—that problem being, how the hell do you actually use smart glasses? While most smart glasses (Meta's first-gen Ray-Bans included) have a voice assistant for shouting commands like “take a picture” and a fairly simple touch-sensitive bar for physical inputs (i.e., pause/play), neither is ideal in every situation.

The fact is, adding a screen complicates smart glasses—the more you can do, the more you'll need to convey to your glasses, and in order to do that, you need an input system as nuanced as the eyewear itself. Not only that, but if you want to use your smart glasses discreetly (or in a normal fashion at all, really), shouting into a crowded subway car is less than ideal. With the Neural Band, however, you can navigate the UI discreetly by pinching, swiping, and tapping through various menus in the smart glasses. My favorite gesture is a pinch to zoom for taking photos and videos. It's Vision Pro-esque, but all done without cameras. In case you're wondering, yes, the neural band is included in that $800 cost.

I got a chance to use Meta's Ray-Bans and its new Neural Band, and you can read my full impressions here.

Like previous iterations of Meta's Ray-Ban glasses, this year's edition will also come equipped with cameras and speakers. Camera-wise, Meta is going with a 12-megapixel ultra-wide sensor that can also capture 1080p at 30fps in a 1,440 x 1,920 resolution. There's also a 3x digital zoom.

The camera is used for the computer vision in the glasses, aka Meta AI, as well. Despite being a fan of Meta's Ray-Bans (they're the only device I ever want to take calls with), Meta AI has been a weak spot for me. While the voice assistant works well most of the time for basic stuff like taking pictures/videos, playing Spotify, and asking what your battery life is, the heavier AI lifting is hit-or-miss at best. Whether Meta's new smart glasses fix that remains to be seen since I haven't had a chance to use them, but I'm hoping for an upgrade here.

But even if AI is still finicky and the cameras and audio are about the same, these smart glasses still have a freaking screen. That's a big step forward, even if functionality is limited for now. When people ask me about my first-gen Ray-Bans, the first thing they want to know is whether they have a display in them, and they're inevitably very disappointed when I have to let them down. Now, I'll actually have something to show them, and if Meta's wristband works, I'll even have something to show them that only Meta can provide.

In a surprise announcement that finds two long-time rivals working together, Nvidia and Intel announced today that the companies will jointly develop multiple new generations of x86 products together — a seismic shift with profound implications for the entire world of technology. Before the news broke, Tom's Hardware spoke with Nvidia representatives to learn more details about the company's plans.

The products include x86 Intel CPUs tightly fused with an Nvidia RTX graphics chiplet for the consumer gaming PC market, named the ‘Intel x86 RTX SOCs.' Nvidia will also have Intel build custom x86 data center CPUs for its AI products for hyperscale and enterprise customers. Additionally, Nvidia will buy $5 billion in Intel common stock at $23.28 per share, representing a roughly 5% ownership stake in Intel. (Intel stock is now up 33% in premarket trading.)

The partnership between the two companies is in the very early stages, Nvidia told us, so the timeline for product releases along with any product specifications will be disclosed at a later, unspecified date. (Given the traditionally long lead-times for new processors, it is rational to expect these products will take at least a year, and likely longer, to come to market.)

Nvidia emphasized that the companies are committed to multi-generation roadmaps for the co-developed products, which represents a strong investment in the x86 ecosystem. But representatives tells us it also remains fully committed to other announced product roadmaps and architectures, including the company's Arm-based GB10 Grace Blackwell processors for workstations and the Nvidia Grace CPUs for data centers, as well as the next-gen Vera CPUs. Nvidia says it also remains committed to products on its internal roadmaps that haven't been publicly disclosed yet, indicating that the new roadmap with Intel will merely be additive to existing initiatives.

The chip giant hasn't disclosed whether it will use Intel Foundry to produce any of these products yet. However, while Intel has used TSMC to manufacture some recent products, its goal is to bring production of most high-performance products back into its own foundries.

Some products never left. For instance, Intel's existing Granite Rapids data center processors use the ‘Intel 3' node, and the upcoming Clearwater Forest Xeons will use Intel's own 18A process node for compute. This suggests that at least some of the Nvidia-custom x86 silicon, particularly for the data center, could be fabbed on Intel nodes. Intel also uses TSMC to fabricate many of its client x86 processors, however, so we won't know for sure until official announcements are made — particularly for the RTX GPU chiplet.

In either case, Nvidia has been mulling using Intel Foundry since 2022, has fabbed test chips there, and participates in the U.S. Defense Dept.'s RAMP-C project with Intel. The DoD project involves Nvidia already making chips on Intel's 18A process node, so it wouldn't be a total surprise.

While the two companies have engaged in heated competition in some market segments, Intel and Nvidia have partnered for decades, ensuring interoperability between their hardware and software for products spanning both the client and data center markets. And the PCIe interface has long been used to connect Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs. The new partnership will find tighter integration using the NVLink interface for CPU-to-GPU communication, which affords up to 14 times more bandwidth along with lower latency than PCIe, thus granting the new x86 products access to the highest performance possible when paired with GPUs. Let's dive into the details we've learned so far.

For the PC market, the Intel x86 RTX SoC chips will come with an x86 CPU chiplet tightly connected with an Nvidia RTX GPU chiplet via the NVLink interface. This type of processor will have both CPU and GPU units merged into one compact chip package that externally looks much like a standard CPU, rivaling AMD's competing APU products.

This type of tight integration packs all the gaming prowess into one package without an external discrete GPU, providing power and footprint advantages. As such, these chips will be heavily focused on thin-and-light gaming laptops and small form-factor PCs, much like today's APUs from AMD. However, it's possible the new Nvidia/Intel chips could come in multiple flavors and permeate further into the Intel stack over time.

Intel has worked on a similar type of chip before with AMD; there is at least one significant technical difference between these initiatives, however. Intel launched its Kaby Lake-G chip in 2017 with an Intel processor fused into the same package as an AMD Radeon GPU chiplet, much the same as the description of the new Nvidia/Intel chips. You can see an image of the Intel/AMD chip below.

This SoC had a CPU at one end connected via a PCIe connection to the separate AMD GPU chiplet, which is flanked by a small, dedicated memory package. This separate memory package was only usable by the GPU. The Nvidia/Intel products will have an RTX GPU chiplet connected to the CPU chiplet via the faster and more efficient NVLink interface, and we're told it will have uniform memory access (UMA), meaning both the CPU and GPU will be able to access the same pool of memory.

Intel notoriously axed the Kaby Lake-G products in 2019, and the existing systems were left without proper driver support for quite some time, in part because Intel was responsible for validating the drivers, and then finger-pointing ensued. We're told that both Intel and Nvidia will be responsible for their respective drivers for the new models, with Nvidia naturally providing its own GPU drivers. However, Intel will build and sell the consumer processors.

We haven't spoken with Intel yet, but the limited scope of this project means that Intel's proprietary Xe graphics architecture will most assuredly live on as the primary integrated GPU (iGPU) for its mass-market products.

Intel's new x86 RTX CPUs will compete directly with AMD's APUs. For AMD, that means it faces intensifying competition from a company with the leading market share in notebook CPUs (Intel ships ~79% of laptop chips worldwide) that's now armed with GPU tech from Nvidia, which ships 92% of the world's gaming GPUs.

Intel will fabricate custom x86 data center CPUs for Nvidia, which Nvidia will then sell as its own products to enterprise and data center customers. However, the entirety and extent of the modification are currently unknown. We do know that Nvidia will employ its NVLink interface, which tells us the chips could leverage Nvidia's new NVLink Fusion tech that enables custom CPUs and accelerators to enable faster, more efficient communication with Nvidia's GPUs than found with the PCIe interface.

 




Intel has long offered custom Xeons to its customers, primarily hyperscalers, often with relatively minor tweaks to clock rates, cache capacities, and other specifications. In fact, these mostly slightly-modified custom Xeon models once comprised more than 50% of Intel's Xeon shipments. Intel has endured several years of market share erosion due to AMD's advances, most acutely in the hyperscale market. Therefore, it is unclear if the 50% number still holds true, as hyperscalers were the primary customers for custom models.

Intel has long said that it will design completely custom x86 chips for customers as part of its IDM 2.0 strategy. However, aside from a recent announcement of custom AWS chips that sound like the slightly modified Xeons mentioned above, we haven't heard of any large-scale uptake for significantly modified custom x86 processors. Intel announced a new custom chip design unit just two weeks ago, so it will be interesting to learn the extent of the customization for Nvidia's x86 data center CPUs.

Nvidia already uses Intel's Xeons in several of its systems, like the Nvidia DGX B300, but these systems still use the PCIe interface to communicate with the CPU. Intel's new collaboration with Nvidia will obviously open up new opportunities, given the tighter integration with NVLink and all the advantages it brings with it.

The likelihood of AMD adopting NVLink Fusion is somewhere around zero, as the company is heavily invested in its own Infinity Fabric (XGMI) and Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) initiatives, which aim to provide an open-standard interconnect to rival NVLink and democratize rack-scale interconnect technologies. Intel is also a member of UALink, which uses AMD's Infinity Fabric protocol as the foundation.

Nvidia's $5 billion purchase of Intel common stock will come at $23.28 a share, roughly 6% below the current market value, but several aspects of this investment remain unclear. Nvidia hasn't stated whether it will have a seat on the board (which is unlikely) or how it will vote on matters requiring shareholder approval. It is also unclear if Intel will issue new stock (primary issuance) for Nvidia to purchase, as it did when the U.S. government recently became an Intel shareholder (that is likely). Naturally, the investment is subject to approval from regulators.

Nvidia's buy-in comes on the heels of the U.S government buying $10 billion of newly-created Intel stock, granting the country a 9.9% ownership stake at $20.47 per share. The U.S. government won't have a seat on the board and agreed to vote with Intel's board on matters requiring shareholder approval “with limited exceptions.” Softbank has also recently purchased $2 billion worth of primary issuance Intel stock at $23 per share.

The U.S. government says it invested in Intel with the goal of bolstering US technology, manufacturing, and national security, and the investments from the private sector also help solidify the struggling Intel. Altogether, these investments represent a significant cash influx for Intel as it attempts to maintain the heavy cap-ex investments required to compete with TSMC, all while struggling with a negative amount of free cash flow.

“AI is powering a new industrial revolution and reinventing every layer of the computing stack — from silicon to systems to software. At the heart of this reinvention is Nvidia's CUDA architecture,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem—a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.”

“Intel's x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing for decades – and we are innovating across our portfolio to enable the workloads of the future,” said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. “Intel's leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the confidence Jensen and the Nvidia team have placed in us with their investment and look forward to the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow our business.”

We'll learn more details of the new partnership later today when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan hold a webcast press conference at 10 am PT.

It's a bad time to be a JavaScript developer, after Koi Security revealed yesterday that it is tracking ""the largest and most dangerous npm supply-chain compromise in history.""The security firm said the Shai-Hulud malware campaign ""has now impacted hundreds of packages across multiple maintainers,"" including ""popular libraries such as @ctrl/tinycolor as well as packages maintained by CrowdStrike."" (Emphasis theirs.) And the problem is probably going to get worse before it gets better, because the malware in question is a worm that autonomously spreads from package to package.""Attackers published malicious versions of @ctrl/tinycolor and other npm packages, injecting a large obfuscated script (bundle.js) that executes automatically during installation,"" Koi Security said in the blog post revealing this campaign. ""This payload repackages and republishes maintainer projects, enabling the malware to spread laterally across related packages without direct developer involvement.""To be clear: This campaign is distinct from the incident that we covered on Sept. 9, which saw multiple npm packages with billions of weekly downloads compromised in a bid to steal cryptocurrency. The ecosystem is the same — attackers have clearly realized the GitHub-owned npm package registry for the Node.js ecosystem is a valuable target—but whoever's behind the Shai-Hulud campaign is after more than just some Bitcoin.""The injected script performs credential harvesting and persistence operations,"" Koi Security said. ""It runs TruffleHog to scan local filesystems and repositories for secrets, including npm tokens, GitHub credentials, and cloud access keys for [Amazon Web Services], [Google Cloud Platform], and Azure. It also writes a hidden GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/shai-hulud-workflow.yml) that exfiltrates secrets during CI/CD runs, ensuring long-term access even after the initial infection. This dual focus on endpoint secret theft and backdoors makes Shai-Hulud one of the most dangerous campaigns ever compared to previous compromises.""That might be confusing to anyone who doesn't have to worry about developing and distributing Node.js software. But the long and short of it is that Shai-Hulud is using a well-known offensive security tool (TruffleHog) alongside developer tooling (GitHub Actions) in an environment that is designed specifically to help distribute software without much developer involvement (npm).We suggested in our previous report that whoever compromised the npm packages to steal cryptocurrency did us a favor, because they could have used their access to those packages to accomplish far worse attacks. Now it seems that someone is looking to do just that — and it's hard to feign surprise when the Node.js ecosystem and the tooling built around it were practically built to enable widespread attacks like this.Koi Security is updating its blog post with a list of npm packages known to have been compromised via the Shai-Hulud campaign. StepSecurity has also published indicators of compromise alongside a technical breakdown of how the malware spreads, what it does, and how organizations should respond if they discover that a compromised package has been used somewhere in their infrastructure.

The FDA has expanded clearance for an accelerated treatment protocol for the noninvasive Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (Deep TMS, BrainsWay) system for depressive episodes and anxiety symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), the development company announced.

The faster protocol is now commercially available in the US, the company reported.

As reported by Medscape Medical News, the system received previous clearance for obsessive-compulsive disorder, smoking addiction, MDD, and comorbid anxiety symptoms in adults with depression.

Although the previous TMS process called for 4 weeks of daily treatments plus follow-up visits, the newly cleared treatment protocol “includes an acute phase of just 6 treatment days,” the company reported in a release.

The expanded clearance was based on results from a recent randomized noninferiority study that the company reported in June. Patients with MDD in the trial (n = 104) received treatment under either the accelerated protocol or the standard protocol.

The accelerated protocol group received five sessions of Deep TMS per day for 6 days over a 14-day period (the acute phase), followed by two sessions per day once weekly for 4 weeks. Each session lasted less than 10 minutes.

The standard group received five sessions per day for 4 weeks (acute phase), followed by two sessions per day once weekly for 2 weeks. Each of its sessions lasted 20 minutes.

Results showed adjusted Hamilton Depression Rating Scale depression score reductions of 19.1 points in the accelerated TMS group compared to 19.8 points in the standard group. In addition, the response rate was 87.8% vs 87.5%; the remission rate was 78% vs 87.5%; and median time to remission was 21 days vs 28 days.

In the statement, the company will provide training to healthcare providers and will be actively seeking reimbursement updates for the accelerated protocol, noting that the current reimbursement for Deep TMS therapy only allows for up to two treatments per day.

For decades, memory decline was considered an inevitable consequence of aging. However, emerging evidence shows that a small subset of older adults — so-called superagers — stay cognitively sharp well into their 80s and 90s.

Research groups worldwide are now investigating the mechanisms underlying super-aging, with the aim of identifying factors that could inform interventions to preserve cognitive function and promote healthier aging across the broader population.

What's at stake extends beyond curiosity about an exceptional few. By identifying the biological, behavioral, and environmental factors that protect superagers' brains, scientists hope to uncover strategies to help preserve cognitive function in the broader population of aging adults.

One initiative is Northwestern University's SuperAging Program. Now in its 25thyear, the program defines superagers as people aged 80 years or older whose memory performance equals or exceeds that of individuals 20-30 years younger.

To qualify as superagers, individuals must score at least 9 out of 15 on a standard word-recall test — a performance typical of adults in their 50s or 60s but well above the average of about five words for those older than 80 years. In addition, their performance on other cognitive domains must be at least age appropriate.

Only about 10% of otherwise healthy older adults meet these stringent criteria, Sandra Weintraub, PhD; M-Marsel Mesulam, MD; and other core members of the Northwestern program noted in a recent perspective article in Alzheimer's & Dementia.

There appears to be no particular lifestyle conducive to super-aging. “Some superagers appeared to follow all conceivable recommendations for a healthy life. Others did not eat well, enjoyed smoking and drinking, shunned exercise, suffered stressful life situations, and did not sleep well. Superagers also did not seem to be medically healthier than their peers,” the Northwestern team reported.

Amanda Cook Maher, PhD, clinical neuropsychologist, who works with superagers at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Michigan Medicine, found that healthy social relationships may be one potential factor.

“Superagers report a higher degree of warm, trusting, positive relationships with others compared to their cognitively average, similar age peers,” Maher told Medscape Medical News.

“Anecdotally, superagers are remarkable and just so much fun,” she noted. “They are so full of life, and their energy and excitement is contagious. Their schedules are jam-packed with volunteering, classes, social engagements, some are still working. It can be challenging to get them in for study visits,” she said.

“While much of the cognitive aging space is focused on what's going wrong for older adults, the study of superagers allows us to dive into what can go right in the aging brain,” Maher added.

Brain scans have revealed significant differences between superagers and their age-matched cognitively average peers.

While typical older adults show widespread cortical thinning compared with younger adults, superagers retain cortical thickness comparable to individuals in midlife.

In particular, the anterior cingulate cortex is typically thicker in superagers than in younger adults. This region supports attention, motivation, and social engagement, echoing behavioral traits seen in superagers, who often report strong social connections and high extraversion.

Superagers show a “striking preservation of the core brain circuit for episodic memory, including hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and cholinergic basal forebrain, relative to closely matched healthy older adults,” Bryan Strange, MBBS, PhD, director of the Laboratory for Clinical Neuroscience, Polytechnic University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain, told Medscape Medical News.

His research showed that longitudinally, these brain regions, which control memory, expressed a slower rate of atrophy in superagers relative to control individuals, “meaning that the cross-sectional differences could not be simply explained by bigger memory areas at birth,” Strange noted.

Strikingly, superagers also show more volume in areas of the thalamus involved in movement.

“This stuck out like a sore thumb, and at first we weren't sure how to interpret it,” Strange said. But a machine learning analysis, including a large number of variables to discriminate superagers from control individuals showed that one of the top predictors was movement speed — superagers move more quickly than age-matched control individuals.

Interestingly, the other top predictor was mental health, with superagers showing markedly lower levels of anxiety and depression on clinical scales, Strange noted.

Postmortem studies have identified several distinctive features of superager brains. Notably, they possess a higher density of von Economo neurons — particularly in the anterior cingulate cortex — cells that are linked to social and emotional processing.

Superager brains also have fewer neurofibrillary tangles, the tau aggregates characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, along with larger entorhinal neurons which are more resistant to neurodegeneration. They show better preservation of the basal forebrain cholinergic system, which supports attention and memory, and reduced microglial-mediated inflammation in white matter.

Despite a growing understanding of superagers, many questions remain.

For example, are they born with protective brain features, or do these features emerge over time? Are they resistant to age-related memory loss, or do they have coping mechanisms that allow them to better offset this memory loss?

“I wish there was a simple nature/nurture type of answer to this question. Sadly, there is not,” said Maher.

Another key question is what role genetics and genetic variants play in promoting cognitive resilience.

Maher noted that superagers do not appear to be at particularly low risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared with their cognitively normal peers.

“APOE allele profiles are similar in superagers and cognitively normal controls and initial investigation of Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk scores are also similar in superagers compared to cognitively average controls,” she noted.

On the other hand, Strange said he is “quite convinced” that the superager phenotype has an important genetic component.

In his work with superagers, Strange said he was also struck by the fact that they were more likely to have a musical background than control individuals.

“Our machine learning analysis to predict superager status included 89 variables spanning demographic, neuropsychology, diet, exercise, sleep, personal and socioeconomic status, midlife activities, medical history, and medical and mental health assessments. Despite this wealth of information, the model only reached a discrimination accuracy of 66%, which is not great. This makes me think that there may be other, particularly genetic, variables that would improve discrimination accuracy,” Strange said.

Other open questions include whether targeted interventions could replicate the superaging trajectory in the wider population; and whether social and psychological traits, like gregariousness and engagement, actively contribute to sustaining memory in late life.

“There are likely multiple paths to becoming a superager,” said Maher.

She added that ongoing studies are using wearable sensors in fully remote protocols to track the daily behaviors of superagers. These approaches, she said, will provide objective measures of sleep and activity patterns to complement self-reported data.

Strange said there are modifiable “variables that could be optimized to help individuals reach superager status,” said Strange.

“These include enjoying an active midlife, doing physical exercise, placing an emphasis on good mental health, and keeping a close eye on cardiovascular risk factors [such as] hypertension and hyperglycemia,” he said.

The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS) revealed a 15.5-fold increase in serious food- and supplement-related adverse events among youth since 2004, including 152 deaths and 1388 hospitalizations.

“Enhanced oversight, and clinician- and caregiver-facing warnings may be warranted for product categories repeatedly linked with adverse outcomes. One potential intervention to reduce food- and dietary product-related adverse events is improving food and diet product labeling as well as consumer education to help vulnerable consumers avoid triggering allergens and remain safe,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Jeannie S. Huang, MD, MPH, Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and University of California San Diego in La Jolla. It was published online in The Journal of Pediatrics.

CAERS relies on voluntary reporting from consumers and healthcare practitioners, which may result in both underreporting and reporting bias. The threshold for reporting varies by reporter, leading to inconsistency in event severity reporting. The absence of denominator data, such as total product usage rates, prevents estimation of incidence or comparative risk and limits generalizability. Additionally, crucial contextual information about exposure settings, timing, dosage, and concurrent conditions was often missing or unclear.

The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest. No funding was received for this study.

Mortality due to status epilepticus (SE) in the US nearly doubled from 1999 to 2020, increasing particularly among individuals aged 75 years or older and Black, a new retrospective study showed.

“Rising mortality rates in older adults may be related to increasing life expectancies and longer survival with comorbidities that cause seizures (brain injury or stroke), leaving older adults more susceptible to SE,” the investigators wrote.

“Investigation into the underlying causes of SE-related mortality and reasons for these disparities is needed,” they added.

This study was led by Wesley Budd, DO, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore. It was published online on September 8 in Neurology.

This study relied on causes of death given in the death certificate, which may have led to misclassification. Additionally, small numbers of American Indian or Alaska Native and Asian or Pacific Islander individuals limited the analysis in these populations.

The investigators reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

As a third-year resident doctor, sometimes I think about how much of myself I've poured into this journey. 

Residency isn't just a job; it's a season of becoming. You learn to show up even when you're running on fumes. You learn how to hold space for grief, for healing, and for uncertainty, all while trying to hold onto pieces of yourself.

The version of me that started this path is not the same one standing here now. I've had to grow up really fast, set boundaries, and learn how to let some things go. I've also discovered strength I didn't know I had. 

Through this chaos, I've found my purpose.

Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its components was associated with a risk of developing systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs).

“This large population-based cohort study suggests that exposure to PM2.5 and to the mixture of its components may be associated with the development of SARDs. It reinforces that effects of exposure to PM2.5 may extend beyond the lungs, potentially to the immune system,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Mareva Geslin, MD candidate, Département de Santé Publique, Hôpital Pontchaillou, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire, Rennes, France. It was published online on June 12, 2025, in Arthritis & Rheumatology.

Misclassification of PM2.5 exposure may be possible particularly in rural areas where one postal code may cover extensive regions. Estimates based on postal codes may not reflect individual movement or exposures at work or during commutes. Residual confounding could not be ruled out owing to lack of data on factors such as smoking.

This study was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. The authors reported having no other conflicts of interest.

Patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration who have not had treatment before for their disease had measurable improvements in visual acuity and key anatomical markers after 6 months of treatment with high-dose aflibercept, the first global, real-world study of the drug showed.

“These month-6 results from SPECTRUM support the real-world effectiveness and safety of aflibercept 8 mg in patients with treatment-naive neovascular age-related macular degeneration,” Clare Bailey, MD, a retina specialist at the University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust in Bristol, England, reported at the European Society of Retina Specialists (EURETINA) 2025, Congress in Paris, France.

Aflibercept 8 mg, a VEGF inhibitor approved by the FDA in 2023 for the treatment of retinal diseases, is a newer iteration of aflibercept 2 mg, which the agency first approved in 2011.

Bailey presented data on the first 150 treatment-naive patients enrolled in the SPECTRUM study. So far, the trial has enrolled 3463 patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, including more than 1100 who have had no previous treatment for their disease.

The 150 patients had an average improvement of 3.5 ETDRS letters after 6 months, along with a reduction of 190 μm in central retinal thickness, a key marker of retinal inflammation, Bailey said. A 3.5 ETDRS letter improvement can be the difference between 20/40 and 20/35 vision on the Snellen chart.

Patients with worse vision experienced more robust improvements in eyesight, Bailey said. Those with visual acuity of 20/200 Snellen, or 35 ETDRS letters, or worse — the definition of legal blindness — averaged an improvement of 14.3 letters at 6 months, improving close to 20/100 Snellen. Patients with visual acuity of 35-69 letters, ranging from 20/200 to 20/40 Snellen, gained 4.9 letters. In patients with 20/40 vision or better, the improvement was less robust, averaging 0.7 ETDRS letters, which is an incremental change in Snellen vision.

Patients with worse central retinal thickness also had more robust improvements after 6 months of treatment with aflibercept 8 mg, Bailey said. Those with central retinal thickness < 400 μm upon enrollment in the trial averaged a 64-μm reduction at 6 months; patients with central retinal thickness > 400 μm had an average reduction of 284 μm. The latter group had worse average overall central retinal thickness at 6 months: 536 vs 305 μm, she reported.

The study evaluated two anatomical markers of drug effectiveness: fluid underneath within the retina. In these 150 patients, 20.3% had no subretinal fluid upon enrollment, and 73.3% had achieved that outcome after 6 months of treatment; 44.7% had no intraretinal fluid upon study entry, with 68.4% meeting that measure at 6 months, Bailey said.

The real-world study raised no new concerns about drug safety, she said.

The patients averaged 4.7 injections of aflibercept over the 6-month trial, including an injection at their last visit and three initial monthly doses, Bailey said. After the first three monthly doses, the prescribing information recommends follow-up injections every 8-16 weeks. Bailey said the injection at the last visit would not have altered the 6-month results she presented.

“There were good anatomical improvements, and the visual acuity gains were very encouraging,” Bailey told Medscape Medical News. “We will await the 12-month data with interest as well as the further precise information about the mean number of injections prior to the last visit.”

The outcome of around 70% of eyes having no retinal fluid after 6 months of treatment “is expected,” Gabriel Katz, MD, a retina specialist at Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv, Israel, said. However, he questioned the clinical practicality of using aflibercept 8 mg as a first-line treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

“First, some countries require the use of bevacizumab as the first line for treatment-naive patients,” he told Medscape Medical News. “Secondly, prior to the introduction of aflibercept 8 mg, the 2-mg version was the most widely preferred drug.”

Many physicians had concerns about intraocular inflammation in high-dose drugs, which was seen in previous studies with abicipar and brolucizumab, Katz said. “Therefore, aflibercept 8 mg was accepted by many physicians with some restraint,” he said. “It is nice to see real-life studies with aflibercept 8 mg do not show a significant signal of intraocular inflammation.”

The study was funded by Bayer. Bailey reported having financial relationships with Bayer, Apellis, and Roche. Katz reported having no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

Details of a new drug that aims to treat the underlying causes of obesity are being presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Vienna, Austria (15-19 September).

The treatment of obesity has been transformed in recent years by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists such as semaglutide, which reduce appetite, slow the release of food from the stomach and increase feelings of fullness.

These drugs are highly effective for weight loss but many people regain weight after stopping treatment. That's because obesity is driven by more than appetite alone – it also involves disrupted lipid and glucose metabolism, changes in adipose tissue and mitochondrial dysfunction, leaving plenty of room for new approaches, explains Riccardo Panella, co-founder and CEO of Turin-based biotech Resalis Therapeutics.

The company's approach involves an antisense oligonucleotide – a small, lab-made fragment of genetic material designed to block a specific RNA in the body. The new drug, which is called RES-010, is designed to block an RNA molecule called miR-22.

miR22 is a ""master controller"" of many processes involved in obesity, including lipid metabolism (how the body breaks down and uses fats), the production and activity of mitochondria (the tiny structures that provide cells with energy) and adipose tissue remodeling (changes in how body fat is organized and how it functions), says Dr Panella, who is one of the authors of the new research.

The hope is that by tackling all these factors simultaneously, RES-010, which is administered once a week as a subcutaneous injection, will reprogram the metabolism, producing long-lasting weight loss.

Pre-clinical studies show that the compound can induce significant weight loss – and that the lost weight isn't regained when treatment stops. A phase 1 trial is now under way.

In tests on obese mice, mice given weekly injections of the drug lost about 12% more weight than untreated mice. The weight loss occurred gradually over the five months of treatment, leading to the animals returning to healthy weight.

Importantly, the treated mice lost weight despite eating the same amount as the untreated mice, which suggests RES-010 isn't suppressing appetite but reprogramming the metabolism.""

Riccardo Panella, Co-Founder and CEO, Resalis Therapeutics

Experiments also showed that mice that had been treated with RES-010 did not regain weight after the drug was stopped.

The team also explored giving RES-010 and semaglutide alone and together to mice and non-human primates (NHPs).

They found that RES-010 selectively targeted fat mass. This is important because rapid weight loss when on a diet or taking GLP-1 drugs can lead to lean mass, which includes muscle and bone, being lost too.

""Lean mass, especially skeletal muscle, is central to strength, stamina and blood sugar regulation, and so its loss is potentially harmful,"" says Dr Panella.

NHPs given RES-010 lost 15% fat mass and 1% lean mass over ten weeks. This compares with 16% fat mass and 8% lean mass for semaglutide alone.

The team also looked at whether the animals regained weight after treatment was stopped.

They observed that while the NHPs given semaglutide alone regained weight after semaglutide was discontinued, the animals receiving the combination treatment did not regain weight after semaglutide was stopped and they remained on RES-010 alone. Moreover, no rebound occurred when RES-010 was also stopped a few weeks later.

No significant side-effects were seen in the mice or the NHPs at therapeutic doses, says Dr Panella.

Tests on animals and non-human organoids have shown how the drug works.

Dr Panella says: ""RES-010 works by reprogramming how cells handle fat and energy

""Rather than reducing appetite, it changes the way in which the body uses fats, boosts the production and activity of mitochondria, the 'batteries' that power cells, and helps convert white fat, which stores energy, into brown fat, which burns it.

""Because it acts on these fundamental pathways, weight regain is less likely.

""RES-010 is pioneering a new class of RNA medicines that reprogram the body's metabolism, with the aim of producing long-lasting weight loss and improved metabolic health by, for example, improving liver health.""

The drug is now being given to humans for the first time, in a phase 1 clinical trial in the Netherlands.

The randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, will involve up to 80 participants (including some with overweight or obesity) and assess the safety and side-effects of various doses. The first participants were treated in November 2024 and the initial results are expected at the beginning of 2026.

electronRx, a leading digital medicine and biomarker company driving healthcare through pulmonary innovation, today announced that it will launch pDx at HLTH 2025. The pDx app offers chronic respiratory disease (CRD) patients a cardiopulmonary assessment device, engineered to medical grade standards, to measure lung function at home using a mobile phone, laptop or tablet. This enables clinicians to remotely assess cardiopulmonary function, track disease progression, and adjust treatment protocols to optimise therapeutic outcomes. By reducing the need for frequent hospital visits, pDx empowers patients to better manage their conditions, while helping healthcare systems to streamline delivery and reduce the strain on resources.

The pDx app and complementary clinical dashboard are designed to enhance the detection, monitoring, and treatment of CRDs including asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension, which are the third leading cause of death, globally*. The app expands upon electronRx's proprietary purpleDx technology, adding tailored questionnaires and access to real-time detailed results for patients, as well as their clinicians. In addition to purpleDx's mobile phone accessibility, pDx can now be accessed using any device with a screen, such as a laptop or tablet, depending on the individual's preference.

The technology leverages the device's camera sensors to capture and measure blood flow biomechanics, generating digital biomarkers that translate into clinically actionable metrics. These include key physiological metrics such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and tidal volume. The data is delivered in real time to healthcare providers via a secure clinical dashboard, enabling remote monitoring of lung function and dynamic adjustment of treatment plans to optimise drug efficacy.

electronRx is dedicated to transforming the lives of people living with breathing disorders. pDx represents a major step forward in personalised respiratory care and we very much look forward to demonstrating the technology at HLTH. The platform's scalable architecture supports integration into existing care pathways, allowing for proactive intervention and reduced reliance on in-person visits. By facilitating continuous monitoring, pDx helps clinicians personalise care while improving patient adherence and reducing healthcare burden. Most importantly, it gives patients greater flexibility and control over their healthcare journey.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Radiation from medical imaging linked to higher blood cancer risk in children","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250917/Radiation-from-medical-imaging-linked-to-higher-blood-cancer-risk-in-children.aspx","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 03:08:00 GMT","

A study led by UC San Francisco and UC Davis has concluded that radiation from medical imaging is associated with a higher risk of blood cancers in children.

The researchers examined data from nearly 4 million children and estimated that 1 in 10 blood cancers - some 3,000 cancers in all - may be attributable to radiation exposure from medical imaging. The risk increased proportionally based on the cumulative amount of radiation the children received.

The study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), appears Sept. 17 in The New England Journal of Medicine. 

The investigation is the first comprehensive assessment using data from children and adolescents in North America that quantifies the association between radiation exposure from medical imaging and blood and bone marrow cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, which are the most common forms of cancer in children and adolescents.

Medical imaging saves lives by enabling timely diagnosis and effective treatment, but it also exposes patients to ionizing radiation, a known carcinogen, particularly through computed tomography (CT). 

The authors caution that doctors and parents should avoid excessive radiation doses and minimize exposure when clinically feasible. 

Children are particularly vulnerable to radiation-induced cancer due to their heightened radiosensitivity and longer life expectancy.""

Rebecca Smith-Bindman, MD, a radiologist and professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, as well as Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at UCSF and first author of the paper

""While medical imaging can be lifesaving, our findings underscore the critical need to carefully evaluate and minimize radiation exposure during pediatric imaging to safeguard children's long-term health,"" said Smith-Bindman, who is also a member of the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies. ""This involves ensuring that imaging is performed only when it provides essential information for the child's care and, in cases such as CT scans, using the lowest possible radiation doses.""

The study uses a retrospective cohort design, looking back at the complete imaging histories of 3.7 million children who were born between 1996 and 2016. The children were treated at six health care systems in the U.S. and Ontario, Canada. Investigators found a significant relationship between cumulative radiation dose and the risk of a hematologic malignancy, which includes tumors affecting the blood, bone marrow, lymph, and lymphatic system.

The risk of developing cancer varied significantly by imaging modality. CT, which is used to detect many abnormalities such as tumors, heart disease, and injuries of the spinal cord and brain, entails significant radiation exposure. But radiographs, which are used to diagnose both broken bones and pneumonia, expose children to much lower doses.

Among all the forms of medical imaging, the study found that chest radiography was the most common imaging exam that doctors performed. The most common form of CT was of the head and brain. 

For children who underwent a head CT, the researchers attributed about a quarter of the children's subsequent hematologic malignancies to radiation exposure. For those who had radiographs, by contrast, they estimated that only a small fraction of the children's subsequent cancers were associated with radiation exposure.

Getting one or two head CTs was associated with a 1.8-fold increased risk of a cancer diagnosis, and this rose to 3.5 times for children who received more scans and were therefore exposed to more radiation.

Altogether, 2,961 hematologic malignancies were diagnosed during the study period. Lymphoid malignancies accounted for 79.3%, while myeloid malignancies and acute leukemia together accounted for 15.5%. About 58% of cancers occurred in males, and about half were diagnosed in children under 5.

The authors said that up to 10% of hematologic malignancies in children and adolescents could be prevented by reducing unnecessary imaging and optimizing radiation doses. In many cases, the authors said, substituting non-ionizing imaging modalities like ultrasound or MRI may be feasible without compromising diagnostic accuracy. 

The authors emphasized that while medical imaging remains an invaluable tool in pediatric care, their findings highlight the need to carefully balance its diagnostic benefits with potential long-term risks. 

""This study provides robust, directly observed evidence of a clear dose-response relationship between radiation from medical imaging and hematologic malignancy risk in children and adolescents,"" said Diana Miglioretti, PhD, UC Davis Health professor and chief of the Division of Biostatistics. 

""Our findings align with international research highlighting that children are especially radiosensitive,"" Miglioretti added. ""It's crucial for clinicians to weigh the immediate benefits of imaging against potential long-term health risks and to optimize imaging protocols to minimize radiation exposure.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Physical frailty linked to higher dementia risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250917/Physical-frailty-linked-to-higher-dementia-risk.aspx","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 03:49:00 GMT","

A new study suggests that physical frailty may contribute to the development of dementia. The study was published on September 17, 2025, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

Physical frailty is defined as having three or more of these five symptoms: often feeling tired; little or no physical activity; slow walking speed; low grip strength; and unintentional weight loss.

We've known that frailty is associated with a higher risk of dementia, but our study provides evidence that frailty may be an actual cause of dementia. On the other hand, despite this new evidence, we can't rule out the possibility that frailty is instead a marker of the early changes in the disease process.""

Yacong Bo, PhD, study author of Zhengzhou University, China

The study involved 489,573 people with an average age of 57 who were followed for an average of 14 years. A total of 4.6% of the participants met the definition for frailty, with three or more of the symptoms. Another 43.9% who had one or two symptoms were categorized as pre-frailty and 51.5% had no symptoms and were categorized as not frail.

During the study, 8,900 people developed dementia. A total of 4.6% of those with frailty developed dementia, compared to 2.2% of those with pre-frailty and 1.3% of those without frailty.

After researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect the risk of dementia, such as age, education level and physical activity, they found that the people who met the definition for frailty were nearly three times more likely to develop dementia than those who had no symptoms of frailty. Those categorized as pre-frailty were 50% more likely to develop dementia.

People with frailty who also had genes linked to dementia were nearly four times more likely to develop dementia than those without frailty or the genetic risk.

The researchers also analyzed the data and found evidence suggesting that frailty may potentially be a factor in causing dementia.

""These findings reinforce the importance of identifying and managing frailty as a strategy for preventing dementia,"" Bo said.

Looking at the data from the other direction, the researchers found that dementia is unlikely to increase the risk of frailty.

The researchers also looked at brain imaging and biological biomarkers and found that people with frailty were more likely to have changes in their brain structure related to dementia.

""These biomarkers may be a mechanism underlying the pathway from frailty to dementia,"" said Bo.

A limitation of the study was that four of the five symptoms of frailty were reported by the participants, so they may not have provided accurate information.

The study was supported by the Chinese National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Birth Defects Prevention, Henan Key Laboratory of Population Defects Prevention, the Chinese International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program and the Henan Medical Science and Technology Research Program.

Locomotor activity is the motion necessary to get from one place to another. It is closely linked to complex human activities such as learning and motivation, and it is key to avoiding or approaching a stimulus, target, or big-picture goal.

Locomotor activity tendencies of avoiding or seeking are a central component of the human experience, with locomotor activity tests enabling the assessment of spontaneous locomotor activity in rats and mice in order to establish the baseline level of motor activity.

People with temporal lobe epilepsy in particular often wander around aimlessly and unconsciously after a seizure. Researchers at the University Hospital Bonn (UKB), the University of Bonn, and the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) have identified a neurobiological mechanism that could be responsible for this so-called post-ictal wandering and potentially other postictal symptoms. According to their hypothesis, epileptic seizures are not directly responsible for post-ictal symptoms, but rather seizure-associated depolarization waves, also known as spreading depolarization (SD). The results of the studies have now been published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

In everyday clinical practice, symptoms are regularly observed after epileptic seizures, known as ""post-ictal symptoms"", which, in contrast to the usually short duration of seizures, typically last several minutes to hours. Besides symptoms such as impaired speech and language comprehension, a state of disorientation may occur. This wandering about, known in technical terms as postictal wandering, can sometimes be life-threatening if, for example, the affected unconscious person runs onto the street. ""Postictal symptoms are traditionally referred to the preceding epileptic seizure. However, it is unclear whether there is actually a direct neurobiological connection or whether the symptoms are based on another pathology,"" says corresponding author Prof. Michael Wenzel from the Dept. of Epileptology at the UKB, who is also a member of the Transdisciplinary Research Area (TRA) ""Life & Health"" at the University of Bonn.

The Bonn research team initially wanted to better understand the development of epilepsy as a result of an initial acute disease-in this case, viral encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain caused by viruses. To do this, they used modern cellular-resolution fluorescence microscopy in combination with electrophysiology and optogenetics in a mouse model, which allows them to study network dynamics and the communication of different brain cell types in the living brain with high resolution over a period of months. ""In doing so, we accidentally discovered a network phenomenon in the hippocampus-a structure relevant to epilepsy located inside the temporal lobe-that could explain postictal symptoms but, surprisingly, does not represent seizures themselves,"" says first author Bence Mitlasóczki, a doctoral student at the University of Bonn in Prof. Wenzel's research group at the UKB.

The observed phenomenon consists of slow depolarization waves, which are mainly known from neurological disorders such as migraine or acute brain injuries. This so-called spreading depolarization (SD) causes the collapse of the neuronal membrane potential and the failure of the affected network for minutes to hours. The structures in the inner region of the temporal lobe, such as the hippocampus, may be more sensitive to SD during epileptic seizures than the multisensory and motor part of the cerebral cortex, known as the neocortex.

This could also explain why postictal symptoms are most commonly observed in temporal lobe epilepsy.""

Bence Mitlasóczki, Doctoral Student, University of Bonn

In addition, SD waves are filtered out in standard clinical EEGs in epileptology because they are so slow. ""As a result, SDs have been 'invisible' in clinical EEGs for decades, which is an important reason why the strictly seizure-related concept of postictal symptoms persists, even though this may not be accurate,"" states Prof. Wenzel.

In addition, the Bonn researchers found evidence that seizure-associated SDs also exist in deep regions of the human brain. To do this, they used a special feature of pre-surgical diagnostics at the UKB for people with difficult-to-treat epilepsy, which tests whether a local seizure focus can be surgically removed. As part of the study, the research team initially examined some participants using the electrodes implanted for diagnosis with additional microwire bundles – which were established by the working group led by co-author Prof. Florian Mormann at the UKB – to determine whether local SD can also be detected deep in the human brain as soon as the EEG bandwidth is extended beyond the international standard, thus enabling very slow potential fluctuations to be recorded.

The conclusion of the Bonn researchers is that epileptic seizures, although assumed to be the cause for decades, may not be the direct cause of postictal symptoms. ""Our hypothesis is that local seizure-associated SD is a key factor in epilepsy that has been massively understudied to date,"" says co-author Prof. Heinz Beck from the UKB and DZNE. He is a spokesperson for the Transdisciplinary Research Area (TRA) ""Life & Health"" and a member of the ImmunoSensation Cluster of Excellence at the University of Bonn. The results point to a possible general role of SD in a variety of different postictal disorders, which now need to be investigated further. ""In addition, our results require a review of previous studies which, because SD was filtered out, related effects and effect sizes to epileptic seizures, even though this may not be the case,"" says Prof. Wenzel. ""Finally, our study could stimulate a discussion on whether the international EEG standard needs to be expanded to make SD directly visible in clinical EEG as well.""

Trace eyeblink conditioning is a popular technique designed to explore the neural mechanisms that underpin motor learning in both human and animal subjects. This technique involves the classical conditioning of learning and memory via the paired presentation of tone conditioning stimulus.

This stimulus starts and finishes with an air puff test that will always elicit a response. After repeated paired presentations, a conditioned eyeblink develops before the air puff.

This type of conditioning has been systematically studied, with the cerebellum (which controls and coordinates muscular activity) now recognized as essential to both animals and humans.

Delivering unconditioned stimulus to the eye's cornea results in sensory information being taken into the trigeminal nucleus. This is transmitted both indirectly and directly to the abducens motor nuclei and accessory abducens. These nuclei's output regulates a number of eye muscles that work cooperatively to generate an unconditioned blink response to the stimulation.

Eyeblink conditioning is regularly used to monitor abnormalities in cerebellar-dependent learning and memory, a principle that underpins this type of associative learning.

Eyeblink conditioning is one of the most straightforward and well-understood motor learning techniques. San Diego Instruments' (SDI's) Trace eyeblink conditioning system is portable, turnkey, and able to deliver high-quality data collection and analysis via menu-driven software linked via a USB interface.

Using a laptop, this system can be transported anywhere, and its comfortable headset enables easy viewing of subject responses. This system is routinely employed in basic learning studies and in examining the behavioral consequences of Alzheimer's and other diseases.

Eyeblink conditioning is also a key component of psychopharmacology research, and can be used to recognize individuals with associative learning impairments. This is important because delayed conditioning can be disrupted in children and adults with neurological disorders such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and autism.

Examining eyeblink conditioning in infants can facilitate earlier detection and treatment of these neurological disorders.

The Trace eyeblink conditioning system from SDI requires no technical knowledge to set up and does not require the specialized interface cards or drivers typically associated with Trace eyeblink conditioning systems.

SDI's Trace eyeblink conditioning system uses intuitive menu-driven software to control stimuli, monitor, and safeguard all eyeblink data throughout every session. Complete response waveforms are classified as “alpha,” “CS,” or “US,” and these are automatically examined using the special analysis software to enable the determination of secondary peaks.

Regular Covid vaccinations should continue worldwide to reduce cardiac risks associated with the virus - according to new research from the University of East Anglia. 

A major report published today sets out ways of tackling the 'profound and lasting impact' of Covid and long Covid on cardiovascular health.

It makes recommendations for diagnosing, treating and preventing serious heart and blood vessel complications linked to the virus.

As well as continuing vaccination programmes, the report recommends structured cardiac rehabilitation - to prevent long-term problems after infection and boost long Covid recovery.

The clinical consensus statement is authored by a group of experts from across Europe, led by Prof. Vassilios Vassiliou from UEA and the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).

The Covid pandemic has had a profound and lasting impact on our health, with complications emerging during acute illness and recovery.

Millions of people around the world are suffering with serious cardiovascular problems caused by Covid infection and long Covid.

A lack of clear evidence-based guidance on how to reduce this suffering and prevent further harm means that patients are not receiving the care they need, and some are turning to unproven or unsafe treatments.

We wanted to change that.""

Prof. Vassilios Vassiliou, UEA's Norwich Medical School

Almost one billion people are known to have been infected with Covid worldwide, although the true number is believed to be far higher.

Research shows that Covid patients, especially those who needed hospital treatment, have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attack, stroke and death from cardiovascular disease.

Around 100 million people are currently living with long Covid, and about five per cent of these have cardiac long Covid, with symptoms including angina (chest pain), breathlessness, arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm), heart failure, fatigue and dizziness.

Long Covid can also lead to autonomic dysfunction where the nerves that normally control heart rate, breathing and body temperature do not work properly.

The team reviewed all existing research on the virus and cardiovascular disease, including the effects of an acute infection, long Covid and Covid vaccination.

They used this research to agree a set of recommendations for how to treat or prevent the damaging cardiovascular effects of Covid.

The report includes advice to continue vaccinating against Covid-19, as people who are fully vaccinated are far less likely to suffer cardiac complications or long Covid, even if they come down with the virus.

It also sets out how to diagnose and treat the symptoms brought on by Covid, such as shortness of breath, chest pain and fainting.

In particular, the paper recommends structured cardiac rehabilitation programmes, including specialised physiotherapy, to prevent longer term problems from developing following infection and to aid recovery from long Covid.

Prof Vassiliou said: ""Covid doesn't just affect the lungs. It can also damage the heart and blood vessels, both during the acute infection and for months afterward. This means chest pain, breathlessness, palpitations, or fatigue may be signs of cardiac long Covid.

""If you already have heart disease, Covid raises your risk of serious complications both immediately and long after infection. In both cases, rehabilitation can protect your heart and support recovery.

""Our report provides unified, practical recommendations for prevention, rehabilitation, and long-term care, while also identifying critical research gaps to ensure strategies continue to evolve with emerging evidence.""

Finally, the experts call for equal access to cardiac rehabilitation programmes, especially for people living in rural locations.

""At present, the capacity of rehabilitation services across much of Europe is insufficient to accommodate both conventional cardiac patients and those with cardiac long Covid,"" said Prof Vassiliou.

""There are also significant regional variations. Targeted financial investment and resource allocation are therefore required to expand service capacity and ensure equitable access.

""Unfortunately, even now, cardiac long Covid continues to affect the quality of life for many patients. We need to ensure patients have equitable access to rehabilitation services, support primary prevention through vaccination and lifestyle programmes, and fund research into long Covid and cardiovascular outcomes.

""Health systems must be prepared for the ongoing burden, not just the acute infection.""

As the second leading cause of death globally, cancer is a worldwide health crisis, particularly as life expectancies continue to increase. In its final stages, cancer spreads throughout the body in a process known as metastasis. Here, the cancer cells enter the circulatory system, moving to various distal sites where they cause the formation of new tumors. Metastasis accounts for a vast majority of cancer-related deaths, but the molecular machinery driving this behavior is still poorly understood.

The cytoskeleton is a critical component of cancer cell migration and is broadly involved in cell structure and motility. The formation of actin filaments (F-actin), in particular, is a notable driver of cell motility, and the presence of F-actin structures can serve as a biomarker of cell migration. Actin filaments can also be used as an indicator of cell necrosis, as the loss of membrane integrity causes F-actin to become exposed.

Previous investigations of F-actin in cancer cells were largely performed in 2D, providing relatively limited information, since cell processes ultimately occur in 3D. Tumors in particular can be challenging targets for such approaches, as they are heterogeneous, and 2D cross-sectional visualization may not provide a complete picture of the cellular dynamics at play. Therefore, an accurate molecular understanding of the cytoskeleton's role in metastasis would necessitate imaging techniques that capture volumetric data.

A recent study from the Vienna University of Technology, Austria, used light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) to examine cytoskeletal changes in spheroids composed of either colorectal cancer (CRC) or non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells in 3D. The 2D data measured with this technique were deconvoluted in NeuroDeblur (MBF Bioscience) and reconstructed into a 3D representation using Thermo Scientific Amira Software, which revealed intricate internal and external tissue structures.

Light sheet fluorescence microscopy uses a laser to trigger fluorescence through a cross-section of a sample. When this is done at discreet intervals throughout an entire sample volume, precise optical sectioning of the specimen becomes possible, producing a data series that can be deconvoluted and stacked into a 3D volume.

Prado-López et al. used this approach to analyze cancer-cell spheroids produced from CRC and NSCLC specimens. They found that the internal structures of the cells exhibited sufficient autofluorescence for differentiation and segmentation. In particular, F-actin structures could be clearly identified, along with quantification of their intensity in individual cells (see below).

Quantitative analysis through Amira Software segmentation also allowed F-actin intensity to be correlated to CRC and NSCLC cell necrosis. Six distinct regions were identified and mapped to different cellular states, such as proliferation, senescence, and necrosis.

F-actin polymerization, which leads to cell stiffening, correlates with increased cell mobility. Prado-López et al. found they could directly observe this F-actin behavior in a more physiologically relevant, 3D context.

Subsequent segmentation in Amira Software provided a quantitative analysis of F-actin distribution. This approach is an exciting step forward in our ability to view cancer cell mobility and metastasis at a molecular level. These insights will enhance our understanding of this process and provide avenues for potential intervention and treatment.

Psoriasis patients treated with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) face a 78% lower risk of death and a 44% lower risk of major cardiovascular events compared to those taking other diabetes or weight-loss medications, new research has shown.

The study – the largest of its kind and presented today at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress 2025 – also found that GLP-1RAs significantly reduced the risk of alcohol abuse by 65% and substance abuse by nearly 50%.

Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition affecting 2-3% of the population, linked not only to visible symptoms but also to higher risks of heart attack, stroke and psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety and increased alcohol or substance use. GLP-1RAs, including semaglutide and liraglutide, are widely used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, this emerging evidence suggests they may also offer important benefits for psoriasis patients..

The international research team retrieved data from a database of over 110 million patients in the United States. Outcomes were compared for over 6,000 psoriasis patients with diabetes or obesity over a two-year period, including 3,048 who were treated with GLP-1RAs and 3,048 who received other anti-diabetic or anti-obesity drugs.

Patients included in the retrospective cohort analysis were over 18 years old, had a confirmed diagnosis of psoriasis requiring systemic therapy, and had received continuous treatment with either a GLP-1RA or an alternative anti-diabetic or anti-obesity medication for at least 24 months. After matching for age, sex, and comorbidities, the benefits of GLP-1RAs were clear and consistent across all sensitivity analyses, using propensity score matching to control for potential confounders.

Our findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists may offer benefits beyond their effects on weight and glucose control, particularly for cardiovascular and psychiatric outcomes in people with psoriasis. We hypothesise that GLP-1 receptor activation may inhibit proinflammatory mediators, which are elevated in people with psoriasis. Additionally, GLP-1 receptors are expressed in parts of the brain involved in mood and the reward system, which could explain the reductions we observed in alcohol and substance use.""

Professor Ralf Ludwig, lead author of the study

These benefits appeared especially pronounced in psoriasis patients compared with matched controls, suggesting a possible synergy between systemic inflammation in psoriasis and the mechanisms of GLP-1RAs. Safety outcomes were consistent with those seen in the general population, with no significant increase in adverse effects such as hypoglycemia, nausea, or constipation.

""Given their safety profile and the range of benefits observed, GLP-1RAs could become a preferred treatment for people with psoriasis who also require therapy for diabetes or weight management,"" Prof. Ludwig furthered.

""Psoriasis management has traditionally focused on controlling skin symptoms, but these findings emphasise the need to consider the wider health risks faced by patients. GLP-1RAs may offer a valuable dual benefit, improving both metabolic control and long-term health outcomes, representing an important step forward in holistic care for people living with psoriasis.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Implantable device helps stabilize blood pressure in spinal cord injury patients","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250917/Implantable-device-helps-stabilize-blood-pressure-in-spinal-cord-injury-patients.aspx","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 03:17:00 GMT","

Getting out of bed in the morning without the risk of passing out is a game-changer for 32-year-old Cody Krebs.

In 2022 Krebs experienced a severe spinal cord injury (SCI) in a motor vehicle accident. Since that time, Krebs requires the use of a wheelchair. The damage to his spinal cord means his brain can no longer control blood pressure in his body. He was vulnerable to blood pressure drops where he was at risk of losing consciousness, and spikes placing him at risk of a heart attack and stroke. However, an international clinical trial led by teams at the University of Calgary, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), and University of Lausanne (UNIL), in Switzerland, and Sint Maartenskliniek, Radboudumc, in the Netherlands has given him control again. 

""Before the accident, I had no idea how volatile blood pressure can be. Just transferring from my bed to my chair almost knocked me out at times when my blood pressure would drop,"" says Krebs. ""At other times during the day, my blood pressure would spike due to severe nerve pain, causing me to break out in a sweat and experience severe migraines.""

Krebs is part of ongoing research at the University of Calgary based on a major discovery to stabilize blood pressure for people with SCI.

In a rare double publication in both Nature and Nature Medicine, a pair of landmark studies by Dr. Aaron Phillips, PhD, UCalgary, Dr. Grégoire Courtine, PhD, EPFL, and Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, MD, UNIL, describe the development of a targeted therapy to address blood pressure regulation in 14 participants across four clinical studies conducted at three separate medical centers in Canada, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.

The study participants and Krebs now have an implantable system on their spine consisting of a new class of electrode arrays. These arrays connect to a purpose-built pulse generator-similar to a cardiac pacemaker-that delivers finely tuned electrical stimulation, calibrated to each person's needs. The result is a compact, adaptable system capable of restoring blood pressure stability through targeted neuromodulation that can be controlled through an app.

Our mechanistic discoveries in Nature were crucial in bridging the gap from foundational neuronal mapping to clinical application. This synergy is what allowed us to move so quickly from theory to therapy. The Nature Medicine study demonstrates several important factors. First, we show that low blood pressure after a spinal cord injury has serious medical consequences that must not be clinically ignored. Second, we show that our neuromodulation therapy for blood pressure instability after SCI can be deployed effectively in diverse clinical settings, at several centers in different countries with different medical protocols.""

Dr. Aaron Phillips, PhD, director of the RESTORE Network and associate professor at the Cumming School of Medicine

Phillips adds the Nature paper also showed that long-term use of the therapy treats not only the low blood pressure occurring after SCI but also prevents the development of life-threatening spikes in blood pressure.

""In the Nature study we were able to identify the entire neuronal architecture of the spinal cord that is responsible for uncontrolled, life-threatening elevations of blood pressure, called autonomic dysreflexia. We also showed that spinal cord stimulation can compete with this neuronal architecture to safely and precisely regulate blood pressure,"" says Courtine, director of NeuroRestore Center and professor at EPFL.

The results were consistent in study participants across all sites: once activated, the system restored blood pressure to a functional range, often within minutes.

""Based on our experiences with this novel treatment, participants report experiencing less brain fog, having more energy, being able to speak louder, and suffering less from a postprandial dip. In addition, once the surgery was performed by neurosurgeon Erkan Kurt at Radboudumc, this system proved relatively easy to use in their home environment,"" says Dr. Ilse van Nes, MD, PhD, who successfully deployed the system at the rehabilitation center Sint Maartenskliniek in Nijmegen, Netherlands.

""The international deployment shows that the surgery and therapy are safe and effective regardless of local practices. It's a key milestone toward making this technology widely available,"" says Bloch, neurosurgeon at Lausanne University Hospital.

While much of the focus in SCI care has been on restoring movement, a majority of patients live with chronic hypotension, a condition that leaves them exhausted, cognitively dulled, prone to fainting, and predisposes to cardiovascular disease over the long-term.

""The implanted devices have a robust safety profile, as they are commonly implanted in the treatment of various pain disorders,"" says Dr. Fady Girgis, MD, neurosurgeon at the Foothills Medical Centre. ""Therefore, it's an easy transition to implant them for this novel indication. We've seen very impressive and immediate improvements in blood pressure that are evident as soon as the device is turned on intra-operatively.""

Krebs says he's proud to be in a clinical trial advancing discoveries in this field. ""It feels good to be able to boost my blood pressure when I need to, I have more energy and am thinking more clearly. Also, there are fewer dangerous spikes in my blood pressure. I am very grateful for all the research being done.""

The implantable neurostimulation system evaluated in these studies was developed by ONWARD Medical. ONWARD Medical has recently received FDA approval to initiate a pivotal trial of this therapy, which is expected to involve approximately 20 leading neurorehabilitation and neurosurgical research centers across Canada, Europe and the United States.

A Swedish-led research team at Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital has shown in a new randomized clinical trial that a low dose of the well-known medicine aspirin halves the risk of recurrence after surgery in patients with colon and rectal cancer with a certain type of genetic alteration in the tumor.

Every year, nearly two million people worldwide are diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Between 20 and 40 percent develop metastases, which makes the disease both more difficult to treat and more deadly.

Previous observational studies have suggested that aspirin may reduce the risk of certain cancers and possibly also the risk of recurrence after surgery in patients with colorectal cancer harboring mutations in genes within the PIK3 signaling pathway.

These genes regulate key cellular processes such as growth and division. When mutated, these processes can become dysregulated, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer development. However, prior findings have been inconsistent and no randomized clinical trials had previously confirmed the association. To address this gap, the ALASCCA trial was initiated and has now been published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The current study included more than 3,500 patients with colon and rectal cancer from 33 hospitals in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. Patients whose tumors showed a specific genetic mutation in the PIK3 signaling pathway-a mutation found in approximately 40 percent of patients-were randomized to receive either 160 mg of aspirin daily or a placebo for three years after surgery.

For patients with the genetic mutation in PIK3, the risk of recurrence was reduced by 55 percent in those who received aspirin compared with the placebo group.

""Aspirin is being tested here in a completely new context as a precision medicine treatment. This is a clear example of how we can use genetic information to personalize treatment and at the same time save both resources and suffering,"" says first author Anna Martling, professor at the Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, and senior consultant surgeon at Karolinska University Hospital.

So how does aspirin reduce the risk of recurrence of colon and rectal cancer? The researchers believe that the effect is likely due to aspirin acting through several parallel mechanisms – it reduces inflammation, inhibits platelet function and tumor growth. This combination makes the environment less favorable for cancer.

Although we do not yet fully understand all the molecular links, the findings strongly support the biological rationale and suggest that the treatment may be particularly effective in genetically defined subgroups of patients.""

Anna Martling, Professor, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet

The researchers believe that the results could have global significance and influence treatment guidelines for colon and rectal cancer worldwide. Anna Martling sees the fact that the drug is well established as a major advantage.

""Aspirin is a drug that is readily available globally and extremely inexpensive compared to many modern cancer drugs, which is very positive,"" says Anna Martling.

The study was funded in part by the Swedish Research Council and the Swedish Cancer Society.

GaGe high-performance digitizers are transforming neurological diagnostics and brain research by delivering the speed and accuracy required for sophisticated brain imaging and neurological research. In focused ultrasound therapies, these devices enable instantaneous tracking to open the blood-brain barrier for safe and precise drug delivery.

Moreover, their ultrafast data acquisition supports EEG, MEG, and brain-computer interface applications, delivering precise signal capture for diagnostics and therapeutic development. GaGe technology provides more detailed insights into both brain function and next-generation neurotherapies.

Challenge: This paper examines the use of cavitating micro-bubbles to breach the Blood-Brain Barrier, which typically prevents the brain from absorbing medication. A high-power focused ultrasound transducer aimed at the brain was employed to induce cavitation in microbubbles injected into the bloodstream.

Tracking a Passive Cavitation Detector (PCD) in contact with the brain to generate spectrograms has been demonstrated to be a robust method to detect and characterize cavitation in mice brains. This study investigates usage of such a PCD to detect cavitation in monkey brains, where detection is more difficult due to their thicker skulls.

How the GaGe digitizer was used: A GaGe Digitizer was employed to measure the electrical field induced by the TMS coils. The digitizer recorded the voltage variations acquired by a dipole probe in the head model, allowing for computation of electrical field strength and distribution.

This paper examines the use of cavitating micro-bubbles to breach the Blood-Brain Barrier and aid absorption of medication by the brain.

Challenge: The objective was to induce cavitation in microbubbles injected into the bloodstream. This induction was achieved by aiming a high-power focused ultrasound transducer at the brain.

How GaGe digitizers were used: The amplitude of the focused transducer's excitation was monitored by a Gage CompuScope digitizer. The resulting CompuScope data was used to estimate absolute ultrasonic pressure, enabling analysis of its effect on microbubble cavitation within mouse brains.

Challenge: Neuroimmunomodulation is a drug-free treatment that uses high-power focused ultrasound to irradiate the brain. The treatment can be effective for neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's.

The underlying mechanism of the treatment is not well understood. This paper experimentally compared three separate proposed mechanisms in mice brains. The irradiating high-power focused ultrasonic transducer contained a smaller low-power transducer used to align the focused transducer and to track ultrasonic activity in the brain in some applications.

How GaGe digitizers were used: Measurements of infrared light absorption and scattering can provide insight, for instance, on blood oxygenation and tissue composition. A Gage digitizer was utilized to track signals from two photodetectors – one measuring raw laser power and the other connected to the signal from the infrared interferometer containing the sample. The Gage waveform data was subsequently utilized to determine final infrared absorption and scattering measurements.

In medical and brain research, studying tissues at the molecular level without damaging the samples is critical. Conventional approaches can be rough and do not always provide a clear picture.

Challenge: Examining brain tissue at the molecular level is crucial for advancing medical research, but conventional mass spectrometry approaches may damage fragile samples and lack the detailed images required for 3D analysis.

How GaGe digitizers were used: Through the combination of high-speed laser pulses with an ultrafast GaGe Digitizer, the research team developed a robust, novel imaging method. This system gently eliminates and evaluates small layers of brain tissue, with precise, real-time signal capture, producing non-destructive, high-resolution 3D images that expose the structure and chemical makeup of brain samples. This approach lays the foundation for improved diagnostics and brain research.

This study is related to developments in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a method utilized in neuroscience and neurology for non-invasive brain stimulation. TMS is commonly employed in research and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Challenge: Conventional TMS coils, such as the figure-8 coil, have constraints in stimulating deep brain regions without causing undesired cortical stimulation. This limits TMS efficacy for treating conditions involving deeper brain structures.

How the GaGe digitizer was used: A GaGe Digitizer measured the electrical field induced by the TMS coils. The digitizer captured the voltage differences recorded by a dipole probe in the head model, allowing calculation of electrical field strength and distribution.

A novel targeted radiation approach for a rare form of malignant tumor-the solitary fibrous tumor (SFT)-has shown significant success, achieving a near-complete response in three patients. The therapy significantly reduced cancer activity and provided symptom relief, underscoring its potential as a viable treatment option. This research was published in the September issue of The Journal of Nuclear Medicine.

SFT is a rare type of soft tissue tumor with few treatment options available. Although most SFTs are classified as benign with minimal risk of recurrence, about 15 to 20 percent are malignant, and those considered benign have the potential for malignant transformation. For patients with malignant disease, treatment options are scarce, and outcomes are often poor.

In several sarcomas, particularly SFT, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is highly expressed on the surface of tumor cells and surrounding fibroblasts. We sought to deliver radiation therapy directly to the FAP target with the novel radioligand therapy, 90Y-FAPI-46.""

Helena Lanzafame, MD, researcher, Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Essen, Germany

The study included three patients who had already tried multiple standard therapies without success. Molecular analysis of their tumor tissues revealed remarkably high levels of the FAP protein, confirmed with advanced FAPI-46 PET imaging. Patients received four cycles of 90Y-FAPI-46 therapy and their treatment response was evaluated with 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT.

Imaging revealed that all patients experienced tumor shrinkage or disease stabilization, as well as significant relief from symptoms, such as severe fatigue and abdominal pain. In addition, no serious side effects were observed among the patients.

""This is the first time we have seen such strong and deep responses in advanced SFT using this precision radiation approach,"" noted Rainer Hamacher, MD, lead oncologist in the Department of Medical Oncology, Sarcoma Center, West German Cancer Center at University Hospital Essen. ""Our findings suggest that screening for FAP expression could help identify patients most likely to benefit from this novel therapy.""

The team emphasizes that these are early results from a small number of carefully selected patients. Larger prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm the therapy s safety and effectiveness, and to understand how best to integrate it into existing treatment strategies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Psoriasis linked to higher risk of age-related macular degeneration","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250917/Psoriasis-linked-to-higher-risk-of-age-related-macular-degeneration.aspx","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 02:52:00 GMT","

New research presented today at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress 2025 reveals that people with psoriasis face a significantly increased risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss.

Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease with multiple comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This study is among the largest to date investigating whether psoriasis also predisposes individuals to AMD, an eye disease affecting millions worldwide.

Dr. Alison Treichel and her team conducted a 15-year retrospective cohort study using data from the US TriNetX collaborative network. The study included 22,901 patients over the age of 55 with psoriasis and compared their outcomes with three propensity-matched control groups: individuals with melanocytic nevi (MN) to represent other dermatology patients; patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) to account for chronic disease and healthcare use; and patients who had undergone an ophthalmologic exam to ensure comparable opportunities for AMD diagnosis. Individuals with a prior diagnosis of AMD were excluded.

In a separate analysis, psoriasis patients treated with biologics were compared to those treated with topical corticosteroids who had not received biologics before or during the follow-up period.

Over the 10-year follow up period, people with psoriasis had a higher likelihood of developing AMD compared with patients in the MDD and MN cohorts, with a 56% and 21% increased risk, respectively. Looking at the two main forms of AMD – exudative (wet) and non-exudative (dry) – psoriasis was associated with a 40% and 13% higher risk, respectively, compared with the MDD cohort.

Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disease in which lipid dysregulation contributes to cardiovascular disease. Because abnormal lipid deposition in the retina is a hallmark of age-related macular degeneration, particularly the dry form that causes progressive vision loss, it is biologically plausible that psoriasis could increase AMD risk. Our study is the first to demonstrate a novel association between psoriasis and non-exudative (dry) AMD and serves as a hypothesis generating observation for future studies""

Dr. Alison Treichel

Notably, psoriasis patients treated with biologic therapies had a 27% lower risk of developing AMD compared with biologic-naïve patients treated with topical corticosteroids only.

""Our findings support a connection between psoriasis and AMD, both exudative and non-exudative, which could be mediated by shared lipid dysregulation,"" Dr. Treichel explained. ""They also suggest that biologic therapies could offer protective benefits beyond skin symptoms. Further research is needed to determine whether these treatments have a true disease-modifying effect and to better understand the role of shared risk factors, including smoking, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and access to specialist care.""

Dr. Treichel emphasised that individuals with psoriasis should remain vigilant. ""Patients with psoriasis should continue to follow standard eye exam guidelines and promptly report any changes in their vision to their healthcare providers. More research is needed before specific screening recommendations can be made.""

Looking ahead, the research team plans to build on these findings by analysing retinal imaging data from psoriasis patients to better characterise ocular abnormalities, define the prevalence of AMD, and evaluate the long-term effects of biologic therapy on disease progression.

The acoustic startle response is an unconditional reflex manifested as a rapid contraction of facial and skeletal muscles in response to a sudden and intense startling stimulus.

Translational research, in particular, benefits from the study of the acoustic startle response because this response is consistent across a range of different species. The acoustic startle response also uses neural circuitry, which is simple in nature while being sensitive to a range of experimental manipulations.

The rodent acoustic startle response is widely employed in the study of the central nervous system's intrinsic properties, including fear and anxiety, sensitization, habituation, classical conditioning, sensorimotor gating, and drug effects.

Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is an important phenomenon used to model sensorimotor gating. PPI involves the suppression of the startle response when a weak pre-stimulus is applied prior to a strong startling stimulus.

Sensorimotor gating issues are key elements of a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, OCD, and Huntington's disease. PPI of the rodent acoustic startle response is, therefore, at the forefront of research into these disorders' genetics, pathophysiology, and pharmacology.

The acoustic startle response in rodents is extremely brief, making this difficult to assess. In order to address this challenge, rodent acoustic startle response is often monitored in stabilimeter chambers, which limit animal movement. This is stressful and unpleasant for animals; however, it necessitates extensive calming and habituation.

The acoustic startle response manifests as an exaggerated flinching response to an unanticipated strong auditory stimulus (pre-pulse). It may be possible to weaken this response via a preceding weaker stimulus (pre-pulse). This is the primary underlying pre-pulse inhibition (PPI).

PPI has been documented in a range of species, including mice and humans, affording researchers a useful means of operationally measuring sensorimotor gating and determining an animal's ability to successfully integrate and prevent sensory information.

San Diego Instruments' SR-LAB acoustic startle response system is the most widely used startle reflex research system designed to quantify PPI, fear-potentiated startle (FPS), and acoustic startle response.

The SR-LAB is a holistic software and hardware solution designed to accommodate a wide range of acoustic startle response applications. For high-throughput applications, as many as 16 stations are available.

The SR-LAB acoustic startle response software controls a diverse array of tone, noise burst, light, foot shock, air puff, and background noise combinations. It can also support various test paradigms without requiring additional software.

The SR-LAB system can easily accommodate the most prevalent test paradigms via a single software program, making it more cost-effective than similar systems.

Users can design customized paradigms as required, and data is easily verifiable because each response allows users to confirm numeric data by reviewing the entire waveform.

The SR-LABS's tubular enclosures allow animals to turn without constraint, removing the restraint stress that often significantly impacts acoustic startle response test results. The tubular design also ensures that animals are kept over the sensor, ensuring reliable results.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (Sept. 17, 2025) – Alright, alright, alright.

It might seem trite to quote actor, renowned Texan and Austin FC minority owner Matthew McConaughey when his club comes out on top, but the latest result for the Major League Soccer side was more than a win.

This win was historic.

Austin FC edged out Minnesota United FC 2-1 in dramatic fashion in the Semifinal of the 2025 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup at MNUFC's home stadium of Allianz Field in St. Paul on Wednesday night with a remarkable game-winning goal in the 120th minute.

And the implications for the expansion club that entered MLS in 2021 are more than just alright. The victory continues the longest Open Cup run in Austin FC's five-year history and means Los Verdes will host the tournament's Final in two weeks on Oct. 1.

“It's a special moment,” said Austin FC head coach Nico Estévez. “[It means] everything. For everyone that works for the club – for every player, every staff member, the fans, all the families – it's an important moment for the history of the club.”The goal that made all that possible arrived at the very death of an intense match that was level at 1-1 for nearly an hour. With both teams briefly finding flashes in 30 minutes of extra time, a penalty kick shootout felt inevitable to determine which of the MLS Western Conference clubs would advance to the Final of this country's most historic competition.

Then, Austin FC saw a glimmer of promise. As the seconds ticked down, Los Verdes moved deep into the attacking third. Midfielder Jon Gallagher brought a ball down with his chest then, on a bounce, he lifted a cross into the box. Myrto Uzuni's initial header on the other end was brisk and forced Minnesota goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair to make an instinctive block. But the Minnesota defenders didn't account for the short rebound – nor CJ Fodrey lingering nearby inside the six-yard box, primed and ready to play the role of unlikely hero. Fodrey handled the rebound with a measured kick and slammed a shot into the back of the net.

The finish at the 119:51 mark was the latest goal in Austin FC history. And it's not the only game-winner that Fodrey has scored in his budding career. On Sept. 7, the 21-year-old forward decided another Austin match when he flicked in a header from an Owen Wolff corner kick. That day, Austin FC defeated Sporting Kansas City in MLS play, also 2-1.

In the span of just 10 days, Fodrey scored his first MLS goal and his first Open Cup goal.

“He's a great, great kid,” said Coach Estévez. “He works hard. He wants to improve. He wants to get better. He has that physicality, that speed. He also has the willingness to run into the box, to have a presence in the box and to score goals. He's been working really hard the whole year, and now every day of training is paying off for him.”

The date with Nashville SC on Oct. 1 will be the first major final for Austin FC. Since joining MLS five years ago, the club has not had many chances to compete for trophies. Three out of four times, the Austin side has failed to reach the MLS Cup Playoffs. Last season, they missed out on a Wild Card spot, finishing 10th in the Western Conference with an 11-14-9 record. The year before that, El Tree finished 12th.

“We're a very young team. Lately, we haven't had these experiences,” Estévez said. “We're coming from a difficult season also with ups and downs. To have the opportunity to play a final this year is huge.”

The group is determined to write a different story in 2025. Austin FC is steadily climbing the MLS standings. They entered Wednesday's contest ranked No. 7 in the conference, five spots below Minnesota at No. 2. Entering the final month of MLS' regular season, Austin has already equaled the club's win total from a year ago and will have a chance to stay competitive for a playoff spot down the stretch heading into Decision Day.

Before that, the club has a chance to win some silverware on home turf. The Semifinal win secured home field advantage over fellow Final Four winner Nashville SC, who took care of business against Philadelphia Union on Sept. 16.

As Austin looks to stymie Nashville's lethal goal scorer and MLS Golden Boot leader Sam Surridge, the club will do so in front of the Verde & Black faithful at Q2 Stadium.

While the Semifinal win is a special moment worth celebrating, it's not all fun and games for the Austin FC players. As goalkeeper Brad Stuver, a hero through this rare U.S. Open Cup Final run, reiterated leaving the locker at Allianz Field, there's more history to be made.

“The job is not finished,” he said.

By Sebastian Quiroz-Gutierrez – @SebastianQuir0z

When the San Diego Wave announced the retirement of Alex Morgan's No. 13 jersey, it marked another milestone for one of the most iconic players in U.S. women's soccer. Morgan joins a small but significant group of NWSL players who have been honored with jersey retirements — tributes that recognize their impact at the professional level. But before these stars became household names, they each built a foundation at the college level. College Soccer News takes a look back at their collegiate accomplishments — a reminder of how college soccer continues to shape the future of the game. 

At the University of California, Berkeley, Alex Morgan consistently delivered as the Golden Bears' top scorer, finishing her career tied for third all-time in goals (45) and third in points (107). A four-time All-Pac-10 selection, she earned First Team All-American honors in 2010, was a two-time Hermann Trophy semifinalist, and became the first Cal player to be named a top-three finalist. Morgan was also a Honda Award finalist, led the Bears in scoring each season, and guided them to the NCAA Tournament all four years. She graduated early with a degree in political economy while earning Pac-10 All-Academic honors. 

Few players made a quicker impression at the University of Portland than Megan Rapinoe, who helped the Pilots capture the 2005 NCAA Championship during her freshman season. She went on to record 30 goals and 28 assists in just 50 matches, earning recognition as the 2005 Soccer Times National Freshman of the Year, a two-time First Team All-American, and the 2008 WCC Player of the Year. 

Rapinoe was also a three-time All-Region pick and capped her career as the 2009 University of Portland Female Student-Athlete of the Year. 

At UCLA, Lauren Holiday (then Cheney) put together one of the most accomplished careers in program history. She remains the Bruins' all-time leader in goals (71) and points (173), earning four straight First Team All-America selections and four consecutive First Team All-Pac-10 honors. A two-time Hermann Trophy finalist and the 2007 U.S. Soccer Young Female Athlete of the Year, Holiday was instrumental in leading UCLA to four consecutive College Cup appearances, cementing her place among the elite in college soccer. 

Leslie Osborne was a standout player for the Santa Clara Broncos from 2001 to 2004, helping them secure the 2001 NCAA Championship as a freshman. She was a three-time All-American and the 2004 Honda Sports Award winner as the nation's top player. Osborne still ranks sixth in goals (44) and ninth in assists (33) on Santa Clara's career charts, and she twice earned WCC Player of the Year honors (2003 and 2004) while also being recognized as the league's Defender of the Year as a senior. 

At the University of North Carolina, Lori Chalupny developed into one of the most reliable midfielders of her era. She tallied 30 goals and 32 assists over her career, starting 82 of 89 matches. A two-time First Team NSCAA All-American and three-time First Team All-ACC pick, Chalupny was the 2005 ACC Tournament MVP and played a vital role in UNC's run to the 2003 NCAA Championship and a perfect 27-0-0 record. She closed her Tar Heel career by leading the program to a 23-1-1 finish in 2005, showcasing her consistency and leadership on the nation's biggest stage. 

Joanna Lohman distinguished herself at Penn State both on the field and in the classroom. A three-time NSCAA All-American and four-time First Team All-Big Ten selection, she was the 2000 Big Ten Freshman of the Year and the 2003 Big Ten Player of the Year. Lohman was a two-time finalist for both the Hermann Trophy and Honda Sports Award, underscoring her place among the nation's elite. She also excelled academically, earning First Team Academic All-America honors and graduating with a 3.98 GPA, while helping Penn State capture four straight Big Ten titles. 

From Berkeley to Portland, UCLA to Penn State, the accomplishments of Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Lauren Holiday, Leslie Osborne, Lori Chalupny, and Joanna Lohman underscore the pivotal role college soccer plays in developing the stars of the professional game. Their jersey retirements in the NWSL celebrate careers that inspired countless fans, but each of those journeys was rooted in the college game. It's a reminder that the college pathway remains a vital bridge to professional women's soccer.

Ricardo Pepi speaks about returning to PSV's starting XI after their 5-3 win over NEC Nijmegen. (2:09)

The September international window has now concluded, and as such, players from the U.S. men's national team have headed back to their clubs. Now the sprint to hit top form ahead of October's window can begin.

For some players, that means making the most of a change of clubs. For others, it's about solidifying their spots in the starting lineup. Then there are those who are on the outside looking in, trying to do anything they can to get steady playing time.

Regardless of which camp they fall into, the past week has proven eventful for several USMNT players.

Throughout the season, ESPN will be monitoring the progress of the U.S. player pool, delivering insights into those whose form or fitness has made them particularly intriguing. We call it the USMNT's countdown to the World Cup.

ESPN will count down to June 11 every week so that way, when the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise.

Welcome to the USMNT's countdown to the World Cup. Only 267 days to go.

It was a week of highs and lows for Pepi. On Saturday, he made his long-awaited return to the PSV starting lineup and made the most of his chance, scoring goals either side of halftime -- one with his right foot, another with his head -- to lead PSV to a 5-3 victory over NEC Nijmegen. On Tuesday against Union Saint-Gilloise in the UEFA Champions League, he conceded a penalty in a 3-1 defeat.

In terms of the bigger picture, at least Pepi is now reestablishing himself in the starting XI. That will need to continue given how the competition for the starting forward spot had heated up thanks to Folarin Balogun's performance during the September international window. The coming weeks will be about establishing consistency ahead of the October international window.

Much of the buzz at the end of September window was about the performance of Alejandro Zendejas and how his goal against Japan had seen him make a play for more playing time, possibly at the expense of Weah. So what did Weah do? He merely went out and scored against Real Madrid, at the Estadio Bernabeu no less, with his clever run allowing teammate Mason Greenwood to put Weah in the clear and fire home past Thibaut Courtois.

It was Weah's first goal for his new club after arriving from Juventus over the summer, and while OM ultimately fell 2-1, Weah showed he's not going to give up his spot in the USMNT starting lineup without a fight.

Reyna made his official debut for Gladbach last weekend. For the team, it was a match to forget, as Werder Bremen handed the Foals a heavy 4-0 home defeat, one that cost manager Gerardo Seoane his job. For Reyna personally, his 74-minute stint had some positive vibes to it.

While he completed only 21 of 31 passes, he was involved in Gladbach's best moves and should have had an assist when he created an opening for Robin Hack, who missed the target from 12 yards. Reyna even had a team-high seven ball recoveries. Reyna will no doubt have preferred a better team performance, but for him it's a start, one that he'll be hoping to build on, even with a new manager in charge.

Among the storylines emerging from the international window for the USMNT was the deployment of the three-man backline. It's a formation that suits the personnel in a lot of ways.

Defensively, it provides a bit more cover for outside backs Sergiño Dest and Max Arfsten, the better for them to play to their strengths in the attacking half. There's less space for Ream to have to cover. Who takes the third center back spot is a coin flip at the moment between Mark McKenzie and Cameron Carter-Vickers. Do you take the player who plays in a top-five league, even though his form has faded a bit in recent weeks, or a player on the dominant team in Scotland? I'll go with McKenzie for now, given his ceiling is higher.

As such, this week's in-form XI uses that formation.

Arfsten's inclusion is down to two factors. One, he excelled in that role during the September window, assisting on Zendejas' goal, and he plays in that position for his club, the Columbus Crew. The other is that Antonee Robinson continues to be brought along slowly at Fulham. He was an unused substitute in last weekend's 1-0 win over Leeds United. There's little doubt that Robinson will reclaim his spot once his fitness improves. He certainly has the attacking chops in terms of delivery from the wing to excel as a wingback. Until then, though, Arfsten gets the nod.

The goalkeeper position continues to bear watching. Matt Turner's form has dipped a bit -- his goals prevented per 90 minutes has sunk to -0.2 -- following the New Club Bounce that occurred upon his return to the New England Revolution. And given Matt Freese's solid showing during the recent international window, as well as with New York City FC, he's in this week's in-form XI.

Probably the biggest question mark is who plays alongside Tyler Adams in the center of midfield. You can count Johnny Cardoso, Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris and Cristian Roldan among the candidates. Tessmann is getting the most playing time in a top-five league, so he keeps his place for now.

ESPN's USMNT Big Board 2.0 went live earlier this month, and each Big Board will provide the foundation for weekly player updates. Below are the minutes and player ratings for each of those 37 players.

Matt Turner, goalkeeper, New England Revolution: 540 minutes in 2025; 7.0 FotMob rating in 2025.

Matt Freese, goalkeeper, New York City FC: 2,520 minutes in 2025; 7.1 FotMob rating in 2025.

Zack Steffen, goalkeeper, Colorado Rapids: 2,070 minutes in 2025; 7.0 FotMob rating in 2025.

Patrick Schulte, goalkeeper, Columbus Crew: 2,250 minutes in 2025; 6.8 FotMob rating in 2025.

Chris Richards, center back, Crystal Palace: 569 minutes in 2025-26; 7.2 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Tim Ream, center back, Charlotte FC: 2,072 minutes in 2025; 6.6 FotMob rating in 2025.

Ream continues to turn back the clock with his performances for Charlotte. The Crown have won nine games in a row, conceding just four goals in that time, with Ream completing 93.1% of his passes and winning 60% of his duels in that span.

Mark McKenzie, center back, Toulouse: 360 minutes in 2025-26; 6.7 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Antonee Robinson, fullback, Fulham: 51 minutes in 2025-26; 6.2 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Joe Scally, fullback, Borussia Mönchengladbach: 265 minutes in 2025-26; 7.2 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Caleb Wiley, fullback, Watford: 0 minutes in 2025-26; 0.0 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

The on-loan Chelsea defender has reportedly been dealing with back and adductor injuries, but returned to partial training last week. The hope is that he can return to first-team action with Watford soon.

Max Arfsten, fullback, Columbus Crew: 2,502 minutes in 2025; 7.5 FotMob rating in 2025.

Alex Freeman, fullback, Orlando City SC: 2,712 minutes in 2025; 7.5 FotMob rating in 2025.

Weston McKennie, midfielder, Juventus: 141 minutes in 2025-26; 6.7 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Count McKennie as the latest USMNT player to log minutes as a wingback, joining the likes of Musah and Weah who have been deployed in that spot recently. It's not McKennie's preferred position, but it just might be the path forward for him to not only get consistent playing time with Juve, but also secure a call-up in October with the USMNT.

Johnny Cardoso, midfielder, Atlético Madrid: 185 minutes in 2025-26; 6.8 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Luca de la Torre, midfielder, San Diego FC: 2,237 minutes in 2025; 6.8 FotMob rating in 2025.

Tanner Tessmann, midfielder, Lyon: 360 minutes in 2025-26; 7.3 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Yunus Musah, midfielder, Atalanta: 203 minutes in 2025-26; 6.3 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Following Musah's late move to Atalanta, he made his debut in a 4-1 win over Lecce, not only logging 14 minutes, but also doing so in his preferred central midfield role. He went 75 minutes in the 4-0 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday.

Frank Leboeuf praises PSG's performance vs. Atalanta after an emphatic 4-0 win in the Champions League.

Sebastian Berhalter, midfielder, Vancouver Whitecaps: 2,650 minutes in 2025; 7.5 FotMob rating in 2025.

Cristian Roldan, midfielder, Seattle Sounders FC: 3,335 minutes in 2025; 7.5 FotMob rating in 2025.

Christian Pulisic, attacker, AC Milan: 194 minutes in 2025-26; 7.6 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Tim Weah, attacker, Marseille: 319 minutes in 2025-26; 6.9 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Malik Tillman, attacker, Bayer Leverkusen: 123 minutes in 2025-26; 7.4 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Alejandro Zendejas, attacker, América: 641 minutes in 2025-26; 7.3 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Giovanni Reyna, attacker, Borussia Mönchengladbach: 74 minutes in 2025-26; 7.0 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Folarin Balogun, forward, AS Monaco: 243 minutes in 2025-26; 7.2 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Ricardo Pepi, forward, PSV Eindhoven: 216 minutes in 2025-26; 7.2 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Patrick Agyemang, forward, Derby County: 21 minutes in 2025-26; 7.0 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Haji Wright, forward, Coventry City: 456 minutes in 2025-26; 7.7 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Wright's late equalizer against Norwich City didn't necessarily dazzle the eye, but his tap-in from two yards earned the Sky Blues a point, and saw the U.S. forward join Sargent atop the goal-scoring charts in the English Championship.

Bundesliga

Within a few hours of Borussia Monchengladbach's 4-0 loss to Werder Bremen on Sunday, a compilation of Gio Reyna's debut at his new club was up on the internet and flying around the U.S. men's national team fan communities.

Never mind that the result got Gladbach's manager fired. Reyna was back on the field, played 74 minutes and created one chance in the game, with an outing that was … fine. Fans tweeted the video around, calling Reyna “levels above this team” and saying he was “still the most offensively creative midfielder in the pool.”

Advertisement

The reaction is indicative of the sentiment around a player many believed to be one of the most talented American prospects ever. Six years after debuting in the Bundesliga, across a World Cup controversy and numerous injuries that have mostly kept him on the sideline, there is still belief — hope — that Reyna will be what so many thought he would be when he broke out with four goals and five assists in 2020-21.

That hope lives in Reyna, too.

“I believe I'll be there (at the 2026 World Cup),” Reyna told BILD. “That was one of the reasons for my move. I'm in open contact with the coach. If I play well at Borussia, I'll definitely find my way back to the national team.”

Reyna is still just 22 now, hardly over the hill. But with a total of just 2,925 minutes across all competitions with his club team since 2021-22 — an average of 731.25 per season — Reyna faces a historically steep climb back into form and fitness after moving from Dortmund to Gladbach this summer.

In the last 15 seasons, just four players have had a season with nine or more combined goals and assists in Europe's top five leagues, then played four straight seasons in the top five leagues without reaching 1,000 minutes in any of them – and then had nine or more goals-plus-assists again in a top-five league, per TruMedia's Albert Larcada and Paul Carr.

Three of those players were at least 30 at the end of those stretches: Olivier Giroud, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Corentin Tolisso.

Just one, Kelechi Iheanacho, compares both statistically and age-wise. Iheanacho was, like Reyna, considered a top young prospect as an 18-year-old when he had eight goals and one assist for Manchester City in league play in 2015-16. He totaled 5,570 minutes over the next four seasons – almost double what Reyna managed in the past four campaigns – and had 25 goals and assists total in that time, before breaking out as a 24-year-old at Leicester City in 2020-21 with 14 combined goals and assists.

The road back may be even tougher for Reyna, in part because Iheanacho is not a perfect comparison.

The Nigerian striker did not suffer anywhere near the same sort of injury history that has limited Reyna. He missed just 10 days due to injury in those four seasons, per Transfermarkt, and was mostly the victim of circumstance. He came up playing in a powerful Manchester City side and then tried to fit into a Leicester team with Jamie Vardy. It wasn't until Iheanacho was moved into a second striker role that he started to thrive again in the Premier League.

Reyna, meanwhile, has been sidelined by multiple hamstring injuries and surgeries, as well as a fractured leg and groin injury. Per Transfermarkt, Reyna missed 492 days from 2021-22 through the end of last season due to various injuries and ailments.

So while Reyna remains an intriguing prospect — a player who can pick a pass and create a moment of brilliance during key moments in a game — he faces an uphill battle to get back to the type of form where he can show that on a weekly basis.

The concern is that Reyna's age doesn't tell the true story of his legs. Data backs that up. Reyna's max speed, measured by the fastest sprints averaged out across five games, ranked last among all qualified Bundesliga attacking midfielders and eighth-to-last among all outfield players last season, per ESPN. Reyna also sprinted fewer times than all but six central midfielders in the Bundesliga.

Reyna isn't a player dependent on his speed or athleticism, but the game still has certain demands on players. The question is whether Reyna's body will allow him to meet those demands. Over the past four years, the answer has been a resounding ‘no.'

“I'm a big fan of him, but his injuries have really hurt his progression and his ceiling and his potential of where he's going to go,” U.S. men's national team legend Clint Dempsey said during an event with Men in Blazers earlier this month. “You don't know if it's a situation where is it the fight, or is his body holding him back from winning that starting position and playing week-in and week-out? I would like to see him get fit. I would hope that this is a new chapter for him.”

Reyna's talent has kept him on the fringes of the national team pool, always lurking if he can get fit. But after he was summoned for the March Concacaf Nations League camp, U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino said Reyna wasn't “ready to play in the way that we expect from him, to perform.”

“The most important thing is how he is showing now in every single training session and spending time with us,” Pochettino said. “Because I think he's not maybe at his best, but he's here [for the staff] to try to know him and from here to help him to arrive at his best. That is the reality.”

What Pochettino has conceded, though, is exactly what fans wrote on social media after Reyna's Gladbach debut: Reyna has a skillset that is unique in the U.S. player pool. And if he can get right in time for the World Cup, that skillset should be enough to put him on the roster.

But the last four years have shown that it's a big ‘if.' And Reyna needs to prove that skillset is still at the level it was five years ago.

Reyna will get his next chance to show his progress this weekend, and he'll face off directly against the player who has stepped up in his absence. Malik Tillman was the standout of this summer's Gold Cup squad and is now the presumed starting central midfielder for the U.S. — whether the U.S. lines up in a 4-3-3, or in the 3-4-2-1 utilized by Pochettino in September's friendlies.

Tillman is actually six months older than Reyna, though his rise started slightly later. A former Bayern Munich youth talent, the German-American has built his career up over stops at Rangers and PSV before earning a $41 million move to Bayer Leverkusen.

Gladbach will travel to face Tillman and Leverkusen on Sunday — and they'll do so with a new coach.

Among the many X factors determining whether Reyna will fight back into the national team picture, an added challenge is that, after just one game starting in his new team, Gladbach fired coach Gerardo Seoane. American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo is reportedly among the potential candidates to take charge, and Reyna will hope he's a fit for the new manager that does arrive.

Everyone around the U.S. program — from staff to fans and media — will be watching to see how it unfolds, with some tracking every touch, sprint and pass along the way. With three windows left until the pre-World Cup camp, time is running thin for Reyna to be the latest exception to the rule.

The U.S. men's national team dropped a spot in the latest FIFA rankings, which were released on Thursday morning.

The U.S. men's national team dropped a spot in the latest FIFA rankings, which were released on Thursday morning.

The 16th-place Americans remained in second place among Concacaf teams as Mexico, which fell to 14th, still leads the way.

As for the overall leader, with UEFA EURO 2024 winners Spain took over the top spot, a mark the team had not occupied in the men's game since June 2014. In the process, the Spaniards have dethroned long-standing leaders Argentina (3rd, down 2), who had occupied the position since April 2023.

Joining Spain in surpassing the current world champions are the team Argentina beat in the FIFA World Cup 2022™ final, France (2nd, up 1). Slightly further down, Portugal, Croatia and Italy have all edged up one spot, into 5th, 9th and 10th position, respectively, making the most of the setbacks suffered by Brazil (6th, down 1) and Germany (12th, down 3).

For Germany, the damage was done by their away defeat to Slovakia in their opening FIFA World Cup 26 qualifier, and they find themselves languishing outside the top 10 for the first time since October 2024. Morocco (11th, up 1) now lead the chasing pack outside the top 10, having triumphed in eight of their nine matches since the last edition of the ranking in July.

The biggest climbers overall are Slovakia (42nd, up 10), whose reward for kick-starting their World Cup qualifying campaign with two straight wins – including the aforementioned upset of Germany – is a place back among the top 50.

Having all shot at least five places up the standings, The Gambia (115th, up 8), Madagascar (108th, up 7), Paraguay (37th, up 6), Uganda (82nd, up 6), Libya (112th, up 5), Suriname (131st, up 5) and the Faroe Islands (136th, up 5) are the main other movers and shakers.

Two further standout storylines are served up by FIFA World Cup 26 co-hosts Canada (26th, up 2) and UEFA up-and-comers Kosovo (91st, up 4). Having already celebrated all-time highs in previous instalments of the ranking, both continue to break new ground.

The next edition of the men's world ranking will be published on Oct. 23.

Chelsea suffered defeat in their opening Champions League game of the season to Bayern Munich, and one of their rivals from the recent Club World Cup success were keen to add to the misery.

The Blues lost 3-1 in Germany despite Cole Palmer's brilliance, and will now have to look forward to a showdown with Jose Mourinho as their first chance to pick up three points in Europe this season.

It was a display filled with uncharacteristic errors from some of Chelsea's key men, after Enzo Maresca named a very similar side to the one who faced PSG in the Club World Cup final.

There was criticism sent the way of Enzo Fernandez for his display, with Blues supporters calling for Andrey Santos to start against Manchester United.

Despite replicating the system that had decimated PSG in the Club World Cup, there was no luck for Chelsea this time around.

During that competition, the Blues didn't make many friends, and actually formed a bit of an online rivalry  with Flamengo, after their fiercely-contested group stage game.

That one ended 3-1 to the Brazilians, something their official Twitter account made sure they reminded Chelsea of after their defeat by the same scoreline on Wednesday night.

We've seen that one before 👀 https://t.co/2TNXqSzFYq

While Flamengo won the original battle with the Blues, Chelsea very much won the war as they shot back at the Brazilian side after they exited the competition.

Flamengo were the only side to beat Chelsea during the Club World Cup, however the game was overshadowed by a very brief cameo in the second half.

Nicolas Jackson was subbed on during the game, however minutes later was sent off for the second time in four appearances for the Blues.

This proved to be the last meaningful impact he had in a Chelsea shirt before being loaned out to Wednesday's opposition, Bayern.

Despite there being no obligation in the loan to Germany, it looks as if his time at Stamford Bridge has now come to an end.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

When DAZN first emerged on the broadcasting scene, it was portrayed in some sections of the media as ‘Netflix for Sport'.

The comparisons were understandable. DAZN was hellbent on disrupting the archaic world of legacy pay-TV sports television in the same way that Netflix had done with entertainment by offering more affordable, flexible subscriptions on the viewers' device of choice on a global scale.

DAZN eventually distanced itself from such a characterisation, which ignored the fragmented nature of media rights, local preferences, and the technological challenge of delivering live video to millions of viewers around the world watching on multiple device types via varying quality of connections.

Indeed, DAZN is a very different company from what it was a decade ago. Its original vision and pricing structure has evolved significantly to reflect commercial realities and the need to recoup multibillion-dollar outlays on rights. The modern DAZN no longer sees itself as a pure subscription offering but rather a digital sports platform comprising multiple services of which live video is just a single component.

However, advances in connectivity, changing consumer preferences and huge investments in its infrastructure have enabled DAZN to achieve its goal of digitally transmitting live sport to every corner of the globe.

DAZN's international service comprises various properties such as combat sports, motorsports and women's soccer, along with a range of free ad-supported television (FAST) channels and third-party platforms.

While DAZN's premium, localised services in Germany, Italy and Spain are still primarily subscription driven, the platform now offers a wide range of free content in a bid to monetise users through other means and potentially convert them to paying customers in the future.

However, to date, the majority of DAZN's international portfolio has had regional or niche appeal. Which is why it ostensibly spent US$1 billion to acquire the global rights to the 2025 Fifa Club World Cup and promised to stream it around the world for free.

Many questioned the wisdom of paying so much for an unproven competition which had hitherto struggled to generate interest from fans, sponsors and other media organisations, especially when there would be no subscription revenue and the most attractive matches in some markets would be sublicensed to free-to-air (FTA) broadcasters.

Others pointed out that DAZN's expenditure was offset by an equivalent investment from SURJ Sports Investment, a subsidiary of 2034 Fifa World Cup host Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), shortly after.

However, the company clearly saw a rare opportunity to acquire the global rights to a major soccer tournament that would appeal to virtually every market in the world. With all respect to college football, electric powerboating and LIV Golf, none has the universal appeal of a tournament featuring Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Lionel Messi.

This was reflected in Fifa's official viewing figures, which claim the expanded tournament attracted a global audience of 2.7 billion. While detailed data has not been made public and many viewers watched the competition on linear television, the Club World Cup appears to have been a success for DAZN – and a major test for its infrastructure.

Like any other technology leader, DAZN's chief technology officer Sandeep Tiku would have liked more time to prepare for the tournament than the seven months he was given between the contract signing in December 2024 and the opening ceremony in June 2025.

However, he was confident that the highly capable, globally scalable broadcast and delivery platform he had helped build since joining the company in 2022 would be up to the task.

“Over the last three years we've undergone a massive transformation,” Tiku tells SportsPro. “By design, we've built a global platform. We have hundreds of live events every single weekend and throughout the week, so building, managing and maintaining a platform that can handle these peaks in demand at scale across the world is a challenge [that we've met].”

In many markets, including the UK, the Club World Cup was DAZN's coming out party – the moment where a previously niche service suddenly became as mainstream as it has ever been. The tournament was promoted on the sides of buses, through digital marketing campaigns and through its sublicensing deals.

The build-up to the tournament was spent ensuring DAZN's platform was resilient and reliable enough to handle multiple device and connection types and capable of coping with sudden peaks in demand.

“The Club World Cup was a completely different ball game,” Tiku explains. “We are a premium product so nearly all of our subscribers have a decent internet connection and a [capable] device because they pay a certain amount of dollars each month.

“But we were streaming the Club World Cup for free, so all of a sudden we were receiving huge amounts of traffic from 200 countries around the world, at a similar level to Germany or Japan [where DAZN has a fully-fledged local service].

“You have to acquire millions of these customers in hours or minutes because most people register just before the game they want to watch is starting. We knew that for millions of customers this was the first time they had ever used DAZN so we could not get it wrong,”

A post shared by DAZN Football (@daznfootball)

Despite DAZN's desire to use the Club World Cup as a revenue generation tool, it knew the importance of making a first impression and therefore prioritised a high quality, reliable stream over bells and whistles. 

DAZN streamed all 63 matches of the tournament in multiple languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish, with each match subject to more than 20 regional variants. Pictures were transmitted from stadium to the International Broadcast Centre in New York and sent to the DAZN Match Centre in Dallas, Texas, before they were transmitted around the world via DAZN's regional production facilities.

Tests conducted prior to the tournament with Amazon Web Services (AWS) determined DAZN's infrastructure could support 300 million concurrent users, while the company added multiple CDNs to support resiliency. In some locations, where existing CDNs weren't capable enough, DAZN launched its own.

Intelligent algorithms automatically moved viewers to the most appropriate CDN and disabled app features that might consume too much bandwidth.

“I don't think any other broadcaster has done this in the past,” Tiku says. “It's amazing scale. Millions registered before matches and then millions watched the stream. Our customer service team was sat there largely idle because there were only [a handful] of people requesting support.”

Tiku's arrival from Entain, a betting company, is indicative of the culture shift that has taken place at DAZN over the past few years. In addition to launching in-play betting, the company has partnered with Fanatics on ecommerce, acquired in-app sports ticketing marketplace Daimani, and introduced gamification and community features, encouraging fans to spend more time and money within its ecosystem and become active rather than passive consumers of sports content.

One example of this in action is how boxing fans score fights before the judges' decision is announced.

“DAZN has evolved from a traditional broadcast platform into an interactive sports platform,” Tiku explains. “Our fans are participating, they're interacting with the broadcast and being a part of it.

“We can see from our data that a significant percentage of our viewers watch the stream on the big screen but also use the app for Fanzone chat interactions and quizzes. We put the customer at the centre of the action.”

That's not to say DAZN hasn't invested in its core streaming capabilities – far from it. Paying subscribers to DAZN received an enhanced streaming experience during the Club World Cup, including high dynamic range (HDR) picture quality and Dolby 5.1 surround sound.

However, these technological capabilities and diversity of revenue streams mean the company is becoming less reliant on subscriptions and is less exposed to the volatility of the rights market.

The company still maintains large portfolios of premium rights to support its operations in key local markets, but its new ethos means it is happy having content on its platform regardless of whether it requires a subscription or even if it owns it directly. The key objective is to expand the user base as much as possible and by providing a premium offering alongside wide accessibility, DAZN is catering to multiple demographics.

DAZN has bolstered its free tier with new rights deals and has integrated several third-party DTC services, such as the National Football League's (NFL) Game Pass International and the National Hockey League's (NHL) NHL.TV, into its platform.

These properties receive many of the benefits that the Club World Cup has helped to illustrate – DAZN's global reach, its technological investments and its existing billing relationships. Essentially, DAZN takes away the burden and risk of managing a DTC platform whilst maximising its existing user base and billing relationship to, hopefully, expand the audience.

In exchange, DAZN gets more users in its ecosystem, while both benefit from a service layer of interactive features and revenue generating opportunities. The NFL has been the poster child for this type of relationship, with Game Pass growing by 30 per cent since the partnership started in 2023 and has since been replicated with others.

“We've built a highly scalable global platform which means the more we can do with it, our costs keep on reducing,” Tiku explains. “It's plug and play [for the third-party service].”

Immersive experiences are another area DAZN sees value. For the Club World Cup, it created an extended reality application for the US market, allowing fans to watch all 63 matches in a 3D tabletop format. For the latter stages of the tournament, DAZN offered a 180-degree viewing angle to help fans fully immerse themselves in the action by giving them a sideline perspective.

For Tiku, the product was about demonstrating how its platform can provide an entirely new way of watching sport, adding value for both fans and rights holders, as well as the possibility of creating new forms of content without the need to acquire broadcast rights.

For example, optical tracking data, which is widely captured by goal line technology (GLT) and semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) systems can be used to digitally recreate key moments from matches and power other types of data-rich immersive experience.

“We acquire a lot of content, but in some instances we don't [make an acquisition] because it's expensive,” Tiku says. “[Instead] we can acquire the data rights or get [data] from our partners and visualise it like this. Suddenly, there's this new product that doesn't have a massive cost.

“We still need to wait for industry to evolve from a device perspective but we're ready.”

Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is AI where Tiku sees the most potential. With AI models already used to optimise streaming distribution and customer service, the next step will see DAZN deploy intelligent algorithms to personalise the end user experience.

“We're working on personalisation for acquisition, retention and engagement,” Tiku says. “It's going to be massive. Our AI-enabled product will become so personalised that consumers will feel this product is just for them.”

An example of this is content. Tiku envisages a future where users can give DAZN a prompt, such as knockouts by Anthony Joshua, and the app will create a video in response. This, he says, not only ensures DAZN will be able to adjust to changing fan expectations but also give its content a longer shelf life than just the live broadcast.

“In ten or even five years' time, fans are not going to consume sport in the same way people watch sport today,” he says. “Some prefer shorter formats or TikTok style videos and it's easy to create a format like that, but getting the content in the right order so you binge it is the most important thing.

“AI makes it simple, it becomes an enabler, and this is why we're investing heavily.”

FIFA has announced a significant increase in payments to clubs releasing their players for the 2026 World Cup,
totaling €300 million to be shared among qualified clubs.

On September 16, 2025, FIFA officially announced the payment of a record $355 million (€300 million) to clubs involved in the 2026 World Cup, a 70 percent increase compared to the 2022 edition in Qatar.

This sum will be distributed among all clubs that released players for the competition, as well as for the qualifying
matches, which is a major innovation in the system.

The 2026 World Cup, which will be held from June 11 to July 19 in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, will host 48 teams for the first time, with a total of 104 matches. The renewed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between FIFA and the European Club Association (ECA) aims to ensure a fairer redistribution of revenue, recognising the key role clubs play in player development.

During the previous edition in 2022, $209 million was distributed to 440 clubs from 51 federations. This latest increase demonstrates FIFA's efforts to support the entire global football ecosystem.

Details on the fund distribution process will be announced at a later date.

Lionel Messi is close to finalising a new multi-year contract with Inter Miami, with final details left to be agreed upon, according to ESPN.

The Argentina international is believed to be in the final stages of negotiations over a new contract, with the deal expected to be confirmed soon, subject to approval by Major League Soccer.

Messi's future in the United States was the subject of speculation recently, with previous reports linking the former Barcelona star to clubs in Saudi Arabia.

The 38-year-old forward is said to be focused on continuing his career with Miami, with talks now ongoing over extending his two-year stay at the MLS club.

Messi joined Inter Miami from Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer in July 2023, penning a two-and-a-half-year contract that runs until 31 December.

 Messi has made 75 appearances for Inter Miami to date, scoring 62 goals and providing 30 assists, and led the MLS side to two major trophies during his time in the United States.

The 38-year-old propelled Inter Miami to the inaugural Leagues Cup trophy in 2023, finishing as the tournament's best player and top scorer with 10 goals.

He also helped Inter Miami set the league record for most points in a single season last year with 74, and lifted the 2024 Supporters' Shield.

Messi has made 36 appearances for Inter Miami in 2025 so far, scoring 28 goals and providing 12 assists, including one goal at the Club World Cup, helping the MLS side reach the round of 16.

His arrival in Miami in 2023 saw several of his former Barcelona teammates follow him to the US, with Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba also joining.

This summer, Inter Miami made a statement move in the market as well, welcoming Atletico Madrid and Argentina midfielder Rodrigo De Paul on loan with an option to buy.

GIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Messi is Inter Miami's all-time leading scorer with 62 goals in 75 appearances to date.

Messi's new contract will see him extend with Inter Miami beyond the 2026 World Cup, which could be the 38-year-old's last major international tournament.

The Argentina icon has so far given no guarantee that he will captain La Albiceleste in next year's tournament, saying his fitness will likely determine whether he is able to take part.

JAMIE CARRAGHER stunned his CBS co-hosts with an astonishing blast at Chelsea and their progress since Todd Boehly took over in 2022.

The pundit was discussing the Blues' Champions League loss to Bayern Munich on Wednesday, much to the chagrin of his co-hosts.

The Liverpool legend was unimpressed by the loss, and went on a rant about the club's lack of progress in recent years, before labelling the Club World Cup a ""Mickey Mouse Trophy"".

The attack left Thierry Henry and Kate Abdo shocked before Micah Richards came to the defence of Boehly's men, sparking a fiery debate.

Carragher began: ""There's no right or wrong way of going about running a football club and trying to be successful, it doesn't matter about the system.

""The point I'm trying to make is we can't pretend that this has been a success so far after three-and-a-half years.

""They came into a club and the manager was Thomas Tuchel, he'd won the Champions League at that club.

""Manchester City and Liverpool were possibly the best two teams in world football, alongside Real Madrid, so it was very difficult for anybody to win the Premier League, but Chelsea were the third best team. It wasn't Manchester United, it wasn't Arsenal, it was Chelsea.

""They then change that manager, they then take a team who were very close to competing and winning trophies like they did the Champions League, and they go and spend £2billion. 

""They are no closer, they are further away than what that manager was doing three-and-a-half years ago in terms of competing with the top teams in the Premier League, they are further away having spent £2bn.""

Richards could not believe what he was hearing, and responded in what would quickly become an entertaining row.

He replied: ""But there's been progress, hasn't there? If you finish in the league in his first season, 12th, and then you finish sixth, and then you finish fourth, and then you win the Club World Cup.

""We're talking about where they are now. Yes, he has spent a lot of money, but there has been progress. 

""They beat the best team in Europe in PSG. They did ever so well, I'm not saying Chelsea are going to win the Premier League, but you can see progress.""

Carragher interjected saying: ""Let's not forget where Chelsea have come from, Chelsea are a winning machine.""

But Richards was having none of it, doubling down: ""Man United have been a winning machine, Man United in this period of the last six or seven years have spent an awful lot of money. 

""Man United have finished 15th, 16th, 17th last year, nowhere near the Champions League, so if you go back and say 12th, progress.

""You mention a way of doing it, at this moment in time Man City and Arsenal and Liverpool have got a better squad than Chelsea. I think it's very clever the way that Chelsea have done their business.

""I don't think their squad is as good, I'm talking about in the Premier League, I think they could buy more quality rather than quantity. 

""But Joao Pedro has been a good signing, Gittens did well at Dortmund, and if you're looking at what they're trying to do, they're trying to buy young players. 

""Man City have waited too long before they can sell anyone, Chelsea are very good at selling on an asset, because they buy them young, they've still got value and look at the fees, Madueke, [£48.8million].

""I just think Chelsea are going about it in a different way, whether we agree with it or not.""

Chelsea have had a very busy few years in the transfer window as they spent massive sums to overhaul their squad, while utilising the loan market and affiliate club Strasbourg to maintain value for players while they develop.

The back and forth descended into a fast exchange of arguments as Carragher diminished the significance of Chelsea's Club World Cup victory earlier this year.

Carragher questioned: ""Are Chelsea here to transfer players or to win trophies?""

To which Richards replied by pointing out that they won two trophies last year including the Club World Cup, before Carragher sensationally labelled the accolade as ""a Mickey Mouse trophy"".

Richards responded: ""The Club World Cup? They've just beaten PSG, European Champions!""

But Carragher got the final word in, cornering Richards by saying: ""You've just said they haven't got a squad better than the other teams in the Premier League. How is that possible when you've spent £2 billion on a squad?""



To which the former Manchester City man had no response.

The pundits' sparring was watched in awe by the pair's other co-hosts, with both Abdo and Henry sitting wide-eyed as the back and forth drew to a close.

FIFA has 211 participating nations in qualifiers, outside of Eritrea and Russia, which have been suspended since 2022 from international play. 

“This new approach means that any club that releases a player for a FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier will now be directly compensated,” FIFA said in a statement.

The $355 million allocation comes from a previous agreement with the European Club Association for the tournament, to be hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada. 

In the 2022 World Cup, the payout was $209 million, with Manchester City receiving the highest amount any at $4.6 million.

MLS received a payout of $7.2 million, which was spread out between 25 clubs. C.F. Montreal received a league-high payment of $1.04 million, with the Seattle Sounders next at $826,757. D.C. United received the lowest payment among MLS clubs at $31,000. The rounded per-day amount for players in the league was $10,900 - regardless of actual playing time. 

FIFA said 440 clubs across 51 member countries got payments from the 2022 structure.

FIFA earned a record $7.5 billion in revenue from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, a significant increase from previous tournaments. The tournament was the most profitable in FIFA's history, generating $1 billion more than the preceding World Cup cycle.

Holden said that the emphasis for the White House task force is on travel and security, ensuring the millions of expected visitors to the U.S., Canada and Mexico for the event are safe.

""One of the constant big questions around this World Cup - and it's a very fair one - is security and travel,"" he told GOAL. ""You're going to have high-profile individuals in sports, entertainment, and politics attending these events. I don't need to dive too deeply into where we stand geopolitically or how people feel about America to make the point. 

""When you're talking about mass gatherings of people, there's always going to be some uneasiness. Knowing I'll be at these games, I have to put my trust in the organizers to do everything possible from a security standpoint to ensure this event goes off safely.""

Holden said that he has confidence that FIFA is also prioritizing security, based on previous World Cups and the venues in the U.S. 

""FIFA takes this with the utmost seriousness,"" he said. ""I've been in these stadiums; the security perimeters are extensive, with multiple checkpoints before you even get inside. Still, I think travel could be an issue. Our country has strong infrastructure, but the sheer number of fans will test it. Moving from game to game, with thousands of people flying the morning after matches to follow their teams, is going to be the biggest onslaught of fans this country has ever seen for a single event.""

Lalas said he's had extensive conversations with task force executive director Andrew Giuliani, offering guidance. Holden added that he was also part of those conversations following a recent charity match in Washington, D.C.

""Alexi and I even did some lobbying on Capitol Hill a couple of months back, speaking with politicians about the need to get ahead of this now,"" Holden said. ""We stressed the importance of visas and investment in infrastructure, and we emphasized how critical fans are to the tournament. We want as many fans in this country as possible - safely and responsibly, with proper clearance. This is bigger than soccer. It's about how the U.S. presents itself to the world. We want to be the best host, and we want this to be remembered as the best World Cup ever.""

He left the meeting with Giuliani encouraged.

""In speaking with him, I heard about everything he's dealing with - from the New York/New Jersey transit plans to getting fans in and out of MetLife Stadium,"" Holden said. ""Kansas City, for example, just opened a new airport, and the World Cup will be its biggest test yet. You're dealing with a range of host cities, each with its own infrastructure challenges, so it's really a massive jigsaw puzzle. I will say I was encouraged by the sense of urgency. Based on my conversation with him, I came away feeling good about the way he's approaching these challenges.""

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has stressed that he has worked closely with the White House to ensure that 'the world is welcome at the World Cup.' 

Human Rights Watch has called upon Infantino to reconsider the location of the World Cup if the U.S. can't assure the safety of international visitors - especially considering that fans from 100 countries are expected to attend. 

Vice President JD Vance, who is vice chair for the Task Force, emphasized that fans traveling to the World Cup will have an enjoyable experience, but also issued a cautionary statement to those who want to extend their stay after it.

""Of course, everybody is welcome to come and see this incredible event, I know we'll have visitors from close to 100 countries,"" he said. ""We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game, but when the time is up, they'll have to go home, otherwise, they'll have to talk to [Homeland Security] Secretary [Kristi] Noem.""

Preparations for both the 2025 Club World Cup and the World Cup in 2026 continue to be at the forefront for host cities and both local and federal officials. Infantino said the two events would bring nearly $50 billion in economic output to the U.S. and 300,000 jobs. Holden, for his part, is eagerly awaiting the tournament.

""I had been waiting for this moment for eight years,"" he said. ""I can't wait for this country to be consumed by the World Cup in a way we can't even imagine. U.S. Soccer knows it will be big, but I think it'll be bigger. I've marked Dec. 5 - the draw - on my calendar. We'll be there at FOX Sports, and that's when it will feel real for everyone. Players and administrators can map the path to knockouts, fans can circle games, book hotels, and buy tickets.... In 10 years, I've covered huge events - Qatar, Russia, Women's World Cups in Vancouver and Australia. But this will be on another level.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com', 'title': 'FOX Sports'}","soccer"

ByAsif Burhan,

Contributor.

The Spanish National Team has today become the first in a decade to top the FIFA World Rankings in both the men's and women's game.

Not since 2015 has one country held the number one position in the senior men's and women's game. The respective Spanish national teams have both assumed pole position in the charts following the release of the latest charts.

The women's national team are the current world champions and holders of the UEFA Women's Nations League. This summer, they also reached the final of the UEFA Women's Euro but lost out to reigning European champions England in a dramatic penalty shoot-out.

Nonetheless, they remained unbeaten throughout the tournament in regulation time and these results, coupled with them finishing above England in the latest edition of the Nations League group stage, were sufficient for them to overhaul the reigning Olympic champions, the United States, at the top of the women's world rankings.

The Spanish men's team are the reigning European champions. Last summer, they became the first team in the competition's history to win seven successive matches at a single tournament as they swept aside three former world champions - Germany, France and England - to win a record-breaking fourth title in Berlin's Olympiastadion.

Those matches are part of a 27-match unbeaten streak under head coach Luis de la Fuente. Their last two results this month - emphatic World Cup qualification victories away to Bulgaria (0-3) and Turkey (0-6) - ensured they accumulated enough points to claim top spot in the men's world rankings ahead of the World champions, Argentina.

It is the first time that the Spanish men's team have topped the FIFA World Rankings since June 2014 when they were reigning world and double European champions at the end of a glittering six years of unprecedented success. However, they flopped in their defence of the FIFA World Cup that summer, going out after losing their first two games in Brazil.

The 2014 FIFA World Cup was eventually won by Germany, who claimed top spot from Spain in July went into 2015 as the number one ranked team in the men's game. There they were joined in December 2014 by the German women's team who had won the 2003 and 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup and six successive UEFA Women's Euro titles going back to 1997.

Before Spain, Germany were the first and only nation to previously hold the number one position in the men's and women's FIFA World Rankings. The only other two countries to top the FIFA Women's World Rankings since it was introduced in 2003 are the United States and Sweden, neither of whom have ever led the men's world rankings.

The Spanish men's team will aim to win a second world title next year in the United States and also chase their own national record of 35 unbeaten matches set between November 2006 and June 2009. They are also in sight of the men's world record of Italy who went undefeated for 37 games between October 2018 and September 2021.

Despite regaining their number one world ranking in August, the Spanish federation sacked their women's team head coach Montse Tomé immediately after the UEFA women's Euro. Unbeaten in their last eleven matches since losing to England at Wembley, they have set their sights on retaining their UEFA Women's Nations League title this winter. In the final four, they will play a two leg tie against Sweden in October with the winners due to take on either France or Germany in the final.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","soccer"

Why Arsenal have turned to teenager Katie Reid to cover for the injured Lionesses captain","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/next-leah-williamson-arsenal-teenager-katie-reid-injured-lionesses-captain/blt4c4f30a5deeb38cb","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

When it was revealed that Leah Williamson would miss the start of the new Women's Super League season, most assumed Lotte Wubben-Moy or Laia Codina would take her place in the heart of Arsenal's defence. Wubben-Moy came into the campaign fresh off the back of a new contract and a role in England's Euro 2025 triumph, while Codina's status as a key starter in Spain's World Cup win in 2023 tells you the level she can reach. And yet, both have been usurped by 18-year-old Katie Reid.

The talented teen has been on the brink of a first-team breakthrough for a couple of years now, catching the eye in last summer's pre-season tour of the United States, just weeks after Williamson had waxed lyrical about her as a speaker at Oxford Union. ""She's exceptional,"" the England captain said. ""She will take my shirt one day.""

She might not have the experience of Wubben-Moy and Codina but the Arsenal academy product is more than justifying her selection and showing just why head coach Renee Slegers has given her such a big opportunity.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Daniil Medvedev is hoping to turn a disappointing 2025 season around ahead of the Lynk & Co Hangzhou Open. Having dropped to No. 18 in the PIF ATP Rankings, he is aiming to bounce back and rediscover the form that once made him a member of the prestigious ATP No. 1 Club..

The 2020 Nitto ATP Finals champion is set to compete in his first tournament after parting ways with his longtime coach, Gilles Cervara, following his defeat to Benjamin Bonzi in the opening round of the US Open. In his pre-tournament press conference, Medvedev shared he has been working with Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke. 

""It's not been an easy decision, but I'm happy to try with them for the remainder of the season and then for the [next] season, I'm going to see how it goes,"" he said. 

""I love the way they work. I love what they say, and it's an interesting new project in my career.""



He also revealed that he took a break after the US Open to recharge, before returning to training Monte-Carlo in preparation for the upcoming Asian Swing.

""I [did] not play tennis for like two weeks after the US Open because I knew that even next tournament is going to be in some time,"" he said.

""I had a very good week of practice last week. I played some of my best tennis this year, maybe my best tennis. And the goal would be to try to recreate this on the court, because if I'm going to be able to do it, I'm going to be able to win tournaments or play good tennis and that's most important for me.""

The 29-year-old is seeded second in Hangzhou and will face qualifier Nishesh Basavareddy or Marin Cilic in his opening match. He owns a 26-18 record this season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Dalibor Svrcina delivered the biggest win of his ATP Tour career on Thursday at the Lynk & Co Hangzhou Open, where he dismissed Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 6-3 in the Italian's comeback from injury.

Making his first appearance since his first-round Wimbledon exit, Berrettini was unable to withstand the 22-year-old Czech's fearless ball-striking at the Chinese ATP 250 event. Despite losing in the second round of qualifying just a day earlier, Svrcina grabbed his chance as a lucky loser and has risen 10 spots to a career-high No. 89 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

“Obviously I wasn't the favourite coming into this match, so I just wanted to come here, enjoy and play freely,” said Svrcina. “Yesterday I lost in the qualies, so I'm happy I got the chance to play again and I think I made the most out of it.

“Matteo is an incredible player, he's coming [back] from injury… Obviously he's not where he wants to be, but I'm very happy with the win today and it's the biggest of my career so far.”

Backed by rock-solid defence and quick court coverage, Svrcina struck 17 winners to Berrettini's 11 and saved the only break point he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, during their 85-minute battle. His reward: a second-round clash with Buyunchaokete or Zhang Zhizhen.

Berrettini, who had reached quarter-finals in Miami, Dubai and Doha earlier this year — including his first win over Novak Djokovic — showed signs of rust after a two-and-a-half month layoff, tallying 15 unforced errors in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head match with Svrcina.



In other Day 2 action in Hangzhou, Tomas Martin Etcheverry eased past Damir Dzumhur 6-2, 6-4 to notch his 20th tour-level victory of the season, becoming the second Argentine to do so after Francisco Cerundolo (33). Etcheverry awaits qualifier Rinky Hijikata or fifth seed Camilo Ugo Carabelli.

Qualifier Nishesh Basavareddy booked his spot in the second round by rallying past defending champion Marin Cilic 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. The 20-year-old, who made his debut at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF last year, is up one spot to sixth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah and will next play second seed Daniil Medvedev.

Gael Monfils cut a dejected figure on Thursday after suffering a painful fall that forced him to retire from his opening match against Alexander Shevchenko at the Chengdu Open.

The 39-year-old Frenchman, who had taken the first set, rolled his ankle late in the second and grew visibly emotional once it became clear he could not continue. After Shevchenko leveled the contest, Monfils retired at 7-6(3), 3-6, 0-1.

Watch the moment that led Monfils to retire: 

“I loved every second of the match, and I really didn't want to end it like this,” said Shevchenko, who helped Monfils up after he fell. “He's my childhood hero, I enjoy watching him so much and I wish him a fast recovery. He's incredible, there are so many people looking up to him.”

Monfils won his 13th ATP Tour title in Auckland in January and backed it up with a fourth-round run at the Australian. But the World No. 52 has now slipped to five consecutive defeats and owns an 18-15 record in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Making his debut at the Chinese ATP 250 event, Shevchenko next plays big-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, who did not face a break point across the second and third sets of his 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 win over Filip Misolic.

Earlier, #NextGenATP star Dino Prizmic moved past Terence Atmane 6-4, 6-3 in the Frenchman's first appearance since his breakthrough run to the Cincinnati semi-finals last month. The 20-year-old Prizmic, who is fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, is competing in Chengdu through the Next Gen Accelerator, which offers players aged 20 and under increased opportunity to compete on the ATP Tour.



Prizmic set a second-round meeting with top seed and last year's runner-up Lorenzo Musetti, who is eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and aiming to strengthen his push for a Nitto ATP Finals qualification.

Other winners on Day 2 in Chengdu include eighth seed Lorenzo Sonego and qualifier Mackenzie McDonald, who both earned deciding-set victories. Sonego rallied past Juan Manuel Cerundolo 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, while McDonald held firm for a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 victory over Botic van de Zandschulp to improve to 2-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Top seed Iga Swiatek stayed perfect against Sorana Cirstea to reach the Korea Open 2025 presented by Motiva quarterfinals on her tournament debut, while Ella Seidel dethroned defending champion Beatriz Haddad Maia in the third-longest match of 2025 so far.

No. 1 seed Iga Swiatek made a victorious debut at the Korea Open 2025 presented by Motiva on Thursday, defeating Sorana Cirstea 6-3, 6-2 to post her sixth win in six meetings with the Romanian -- and afterwards, she revealed the family connection that made it extra special.

Seoul: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Swiatek's father, Tomasz, was a rower who competed in the men's quadruple sculls event at one Olympic Games -- Seoul 1988. This may be his daughter's first time in the city, but she's been hearing about it for all of her life.

""The Olympics in 1988 were the highlight of his career, and he's been telling us stories about it since me and my sister were kids,"" Swiatek said in her on-court interview. ""So I'm happy to explore this city -- he's been talking about being here as a great adventure. I play a different sport, but still we're at the Olympic venue and I'm surprised by how the whole city is still appreciating the Olympic tradition. It's great, because this event is the best the world has in any area. Playing here for sure is an honor, and maybe next year my dad will come!""

Playing her first match since losing in the US Open quarterfinals to Amanda Anisimova, Swiatek got off to a fast start against an opponent to whom she has only ever dropped one set -- the first set of their first meeting back at the 2022 Australian Open. She hammered a pair of forehand winners en route to breaking Cirstea in the first game, and swiftly built a 5-1 lead.

Cirstea still battled hard, saving the first five points against her with fine serving and getting one of the breaks back as Swiatek lapsed into error -- but another forehand winner from the Pole sealed her sixth set point. In the second set, Swiatek still had to navigate a few untidy moments -- she tallied 19 winners to 21 unforced errors overall -- but nonetheless saved all three break points against her, and converted her first match point as Cirstea sent a forehand long.

Swiatek advanced to her 13th quarterfinal in 15 tournaments this year (excluding team competitions). She will next face a fellow major champion -- either No. 8 seed Emma Raducanu or Barbora Krejcikova.

Seidel dethrones Haddad Maia in third-longest match of 2025: Qualifier Ella Seidel came through a 3-hour, 28-minute barnburner to dethrone defending champion and No. 6 seed Beatriz Haddad Maia 6-7(4), 7-6(3), 7-5 in the third-longest tour-level match of 2025 so far.

The No. 105-ranked German trailed by 5-2 and one match point in the third set, but surged through the next five games in a row in a blitz of heavy forehand winners mixed up with smartly-timed drop shots. Seidel, 20, has been surging in recent months. This result was her third career Top 30 win, all of which have come since June -- the 20-year-old also defeated Anna Kalinskaya in Berlin qualifying and Emma Navarro in Cincinnati en route to the last 16.

It's also not the first time this week that Seidel has battled back from the brink. She also saved five match points in her first qualifying match before overcoming Mai Hontama 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(7) in 2 hours and 26 minutes.

Haddad Maia, who took a medical time-out leading 5-4 in the third set, later withdrew from the doubles tournament due to a right knee injury.

Seidel advances to her fourth WTA quarterfinal, and first at WTA 500 level. She will next face No. 2 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova, the only former champion remaining in the draw, who came through 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 against Roland Garros semifinalist Lois Boisson.

Great Britain advances to the Billie Jean King Cup semifinal by defeating Japan 2-0. Kartal wins opener against Shibahara, while Boulter secures victory over Uchijima. Britain will face United States in semis, Italy vs Ukraine in the other semifinal.

Great Britain reached the Billie Jean King Cup semifinals for the second year in a row, defeating Japan 2-0 in Thursday's quarterfinals.

Even without top-ranked Emma Raducanu, Britain sealed the tie by winning both singles matches in straight sets. The four-time finalists will face the United States next, the event's most successful nation.

Kartal gives Britain the perfect start

Britain's Sonay Kartal opened the tie with a strong start, racing to a 4-0 lead against Japan's Ena Shibahara before closing out the first set 6-3.

The second set was tighter, with both players unable to break the other's serve, forcing a tiebreak. Shibahara jumped to a 3-1 lead before Kartal rallied to earn triple-match point. The 23-year-old Brit, ranked No. 82, sealed a 6-3, 7-6 (4) win on her second opportunity. Kartal had also won both her matches on her Billie Jean King Cup debut in April.

Boulter seals the victory with easy win 

Britain's Katie Boulter, ranked No. 55, then dominated Japan's Moyuka Uchijima 6-1, 6-2 in the second singles to secure her nation's place in the last four. Uchijima, ranked No. 92, struggled to find rhythm as Boulter's solid baseline play proved too strong.

Semifinal lineup set

Great Britain will face the United States in Saturday's semifinal. Earlier Thursday, Jessica Pegula and Taylor Townsend clinched the deciding doubles match to give the U.S. a 2-1 victory over Kazakhstan. On Friday, in the first semifinal, five-time champion Italy will face Ukraine, which, like Britain, is still chasing its first Billie Jean King Cup title.

Italy scored a 2-0 win over China, while Ukraine overcame Spain by an identical score in the quarterfinals earlier in the week.

Alexander Zverev: We talked about it. He texted me and sent me a picture before I saw it live. Look, a new haircut, apparently it works. Every time he has one, he wins the tournament, so hopefully it's going to go the same way for Laver Cup.Flavio Cobolli: I said that it's really nice because I really like him blonde. So, I really love it.Casper Ruud: We have an ongoing discussion of what the nickname should be for him. “Silver Fox” is pretty good. You know, his hair grows so fast. It was blonde two days ago and now it's already turning silver. In a few days, it'll be even darker. “Silver Fox” is a good nickname for him, and I think it's cool.Yannick Noah, Team Europe Captain: You know, we're like actors. You play tennis the club you grow up playing, and all the sudden you're on these stages with all these people watching you. Of course, you have to play and protect yourself, and so you start with a haircut. Whatever you wear, it's like your favorite shirt, and a lot of people are watching. I think it's a good energy and it suits him very well. It looks great! And then he turned it to blonde. I want to be blonde too, but I don't think it's going to work. I support him.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

McLaren's Norris 'reasonably confident' of 'another good weekend' as constructors' title beckons

As F1 heads to Baku for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more.

Formula 1 drivers and teams are setting up at the Baku City Circuit for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix this weekend, marking Round 17 on the calendar.

Free Practice 1 and Free Practice 2 will take place on Friday, September 19, followed by Free Practice 3 and Qualifying on Saturday, September 20 and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, September 21.

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: A long lap – there's so much to put together in Baku, with lengthy straights and big braking zones in the first sector, before a winding second sector and a tough third sector.

Braking for Turn 1 is tricky; the corner comes quickly after the start-finish line, but it somehow seems to take such a long time to get there from the final turn. With some slipstream, whether you luck into it or orchestrate it, you can gain a huge amount of time.

That's something to watch for in Qualifying, but out-laps are also important; the track surface isn't so abrasive, so with a slow out-lap you could fail to warm up the tyres and lock up into Turn 1.

The notorious castle section in the middle of the track is narrow and a place where accidents can easily happen, but the trickiest corner is probably Turn 15, where you're accelerating towards the end of the lap.

Turn 15 is an unsighted left-hander in which you're braking slightly to the right, then you've got to slow it down and not get into the run-off area, and avoid the looming walls in the process.

It's all about the braking and, like at any street circuit, there's plenty of time to be gained if you can carry sufficient speed out of the apex – just don't get greedy with the apex and clout the wall.

“On a street circuit with low levels of grip and wear, bringing the same selection as in 2024 would inevitably have led to a one-stop strategy,” reads Pirelli's preview.

“At least this way, considering that this year's range suffers much less from graining, it opens up the possibility of a two-stop strategy.

“Moreover, it is clear that this year, most recently at Monza, the teams and drivers have become adept at managing the tyres well, so that the race is unlikely to see very different strategies.

“Although it's a street track, Baku has some very long straights – where the cars hit very high top speeds – that place significant vertical loads on the tyres.”

For the first time since the Austrian Grand Prix back in June, championship leaders McLaren are heading into a weekend aiming to return to winning ways – following on from Max Verstappen and the resurgent Red Bull's impressive triumph at Monza last time out.

Might we see another head-to-head between the Dutchman and the papaya cars at the Baku City Circuit? Can Charles Leclerc give Ferrari something to celebrate by making it five straight poles on Azerbaijan's streets? And what about Mercedes' chances of getting back in the mix?

Given the unique demands of this track, and the fine margins at play so far this season, it will be a fascinating three days of action as those questions are answered.

That said, McLaren have their first chance to wrap up the 2025 Teams' Championship in ‘the land of fire', given the huge points advantage the squad boast over nearest rivals Ferrari – F1.com running through the all-important permutations right here.

Behind the top-four group, F1's midfield fight remains as close as ever, highlighted by just 42 points covering Williams in fifth, Aston Martin in sixth, Racing Bulls in seventh, Kick Sauber in eighth and Haas in ninth.

With so much drama unfolding in Baku over the years, the weekend could present a golden opportunity for one of those outfits – and even Alpine, who have been cut adrift in 10th – to get their hands on a big haul of points.

We will be with you for every twist and turn...

Azerbaijan has played host to some action-packed, drama-filled races since the country arrived on the F1 calendar nine years ago, with the high-speed Baku venue and its fearsome concrete walls catching out plenty of drivers.

But one moment that remains in the memory for another reason is Daniel Ricciardo's incredible overtaking display during the 2017 encounter, the highlight of which was a three-car pass down the main straight and into Turn 1.

Running behind Renault's Nico Hulkenberg and the Williams cars of Felipe Massa and Lance Stroll, the Australian used the slipstream to perfection before slamming on the brakes at the last moment and somehow keeping it out of the wall.

Watch Ricciardo's stunning move in the video player below.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

McLaren's Norris 'reasonably confident' of 'another good weekend' as constructors' title beckons

Baku is one of the trickiest circuits on the F1 calendar, punishing the smallest mistakes with its unforgiving walls – so which drivers and teams are poised to master it?

After the roar of Monza, Formula 1 returns to the streets of Baku – a venue where sheer speed meets tight walls. With unforgiving corners and high risk, high reward overtaking zones, Azerbaijan presents both similarity and stark contrast to the Temple of Speed.

So, who's equipped to thrive in F1 Fantasy? The Baku City Circuit presents one of the most unpredictable challenges of the year, with its mix of low-speed corners and one of the longest straights in F1. Our F1 Fantasy Strategist takes stock of the most reliable and opportunistic assets that could shape your fantasy score this weekend.

It's never too late to join the free-to-play game and compete for the great prizes on offer every race week! New players will need to select five drivers and two constructors within the starting cost cap of $100 million.

Be sure to join the Street Showdown for a two-race mini league across Azerbaijan and Singapore too. There are exciting new prizes on offer, including an Red Bull replica drivers race suit! Keep your eyes peeled for exciting mini leagues opening later in the F1 Fantasy season too, providing you with even more opportunities to play and win.

Ahead of every Grand Prix weekend, our F1 Fantasy Strategist evaluates seven in-game assets – five drivers and two teams – that can help you succeed in F1 Fantasy, whether that's eking out every point or maximising your budget.

With Baku's combination of high speeds and tight walls (especially through the castle section), patience and timing are everything. Overtaking opportunities down the kilometre-long main straight can shuffle the order quickly, while Safety Cars are always a factor – making reliable drivers and strong constructors even more crucial.

Catch up on the Italian Grand Prix highlights below and keep reading for more tips. Remember to lock in your teams before the Qualifying starts on Saturday, September 20 at 1600 local time (1200 UTC).

Lando Norris is not a pick for the risk-averse F1 Fantasy manager.

The McLaren racer has two retirements (Montreal and Zandvoort) in the last seven races, but has also banked scores of 30+ fantasy points in each of the other five – no other driver has more than four in that period.

The nine-time race winner drove from P15 to P4 in 2024, on his way to a 38-point performance and the fastest lap last time out in Baku.

Norris leads all drivers with the highest number of fastest laps (six) in 2025, worth 10 points in F1 Fantasy. If you're confident Norris can win in Baku, he represents an incredibly high points ceiling.

It's hard to ignore the rich vein of form Alex Albon is currently in.

The Thai driver secured his fifth-consecutive double-digit F1 Fantasy score on his way to P7 in Monza – his 11th points finish in 16 races this season for the Grove-based team.

Since Silverstone, Albon has been the fifth-highest scoring driver in F1 Fantasy, averaging 16.0 points and outscoring the likes of more expensive assets Charles Leclerc ($23.3m) and Lewis Hamilton ($23.2m) during that time.

If Williams can deliver more straight-line performance in Baku, Albon will be worth owning this weekend.

Oliver Bearman continues to deliver as a consistent beacon of F1 Fantasy production in 2025.

Fascinatingly, the British driver stood in at Baku for former Haas stalwart Kevin Magnussen in 2024, recording six overtakes and finishing P10 in only his second Formula 1 race at the time.

This year, the rookie leads all drivers in overtakes per race (4.4) and is second for positions gained per race (3.8).

Baku is a track that presents several excellent overtaking opportunities, which makes Bearman worthy of serious consideration at this circuit.

Isack Hadjar is back on the Strategist's watchlist for another week after recent strong results for Racing Bulls.

Over the last three races, the French driver averages 16.3 fantasy points – the sixth-best average on the grid in that window.

He has been the best-value asset in the game from Hungary onwards, recording 3.09 points for every $1 million spent, and could still rise $0.6m in value even if he received the dreaded -20 point penalty for a DNF.

Hadjar's friendly price point also facilitates upgrades to other parts of your team. If you're targeting premium assets in Baku such as McLaren and Ferrari, Hadjar helps enable that.

Pierre Gasly has had something of an underwhelming season in 2025 and has been in the F1 Fantasy wilderness as a result – but this could change in Azerbaijan.

The 29-year-old secured P3 and P5 results in 2021 and 2022 respectively, which may provide a much-needed confidence boost to his chances this weekend.

The Alpine racer has hit the $4.5m price floor, meaning he can go no lower in value and is a safe pair of hands around a track that has claimed many driver retirements over the years.

Gasly has four double-digit F1 Fantasy scores to his name this season, so the potential to score well is certainly there.

Other drivers to monitor: Oscar Piastri, Charles Leclerc

McLaren are unstoppable right now in F1 Fantasy – there is no other way to put it.

After a below-average 52 points in Zandvoort, the Woking-based team bounced back in Monza to record their fifth score of 90+ points in the last six race weekends.

Surprisingly, McLaren leaned heavily on their success in the pit box. After a slow start to the season for scoring points from fast pit stops (the team only scored 15 points once in the first 13 races in this scoring category), McLaren have since recorded 25-point pit stop bonuses in two of the last three race weekends.

It's impossible to ignore McLaren as a consistent source of points and Baku will be no different.

Red Bull have flown under the radar as an F1 Fantasy asset lately, but they might have turned a corner in Monza.

Max Verstappen recorded his third win of the season, which contributed to the team's best score in F1 Fantasy since they last set foot in Italy (Imola 2025 – 71 points).

Over the last five races, Red Bull also lead all teams for fast pit stop points, averaging 12.4 per race in that span.

Verstappen has finished on the podium twice in his last three visits to Baku and Red Bull have won three of the last four Grands Prix in Azerbaijan. If Verstappen and Yuki Tsunoda look competitive in practice, Red Bull could be a convincing differential option this weekend.

Other constructors to monitor: Ferrari, Williams

As always, be sure to keep a close eye on the early sessions to help guide your decisions for drivers and teams in the lead up to the team lock deadline.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

McLaren's Norris 'reasonably confident' of 'another good weekend' as constructors' title beckons

In this week's Beyond The Grid podcast, Graeme tells host Tom Clarkson how his experience led to a job with Cadillac, how the team won its place in F1, and the incredible preparation work happening as the clock ticks towards the new team's debut at the 2026 Australian Grand Prix.

Six months before their first race, the new Cadillac Formula 1 Team is already moving fast. The drivers have been signed, the car is being developed on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and engineers are running simulations to prepare for Grand Prix racing.

Leading Cadillac to the Formula 1 grid is Team Principal Graeme Lowdon, who knows how to launch a brand-new team. He did it in 2010 with Virgin Racing, which raced at the back of the grid and was graced by the talent of the late Jules Bianchi.

And in this week's Beyond The Grid podcast, Graeme tells pod host Tom Clarkson how his experience led to a job with Cadillac, how the team won its place in F1, and the incredible preparation work happening as the clock ticks towards the new team's debut at the 2026 Australian Grand Prix.

He explains why Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez are the perfect drivers for the team, and why he admires Cadillac reserve driver Colton Herta for swapping IndyCar for a shot at racing in F1.

There are plenty of talking points ahead of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, with the F1 TV crew here to run through them all.

With the title fight heating up in the wake of McLaren's team orders at Monza, Oscar Piastri gave his thoughts on the latest 'papaya rules' having allowed rival and team mate Lando Norris back in front at the last race.

Speculation has grown that Isack Hadjar will be racing alongside Max Verstappen at Red Bull next season, but the Frenchman dismissed any such rumours for now.

Verstappen, meanwhile, gave details on his recent Nurburgring Nordschleife outing, with the four-time World Champion expected to return to the infamous track in GT3 machinery later this month.

Join Laura Winter, Chris Medland and James Hinchcliffe on Weekend Warm-Up for all of the above and more.

McLaren can make it back-to-back Teams' Championship titles at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, while drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris resume their battle for individual honours...

When McLaren won the Teams' Championship last year, it ended a 26-year wait for glory. Courtesy of their dominance so far this season, they will not have to wait anywhere near as long for the next one and thus it's more a matter of when, not if, they defend their crown...

Baku is home to a majestic street circuit that straddles the Caspian Sea and winds its way through an eye-catching Old Town and plays host to the returning Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

Isack Hadjar has insisted that he ""didn't sign anything"" yet amid reports that he could step up to Red Bull alongside Max Verstappen for the 2026 season.

The Formula 1 rookie has impressed during his maiden season with Racing Bulls, despite a disappointing start after crashing out on his Grand Prix debut during the formation lap in the wet in Australia.

Since then, the 20-year-old has shown flashes of speed for Red Bull's sister squad and secured seven points-scoring finishes, the highlight of which came when he finished third in the Dutch Grand Prix last month.

With Yuki Tsunoda currently unable to deliver consistent point-scoring finishes at Red Bull, speculation has continued to grow that Hadjar will be brought in for 2026 given the French driver's impressive results.

However, ahead of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix this weekend, the rookie confirmed that he didn't know where he would be driving next season and that he ""couldn't care less"" about the rumours.

“Yeah, I did, and I think it's very funny,"" he said when asked about the reports. Pushed on why he found them funny, he responded: “Because I didn't sign anything.”

Hadjar was then asked where he would rather drive next year, with the 20-year-old adding: “The goal has always been to be a Red Bull driver since I signed with Red Bull, with the Red Bull Junior Team, so I think it is quite clear.

""It [driver decisions] has always been decided, at least for me, at the very end of the season. I think it makes sense, because there are eight races to go, so I need to keep pushing.”

Recently promoted Red Bull boss Laurent Mekies confirmed ahead of the Italian Grand Prix that no mid-season swap would take place, with Tsunoda having already been brought into the senior team at the expense of Liam Lawson earlier this year.

The New Zealand driver made only two appearances for Red Bull before being dropped and placed back at Racing Bulls, and ahead of the race in Baku, he was asked what advice he would give Hadjar if a potential move went ahead.

""For me it's hard I guess to look back on and have a proper comparison, just because it was just the two races,"" said Lawson on Thursday in the Drivers' Press Conference.

""I prepared, I tried to do everything I could. Obviously we can always do things better but I would honestly just say ignore everything that's being said.

""At the end of the day, we're all racing drivers, we all have to have enough self-confidence to be in the sport in the first place. We don't come here thinking that other people are better than us, otherwise we wouldn't be here. So I think to just have faith in yourself.

""He's done a good job this year and I think he needs to just focus on the job and focus on preparing the best he can. Not listening to everything that's said about what it's going to be like because, at the end of the day, nobody actually knows. Only the guys that have done it [know].""

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

McLaren's Norris 'reasonably confident' of 'another good weekend' as constructors' title beckons

Max Verstappen had plenty to talk about ahead of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, having been in action at the Nordschleife last weekend.

Max Verstappen has given his verdict on his recent Nurburgring Nordschleife outing, admitting that ""rules are rules"" having been required to race a de-tuned GT4 Porsche Cayman on his debut in order to gain the relevant licence.

Fresh off the back of his Italian Grand Prix victory, the four-time World Champion visited the infamous Nordschleife circuit in Germany last weekend, where he tackled the 100-plus corners during a four-hour ADAC ACAS Cup event in order to gain a Permit A.

This licence will now allow the Dutchman to race faster GT3 machinery, with an entry in Emil Frey Racing's Ferrari 296 expected in the next four-hour event – the ADAC Barbarossapreis – on September 27.

""My passion is to also do these kind of races. I knew that taking my licence needed to be done in a certain way and I have to say that they were all very helpful and supportive when I got there. But rules are rules and I get that,"" said Verstappen during Thursday's media day ahead of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

""The down-tuned car was quite interesting to drive but honestly, very good collaboration. I got to do it in one race where sometimes you need to do it in two. They gave the option to do it in two different cars, so they were very thoughtful, helpful. Supportive as well because for them I think it was great to see.

""I enjoyed it, even though the car was super slow I still had a very useful day because I managed to drive in the wet, I managed to drive in the dry afterwards, do a start, getting to know all the flag rules because they are a little bit different to F1.

""At the end of the day it doesn't matter what kind of car you drive around the Nordschleife, it's always going to be fun when you push it.""

Verstappen has already previously driven Emil Frey's Ferrari GT3 during a test session at the Nordschleife, where under the pseudonym of 'Franz Hermann', he unofficially broke the GT3 lap record.

Verstappen's ultimate goal is likely to shift towards the Nurburgring 24 Hours next season, which will be held on May 15-17 and does not clash with any Formula 1 events.

""I like racing in general also outside of F1. I knew that if I wanted to get my permit I needed to do that race and we just went about, it was all organised very well, they were all very helpful as well from the organisation side,"" he added.

""Every lap that you do around there is a different kind of experience so for me it was still very useful even though people say the car is down-tuned and it must be very boring. Of course the car is not the most exciting to drive but I look at it in a different way.

""You try to then focus on other things that might be useful in the future when you go there with a proper car. I had fun, it's a nice environment to be in, a bit different to F1.""

The aftermath of the shooting exposed how little traditional journalists understand the platforms shaping online radicalization and real-world violence: “Too many outlets don't employ reporters who truly live online.”


							By 

	Taylor Lorenz



	Within minutes of Charlie Kirk being shot, millions of Americans began scrambling for information. But as the public struggled to make sense of the event, media organizations were flailing too. The Wall Street Journal misinterpreted engravings on the bullets, an anchor compared social media to a cult, and some old school journalists seemed to struggle with the basic concept of a Discord server. 


	“The fact that there is no one in traditional media whatsoever who has any inclination to what the modern landscape of the internet is and how to navigate it is baffling at best and downright dangerous at worst,” one X user posted, amassing over 10,000 likes.

					MAGA Pundits Revel in 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' Suspension: ""He Is Now Canceled and Unemployed""		
			









	Traditional news media's struggle to understand the internet or grasp new technology isn't a new phenomenon. Tim Miller, a political strategist and writer-at-large for The Bulwark, an anti-Trump new media brand on Substack, compared struggling media figures attempting to decode the shooter's internet slang to “Bryant Gumbel in 1994 trying to explain the world wide web on the Today Show.” In 2025, there are more reporters covering The Los Angeles Lakers than there are dedicated online culture journalists in all of mainstream media.


	This vacuum left by the traditional media on internet culture coverage has allowed influencers, TikTokers, and streamers to step in and provide the tsunami of information that people crave. But that information is often unverified and many influencers don't adhere to any journalistic or ethical standards. Just last month, a WIRED investigation revealed that dozens of liberal news content creators, several identifying as independent journalists, were taking part in a dark money political influence scheme without any disclosure to the public. Meanwhile right wing content creators are building massive media empires weaponizing pop culture news for political purposes with little to no scrutiny. The disinformation pushed by these types of influencers confuses audiences, leaves them less informed, and erodes trust in actual journalism. 

	











	The internet is the most powerful political tool of our time, but most media organizations treat it as an afterthought until breaking news arises. “Too many media outlets don't employ reporters who truly live online and have a firm grasp of internet culture,” said Oliver Darcy, a long time media reporter and founder of Status, a newsletter about the media.


	The journalists getting things wrong, Darcy explains, don't have nefarious intentions. They're often just general assignment reporters thrown onto stories that they're unqualified to report on. This is how we have ended up with so many false reports of things like non-existent TikTok challenges. “Just like a news organization would not send a general reporter into a war zone, outlets should also not send untrained journalists into the chaotic online world and expect them to be able to have a complete understanding of what is transpiring,” Darcy said. 


	Ryan Broderick, founder of the newsletter Garbage Day and one of the first ever internet culture reporters, said that it didn't have to be this way. Throughout the 2010s, digital media companies employed dozens of journalists covering various online communities and phenomena. Much of their coverage, however, wasn't innately valued outside of its ability to generate traffic by going viral on platforms like Facebook. Once digital media crumbled and outlets like BuzzFeed, Mic, Vice, and others shuttered their news teams, online culture reporting as a beat was gutted. 

	











	Some internet culture writers ended up in traditional media. Ali Breland and Charlie Warzel, two top journalists who have reported on the darkest and most obscure corners of the internet, landed at The Atlantic. Aric Toler, who previously worked at the investigative outlet Bellingcat and has extensive experience plunging the depths of the internet, went to The New York Times. Many others simply quit the business or became content creators themselves. 


	Gender-based attacks also eroded the internet culture beat. In the 2010s, much of internet culture journalism was done by women. In 2025, many have been driven out of the industry by declining opportunities or a relentless torrent of abuse and blowback from the subjects they cover. Gamergate, a misogynistic harassment campaign that began in the early 2010s, provided a blueprint for the weaponization of the internet and kick-started the careers of many of the most prominent right wing internet figures today. Legacy media organizations hired women and LGBTQ journalists to cover these influencers, then, as Broderick put it, “threw them into the internet wood chipper for traffic.” As many online pointed out following Kirk's shooting, “Gamergate was… the spark for modern radicalization.” 


	Will Sommer, a senior reporter at The Bulwark, and author of the book Trust the Plan: The Rise of QAnon and the Conspiracy That Unhinged America, is one of the country's top reporters on internet culture and online extremism. He said that traditional media organizations are simply “reluctant to acknowledge that internet things and internet movements and internet politics are worth taking seriously and deserve having some expertise on for a newsroom. To [cover internet culture] effectively requires newsrooms to understand a world that they're not used to, and to understand there will be bad faith attacks against any reporters who cover it.”

	











	Jamie Cohen, associate professor of media studies at CUNY Queens College said that the more out of touch the traditional media becomes with internet culture, the more trust these organizations lose with the public and especially younger audiences. Cohen likened the situation to 2008, right before the financial crisis. 


	“In 2008, [the media] lacked the financial literacy to understand crucial concepts,” he said. “Financial experts were able to not explain certain important things.” That lack of nuanced coverage of our financial system allowed for exploitation by bad actors who thrived under lack of oversight, Cohen said. 


	The more out of touch the mainstream media coverage of the online world becomes, the more audiences, especially younger audiences, turn to less reliable news sources. Already, the share of U.S. adults who say they regularly get news from TikTok has jumped from 3% in 2020 to 17% in 2024, according to a study by Pew Research Center.  37% of Americans aged 18-29 say they regularly get news from news influencers, compared with just 7% of those 65 and older.


	Aidan Walker, a meme researcher in Washington D.C. said that instead of relegating certain people in a newsroom to understanding the online world, news outlets need to start hiring people who are hyper online for all beats. Journalists also need to recognize that spending a lot of time on X doesn't mean that they are plugged into online culture. “Twitter cannot be the place where journalists get a sense of what's happening in the world because it's not a complete picture,” he said. 

	











	Some on X echoed this sentiment. “Millennial journalists spend time scrolling Twitter for headlines and mistake that as being ‘very online,' which would be a meaningful descriptor maybe 15 yrs ago but today puts you closer to Facebook moms and dads,” the writer and trend forecaster Ayesha A. Siddiqi posted.


	Adam Aleksic, a linguist and author of the book Algospeak: How Social Media Is Transforming the Future of Language, said that what constitutes “very online” has evolved over the years. “To be very online today, you have to understand years of meme history across platforms, as well as a niche understanding of the specific communities you're engaging with,” he said. “Young people are digital natives, they have grown up so immersed in the online environment that they have a deep internet knowledge which may seem incomprehensible to outsiders.”


	Broderick is hoping that news outlets like his Garbage Day can step up and keep people informed. Prior to the shooting, Broderick hired a researcher from Know Your Meme, the leading internet meme database, and a managing editor who came from Tumblr and BuzzFeed. So far, his investment in online culture coverage is paying off. Broderick said that his post last Friday covering the online references made by Kirk's shooter amassed over half a million views. 


	Will Sommer's newsletter False Flag for The Bulwark reaches over 861,000 subscribers. “Someone needs to explain to people,” Sommer said, “that a Gopnik is not necessarily a Pepe.”

""Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,"" the president wrote on social media.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	It's safe to assume that Donald Trump is jumping with joy over Jimmy Kimmel Live! getting suspended by ABC over host Jimmy Kimmel's viral comments about Charlie Kirk.


	After attending a state dinner earlier in the evening, the president took to Truth Social at 1 a.m. in the U.K., writing, “Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT”

	Though Trump called the show canceled, ABC only suspended it “indefinitely.”

	Kimmel drew heat from Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr after he suspected Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson was a MAGA Republican during his opening monologue on Monday night's show. “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said at the time.


	On Wednesday, Carr condemned the late night host's comments and threatened to take action against ABC affiliates over Kimmel's comments. “[This] appears to be an action by Jimmy Kimmel to play into the narrative that this was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” Carr said on a podcast. “What people don't understand is that the broadcasters … have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest. When we see stuff like this, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”

	











	Nexstar, which owns 28 ABC affiliates across the country, was the first to preempt the series for the immediate future. Then an ABC network spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter that Jimmy Kimmel Live! would be “preempted indefinitely.”

SAG-AFTRA also released a statement following the news, noting, ""The decision to suspend airing 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' is the type of suppression and retaliation that endangers everyone's freedoms.""


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


	The union that represents writers on Jimmy Kimmel Live! is ripping ABC for pulling the show off air after the comedian made some viral remarks regarding the shooting of Charlie Kirk.


	“The right to speak our minds and to disagree with each other — to disturb, even — is at the very heart of what it means to be a free people. It is not to be denied. Not by violence, not by the abuse of governmental power, nor by acts of corporate cowardice,” said the Writers Guild of America West and East on Wednesday night, not long after Disney-owned ABC said it was pulling the show “indefinitely.”

	The union added, “As a Guild, we stand united in opposition to anyone who uses their power and influence to silence the voices of writers, or anyone who speaks in dissent. If free speech applied only to ideas we like, we needn't have bothered to write it into the Constitution. What we have signed on to — painful as it may be at times — is the freeing agreement to disagree.”

	The statement continued: “Shame on those in government who forget this founding truth. As for our employers, our words have made you rich. Silencing us impoverishes the whole world. The WGA stands with Jimmy Kimmel and his writers.”


	Meanwhile, the American Federation of Musicians union, which represents musicians on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, produced a hard-hitting statement that characterized the move as “state censorship.” Said Tino Gagliardi, the AFM international president, “This is not complicated: Trump's FCC identified speech it did not like and threatened ABC with extreme reprisals. This is state censorship. It is now happening in the United States of America, not some far-off country. It's happening right here and right now.”

	











	Gagliardi added, “This act by the Trump Administration represents a direct attack on free speech and artistic expression. These are fundamental rights that we must protect in a free society. The American Federation of Musicians strongly condemns the decision to take Jimmy Kimmel Live off the air. We stand in solidarity with all those who will be without work because of government overreach.”


	The industry's performers union, SAG-AFTRA, also released a statement in response to the news of the suspension. “Our society depends on freedom of expression. Suppression of free speech and retaliation for speaking out on significant issues of public concern run counter to the fundamental rights we all rely on,” the union stated.


	It added, “Democracy thrives when diverse points of view are expressed. The decision to suspend airing Jimmy Kimmel Live! is the type of suppression and retaliation that endangers everyone's freedoms. SAG-AFTRA stands with all media artists and defends their right to express their diverse points of view, and everyone's right to hear them.”


	ABC's decision marked a significant escalation of an event that took place earlier in the day: Major local TV station owner Nexstar decided to pull the late night show from its stations in the wake of Kimmel's comments Tuesday. Nexstar broadcasting division president Andrew Alford called Kimmel's remarks “offensive and insensitive” in his explanation of the move, adding that giving Kimmel a platform was “not in the public interest at the current time.”

	











	In the remarks that prompted the firestorm, Kimmel commented on the shooting of Kirk, a right-wing activist, at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said.


	Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr came out swinging against Kimmel's commentary in an interview with a YouTuber early Wednesday, bringing up the potential for certain ABC affiliates' licenses to be revoked. He called for ABC affiliates to “push back” and tell the network, “Listen, we're not going to run Kimmel anymore until you straighten this out because we're running the possibility of license revocation from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion.”


	Kimmel had been prepared to address the backlash on his Wednesday show, a source told THR, but not to apologize.

Ray3, the companies hope, can become a staple to rival Google


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	The race to bring cinematic-level video to studios and filmmakers took another turn Thursday as AI video company Luma AI announced it was partnering with Adobe to release its new Ray3 model. 


	Starting today, the AI video company is making Ray3 available to customers of Adobe's generative-AI app Adobe Firefly.  Paid Firefly customers will get unlimited AI-assisted video over the next two weeks, with a cost structure kicking in after that. Other clients, such as Hollywood studios and streamers, can order the tool separately for their filmmakers. With the deal, Luma hopes its tech tool will become a staple for the industry.

	Backed by Amazon, a16z and others, Luma AI's tech aims to make AI-generated cinematic video more realistic. The company is in an arms race with Runway AI, Google Veo and others. Hollywood studios and filmmakers, the companies hope, will use the tools to generate video in-screen without requiring shoots, cutting down on costs. The quality of the AI-generated videos will be a key determining factor in the update of the new technology. To what extent AI video can, or should, replace physical production remains an open question.


	Luma has been releasing a steady stream of models since it came on the scene in early 2024 with Dream Machine. The tool was a quantum leap forward in what short-form video could do with basic text prompts. Ray3 continues the trend of short 10-second videos without dialogue but with a higher level of realism.


	In a call with THR, Luma AI CEO called Ray3 “the most intelligent video model on the market.” He touted its ability to “reason,” an at-times squishy AI term that essentially means the model can interrogate itself to improve on an existing task instead of requiring users to keep refining their prompts.

	











	“If coders get intelligent models, why shouldn't creators get intelligent models?” Jain said. In a demonstration, he showed a complex prompt that asks for the model to have characters turning to a light while it changes colors, followed by an explosion. The six-part sequence, he said, could not be handled by most models.


	Ray3 also provides the ability to doodle on an image, drawing out the trajectory of a character on screen, with the tool then generating a video of the movement.


	“With Ray3 now available in the Firefly app, Adobe customers are among the first to gain access to a powerful new video model that amplifies imagination and transforms workflows,” Adobe's v-p of new GenAI business ventures Hannah Elsakr said in a statement. “We can't wait to see how they use it to bring their ideas to life.”


	Veo 3 remains a leader thanks to Google's reach, tech and ability to train on millions of YouTube videos.

This marks the third and final major to make deals with Spotify after the service upset the music industry by cutting premium royalty rates for songwriters.


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


Spotify has announced a new multi-year global partnership with Sony Music, the third and final major to sign new deals with Spotify this year. The deals encompass both the recorded music and publishing sides of Sony's business, and according to Spotify, its “new direct licensing arrangement in the U.S.” will result in higher royalties for songwriters.


	It's a notable part of the pacts, given Spotify came under fire from music publishers last spring when it started paying a reduced royalty rate to songwriters and publishers in the U.S., resulting in what the National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA) says was a loss of $230 million in royalties in the first year.


	This is because Spotify found that by adding audiobooks into its premium subscriptions, it could reclassify those popular subscriptions as “bundles,” a type of plan that qualifies for a discounted rate on U.S. mechanical royalties given that multiple products are offered under one price tag. The move caught publishers off guard and reignited longstanding tensions between publishers and Spotify about what royalties songwriters should earn.

	Sony follows Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group and Kobalt in making these direct deals to, in part, improve remuneration for songwriters post-bundling. It's unclear if these deals bring these companies' royalty rates back to the level they were before bundling or not. 


	In a press release about the deals, limited information is given about the nature of this expanded partnership. According to a press release about the deals, “the companies will work together to keep improving the listening experience while creating more opportunities for artists and songwriters to reach audiences everywhere. These initiatives will launch new product offerings including enhanced audio and visual formats that enable deeper connections with fans.”


	Recently, Spotify has been focused on expanding its offerings. The Stockholm-based company has announced it will now allow for direct messaging, a new DJ feature for playlists and high-fidelity listening — all as part of premium. Late last year, it also rolled out music videos for 97 countries, excluding users in the U.S. and Canada. 


	“Our partnership with Sony is built on a shared drive to shape the future of music. Together, we're accelerating the pace of innovation to create powerful new opportunities and increasing revenue for artists and songwriters,” says Daniel Ek, Spotify's founder and CEO. “These agreements aren't just a milestone; they're a catalyst for building a more dynamic and prosperous music ecosystem for everyone.”


Rob Stringer, chairman of Sony Music Group, says: “Sony Music Group and Spotify have long been mutually committed to advancing music streaming and growing the marketplace for all. This is further reflected in our new agreements where we're working to develop futuristic approaches that ensure our artists and songwriters remain appropriately compensated for their work, and audiences are getting a high-quality experience that's ever evolving.”


	“These deals with Sony Music Group are built to better support artists and songwriters by unlocking new formats and forging deeper connections with fans,” says Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer at Spotify. “This alignment creates space for new opportunities and long-term growth for everyone involved.”

Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Clairo has signed with Atlantic Records, the label announced Thursday (Sept. 18).


	“Clairo represents the rare kind of artist who reshapes the music landscape simply by being true to herself,” said Elliot Grainge, chairman and CEO of Atlantic Music Group, in a statement. “She's not just one of the most important songwriters of her era, she's an artist whose work and aesthetic is truly unique. As a leading voice in music today, we are honored that she has chosen the Atlantic family to be part of her next chapter.”


	Clairo was previously signed to Republic Records, which released her 2021 album, Sling. Her self-released 2024 follow-up, Charm, received a Grammy nomination for best alternative music album.


	“I'm so thrilled to begin this next chapter of my musical journey with Atlantic,” said Clairo. “From our first meeting, they immediately understood my vision, and it feels good to know I can continue to be as expressive and free with my ideas with a great new partner by my side.”

	All three of Clairo's albums to date have charted on the Billboard 200: 2019's Immunity (No. 51), Sling (No. 17) and Charm (No. 8). All three also charted in the top five on Billboard‘s Top Rock Albums and Top Alternative Albums tallies, with Sling spending one week at No. 1 on the latter. Charm also spent a week at No. 1 on the Independent Albums chart. The singer-songwriter has racked up 3 million equivalent album units (399,000 of that in traditional album sales), as well as 3.76 billion on-demand official streams in the U.S., according to Luminate.

Backed by Sherrese Clarke's HarbourView Equity Partners, the new management firm promises to ""fiercely protect artists and fight to make things happen for them.""

Michelle Jubelirer and Arjun Pulijal, former top executives at Capitol Music Group, have officially launched Soft Shock, a new management and media collective designed to reshape how talent is developed and supported across entertainment. Positioned “at the edge of boutique,” Soft Shock said in its launch announcement that it will offer a wide range of services including talent management, creative marketing, brand development and content production/distribution across all media formats.


	Soft Shock is backed by a strategic investment from HarbourView Equity Partners, a four-year-old firm founded by Sherrese Clarke. HarbourView, based in Newark, NJ, has amassed nearly $3 billion in music and entertainment assets — including a mix of active and passive publishing rights and master royalty holdings — with a catalog that includes stakes in works by Kelly Clarkson, Wiz Khalifa, George Benson, Fleetwood Mac and others.

	Focused on authenticity and direct fan engagement, the company describes its mission as championing artists and driving cultural impact, adding it is committed to building a diverse roster of talent and leaning more on trust-based partnerships. Beyond music, Soft Shock will also represent a broad range of creatives — comedians, filmmakers, actors, athletes, designers, chefs and others.


	“The name Soft Shock exemplifies our approach to everything. We are humanistic and empathetic first… but we are going to fiercely protect artists and fight to make things happen for them,” said Jubelirer. “It's a volatile time for the creative psyche – that applies to talent as well as those on the business side trying to build careers –  these are people's lives. We believe creative intention, personal fulfillment, and commercial success can all co-exist. It just takes curation and bravery, or as we say, ‘a soft touch with the courage to shock.'” 


	Jubelirer, who made history as the first female chair and CEO of Capitol in its 80-plus year history, brings a wealth of experience from both the legal and music industries. Her career includes roles at Sony Music, the law firm King, Holmes, Paterno & Berliner, and Capitol, where she helped guide the careers of artists like Tyler the Creator, Frank Ocean, and M.I.A. She exited CMG in early 2024 following a restructuring at CMG parent Universal Music Group, and that same year was named Billboard‘s Women In Music executive of the year.


	Pulijal, who served as president of CMG before departing a month after Jubelirer, previously led marketing efforts for the label, crafting acclaimed campaigns for artists such as Paul McCartney, Halsey, and Maggie Rogers. He joined Capitol in 2013 after seven years at Epic Records. Together, Jubelirer and Pulijal bring over 50 years of combined experience and a track record of commercial and creative success. During their tenure at CMG, they oversaw major milestones including the rise of Ice Spice, Sam Smith and the release of the Beatles' final single “Now & Then.”


	“It may not always feel like it, but artists have the power now and it's never going back,” said Pulijal. “Telling talent ‘go viral and then we'll care' is a race to the bottom. We combat that by building scale on the side of talent through a diverse network that offers thought partnership and collaboration. All artists are creators and Soft Shock is ready to provide them with the tools, resources, and creative freedom they need to build sustainable, multi-faceted careers.”


	With Soft Shock, Jubelirer and Pulijal aim to create a top spot for talent seeking authentic collaboration, supported by HarbourView's portfolio. HarbourView CEO Sherrese Clarke cited the founders' “vision and conviction” as leaders. “I've watched Michelle fight for artists with the same courage she brings to every table we've shared, including our shared passion for the most vulnerable, and Arjun is equally relentless in reimagining what's possible,” said Clarke. “At HarbourView, we look for partners who not only shift culture but expand it – with Soft Shock's focus on artistry, equity, and impact in entertainment, they perfectly embody that.”

The pop icon has re-signed with her original label after two decades. 


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Madonna is going back to the start. Warner Records announced on Thursday (Sept. 18) that the pop icon is returning to her original label home after nearly two decades away. The best-selling female artist of all time has signed with Warner for what the label called her “highly anticipated, upcoming new dance album.”

	











	Madonna celebrated the return in an Instagram post in which she wrote, “Almost 2 decades later — And it feels like home with Warner Records! Back to music, Back to the Dance Floor, Back to where it all began! COADF – Pt. 2 2026.” The post included a series of pictures of the 67-year-old superstar seated on mattress on the floor in a gauzy light pink nightgown staring at the camera with an old-fashioned typewriter at her feet, striking the kinds of sultry looks that have been her signature for more nearly half a century.


	The final slide consisted of a snap of a pair of gold heels and what looked like a black purse with the message “P–sy Power” in rhinestones across the front.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Warner Records was Madonna's home for the first 25 years of her career, starting in 1982, when she signed with the Seymour Stein-run label subsidiary Sire Records. She released her self-titled debut on the label in 1983, which spawned a series of indelible early dance pop hits, including “Everybody,” “Burning Up,” “Holiday,” “Lucky Star” and “Borderline.”

	











	”From being a struggling artist in New York City to signing a record deal to release just three singles it seemed at the time my world would never be the same again and in fact that couldn't have been truer,” Madonna said in a statement announcing the deal. “Since the beginning Warner Records has been a real partner with me. I am happy to be reunited and look forward to the future, making music, doing the unexpected while perhaps provoking a few needed conversations.”


	The deal will bear immediate fruit with a new album due out in 2026, marking the singer's first full-length collection of new songs since 2019's Madame X. According to the release, the untitled new album will find Madonna re-teaming with producer/songwriter Stuart Price for the sequel to her Confessions on a Dance Floor LP, which featured the hits “Hung Up” and “Sorry.”


	”We are honored to welcome Madonna back home to Warner Records. Madonna isn't just an artist — she's the blueprint, the rule-breaker, the ultimate cultural juggernaut. For decades, she has not only defined the sound of global pop music but also reshaped culture itself with her vision, innovation, and fearless artistry,” said Warner Records co-chairmen Tom Carson and Aaron Bay-Schuck in a statement. “This signing represents a historic, full circle moment, one that brings her back to the label where it all began and reaffirms her unparalleled influence, setting the stage for an exciting new era of creativity and impact.”


	She remained on Warner through her record-setting run in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, during which time she released such iconic LPs as Like A Virgin (1984), True Blue (1986), Like a Prayer (1989), Erotica (1992), Bedtime Stories (1994), Ray of Light (1998), Music (2000), American Life (2003), the original Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005) and Hard Candy (2008). She hopped to Interscope Records in 2012 for her MDNA LP.

	











	At press time no release date has been announced for the upcoming album.


	In July, Madonna released her long-rumored Veronica Electronica album, a collection of eight rare and unreleased remixes of songs from her beloved 1998 Ray of Light album.

Artists will also be able to share behind-the-scenes content, new release countdowns and more later this year.

	Steve Knopper



Befitting YouTube executive Lyor Cohen‘s background as a top hip-hop manager and record mogul, many of the “Made On YouTube” features announced Tuesday (Sept. 16) at an event in New York are focused on musicians' needs. Beginning later this year, artists will be able to share behind-the-scenes video content, countdowns for new releases and “thank you” clips to fans, as well as participate in a pilot program for selling exclusive merch to prolific viewers. Plus, they'll have access to new tools, many involving AI tech developed by YouTube parent Google, to help generate song ideas, video sketches and even entire works. 


	As part of YouTube's 20th-anniversary rollout of 30-plus new tools and products, Dua Lipa told Cohen, in an on-stage interview, that her content on the service has helped her be “part of the conversation” and “adds to the closeness and brings more of a familiarity.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	New features on YouTube Shorts, which competes for views with TikTok and Instagram Reels, have clear benefits for artists and musicians. The new “Speech to Song” tool combines snippets of recorded conversation, say, or a verbalized idea for a lyric or poem, with AI-generated musical ideas into what sounds like an actual work. (Many of these features are in the process of rolling out in the U.S., as well as other countries.)


	Another feature, Veo 3 Fast, customizes Google DeepMind's Veo 3 video-generation tool so users can quickly and easily link sound and video clips. The tech allows for lower latency, reducing the buffering period that often occurs between a camera capturing a moment and its display to viewers. 


	The Veo 3 tool has an AI component, too: Plug in, for example, “punk rock dad,” combined with the original song fragment, and wind up with a custom angry-parent-skateboarding music video. Veo 3 Fast also allows users to borrow motion from existing videos, like a dance or sports move, and apply it to a photo to animate the still image.


	Also during the event, YouTube reported that it has 2.7 billion users, landed $60 billion in 2024 media revenue and has paid out $100 billion to content creators since 2021.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: Lionsgate will be reducing 5% of its companywide staff, Deadline has learned. 


	Approximately 50 staff overall will exit in a move that adds to a previous trim. The earlier layoff constituted 8% of staff, which will mean Lionsgate will have lightened its head count by 13% when this round of downsizing is done.


	The purpose of the headcount reduction is corporate belt-tightening, as all companies in the industry are doing, including the ongoing attrition at Paramount Global after its acquisition by David Ellison's Skydance. Co


	This will be it for Lionsgate, making it more efficient as it positions the company for the future growth, sources said.

	Lionsgate chief Jon Feltheimer has just sent an internal memo that Deadline got hold of. Here it is:

Dear Colleagues:We continue to operate in an industry environment characterized by unprecedented change and disruption, and we are continuing to adapt our organization to these changes in order to compete successfully. As part of this process, we separated Lionsgate and STARZ into independent standalone companies earlier this year, and we are continuing to monetize non-core assets, re-allocate our resources to growth areas of the business and reduce costs.We have already reduced our studio headcount by approximately 8% this year and today we are notifying an additional 5% of our employees that their positions will soon be eliminated. These are difficult decisions impacting colleagues with whom we have collaborated for years and who have made valuable contributions to Lionsgate's success, and we will make their transitions as smooth as possible. Our Human Resources team will follow up with additional information later this morning. Though we may continue to fine-tune the organizational structure of individual departments from time to time, today's headcount reduction will substantially complete our year-long process of repositioning the company for growth.Our core strengths remain intact: one of the largest and most valuable film & television libraries in the world, a portfolio of premium franchises, deep content pipelines and a talented and entrepreneurial workforce second to none. Working together, I am confident that we will continue to position ourselves for solid and significant growth in the years ahead.Sincerely,Jon

	Minutes before NBC late-night host Jimmy Fallon was slated to appear on a New York conference panel Thursday, organizers announced he was out of the lineup.


	“Unfortunately, Jimmy Fallon is no longer able to attend today's session,” the Fast Company Innovation Festival said in a statement.


	Fallon and marketing executive Bozoma Saint John had been slated to discuss their new advertising-focused NBC series On Brand. A representative of the festival at the conference venue in Lower Manhattan told a Deadline reporter there would be no comment on the situation beyond the statement.

	











	The panel, minus Fallon, went on as scheduled. Moderator Jeff Beer, a senior staff editor at Fast Company, kicked the session off by saying, “In light of current events, Jimmy could not make it this morning.” Saint John, who is also a cast member on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, drew a cheer by interjecting, “But you've got me!” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The schedule shift came the morning after the jolt of ABC pulling Jimmy Kimmel from the air indefinitely, the most dramatic reaction yet to public comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The Trump Administration and a wide swath of Republicans jeered Kimmel's Kirk references in his monologue, with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr openly threatening ABC and Disney with retaliation. Kimmel had joked that President Trump was grieving the same way “a 4-year-old mourns a goldfish.” As evidence and theories emerged about suspected killer Tyler Robinson's political motives, Kimmel quipped that MAGA supporters were eager to prove that Kirk's killer was “anything other than one of them.”

	











RELATED: Jimmy Kimmel Sidelined: Hollywood Reacts To ABC Pulling Talk Show Over Charlie Kirk Comments


	Fallon and his fellow NBC late-night host, Seth Meyers, have drawn the attention of Trump in the wake of Kimmel's show being suspended indefinitely by ABC. 


	Trump offered his “congratulations” to ABC in a Truth Social post in the wake of the Kimmel move. He said it, along with the announcement from CBS last month that it was cancelling Late Night with Stephen Colbert at the end of the current season has turned the focus to NBC. The Kimmel suspension “leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT”

Since when does the president get to get people fired? Is the government now in charge of what we see on TV? He said MAGA gang so what? Are we now in a communist country? Is the leader not to be talked about? How many other presidents and vice presidents have been talked about on late night and never got in trouble. Trump you are not above this. He did say he wanted to be a dictator. He's on his way. Well done, now you have a dictator, for voting for this person

I like Jimmy. He's more like LENO, he entertains his audience

A friend of mine was there and heard the production staff talking. It wasn't a protest. There was little security and no metal detectors and they were saying that because of what happened with Charlie Kirk that Jimmy wasn't happy with the security arrangements. It had nothing to do with solidarity with the other Jimmy or anything like that, it was a safety issue.

Yes for Trump Get rid of those who are against Trump No one thinks about that

Fallon is the funniest and least political late show. He very rarely goes full political like Colbert and Kimmel. However his ratings are not great and it is probably a wise move to keep his head down especially since network affiliates like the ones that preempted the Kimmel programming use their voice and capital leverage.

Fallon is proof that cowardice takes you far in America.  He doesnt dare raise his voice, he doesnt dare say anything funny.  He simply gushes at guests he's supposedly over the moon for, every single damn one of them.  

If you want to see what a future with AI generating entertainment is, watch Jimmy Fallon.

Kimmel is SO much funnier than Fallon (but I do like “Box Of Lies” and when they use retriever pups). Kimmel has a knack for saying what I'm thinking, hope he's back on TV soon.

Yes, soon. Complain to ABC. My local democratic group has done so.

What's happening is total BS, but come on, we all know Fallon is ONE NOTE.

Hmm, maybe as a late night host but he is supremely versatile and talented at impressions, and arguably, a host who doesn't suck out all the air from the room with his own ego is the perfect platform for his guests to shine.

Because he would have been asked questions.

Donald Trump has been sounding off again over Jimmy Kimmel being taken off air as he committed to “a movement to defend the glorious traditions of freedom of speech on both sides of the Atlantic” during his trip to the UK.


	Responding to a question about whether free speech is better protected in the U.S. or UK, Trump claimed Kimmel was “fired because of bad ratings more than anything else,” along with “saying a horrible thing about a gentlemen called Charlie Kirk,” the conservative commentator who was shot dead last week.


	“Kimmel is not a talented person, he has very bad ratings more than anything else and they should have fired him a long time ago,” said Trump alongside UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer during a press conference. “You can call that free speech or not, he was fired for lack of talent.” Trump made similar remarks yesterday on his Truth Social platform.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Trump's comments came after Kimmel was “pulled indefinitely,” not “fired,” by ABC following remarks about Kirk's accused killer Tyler Robinson and his affiliations. A swathe of criticism from Hollwood and beyond was forthcoming yesterday after Kimmel was taken off air for saying: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”


	Kimmel was supposed to qualify his comments on the following night's show but was removed beforehand. The move is the latest in a series of concerning anti-free speech developments on American network television after Disney and Paramount settled lawsuits with Trump, and after the Stephen Colbert show was axed by the latter.

	











	Trump said “many British citizens have offered condolences” to him over Kirk's death including Starmer and he will be journeying to a memorial service on Sunday for Kirk.


	“It's so imperative that we stand together for these fundamental rights,” he said. “Just last week, an American was assassinated for speaking his mind. He was a great young man with an incredible future. I hope together our nations can lead a movement to defend the glorious traditions of freedom of speech on both sides of the Atlantic.”


	Trump took questions alongside Starmer following a two-day trip to the UK that has been met with protests and a projection of Jeffrey Epstein onto the side of Windsor Castle.


	Trump and Starmer were effusive about the “special relationship” between their two nations. 


	“The bond between our countries is like no other anywhere in the world,” said Trump, whose mother was born in Scotland and who owns golf courses in the country. “The U.S. and UK have done more good on this planet than any two nations in human history. That is thanks in large part to the traditions of British liberty which grew up on these beautiful magnificent isles.”


	The pair's main area of “disagreement,” according to Trump, is over the war in Gaza and the UK's imminent decision to recognize a Palestinian state, which Trump's team disagrees with.


	“Hamas said they will put the [Israeli] hostages up as bait; that's pretty brutal,” said Trump. “We haven't heard that one in a long time. I have a disgreement with the Prime Minister on that score. It's one of our few disagreements actually.”


	Trump leaves the UK later after striking a landmark technology deal that will see billions pumped into the UK for artificial intelligence.

He should tell the DOJ to approve Disneys purchase of Fubo and he should tell the FCC to weaken the media ownership rules so Nexstar can merge with the other company.

That's basically why he's off the air.  If those happen, he'll be back on the air.

Free speech, ban it if you don't like it and call it “lack of talent”.

What happened to Jimmy's freedom of speech?

Hey, it's not like he's been fired, banned from all social media platforms, debanked, have his friends and family members threatened, and had dozens of smear pieces written about him like the left has been doing for the last decade.

Old Jim can still spread all the conspiracy theories he wants from his TikTok account.

You talking about how Trump was banned from Facebook for fomenting violence on Jan 6? Or something/somebody else. Please use examples next time.

Well Trump has a lack of talent and embarrassingly low ratings so….! 👋

Typical response from the butthurt felon still jealous that he never won an Emmy for his performance, like Jimmy.

	Silicon Valley startup Luma AI has launched Ray3, which it says is the first video model with the ability to reason.


	Adobe and major ad firms and creative agencies Monks UK, Galeria, and Strawberry Frog are among the initial customers of Ray3, which is available on the Dream Machine platform.


	The generative model is capable of critiquing itself and making on-screen notes about revisions and improvements. Production work can also be saved and picked up where it was stopped, unlike many current models. A “draft mode” also allows for more trial and error at a faster rate, with preferred results then rendered in 4K high dynamic range.

	The output of a system endowed with the power to reason, Luma says, is “videos that feel more coherent, with characters that look consistent, scenes that unfold naturally over time, and physics that behave as they should.”

	Luma also says Ray3 is the first model to produce video in true 10-, 12-, and 16-bit HDR ACES2065-1 EXR format, making it suitable for high-end film and advertising projects.


	Luma, whose backers include Nvidia and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, earlier this year opened an L.A. studio and it is also establishing a presence in New York.


	“Ray3 is our first step toward building intelligence for creative work,” said Amit Jain, CEO and co-founder of Luma AI. “Creative work is one of the most intellectually challenging things humans do, yet until now, many of the AI available to creatives has lagged far behind what's possible in coding and analysis with language models. Generative models have been more like slot machines – powerful but not intelligent. Ray3 changes that in a big way.”


	Adobe and Luma AI are partnering to bring Ray3 directly into the Adobe Firefly app.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: The Golden Globes is getting a companion TV special. Titled Golden Eve, the first annual CBS primetime special, honoring recipients of the Cecil B. DeMille Award and Carol Burnett Award, will air at 8 PM on Thursday, Jan. 8, three days before the Golden Globes ceremony on the network (and streaming on Paramount+). It is part of an expanded Golden Globes partnership between CBS and Dick Clark Productions to launch Golden Week. 


Golden Eve will be the cornerstone of the new week-long initiative, which includes special programming across Paramount platforms and kick-off events leading to the 83rd Annual Golden Globes, airing live on Jan. 11, 2026 with comedian Nikki Glaser returning as host.

	Like this year's inaugural Golden Gala, which honored Cecil B. DeMille Award recipient Viola Davis and Carol Burnett Award recipient Ted Danson, the 2026 honorees will be presented with the awards at a ceremony earlier in the Golden Week. It will be taped and turned into the Golden Eve special, which will also feature curated career retrospectives, never-before-seen footage, and in-depth conversations with the award recipients. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We are so excited to expand our partnership with CBS and bring the Golden Globes to an even wider audience across the Paramount portfolio,” said Jay Penske, CEO of Dick Clark Productions, which is co-owned by Deadline parent PMC. With Golden Eve, we will celebrate the industry's most talented and influential figures, recognizing the recipients of the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award and Carol Burnett Award. This is a chance to properly honor those who have so profoundly shaped our culture with more than a 2-minute awards moment. This event and special will occur during ‘Golden Week', a premier cross-platform initiative with CBS that transforms the Globes into a multi-day cultural event, making it a cornerstone of the awards season.”


	This marks an evolution from this year's Golden Gala, which was not televised, with Davis' acceptance speech, which you can watch below, going viral after being released on YouTube by the Golden Globes. (The Academy's Governors Awards, where Honorary Oscar are handed out, also is not televised.)

	











	“CBS has long championed excellence in arts and entertainment and that will continue in 2026,” said Amy Reisenbach, President, CBS Entertainment. “With Golden Eve and Golden Week, we'll celebrate the Golden Globes across CBS and Paramount, creating an immersive experience that brings viewers closer to one of Hollywood's most iconic events.”


	First created in 1952 and honoring the eponymous director, the film-focused Cecil B. DeMille Award has had 69 recipients to date, including Walt Disney, Audrey Hepburn, Sidney Poitier, Judy Garland, Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Redford, Barbra Streisand, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey. The TV counterpart, the Carol Burnett Award, was created in 2019 and initially awarded to its namesake.


	“The Golden Globes has always honored the achievements of remarkable talents. With Golden Eve, we'll give viewers a more intimate look at our honorees' legacies and bring audiences closer to these icons,” said Helen Hoehne, President, Golden Globes. “We're excited to create an unforgettable night of award television with CBS and Paramount as we celebrate these legends.”


	DCP plans, hosts and produces the Golden Globes, which has been viewed in more than 185 countries and territories worldwide.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Him fumbles its football horror story","https://www.avclub.com/him-review","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 06:00:00 GMT","

“No guts, no glory” is taken to literal extremes in Him, a blend of sport and horror genres as unlikely as it is unsuccessful. Director Justin Tipping (Kicks) expands on Zack Akers and Skip Bronkie's original Black List-featured screenplay, which hints at legitimate controversies surrounding the NFL—including the grooming of young men from vulnerable communities and the prevalence of traumatic brain injuries—but posits that the sport's true evil is influenced by the occult. Produced by Jordan Peele's Monkeypaw Productions, Him clearly attempts to provide the socially conscious, figuratively couched scares that crowds have somewhat reductively come to expect from the company, but this football horror fumbles any semblance of salient cultural critique.

As long as he can remember, Cam Cade (Tyriq Withers, co-star of the recent I Know What You Did Last Summer remake) has idolized Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), star quarterback of the San Antonio Saviors. Even after watching Isaiah sustain a gruesome leg injury during a live broadcast as a child, Cam was encouraged by his father to strive for the majors. 14 years later, his moment has finally arrived. Motivated by his now-late father's favorite saying—”no guts, no glory,” of course—he's dutifully trained to be the best. In fact, it's looking like he might soon be drafted to the Saviors, potentially taking over his idol's position in the process. 

But when Cam is attacked by a crazed fan during a lonely late-night practice session, the blunt force head injury threatens to end his career before it's even begun. Although the surgical staples have yet to be removed and his brain is still swollen, Cam's smarmy agent (Tim Heidecker) gets in touch with the unexpected opportunity of a lifetime. Isaiah has personally beckoned the up-and-comer to spend a week at his secluded compound, where he will receive personal guidance from the football veteran and cut his teeth before the upcoming draft at his luxurious facilities.

Yet upon arrival, Cam quickly senses hostility. Even before entering the front door, his car is accosted by Isaiah's most committed supporters, who act more like zealots than superfans. The GOAT himself comes off as more interested in torturing Cam than training him, abetted by increasingly uncomfortable recovery treatments courtesy of Isaiah's personal sports physician Marco (Jim Jefferies). The only friendly presence is Elsie (a sparse Julia Fox), Isaiah's influencer wife, and the cadre of sexy women she keeps in her company. 

The tension between this waning heavyweight and the young talent coming for his title is predictable, but the plot to thwart Cam's takeover is anything but. As opposed to unpacking the real sport's underlying ugliness, one that perpetuates gross bodily harm and racist recruitment practices, Him trains its gaze on strange supernatural phenomena that don't meaningfully interact with any of the aforementioned criticisms. Instead, the NFL-adjacent entity that considers Cam a future moneymaker is infiltrated by Satanic pagans in lieu of straightforward capitalist greed. Without spoiling any specific revelations, blood transfusions, body paint, and blistering saunas become emblematic of the conspiratorial entities that monitor Cam's progress from the shady sidelines. Though there is some success highlighting the innate violence of football—a visual gimmick involves x-ray vision that examines the brain-bashing, bone-breaking injuries sustained by players—the American obsession with this brutal spectacle is never grappled with. 

Him‘s heavy-handed Christian imagery does its Satanic aspects no favors. Cinematographer Kira Kelly (known for collaborating with Ava DuVernay) trains her lens on relevant iconography: a gold cross dangles from Cam's meaty neck; a dinner table scene directly evokes The Last Supper; endless interactions namecheck the big man upstairs. Reading as a milquetoast treatise on the necessity of centering god (i.e., Him) and denouncing the devil's temptation, this vaguely holy perspective hinders Him from going all-out on the horror front, resulting in a disappointing dearth of scares and carnage. 

These surface-level spiritual nods also stand in place of further character development, never reconciling these beliefs with the corruption that comes with the pursuit of fame. Cam falters in his faithful familial obligations, only speaking with his mother during infrequent phone calls; his commitment to a long-term (though virtually unseen) girlfriend wavers with each woman that crosses his sightline; even Isaiah and Elsie's marital union provides little insight into the oft-superficial nature (and hardly holy lifestyles) of celebrity couples. Conflicting commitments to “football, family, and God” are never fleshed out with a clear perspective, only existing to further the film's Satanic strawman. 

As the final moments of Him unfold, there's an attempt to drastically course-correct. Previously minor characters flat-out state the nefarious tactics of the American football enterprise, and the previous lack of bloodshed is duly made up for. But it's a desperate Hail Mary after a poorly played game, without a hope of bailing out the team behind it.

Giant local TV conglomerate Nexstar might have been both the first, and the biggest, of America's various station-owning overlords to make a public stink about Jimmy Kimmel this week, calling comments the ABC host made addressing Republicans “working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk” both “offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse.” But Nexstar could wind up tragically losing the race to be the most performatively angry about the talk show host's statements: Sinclair Broadcast Group has now entered the contest, and nobody gets angrier, in more attention-seeking ways, than Sinclair.

The company—which owns the largest collection of ABC affiliate stations in the United States, and is notorious for forcing local newsrooms to run “must-run” segments typically espousing conservative views—issued its own statement on Wednesday night in response to news that ABC and Disney had yanked Kimmel from the airwaves out of apparent fear of affiliate revolt. (Presumably spurred on by FCC chair Brendan Carr, who gave a podcast interview earlier on Wednesday implying threats of license loss to any affiliate that didn't go after Kimmel.) But that mere capitulation wasn't enough for Sinclair, which issued a statement late on Wednesday stating that “Sinclair will not lift the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! on our stations until formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability.” The statement also all but begged for the FCC to “take immediate regulatory action to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.” Oh, and they want Kimmel to personally apologize to Kirk's family, and give a donation to his organization Turning Point USA, presumably for the gross crime of saying that right-wing political figures sure do seem eager to make political hay out of the commentator's murder.

But don't worry, ABC viewers in Sinclair-owned markets! (There are a lot of you, by the way; Sinclair owns roughly 40 ABC affiliates around the country, out of the 193 stations it owns overall.) The conglomerate will be providing something equally entertaining to watch in the slot previously reserved for Kimmel's Friday night episode: A tribute to Kirk, which will also be made available to ABC affiliates around the country. This will, of course, be very exciting for anyone who has not spent enough time over the past week being lambasted with media extolling the virtues of Kirk's very vocal approach to the American political experiment, and who would have just wasted all that time watching Kimmel's show by relaxing or laughing anyway.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Visibly nervous Disney asks if people maybe want some Muppets right now","https://www.avclub.com/muppet-show-special-disney-plus-seth-rogen-sabrina-carpenter","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 01:48:00 GMT","

You ever plan for your day to be about one thing, but then it turns out to be about something else? That's kind of how we imagine Disney's Wednesday has been going, as the company rolled out long-in-the-works plans to announce a 50th anniversary celebration of The Muppet Show today, and wound up feeding it straight into the maw of public vitriol currently consuming ABC and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Thus did headlines about the genuinely sweet-sounding Disney+ special—which is being produced by Seth Rogen and will feature appearances from Sabrina Carpenter, and take the Muppets back to their roots as a variety show—find themselves forced to share very close space with news about the streamer's parent company yanking one of its most famous celebrities off the schedule in response to right-wing outrage. A juxtaposition of various forms of pop culture puppetry that was entirely coincidental, and which we nevertheless can't stop ourselves from squinting at and going “Huh.”

The Muppets special, which is being billed as a pilot for a potential revival of the series, has actually been a semi-open secret for a while: A few weeks back, California released a quickly-redacted list of tax credits that included a reference to a “Muppets pilot,” so this has been brewing for at least a second. And we certainly can't fault the general zeitgeistiness of the pitch, even if it very specifically ran afoul of the news of the day today. Rogen and Carpenter are both natural fits for a revival of the old Muppet Show format: He's fresh off a bunch of Emmy wins for The Studio, and has maintained a reputation as being a genuinely human, funny guy despite mountains of success; she's one of the biggest young musical acts in the country. Just as importantly, both of them tend to work a little bit blue, tying neatly into the Muppets‘ subversive vibes; taken in a vacuum, it's a strong, on-brand billing. (Rogen is technically only on the hook right now as an executive producer, alongside his usual partner Evan Goldberg, but this feels like a pretty natural time for him to step in front of the camera.)

Per Deadline, the special is being written by veteran Jimmy Fallon writer Albertina Rizzo (no relation) and directed by frequent John Mulaney collaborator Alex Timbers. Set to air in 2026, the pilot “will feature Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and the gang as they return to the Muppet Theatre to produce a variety show.” Most of the current regular Muppets cast, including Dave Goelz—who's been with the franchise since the first episode of The Muppet Show in 1976—are set to reprise their parts.

Sometimes the machinery of the right-wing tattle machine can move with shocking swiftness. We were, for instance, just in the midst of writing up FCC chair Brendan Carr's threats against ABC and talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!—in which Carr, fresh off helping to bully Paramount and CBS News into submission, suggested ABC affiliates complain to parent company Disney about Kimmel's comments on the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk—when news broke that those threats had come to fruition. First, news broke that Nexstar, which owns a bit more than 10 percent of all the ABC affiliate stations in the U.S., was intending to preempt Kimmel's show in favor of other broadcasting. Then the big shoe dropped: ABC, per Deadline, has announced that Kimmel's show is being taken off the schedule “indefinitely.”

All of this, presumably, due to the monologue that Kimmel delivered on his show on Monday night, in which he noted that “many in MAGA-land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.” While making jokes about JD Vance and noting the Department Of Justice's recent removal of a study showing right-wing violence “outpaces” attacks from the left, Kimmel didn't mince words: “The MAGA Gang (is) desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

These comments and jokes provoked accusations of being “the sickest conduct possible” from Carr, who told podcaster Benny Johnson that “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take actions on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” Nexstar, meanwhile, was a bit vaguer, simply saying in a statement that it “Strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk and will replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets.” It added that it did not view broadcasting Kimmel as being in “the public interest”—a line also trotted out by Carr in his efforts to invoke legal authority against ABC for broadcasting Kimmel's show.

As for ABC, it's staying as quiet as it can, issuing a simple “Jimmy Kimmel Live! will be preempted indefinitely” in a statement to Deadline, and declining to share any further details.

News of Nexstar's principled stand on the issues comes just a month after the massive broadcast group announced it was acquiring rival station owner TEGNA, which owns or operates 68 American TV networks. The press release announcing the acquisition specifically thanked the Trump administration for initiatives enabling the purchase.

The Gen V writers room had to go back to the drawing board after the “incredibly unimaginable” death of Chance Perdomo, who died in a motorcycle accident last year at the age of 27. Perdomo played Andre, a supe with magnetism powers, in season one of the college-set The Boys spin-off. While some other series may have found another actor to play the major character, co-showrunner Michele Fazekas shared that “literally no one was saying recast” in a recent interview with Deadline. “Studio, network and everybody was kind of like, ‘No, of course not,'” she continued. “So, we knew that we had to treat this like this character, as much as people have lost the real Chance, our people have lost Andre. And what does that look like in a world where it's superheroes in college and a lot of ridiculous gore and funny?”

That decision added some extra work for the team, as Fazekas shared they had already written “like five episodes of Andre's story” before Perdomo's death. “We're like, ‘OK, all of that is obviously gone,'” she recalled. In the end, however, Fazekas was “proud” of how the show handled the profound loss. “We just sort of made it like we wanted the season to certainly honor him, and then at the end, we realized the season is about him, everything, and all of the drive comes from him.”

In his review of the first three episodes of season two, which are currently streaming on Prime Video, Manuel Betancourt wrote that while Perdomo's absence is “very much front and center… you can see the places where Andre/Chance's death has been stitched into the show's otherwise quite intricately plotted season ahead.” That being said, he also wrote that the way the characters themselves process Andre's death was “an admirable way of honoring Chance even as the Marie (Jaz Sinclair) escape of it all feels like a forced reset for what the season cliffhanger had first teased.”

Fazekas also spoke of the strange experience of mourning the character of Andre along with the actor who played him. “It is a weird thing to grieve a fictitious character, but we did,” she said. “We definitely did actually talked [sic] about it like, I think it's OK to actually grieve something, cause you grow to love these characters as much as you love the people who are portraying them. And in some ways, we knew Andre better than we knew Chance. Chance was in Toronto. We spent more time with Andre in a way, and it was like, losing Chance is incredibly unimaginable in a way, but we all were like, ‘Oh, we also lost this Andre guy we really liked.' So, at the end, I was like, ‘Oh, this was about Andre,' and it was about Chance, the season was. I'm very proud of that.”

In the last years of his life, Redford stayed out of the spotlight. However, the prolific environmentalist did step out a final time where he was pictures at an event with his wife, 68-year-old Sibylle Szaggars. Read on to see the final photos.

The last photos of Robert Redford in public were taken at the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation's 2021 award ceremony. The event was held in October at Monaco's Grimaldi Forum. In the photos, Redford looks cheery with Sybille Szaggars, whom People says he married in 2009. 

In the shots, the couple elegantly rocks head-to-toe white. Redford is in a crisp suit while Szaggars dons a floor-length eyelet dress.

At one point in the evening, the couple was spotted wearing colorful facemasks as the world was still reeling from the COVID-19 shutdowns.

The mission statement of Prince Albert's foundation is “protecting and progressing planetary health,” according to its website, making it a poignantly fitting final event for the dedicated environmentalist. 

In a 2015 interview, the “Up Close & Personal” star spoke on climate change and said, “We need alternative energy. I think that's the future. I don't think oil is the future. This is gonna be an unpopular opinion, but I think it should stay in the ground.” He also revealed he worked in the Chevron oil fields as a kid.

The icon expressed concern for the future of Earth as he continued, “We're so close to polluting the planet beyond anything sustainable. He hopefully predicted a shifted focus to alternative energy would create an industry and jobs. 

When asked what he would say to people questioning why they should listen to a Hollywood actor about the environment, Redford replied, “I've been an activist since 1969. I've been involved in the environment from a standpoint of wanting to draw attention to what an alternative could be rather than what we've been having.”

Former “Real Housewives” daughter Bella Hadid shared photos on Instagram from her hospital bed on Wednesday, September 17. Although she didn't specify why she was in the hospital, she has opened up about her struggle with Lyme disease in the past, per People, and a comment from her mother seemed to indicate that's what she's dealing with now.

A post shared by ℰᥫ᭡ 𓂃 ོ☼𓂃 (@hadiduptades)

In some photos, you can see from Bella's perspective, looking out the window and around the hospital room. In others, she can be seen playing games and hanging out with her sister, fellow model Gigi Hadid. Another photo shows Bella seemingly wearing an oxygen mask with an IV in her arm as she gives a peace sign with her fingers. A different glimpse of the star shows her with a compress on her head and what appears to be a few tears. There are also pics of flowers, a double rainbow and other sights.

A post shared by bella hadid fan page (@bellah.drip)

In the caption, she wrote a simple message to her fans, saying, “I'm sorry I always go MIA. I love you guys.”

Bella may be facing some health issues, but she's definitely not alone. She has plenty of support from both family and fans. Just take a look at the love she's receiving online in response to her Instagram post.

“❤️Lyme warrior,” Bella's mom and Bravo star Yolanda Hadid wrote in a comment, seeming to suggest that Bella is dealing with her disease at the moment.

Bella's sister, Gigi, wrote, “I love you! I hope feel as strong and good as u deserve, soon!!!!!!”

Fans were also quick to leave comments of support. One person left a note, saying, “Take care and heal, the world is waiting for Miss Bella Hadid always. Stay strong ❤️”

“Feel better angel come back stronger 💖,” someone else wrote. A third fan added, “take the time you need to take care of yourself whenever you need it bel ❤️ we love you n we will always be here waiting 4 u ❤️💕”

A post shared by Bella 🦋 (@bellahadid)

Living with Lyme disease isn't easy, which is something that Bella opened up about back in August 2023. In an Instagram post, she wrote, “[T]he little me that suffered would be so proud of grown me for not giving up on myself🫶🏼”

“Living in this state, worsening with time and work while trying to make myself, my family and the people who support me, proud, had taken a toll on me in ways I can't really explain,” she later added. “To be that sad and sick with the most blessings/privilege/opportunity/love around me was quite possibly the most confusing thing ever. one thing I want to express to you all is that 1: I am okay and you do not have to worry, ♥️and 2:I wouldn't change anything for the world. If I had to go through all of this again, to get here, to this exact moment I'm in right now, with all of you, finally healthy, I would do it all again. It made me who I am today.”

“The universe works in the most painful and beautiful ways but I need to say that if you are struggling— it will get better,” Bella continued. “I promise. take a step away, stay strong, have faith in your path, walk in your truth and the clouds will start to clear up.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Celebs Defend Jimmy Kimmel After ABC Pulled His Show From the Air","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/celebs-defend-jimmy-kimmel/","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 06:56:15 GMT","

ABC pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from the air indefinitely, and celebrities are coming to the talk show host's defense online. On September 17, 2025, an ABC spokesperson told Rolling Stone that the recently-Emmy nominated late-night show “will be pre-empted indefinitely.”

ABC announced on Wednesday evening that it was pulling Jimmy Kimmel's late night show “indefinitely” after criticism of comments he made on Monday about the motives of the man who is accused of fatally shooting the conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week. #jimmykimmel #maga #breakingnews #learnontiktok #charliekirk 

Earlier in the day, Nextstar Media Group announced that their “owned and partner television stations affiliated with the ABC Television Network will preempt ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight's show.”

According to Nextstar Media Group's statement, the decision was due to Kimmel's joke about Charlie Kirk's recent passing. Kimmel actually said the following on the Monday night taping of his show:

“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

This announcement comes exactly two months after CBS canceled “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” Kimmel was a vocal supporter of Colbert, even voting for “The Late Show” to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show, a category Kimmel was also nominated in. The day after the Emmy Awards, Kimmel celebrated Colbert's win with John Oliver.

Margaret Cho used colorful language when commenting on Variety's Instagram post, asking, “What the actual f.” Fellow comedian Atsuko Okatsuka also expressed dismay, writing “WHAT” in all caps in the comments section.

Kathy Griffin went to Bluesky to urge her followers to vocally support Kimmel. Griffin herself experienced backlash when she posted a “photo of herself holding up a Donald Trump mask made to look like a severed head” in 2017, according to NPR.

Wanda Sykes, who was supposed to be Kimmel's guest on tonight's episode, took to Instagram to express her disappointment with ABC's decision and to ask for prayers. She also mentioned the First Amendment concept of freedom of speech, as did MSNBC host Chris Hayes when he wrote on the Elon Musk-owned website X (formerly known as Twitter).

A post shared by WS (@iamwandasykes)

Hayes called Kimmel's forced hiatus “the most straightforward attack on free speech from state actors I've ever seen in my life.”

This is the most straightforward attack on free speech from state actors I've ever seen in my life and it's not even close. https://t.co/uMjEZkIpat

Ben Stiller also used X to explain his thoughts, writing, “This isn't right.”

This isn't right. https://t.co/mVJ8308w1k

Comedian Mike Birbiglia posted a picture of a handwritten note on Instagram, on which he wrote about defending people even if you don't agree with them. He also called for fellow comedians to make statements in support of Kimmel.

A post shared by Mike Birbiglia (@birbigs)

“Freaky Friday” actress Jamie Lee Curtis, who recently broke down in tears over Kirk's passing, reposted a Kimmel quote on her Instagram story. The quote read, “I don't think anyone should be canceled. I really don't.” Kimmel said this quote in April 2025.

“I am horrified at the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel Live,” wrote actress Jean Smart. “What Jimmy said was FREE speech, not hate speech.”

A post shared by Jean Smart (@realjeansmart)

“And our right to free speech is being eliminated,” actor and comedian Steve Martin wrote, captioning a quote from the “Diary of Anne Frank” from 1943.

Although Kimmel's show is not currently airing, and there's no word on when it will return, if ever, he clearly has a lot of support from fans and celebrities alike.

Influencer Keeley Whitcomb is mourning the heartbreaking loss of her two children after a car crash on September 15 near Hastings, Nebraska. Her husband, Blake Whitcomb, remains in intensive care following the accident. Whitcomb, who often posted Disney-themed content and worked as a travel agent for Dreams Travel Consulting, shared the devastating news with followers on TikTok. 

“To my friends who follow me: yesterday was the worst day of my life. An accident has taken my two children from me and put my husband in the intensive care unit. Consider me out of the Disney office,” she wrote.

According to local outlets NTV News and KLKN-TV, the Adams County Sheriff's Department responded to a two-vehicle crash at an uncontrolled rural intersection. Blake, 33, was driving a pickup truck that collided with a farm silage truck driven by 66-year-old Dale Feik.

Both drivers were transported to Mary Lanning Memorial Hospital. The couple's children, aged 7 and 10, were passengers in the pickup truck and were pronounced dead at the scene.

In the days after the accident, Keeley shared emotional tributes to her children on TikTok. Honoring her 10-year-old daughter, Laynee Rae, she wrote, “10 years was not long enough for me. Forever on my mind, my Laynee Rae. 9/15/2025.”

Being a step-parent is a whole different kind of love. 9/15/2025

She also remembered her stepson, Ryder, in a heartfelt post. “Once upon a time, I met a boy. I fell in love with him the moment I met him. Though I didn't know him all his life, I got to know him for 3 years. Being a step-parent is a whole different kind of love. 9/15/2025.”

The family's heartbreak has been felt across their community and online. Ryder's grandmother, Cheryl Gardner, shared her own tribute on Facebook: 

“Yesterday, Heaven got a new angel. Fly high Ryder and thank you for blessing me, if only for a short time. God has bigger plans for you my little buddy.”

Fans and friends have filled Keeley's social media posts with messages of love and support as she navigates unimaginable grief. Another comment read: We are crying with you. We have no words.” 

“I just watched all 3 videos. This is the first time you've ever been on my FYP, but as a mom, I cried for you. I'm so, so sorry.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Reese Witherspoon Reveals Why She Went to a Hypnotist","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/reese-witherspoon-hypnotist-anxiety/","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:48:28 GMT","

Reese Witherspoon has opened up about the fact that she deals with anxiety. Beyond that, “The Morning Show” star has just revealed that she has consulted a hypnotist to manage the issue.

“Can we talk about our relationship to anxiety? Because I wanna hear tools that you've learned and what I've learned, and it's real,” Witherspoon said while chatting on the Wednesday, September 17, episode of Las Culturistas podcast. She added, “I'm a high-anxiety person.”

Fortunately for the star, she has found something that works for her when it comes to managing her anxiety. She revealed to the podcast hosts Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers, “I started doing some work with a hypnotist, and she actually works for this thing called neurolinguistic programming. So, it's called NLP.”

Starting when she was 34 years old (she is 49 years old now), Witherspoon explained, “She helped me realize that I was going to get the same result, but I could get rid of all the anxiety in the middle.”

It turns out that the star has sought out a number of solutions to her anxiety-related issues. She said she “tried meditation, but admitted that it is “hard for [her] to listen.” She explained, “I also have, like, some ADD [attention deficit disorder or ADHD] stuff, so I can't listen to stuff for very long.”

Witherspoon also tried medication, “Ativan to calm down,” however, it didn't work out for the star. She revealed, “It would make me feel like a zombie.”

“I wasn't performing at the level I wanted to, and I wasn't as funny,” she admitted. At the same time, she was sure to add: “If you need medicine, please take the medicine … I'm not a doctor.”

She also explained, “I was like, why am I doing this? I don't feel good. Or I take an Ativan, and I was sleepy. That actually changed my whole life. And I want people to know anxiety is real.”

Witherspoon knows she's not the only one who deals with anxiety issues. In fact, she witnesses others' struggles online.

“I see girls going through it or guys going through it and they post videos, and … I wanna hug them,” Witherspoon told the podcast's hosts. 

“I want — [it] makes me wanna cry because it's very real, and you're not alone, and you can calm yourself down,” she added. “There's tools to calm yourself down.”

When it works well, film marketing can feel something like a magic trick. Maybe even a superpower?

Macon Blair's “The Toxic Avenger” recently made headlines with a marketing move that saw several outlets reporting the film had relieved at least $5 million in medical debt through a hefty donation from Cineverse that the film's ticket sales would supplement. For every additional $1 million “The Toxic Avenger” made in theaters, another million in medical bills would also disappear. The patients the campaign would help came from a wide pool of people in need — with debt resold at a fire-sale price.

 










That story — about a scrappy indie movie sticking it to America's broken healthcare system through a triumphant rush on the box office — is true, mostly. After three weeks, Cineverse has erased at least $7 million in medical debt, thanks to “The Toxic Avenger.” The activation lines up well with the themes of Macon Blair's mutant movie, starring Peter Dinklage as a new embodiment of the cult-classic hero.

“Medial debt is crippling for American families,” said Lauren McCarthy, senior vice president of marketing at Cineverse. “We've all experienced it, and we all know someone who's experienced it.”  

The final amount of medical debt forgiven by the studio could land closer to $8 million, if it makes much more in theaters, and if you account for other donations made directly. The “Toxic Avenger” activation cost just $70,000 for the studio to pull off, and plenty of other low-budget releases could be doing this, too.

“One dollar, on average, erases around a hundred dollars or more of medical debt,” explained Daniel Lempert, vice president of communications and marketing at the nonprofit Undue Medical Debt.

“It took us a while to wrap our heads around that math,” said McCarthy. “But it was one of the most exciting parts of the process [promoting this film], hearing that all this was possible.” 

“Medical debt tends to be the cheapest of the debts,” said Lempert. That's “because the demands on people, to pay for healthcare through a copayment or a deductible, are increasing.” 

Unpaid medical debt is exceedingly common in the United States. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading source for healthcare data, estimates that more than 100 million people are struggling with medical debt today. That puts the total at a staggering $220 billion or more — a number that shows just how overwhelming and urgent the crisis has become.

 










“It's very likely that figure is an undercount because this is a crisis that's very hard to track,” Lempert continued. “A lot of people will borrow from friends and family, and the number one reason people will do a GoFundMe campaign tends to be around healthcare debt.”

Facing its own challenges in a finicky market, “The Toxic Avenger” initially had trouble finding a home. Rumors that it was “unmarketable,” possibly for gratuitous violence, swirled after it premiered at Fantastic Fest in 2023. When Cineverse rescued it last year, their recent triumph with the extremely graphic “Terrifier 3” only made speculation about its content gorier.

Partnering with Undue Medical Debt was a smart course correction that played on the film's heart. “At its core, [‘The Toxic Avenger' is about] activism and optimism that makes the movie so charming,” said McCarthy. “That's why it's had this consistent fandom that's so highly engaged.” 

McCarthy said “The Toxic Avenger” cost the studio less than $5 million combined to acquire and market. By comparison, Cineverse spent $500,000 marketing “Terrifier 3,” which could have theoretically paid for $50 million in medical debt when the resale rate is $1 to every $100.

“I got an initial quote for a [another stunt] that could have been an option,” said McCarthy, who described a flash mob spectacle that would've cost $50,000 at least. “When you think about the frivolity of what that money could do, and what we are doing instead, it puts things in perspective. … We do a lot of stunts because we certainly don't put anywhere near the budget into paid media than any other studio does. We do things that activate the community online that they really respond to. There's been a lot of stunts. Then we rely on organic digital pickup and we amplify a bit, but we are relying on people to see the stunt, get excited by the stunt, think it's funny, and share it with their friends, and that makes the community bigger.” 

 










Lempert broke down “The Toxic Avenger” math as a case study for the activation strategy, examining ticket sales from opening day on August 29 to the present. The effort has been widely praised on social media, and discussing the initiative on Reddit, several fans joked about the amount of debt forgiveness that could be achieved with the amount of money Hollywood spends on big-budget films.

“People are finding catharsis in narratives about the healthcare system and inability to pay and who deserves access to care that helps keep them and their family alive,” said Lempert. You may have heard of Undue Medical Debt before now for their 2016 stunt on “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.” The gag for the political talk show was touted as one-upping Oprah for the biggest charity giveaway in television history, and it tested an important concept for Undue.

“The model is very compelling,” said Lempert. Undue has promoted two other films, including 2019's “Buffaloed” with Zoey Deutch and last year's “Ordinary Angels” with Hilary Swank.

“It speaks to how pervasive this crisis is that we have such an eclectic roster of partners,” he said. The team at Undue will work with “The Toxic Avenger” PR team to personalize literature that will be sent out to patients with forgiven debt, thanks to the film, later this year.  

 










“We're slightly slammed, so we haven't fully gotten there, but I'm hoping that it can be as delightful and surprising to the people receiving the letters as possible,” said McCarthy around the film's opening weekend. “We're going to try to cook up something that is charming enough for them to want to talk about it.”

“The Toxic Avenger” has so far made a self-reported $2.9 million for Cineverse (although lower insider estimates place it closer to $2.3 million), and Blair's mutant movie doesn't seem to have been substantively aided by the Undue partnership. 

Still, it's a clever bang-for-your-buck PR purchase from Cineverse — which continues to face blowback for the political reputation of “Terrifier 3” — and a super-charged victory for the nonprofit. 

Working with Undue Medical Debt is an opportunity for your film to become an “empathetic outlet,” Lempert said. The organizers are easy to reach through their website, and no matter what happens at the box office, discussing Americans' everyday battles with the healthcare system can “destigmatize an issue that is certainly no fault of any patients,” he said. 

“The Toxic Avenger” is coming to digital release on September 30.

A rock-brained football horror movie that's as subtle as being sacked by a 300 lb. defensive lineman and somehow only half as much fun, Justin Tipping's “Him” is a single idea stretched out for half the length of an NFL broadcast (spoiler alert: half of an eternity is still an eternity). That idea: What if football was literally a religion? Holy shit. But wait, there's more. What if the sport's chosen one narratives, hyper-zealous fandoms, and national Sunday worship services weren't an extension of Christianity, but rather a demonic inversion of it? What if becoming a god meant signing a contract with the devil, and getting there required otherwise good men to sacrifice a lot more than just their free time? That would be so crazy.

Self-evident as that concept might be to anyone who's ever heard of America, there's no denying the potential of a bold genre film that dared to confront the dehumanizing barbarity of our country's most profitable sports league; the pronounced indifference it has for the health of its players, the structural racism that continues to undergird the entire apparatus, the short-term riches it offers in order to offset the true cost of pursuing immortality. “Him” is not that film. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Less “‘The Devil's Advocate' meets ‘Any Given Sunday'” than a “Black Mirror” episode with advanced CTE, this dull look at the dark underbelly of an organization that's plainly evil on its surface wants all the glory of a championship season without so much as breaking a sweat. Its characters are constantly nattering on about the price of greatness, but the self-satisfied movie around them seems content with mediocrity from the moment it starts — every setpiece a punt that Tipping, Zack Akers, and Skip Bronkie's see-through script celebrates like a touchdown. By the time “Him” finally lets loose during a final sequence that's staged like a Super Bowl halftime show (a full surrender to post-ironic kitsch at the end of an airless film that spends 90 percent of its story on a series of training exercises), I struggled to remember what it was supposedly playing for in the first place. 

Who is Him? Will, that's a loaded question. For the last 20 years or so, legendary San Antonio Saviors (lol) quarterback and eight-time champion Isaiah White was unambiguously He. But time makes goons of us all, and while injuries have never done much to slow Isaiah down — not even the one where a bone pierced right through his leg on national TV — the fact that he's played by a 53-year-old Marlon Wayans is finally catching up with him (Wayans is always exceptional as a dramatic actor, and the shark-eyed intensity he brings to this movie is the only thing that holds it together). There are even rumors that he might be retiring at the end of the next season, and, I don't know, becoming the world's most hardcore canasta player or something. 

 










How do you replace a GOAT? Well, farmers tend to find it pretty easy, actually, but the football community turns its attention to star prospect and presumptive first draft pick Cameron Cade (“I Know What You Did Last Summer” actor, former college wide-receiver, and Pro Bowl-worthy hot person Tyriq Withers). Could he be Him?? Or “Him Kardashian,” as his agent — a delightfully shit-eating but sorely overqualified Tim Heidecker — suggests? “Himothée Chalamet??” Him Cameron? Him Wenders? Him Jong Il? Sorry, this was by far my favorite part of the movie and I'm trying to pad this thing out as much as I can. 

Cameron's dead dad certainly thought his son had greatness in Him, and Cameron has grown up hellbent on proving him right. Alas, just a few days before the combine, the generational talent is conked in the head by a giant samurai(?) who appears out of nowhere on the practice field one night, which gives Tipping the first of his many opportunities to exalt in his movie's signature Concuss-o-Vision, which harkens back to the glory days of “Romeo Must Die” by offering a kind of real-time MRI that allows us to see Cameron's brain jostle and swell every time he gets hit. His once-assured career already on the rocks now that he isn't able to show off his skills for the league's owners, Cameron is suddenly redeemed by the call of calls: Isaiah White — Him himself — has invited him to come train at his super-remote, not-at-all-evil desert compound (played by an active NASA facility in New Mexico). You know, the one that looks like a Bond villain's secret lair, adorned with ancient symbols, and surrounded by cult-like fans who jump-scare anyone who dares to drive onto the premises. Rest assured that only very normal stuff happens there.

 










From that point forward, the movie is dedicated to the week-long program that Isaiah cooks up for Cameron in his brutalist football dungeon, with each day growing more sinister than the last. Cameron doesn't have much of a personality (it must have been one of the sacrifices he made in order to be so good at football), but even a more extroverted prospect would probably default to the same deferential posture that he does at first. 

It's not particularly interesting to watch him murmur some version of “Ohhhkaaayyy…” whenever his host, idol, and mentor gives him a demented pep talk, or injects himself with his old blood, or insists that Cameron strip naked in the middle of the practice facility so that the resident sports doctor (Jim Jefferies) can give him a physical in front of the entire staff, but you can understand why the kid would be willing to chalk them up as the sort of  things that happen between episodes of “Hard Knocks.” He's barely even thrown by a run-in with Isaiah's influencer wife, who introduces herself by offering the young stud a jade green butt plug (she's played by an obviously demonic Julia Fox, whose bleached eyebrows and mirrored tops make it all too easy to imagine a Ryan Murphy-directed remake of “Rosemary's Baby”). 

 










There isn't a real flag on the play until Isaiah brings in a practice squad to run drills with Cameron, a scene that ends with one of the new guys volunteering to get hit in the face with a perfect spiral from a football throwing machine every time the prospect messes up. The self-annihilation is a bit too “It's all for you, Damien” to pass the smell test (Cameron never seems to question why Isaiah cares so much about the future of the Saviors franchise, to the point that he's willing to help the kid who's threatening to displace him as the team's starting quarterback), but maybe that's part of its appeal. People are desperate for something to believe in, especially when they have to forsake everything else before their faith can be rewarded. 

That should be a scary prospect for a kid like Cameron, who's extremely close with his mother and brother, and remains in a ride-or-die relationship with his high school sweetheart despite his newfound fame. But nothing in “Him” is scary, emotionally or otherwise. Tipping is so eager for sizzle and flash that he fumbles any tension or terror out of the face-destroying football drill, which is rendered incoherent by aggressive cuts and hyper-stylized close-ups. Later setpieces similarly try to squeeze genre thrills out of sports culture — precious few of them succeed. A visit to the hyperbaric chamber teases some “Final Destination”-like fun, but nothing comes to pass. A soak in the sauna ends with a mild shock, but the movie is too satisfied with its empty symbolism and routine hagsploitation to feel like it has any skin in the game. Much as Wayans does what he can to will the movie toward some kind of integrity or internal logic, it's hard to score any points against a broken culture in a movie that can't think of anything more ominous than the sight of a football rolling down an empty hallway.

 










At least that last bit is good for a laugh, if only unintentionally. “Him” knows that it's silly as hell, but it has no idea how to balance that against the ostensible seriousness of its social critique, which is how you wind up with leaden dialogue — “If you were starving to death in jail and offered food or freedom,” Isaiah says to Cameron, “do you really have a choice?” — sandwiched between moments of broad satire in a film where both parts of that equation have been sanded down to the nub. “Him” asks its characters ad nauseam how far they would go to be great, but this dreadfully compromised movie never even risks enough to be good. 

Universal Pictures will release “Him” in theaters on Friday, September 19.

If your definition of a comedy is “Barbie,” “Deadpool vs. Wolverine,” or “A Minecraft Movie,” the studio comedy is doing brilliantly. But if you're thinking Gen Z doesn't have its own “Bridesmaids,” “The Hangover,” or “Anchorman,” you're not alone in wondering what happened to this genre? 

Is this a joke? Perhaps not a funny one. 

At the start of July, IndieWire's chief film critic David Ehrlich declared “The Naked Gun” the most important movie of the summer. That's because it's a no-doubt-about-it studio comedy and spoof film. It's not comedy packaged with superheroes or toy and video game sales, and though it's a continuation of a popular series, it doesn't feel like a sequel cash grab. Movies like it are becoming rarer, especially at the box office. And when you have a lack of diverse options in theaters, fewer people start showing up. Theaters need movies that are monumentally dumb on purpose like “The Naked Gun” as much as they need the mega blockbusters that are monumentally dumb on accident.

So did Liam Neeson and director Akiva Schaffer save America? “The Naked Gun” has just surpassed $100 million worldwide, but only about half of that came from domestic dollars. That's a respectable number that should likely turn a profit for the studio, but it's not a mega culture-defining hit that would singlehandedly bring studio comedies off streamers and into theaters (I predict now that “The Naked Gun” will do gangbusters once it hits PVOD or Paramount+). It may also be the most successful “traditional studio comedy” in years.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






In the five years before the COVID-19 pandemic, at least six different sure-fire studio comedies surpassed $100 million at the domestic box office. That's when you filter out the animated movies, sequels, the family comedies, and some of the sequels like “Pitch Perfect” that might be better defined as musicals. 

But that half-decade produced hits like “Trainwreck,” “Girls Trip,” “Bad Moms,” “Daddy's Home” and its sequel, and “Spy.” None of those can be confused with anything other than a studio comedy in the truest sense. If we're being generous to the comedy definition, “Central Intelligence,” “Sausage Party,” and “Crazy Rich Asians” all help the case that people once came to the theater to laugh.

Post-COVID, the most successful original comedy of the last five years is the adventure/romance/comedy “The Lost City” with Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum. It's the only bona fide comedy to surpass $100 million domestic. The next biggest hits, including “Anyone but You,” “The Naked Gun,” “Ticket to Paradise,” “Cocaine Bear,” “No Hard Feelings,” and “One of Them Days,” were all in the $50-90 million range domestic (according to data via Comscore).

“There's a real drop-off in performance of comedies that were well-reviewed and well-received by audiences,” one studio distribution chief told IndieWire. “So you've got to start with, OK, what happened? How did this genre go away?”

 










The distro chief said that, while comedies started declining before COVID, the pandemic really accelerated things. The first culprit is the amount of “free comedy” available on streaming. Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max are loaded with stand-up comedy specials that don't require the same barrier to entry as the act of driving to a theater and buying a ticket.

When we raised the point to other distribution chiefs that studio comedy films have all moved to streaming, they challenged with “which ones?” “Happy Gilmore 2” is a great example of a comedy that has broken through on streaming and could have been a box office hit had it gotten the chance, though it may be the only good example.

But streamers are also littered with B-comedies that, in another era, might have done modest but forgettable business in theaters. We're looking at you, “The Pickup,” “Heads of State,” “Back in Action,” “Kinda Pregnant,” and “Summer of 69,” all of which were released this year. Those movies are reserved for streaming these days, likely for good reason.

Another distribution chief argued that the so-called “four-quadrant studio comedy” just doesn't work anymore. Today's audiences don't want just Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn paired up, they want genre films with more nuance or niche comedies like “Friendship” that can find a very targeted and passionate audience. 

 










But certain studios seem to be staying away entirely. Sony and Paramount have a few of those aforementioned hits, but Warner Bros., Disney, and Universal have been moving away from the genre and toward more IP. Studios are also staying away from a title like “Happy Gilmore 2” because of its budget. The first distribution chief speculates the Adam Sandler sequel likely cost Netflix a fortune of between $120-150 million to accommodate all the cameos, back-end deals, and special effect-driven gags. 

With the box office as depressed as it is, would that movie still be seen as a hit in theaters?

“If your budgets are reasonable, you can afford to hit singles and doubles. That's a good business. But what you can't do with a challenge genre like comedies is swing for the fences,” the first distributor said. “I wouldn't want to have that risk. If you make that movie for $75 million, maybe I'd take that risk.”

One idea floated by that distributor is to simply lengthen theatrical windows. It's the same challenge for other tentpole movies, but for comedies, the gap between theaters to streaming can be exceptionally short, and audiences are just fine waiting for them. Another potential solution: don't charge for “The Naked Gun” as much as it costs to see “Jurassic World.” That, however, would require a big shift in how exhibitors do business.

 










But if there's something that gave the distributors we spoke to hope, it's that the best comedies have phenomenal word of mouth. Look at movies like “The Hangover” or “Bridesmaids,” movies that did not open huge in their first weekend, but then saw domestic total multiples of at least six times what they first opened to. These movies were slow burn hits that people had to talk about and see, and those movies stayed successful in theaters for weeks on end.

For as hilarious as “The Naked Gun” is, it did only a respectable multiple of just over 3, as did movies like “No Hard Feelings” and “Freakier Friday.” But the poster-child of a late-blooming success story in the post-COVID era is “Anyone but You,” which has a staggering 14.72 multiple after opening to just $6 million and looking like a flop. Stars Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell famously manufactured a phony real-life romance — all while Sweeney was still engaged — that got internet sleuths buzzing and bolstered audience interest to see what chemistry might be on screen.

Another studio distribution chief said that, while comedy hasn't quite recovered from the pandemic or strikes, it's heating up. What's more, this is a “copycat business,” and the moment the next studio comedy hits it big, everyone else in town will have three similar ones in the pipeline.

 










“A movie can still open to $6 [million] and do $90 [million],” the executive said. “That to me, there's a lot of hope, because if the movie is funny, you can have a 15 multiple. If it delivers, the numbers are there, there absolutely can be another ‘Hangover.”

Clairo has found a new label home. After independently releasing her latest album, Charm, the singer-songwriter has announced her signing to Warner Music Group (WMG) subsidiary Atlantic Records. “I'm so thrilled to begin this next chapter of my musical journey with Atlantic,” Clairo said in a press statement. “From our first meeting, they immediately understood my vision, and it feels good to know I can continue to be as expressive and free with my ideas with a great new partner by my side.”

Elliot Grainge, the chairman and chief executive of Atlantic Music Group, added, “Clairo represents the rare kind of artist who reshapes the music landscape simply by being true to herself. She's not just one of the most important songwriters of her era, she's an artist whose work and aesthetic is truly unique. As a leading voice in music today, we are honored that she has chosen the Atlantic family to be part of her next chapter.”

Clairo began her career with Fader Label, which is under the Universal Music Group (UMG) umbrella. Through the label, she shared Diary 001, Immunity, and Sling, the latter of which was a co-release with another UMG label, Republic Records. In 2021, before releasing Sling, Clairo also signed an exclusive, worldwide publishing agreement with Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG).

Massive Attack intend to pull their music from Spotify. The band shared the news in a statement that also expressed solidarity with a new cultural boycott initiative called No Music for Genocide. The movement calls for artists, labels, and rights-holders to remove music from streaming platforms in Israel, via geo-blocking, in protest of the country's ongoing assault of Gaza, and Massive Attack intend to participate in the boycott.

“Unconnected to this initiative & in light of the (reported) significant investments by it's CEO in a company producing military munition drones & AI technology intergrated into fighter aircraft, Massive Attack have made a separate request to our label that our music be removed from the Spotify streaming service in all territories,” Massive Attack wrote.

“In the separate case of Spotify, the economic burden that has long been placed on artists is now compounded by a moral & ethical burden, whereby the hard-earned money of fans & the creative endeavours of musicians ultimately funds lethal, dystopian technologies,” the band continued. “Enough is more than enough. Another way is possible.”

Numerous artists have removed their music from Spotify in recent weeks, largely in protest of chief executive Daniel Ek and his venture capital fund Prima Materia's investments in Helsing, a defense company that currently operates in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, and sells software that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to inform military decisions. Among the acts to pull music from Spotify are: Hotline TNT, Young Widows, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, WU LYF, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Xiu Xiu, and Deerhoof.

Onstage, Manchester four-piece Maruja conduct a series of distinct rituals. Like Moses commanding the Red Sea, sax player Joseph Carroll might gesture for the crowd to part down the middle, then join them to kick off the first song. Singer and guitarist Harry Wilkinson will peel off his shirt and pump through a few pushups at the top of “Break the Tension.” Drummer Jacob Hayes and bassist Matt Buonaccorsi may wave their arms in slow motion, like mediums leading a seance. The band performing these varied acts—signaling sacred communion one moment, overt masculinity the next—boomerangs between free jazz, hip-hop, hardcore punk, and alt-rock balladry, sometimes within the same song. On their debut album Pain to Power, Maruja aim to bottle their intense live act and improvisational spirit. Their ferocity mostly remains intact, but it's an overall disjointed listen, with slower tracks that skid and sputter next to more bracing pieces.

Pain to Power is a testament to Maruja's manifold influences. Their sound draws from various UK scenes of the past decade-plus; in particular, the post-punk and experimental rock championed by bands like Shame, Yard Act, Black Midi, and Squid and the teeming London jazz community that has nurtured artists like Shabaka Hutchings, Nubya Garcia, and Moses Boyd. Wilkinson, who sometimes raps in fast-paced, gasping measures, has also cited homegrown MCs Lee Scott, Jehst, and Little Simz as influences. Pain to Power's best songs sound mesmerizing, as if elements of each style were hurled around with speed and abandon, like different pigments slashing against a Pollock canvas.

Kicking off as an industrial punk grinder, “Break the Tension” morphs into agit-jazz as Carroll swoops in with belching and fluttering saxophone. Maruja fold in spectral backing vocals, racing percussion, and trunk-rattling bass, building to a pressure point that never lets up. Album opener “Bloodsport” is even more exhilarating, as Wilkinson raps over rim shots that tick like a bomb and bass strings with the heft of truck tires. “Shame so strong wanna wash away with blood,” Wilkinson barks. “Blood calls blood, will we ever bleed enough?” He leaps between steady spoken word and raw-tonsiled screams, a feat that recalls contemporary hardcore a la Show Me the Body, but also '90s heavies Rage Against the Machine.

Like both of those bands, Maruja invokes political issues in song and onstage, frequently leading their crowds in “Free Palestine” chants and reflecting on oppressive power structures within their lyrics. The epic, 10-minute “Look Down on Us” deals with the latter, criticizing the lords of late-stage capitalism—CEOs, tech-titans, and the suits that land on the front page of Forbes magazine. “Picking bones through their teeth caught between the meat,” Wilkinson rasps. “See the blood dripping down to the claws on their feet.” He rolls select “Rs,” invoking Zack de la Rocha and Johnny Rotten.

Wilkinson's lyrics are best when they are whittled to specific visuals like the villains populating “Look Down on Us.” Unfortunately, he can get lost in platitudes that sound cribbed from self-help books: “The truth is hard to find hidden deep within one's aura;” “My universe determined by my fucking self belief;” “Intuition we are brave inner vision not afraid.” Where many of these phrases are buried in brash and invigorating arrangements, anthemic single “Saorise” veers into cheesier territory as Wilkinson repeatedly croons, “It's our differences that make us beautiful” over twinkling guitar and surging sax riffs. Despite the band's earnest intentions, “Saorise” feels awkwardly crammed into Pain to Power—a sluggish ballad with a trite slogan wedged between thrilling genre experiments.

Wilkinson has compared Maruja's concerts to “having a fucking exorcism.” “The most beautiful part to me is to be vulnerable in front of people and to be confident in being like that,” he said in a 2023 interview. The band has also discussed their slightly unconventional approach to writing and rehearsal—namely, that they don't do much of either. Maruja's method is rooted in improvisation; they never play a song the same way twice. The best songs on Pain to Power capture that electric, instantaneous energy, where everything collides in delightful chaos. Maruja only lose that alchemic touch when they overthink the process.

“Messy” wasn't just a hit single for Lola Young; it was also a manifesto. The bratty pop-rock song that dominated TikTok in late 2024 and early 2025 documents the British singer's inner dialogue as she chafes against impossibly high standards. “A thousand people I could be for you, and you hate the fucking lot,” Young rasps in her defiant south London twang, alternately belting and gently teasing out the line. It's spiky yet wounded, capturing the turbulence of a toxic relationship in full swing. Young wrote her third album, I'm Only Fucking Myself, during the song's unexpected meteoric rise (in January this year, it was the most-streamed song by a British artist in the world) and a stint in rehab. Here, she leans further into her commitment to warts-and-all pop music, producing several songs that feel just as arresting as her viral moment.

Though “Messy” seems addressed to a critical partner or parent, you could also read Young's bristling self-ownership through the lens of her career: the long road of publicly carving out her identity as a musician after having been discovered as a teenager. She graduated from the BRIT School in 2018, a selective but free specialist school for music and performing arts, notably attended by the likes of Adele, Amy Winehouse, and RAYE. Soon afterwards, she caught the attention of Nick Shymansky, Winehouse's former manager, and Nick Huggett, who signed Adele. Both signed up to her management team (Shymansky is still her manager today); the following year, she inked a deal with Island Records.

Her first releases were downbeat, soulful singles that seemed to play to the masses. In 2021, she even completed the British hazing ritual of recording a tear-streaked piano cover of a vintage pop song for department store John Lewis's annual Christmas advert. But by her breakthrough 2024 record This Wasn't Meant For You Anyway, she'd developed a disarming candor—she's described it as learning “to write as if I was speaking to somebody,” a quality she sharpens on I'm Only Fucking Myself.

The record documents a life in chaotic transition, including Young's recovery from cocaine addiction—a non-linear journey that doesn't rest on feel-good affirmations or straightforward resolution, but unblinkingly faces both the highs and the lows. The album's first full track is the anthemic “FUCK EVERYONE,” an indie-sleaze ode to casual sex and hedonism, before breaking into a strut with the psychedelic-tinged funk of “One Thing."" Although anxieties about exposure and self-hatred cling to the lyrics like shadows, the songs' production—shaped by Solomonophonic (SZA, Remi Wolf)—fosters a no-strings-attached, devil-may-care breeziness before the album careens into darker territory.

The comedown is brutal, with Young at her most raw as she writes about avoidance and addiction. On “CAN WE IGNORE IT? :(,” over a spider's web of listless guitar distortion, she begs for oblivion before the chorus surges with desperation: “If you love me like you say,” she sings, “You'll let me escape.” The album's jewel in the crown, “d£aler,” scans on the surface as a pared-back '80s pop song, but pulsates with a self-destructive yearning to skip town and get high. Throughout the record, Young's voice is an emotional powerhouse, whether she's screaming her throat red on the grunge-rock ballad “SPIDERS” or tenderly whisper-crooning on the twangy “why do i feel better when i hurt you?”

Young's chatty style, though, can sometimes feel a little too unvarnished. That lack of censorship is part of her appeal, but it allows clunky lines like “I like a dopamine hit more than a fat kid loves cake” to slip through the net on the otherwise raucous and sunny “Not Like That Anymore.” Then there's the tautologically titled “SAD SOB STORY! :),” which berates an ex for not processing their anger in therapy via overstuffed, diaristic verses. Young is stronger when she turns her lens on herself, as on the forlorn “why do i feel better...,” which offers a necessarily vulnerable counterpoint to the rest of the album's full-throttle fuck-you.

There's something nostalgic about Young, who feels much closer in spirit to the outspoken rebellion of Winehouse or Lily Allen than the puritanical, sober, “clean girl” stereotype of her generation. “d£aler,” with its funk rhythm, certainly feels timeless and bare-faced enough that it could be her own “Smile” or “Rehab.” Perhaps the character she's portraying—the authentic, potty-mouthed pop starlet who subverts the formula—is nothing new; perhaps by now, it's even become its own kind of formula. But I'm Only Fucking Myself arrives against a backdrop of pristine pop like a cannonball, cracking the veneer of our sanitized and pearl-clutching cultural moment with refreshing honesty and messiness.

Pavement have just released Hecklers Choice: Big Gums and Heavy Lifters, their new best-of compilation; physical editions will follow on November 14 via Matador. What's more, the band has also announced that vinyl and CD versions of the soundtrack to their oddball movie Pavements—a blend of documentary, biopic, and mockumentary, all directed by Alex Ross Perry—will arrive on November 14, too. Stream their new compilation album, and check out a live video of “Grounded,” filmed at the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, below.

Hecklers Choice is the second best-of compilation of Pavement's career, arriving 15 years after their 2010 collection Quarantine the Past. The updated tracklist includes songs that have since become modern classics of the band's career, including the Spotify algorithm favorite–turned–TikTok hit “Harness Your Hopes.” Pre-orders for vinyl and CD versions of Hecklers Choice are currently ongoing.

Pavements (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is also currently available to order. Compiled by the band and Robert Greene, the movie's producer and editor, Pavements' official soundtrack combines live and rehearsal recordings from the band's 2021 reunion tour, dialogue snippets from the movie, scenes from the fake Oscar-bait biopic Range Life, and cast recordings from the Slanted! Enchanted! jukebox musical.

One afternoon in Chelsea, during New York Fashion Week, Feng pulls up to a runway event looking like a hungover college freshman. The 19-year-old, part of an emerging wave of UK underground rap getting hyped up like the '03 NBA draft class, has bags under his eyes. His hair is in a messy bun. He's wearing a wrinkled white tee, a colorful scarf he bought off Depop, black skinny jeans, and house slippers with the heads of stuffed teddy bears on the top. He glances at the world of high fashion—a mix of magazine editors, brand ambassadors, influencers, models, young rap darlings, and a Los Angeles Lakers role player—and asks his manager, Christian, “Why's everyone dressed so serious?” Christian responds, “'Cause everyone is putting on a fuckin' show,” as they both bust out laughing.

After the collection is shown, Feng shuffles around the event space shaking a few hands and snapping photos on his iPhone 5, which makes all of his pictures look like he time-traveled back to 2013. As we make our way outside, he seems curious but relatively unimpressed by Manhattan, referring to it a few times as “corporate.” He's eager to get to Flatbush, where, later in the night, he's throwing a house party in the first-floor apartment of a brownstone he gained access to through various Instagram DMs. He hopes that it doesn't get busted up by the NYPD, especially because he put up some of his own money and turned down an offer from an energy drink company to sponsor the party. “Not everything needs to be branded; not everything has to be about making money—not that money isn't important,” he says. “Right now, I'm just tryna go out and hang out with cool people and take cool pictures of their outfits and listen to music and make music about it.”

That's pretty much how his breakout mixtape, February's What the Feng, came about. With the fadedness of old Piff Gang and the coming-of-age spirit of early Mac Miller, the tape is mostly stories of Feng, who is from south London's Croydon neighborhood, and his friends running around town, going to parties, meeting girls, and staying out too late. I think I like it so much because it reminds me of being a teenager in New York, where the public transportation made the world feel limitless, even if most of that freedom was used just to try to sneak into bars.

What the Feng is full of heartfelt and earnest writing, sometimes with the slightly corny ultra-positivity of one of those guys who gets drunk and tells all his friends how much he loves them. “There's some lyrics on there that cringe me out now,” says Feng, with a blushing smile on his face. “But I don't think that's a bad thing. I take the mundane things and feelings in life and make them interesting. I know there's people out there who think I'm lame for it, but I don't care. I think I'm cool.”

Despite being a rapper of the internet, Feng still writes with great specificity and hyperlocality. To me, rap is always a regional thing, so much about where you're from, and you get that from his music.“East Croydon, where some man wanna end me/Whitgift Centre with the peng ting/She look better than her friends are/Took an Uber XL to where her ends are,” he raps on “Memories” in a washed out deadpan that is part Lucki, part just the reality of recording on a cheap microphone.

Feng grew up with two older brothers with more than a decade on him, which explains why he has the taste of a 30-year-old with the 2011 XXL Freshman cover still on his wall. When he was a kid, his oldest brother introduced Feng to rappers like Kid Cudi, Drake, and A$AP Rocky, whose hazy, chopped instrumental choices on Live.Love.A$AP feel especially formative on the glitchy cloud-rap beats—produced by himself, Boxxy, and Arizona—of What the Feng. Meanwhile, he absorbed other stuff, like the political dancefloor pop of M.I.A. (“I love pop that also feels like a middle finger to the pop scene”) and UK drill music, which was inescapable. He tells a story about being on the soccer team (he supports Crystal Palace, for those wondering) in high school, where he was apparently a stud midfielder. “We were the team from Cro', so we were the rough guys who'd go into a rich area and fuck them up,” he remembers, though it's really not that long ago. “Then we'd leave blasting Unknown T and Digga D.”

Soon enough, he traded in his boots for BandLab. It all started with him having a YouTube channel that grew from gaming videos to teaching himself FL Studio to playing around with cameras and then eventually to laying down glazed raps straight on his iPhone. His self-directed music video style has been a big part of the appeal; “Walk in the Park,” which feels like he's having flashbacks over a drill beat with the drums stripped away, has the shadowy, low-budget feel of vintage SpaceGhostPurrp, while the bright-colored, fashion-forward “Kids From the West” looks straight out of Skins. For those who lived it, the nostalgia-bait might feel entirely aesthetic, criticism you could extend to much of the current UK underground. Though, in Feng's case, I think these videos really hammer home the vibe of his music: a bunch of rebellious teens who look like they raided the racks of American Eagle and Zumiez getting into as much shit as they can before it's time to go get jobs.

What I worry about for this UK underground scene is how this boom and sudden interest (from labels, influencers, and content creators) might flatten the regional uniqueness of the music in an attempt to crossover into the United States. I already felt that in YT's Oi!, which isn't nearly as grounded as earlier mixtape #StillSwaggin. And I thought about that as I pulled up to a Fakemink pop-up on the Lower East Side. Fakemink has recently been co-signed by Drake, Frank Ocean, and Timothée Chalamet, so, no matter how you feel about the music, it's all shrouded in marketability and clout. There's so much money and fame within reach for these rappers; how does that change the music? “Yeah, people are throwin' lots of fuckin' money at us right now,” admits Feng, sitting in a West Village park. “But I don't need it. I'm making money on my own. I just need to be 100% sure before doing anything, and, right now, I don't feel 100% sure about anything but making a project that's me and having my friends around me.”

Later that evening, Feng changes into a Been Trill tee, the likes of which I haven't seen since the A$AP Mob days, and Rubik's Cube Vans that the Pack would fuck with. He's roaming around Lower Manhattan with his friends Jah, who grew up a few minutes away from him in Croydon, and Llondon, another artist, killing time until the party has to be set up. They eat some chain barbecue and do fake New York accents and wonder what “tings” will be at the function later. They stop by the 9/11 memorial where they do an earnest group prayer and then argue with me about Jay-Z not being as popular worldwide as Drake. They take the subway to Flatbush and, once on the Ave., Feng lets out a sigh of relief: “Now this somewhere I could live,” he says as the smell of jerk chicken hits his nose.

On the first floor of the massive three-story brownstone, all of the furniture is cleared out and there's nothing in the space but a DJ setup and platters of chicken tenders on the kitchen counter. I leave for a moment, only to come back to a place packed with early twentysomethings in YMCMB snapbacks, shuttershades, and anything you might expect to see at American Apparel. Everyone I meet is carrying either a digital camera, a cigarette, or a bottle of Smirnoff vodka. There's a dude throwing back a tallboy in the empty bathtub. Jah is at the door checking IDs. Llondon is on the stoop complaining to me about the guy-to-girl ratio while the DJ blasts Opium stuff and Xaviersobased. Feng is sitting on the ledge of the steps, snapping pics and flirting with every woman who comes his way.

I meet the owner of the apartment, a nervous 23-year-old whose parents left him the crib so they could move to Long Island. He's wearing a suit to try to be presentable if the cops come. Surely enough, things start to get a little out of control. Dudes who can't get in get into screaming matches with Jah at the door, and the party extends out into the street where neighbors start peeking out their windows and standing on their porches shaking their heads. At some point, Chicago bop revivalist Thirteendegrees ° randomly pops up and performs a few songs off his mixtape Clique City Vol. 2. Feng has a drunken smile on his face the entire time.

Around one in the morning, the police do come. A couple kids try to shoot a music video in front of the cop car and another grabs the DJ's mic and attempts to kick off a “Fuck 12” chant that doesn't stick. The de facto apartment owner brushes off his suit and goes to talk to the officers, which lasts about five seconds before he starts yelling, “Everyone get the fuck out!” The music cuts off, and, gradually, everyone leaves, murmuring about a rave happening not too far away. I find Feng joyfully chatting up another girl. “I hope you're having fun; that's what it's all about,” he says to me, disappearing into the crowd. Before I leave, I walk past a few kids trying to light leftover joints they found on the ground and another group playing Fakemink out of their whip. I take a glance at the empty living room where nothing is left on the sticky floor but popped balloons, streamers, and empty bottles of Twisted Tea. It wasn't a perfect party, but at least there were no brand activations.

	President Donald Trump and his family are building a multinational cryptocurrency, real estate, and licensing empire on the back of his presidency, catapulting his estimated worth by billions. 


	The net worths of individual members of Congress are estimated to range between the tens of thousands of dollars and more than half a billion. The justices of the Supreme Court are estimated to hold a collective net worth of over $64 million. 


	Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.) is introducing legislation to try and combat the culture of political profiteering that has become endemic to virtually every corner of the federal government — and supercharged under the second Trump administration. “If you have egotistical, narcissistic, corrupt people in government, you will have an egotistical, narcissistic, and corrupt government,” Kim says. “But if you have people who are dedicated to public service, people who are honest, you can have an altogether different kind of government. I want the American people to see the choice.”

	











	On Thursday, Kim unveiled “The Restoring Trust in Public Servants Act,” which would prevent America's most powerful elected and appointed officials across all three branches of government from enriching themselves off their offices. The bill would prevent members of Congress (as well as their families and employees), the president, vice president, Senate-confirmed political appointees, and judicial officers — including members of the Supreme Court — from trading stocks and participating in a host of financial activities that could present conflicts of interest. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	During the second Trump administration, profiteering off one's elected office is no longer viewed as an impropriety, but the standard of conduct set by the president himself. Sources close to Trump told Rolling Stone in May that the president has privately complained that it was “stupid” not to cash in harder during his first term, and is making up for lost time. Already this term we've seen the Trump family build out a blossoming crypto empire, launch all manner of licensing deals, and announce new international real estate investments.

	The new bill is similar to anti-corruption legislation Kim introduced during his time in the House, but the new measure expands the category of covered assets to include crypto and other “digital assets,” as well as the scope of public officials subject to the ban. 


	In addition, the act would prevent members of Congress from accepting outside earned income and from serving on the board of an association or corporation, with limited exceptions for nonprofit work. The congressional lobbying ban would be expanded to cover the entirety of a former lawmaker's life. 


	“I know people in Congress where if you're a corporation, you can't get a meeting with that person unless you donate from your corporate PAC to them. I find that to be wholly unacceptable,” Kim tells Rolling Stone. 


	“We should just have a single standard,” Kim says. “Everyone's a public servant. Everyone swears the oath in exactly the same way, everyone's trying to protect and defend the Constitution by virtue of our jobs and our oath. We should also just have a single standard when it comes to ethics, when it comes to our behavior and our role here.” 


	Kim was elected to the Senate to fill the seat vacated by disgraced former Sen. Bob Menendez — who is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence after being convicted on federal corruption charges. Among his peers, Kim has perhaps the best vantage point of the chaos and distrust that the financial abuse conducted by those in power can sow among a community.

	Menendez was caught with literal bars of gold in his closet, but the investigations into his foreign dealings revealed a history of leveraging his position in the Senate to secure bribes and other boons. While Menendez ran afoul of federal law, his actions are only a few degrees removed from the open graft being normalized in the White House. As the president openly flaunts his business dealings abroad and at home — even hosting a pay-for-access dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort for investors in his cryptocurrency schemes — it's clear that existing legislation and enforcement mechanisms are grossly insufficient. 

	











	“It shows just how limited our system of checks and balances really is,” Kim says. “So much of our checks and balances as a country really rested on norms of behavior. When you're dealing with someone like the president who just doesn't abide by that, you see how the system really falls short to be able to address that.” 


	The lack of established, universal, and widely enforceable rules restricting public officials ability to profit off investments and other speculative activities both during their time in office and after has long been an issue — see the stock indexes tracking the stock trading activities of House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her husband. Past attempts to enact trading bans have stalled, been amended into effective uselessness, or devolved into performative political bickering aimed at individual members. In the second Trump era, billionaires are seemingly able to directly purchase favor and influence at the White House, and graft is the name of the game.


	In Kim's view, the heart of public service has been lost in the dysfunction. 


	“I am trying to counter that kind of broader attack and assault on public service that I feel is going to be damaging for generations,” he says. “I'm simultaneously trying to encourage people in public service while trying to clean up and restore trust in what it means to be a public.”

	Kim recounts a former boss at the State Department, where he worked in his early career, who told him that “you don't have good government unless you have good people working in government.”


	“I love this job so much, I could do this for free,” he adds. “We only need 535 people in Congress out of a country of 340 million people. Surely we can find 435 in the House and 100 in the Senate that are willing to say, ‘I am so honored to do this job, I am happy to divest and assure the American people that I'm doing this in the right way.'”

	Sinclair will replace the Jimmy Kimmel Live! time slot on Friday with a tribute special to Charlie Kirk. The company has also demanded that Kimmel apologize to Kirk's family, and donate to them and Turning Point USA, which was co-founded by Kirk.


	The announcement was made shortly after ABC said is was suspending the late-night show “indefinitely” after both Sinclair and Nexstar kicked it off its U.S. stations following Kimmel's comments about Kirk's assassination during a Monday monologue.


	“Mr. Kimmel's remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country,” said Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith in a statement. “We believe broadcasters have a responsibility to educate and elevate respectful, constructive dialogue in our communities. We appreciate FCC Chairman Carr's remarks today and this incident highlights the critical need for the FCC to take immediate regulatory action to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.”

	











	The company also stated that it will not lift the suspension on Jimmy Kimmel Live! “until formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability,” and called on Kimmel to apologize to Kirk's family, as well as make “a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk family and Turning Point USA.”

	Earlier today, the Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, publicly demanded licensed broadcasters to stop airing Kimmel's show. “I think that it's really sort of past time that a lot of these licensed broadcasters themselves push back on Comcast and Disney and say, ‘Listen, we are going to preempt, we are not going to run Kimmel anymore, until you straighten this out because we, we licensed broadcaster, are running the possibility of fines or license revocation from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion,'” Carr said when speaking with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson.

	











	Kimmel is the latest late-night host to be yanked from a major network. In July, CBS announced its decision to abruptly end Stephen Colbert's The Late Show in 2026. In a previous statement, the network claimed the cancellation was financial. However, the decision to end Colbert's show garnered criticism, since the announcement came days after he criticized Paramount, CBS' parent company, over its decision to agree to a settlement with President Donald Trump.

	As music memoirs go, Yusuf/Cat Stevens' Cat on the Road to Findout couldn't have been more aptly titled. Over the last nearly 60 years, few in pop have traveled such a twisty path, as the bearded pop troubadour went from Cat Stevens, teen idol, to Cat Stevens, becalmed balladeer, to Yusuf Islam, man of religion and occasional music. Along the way, he battled tuberculosis, almost drowned, had a fling with Carly Simon, and became one of the first major pop stars to be canceled after he weighed in (in ways he felt were misunderstood, mishandled, or misinterpreted) on the Ayatollah Khomeini declaring a fatwah against writer Salman Rushdie in 1989.


	That tale is laid out in the book, published Thursday in the U.K. and Oct. 7 in this country. Below, some tea from the tillerman.


	How did Steven Georgiou become Cat Stevens in 1965? As he writes, part of the inspiration came from then-current film titles like Cat Ballou and What's New Pussycat? and partly from a hit at the time called “Walkin' My Cat Named Dog.” A girlfriend also told him he looked like a cat when she saw him reclining on a couch. As he says, “All I did was add ‘Cat'  to my first name, shifting Steven from head to tail: Hey-ho! ‘Cat Stevens' was born.” That girlfriend — Christine, whom he calls his first “real love” — would also inspire the decidedly non-catty classic “The First Cut Is the Deepest.”












	In 1966, Yusuf scored his first hit with the whimsical symphonic pop of “I Love My Dog.” There was only one problem: He didn't own such an animal. “Journalists were certain to pounce on me with probing questions about my own fluffy, beloved friend,” Yusuf writes. Luckily, he was walking the streets of London's Soho district one night and came upon a stray black dachshund tied to a street post. Yusuf quickly adopted the dog, whom he named Willemina, and now had an actual pet he could talk about while promoting the record.

	In 1971, Yusuf met Carly Simon, who was booked to open his show at the Troubadour club in L.A. “Touring puts you in sensitive, close contact with those journeying with you,” he writes, adding, “It was difficult to keep away from Carly,” and the two “got to know each other extremely well.” In her own memoir, Simon confirmed that “Anticipation” arose from the time she was waiting for him to show up at her place for a date. She's never revealed the inspiration behind “You're So Vain” (only to a TV executive who paid $50,000 to charity to find out), but Yusuf, jokingly or not, thinks he knows. “I never understood the endless hide-and-seek of finding out who ‘You're So Vain' was about, bro! Naturally, I knew it was me!” (Bonus info: We also learn from his book that Yusuf is not immune to using the term “bro.”)


	As Cat Stevens, Yusuf came to embody the peace-loving, soul-searching stereotype of the Seventies troubadour. But as a child, he writes, he admits he “gravitated toward any danger-filled subjects of a magnetic, action-driven nature involving as much violence, destruction, and death as possible,” like horror films. After seeing the film version of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities, set during the French Revolution, Yusuf recalls building miniature balsa-wood guillotines as a hobby. (They could have come in handy for hard-headed women … and men.) This odd pastime did also serve to bond him with music, though: He says he would listen to his sister's LP collection while making them.


	After he finished Tea for the Tillerman, the album that installed him in the soft-rock pantheon along with Simon, James Taylor, and a select few others, Yusuf was informed by label head Chris Blackwell that “Wild World” was an obvious hit. But Yusuf says he felt the song was too “verse and chorus,” and thought someone else, namely reggae artist Jimmy Cliff, should record it instead, with Yusuf himself as producer. Cliff was up for it, but apparently nothing more came of the idea, and Yusuf's original version of the song wound up going top 20.

	Yusuf writes that he was approached by director Hal Ashby about contributing songs to his 1971 movie about the bond between a young guy obsessed with death and a quirky elderly woman who loved life. Yusuf says that in addition to hearing some of his songs in a rough edit of the film, he was asked to write new ones and dashed off demos of two semi-competed tunes — “If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out” and “Don't Be Shy” — with the idea of finishing them later. Instead, Ashby loved the raw takes and used those instead.

	











	Why didn't a soundtrack with all his songs appear until 2022, more than 50 years later? As Yusuf writes, he wasn't thrilled with the idea of a premature hits package, so he and his lawyers decided not to give the go-ahead for a companion album. (As far as lead actress Ruth Gordon singing “Sing Out” and playing piano, he writes, “She sounded dreadfully out of tune, but that was the way Hal wanted. So be it.”)


	To support his mathematically baffling concept album Numbers, Stevens, then at the peak of his pop moment, went on the road with an elaborate set that included what he calls a “white sail backdrop,” a “sparkly red-top piano and automatic pop-up stool.” The concerts would open with Stevens popping out of four colored boxes. He hired magicians to open the shows (whose tricks, he says, included “sawing a luscious blonde lady in half”). The final touring troupe included not just musicians, crew, and magicians but “countless doves and rabbits.” And let's not forget about the tiger that would “dramatically appear” in a cage on the stage.


	Following a near-drowning incident in Malibu in 1975, Yusuf began his road to a new faith, which, as he writes, involved adjustments for everyone. His name change to Yusuf Islam wasn't too difficult: “That would be easy for my family and English-speaking friends to pronounce,” he writes. But his on-the-road rock & roll lifestyle took a hit: “There was no more room for ‘Freelove & Goodbye' relationships, that sort of idea was not allowed in Islam.” While making Back to Earth, his last “Cat Stevens” album, he would take prayer breaks, which was “quite tough, especially if something was really cooking, musically.”


	For that album cover, he also decided to announce his conversion by way of using a “decorative gold Arabic calligraphy” for the credits. But, as he writes, the government of Malaysia was not thrilled with seeing “Allah” in calligraphy on the cover and asked for it to be removed. At his urging, Yusuf's record company slapped a sticker over that part of the cover and removed it from later pressings. Collector's item alert!


	According to Yusuf, he was invited to participate in the 1985 all-star charity concert, in London. By then. he had given away his musical instruments, hadn't performed live in years, and admits he was “scared witless” when he arrived at Wembley. Still, he prepped a new song, “In the End,” that he would perform a cappella. As the day dragged on, he was told that John's set was running longer than anyone had expected, and Yusuf's song was cut from the lineup. As he writes, “My heart sank like a rock.” When he arrived back home and watched the end of the broadcast thanks to a time delay, he saw his name listed in the closing credits.

	











	The incident that Yusuf writes would be a “blistering asteroid” in his life started with an Islamic scholar who shared portions of Rushdie's book, which the singer found to be “unbelievably rude and offensive.” Yusuf writes that he contacted the book's publisher, asking for it be pulled from circulation and also spoke with Islamic scholars, who told him that any retribution would not involve vigilantism.

	During a subsequent public talk about this conversation, he writes that an “undercover journalist” from a tabloid asked him if thought Rushdie should be put to death for his book. Yusuf writes that he addressed the question “as openly as possible” but “forgot to mention the questionability of the dreaded fatwah.” In the book, Yusuf feels a public apology he wrote was largely ignored and that the press went with its take that he was “an unrepentant supporter of the ayatollah and his fatwah.… Alas, I was not knowledgeable or eloquent enough to explain my stance on the matter as clearly at the time.”  


	According to his memoir, what he calls a “shadow banning” by some journalists simply pushed him into even greater devotion to his faith and studying “the status of fatwahs.” But Yusuf still looks back at that incident as “an onslaught of misunderstanding and hatred like nothing I'd ever experienced — before or since that day.”

Marc Maron and Wanda Sykes were among the many to raise serious concerns about the threat to free speech after ABC's decision to indefinitely pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! following pressure from the Trump administration.


	Sykes was set to be a guest on Kimmel on Wednesday night, but ABC made its decision before the show was taped. “He didn't end the Ukraine war, or solve Gaza, within his first week,” Sykes said of Trump in a video on Instagram. “But he did end freedom of speech within his first year. Hey, for those of you who pray, now's the time to do it. Love you, Jimmy.”


	Maron, who's become an increasingly vocal critic of comedians who inadvertently, or outwardly, cater to the right, shared a particularly blunt video on TikTok that was at once a dire warning and a call to action. “This is government censorship. This is the Trump administration coming after people who speak out against him,” he said. “This is the end of it. If you have any concern or belief in real freedom or the Constitution and free speech — this is it. This is the deciding moment. This is what authoritarianism looks like right now in this country. It's happening.”

	











	Maron also put ABC's decision in the context of the free-speech debates that have been swirling around the comedy world the past few years, and urged those ostensible “free-speech warriors” to take note. “This isn't about saying the r-word or the t-word or any of that,” he said. “This is government censorship. This isn't fucking Twitter. This isn't people getting canceled because of a cultural pile-on. This is the United States government silencing voices that they disagree with.… Look, if they can come for Kimmel, they can come for anybody. This is happening. It's time to act, figure it out, find a way, come together. Push back. Because if this goes, it's over.”

	











	Emmy-winning Hacks star Jean Smart shared a photo on Instagram of herself and Kimmel, writing that she was “horrified” with ABC's decision. “What Jimmy said was FREE speech, not hate speech,” she said. “People seem to only want to protect free speech when it suits THEIR agenda. Though I didn't agree at ALL with Charlie Kirk; his shooting death sickened me; and should have sickened any decent human being. What is happening to our country?”

	Others to express their shock and dismay online include Ben Stiller, who simply tweeted, “This isn't right.” Mike Birbiglia, echoing Maron's sentiment about the free-speech debates in comedy, added, “I've spent a lot of time in public and private defending comedians I don't agree with. If you're a comedian and you don't call out the insanity of pulling Kimmel off the air — don't bother spouting off about free speech anymore.” 


	California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the Republican Party “does not believe in free speech,” adding, “Buying and controlling media platforms. Firing commentators. Canceling shows. These aren't coincidences. Its's coordinated. And it's dangerous.… They are censoring you in real time.” 


	Barack Obama echoed this sentiment, saying, “After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like.”


	He added, “This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it.”

	In a video posted to social media, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said, “If you don't raise your voices right now about the assault on free speech, about Donald Trump's decision to, disgustingly, exploit the murder of Charlie Kirk so as to try to permanently render powerless and impotent those who politically oppose him, there may be no democracy to save a year from now.”


	The decision to pull Kimmel came after conservative outcry over a joke the host made during a recent monologue about the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk. Among those criticizing Kimmel was Trump's Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, who called on licensed broadcasters to stop airing Kimmel's show. Not long after, Nexstar and Sinclair — two giant media conglomerates that own myriad ABC affiliates around the country — announced their decision to preempt Kimmel. ABC made its decision to pull the show soon after.

	Dozens of Americans across a variety of professional fields have been fired or put on leave from their jobs after conservatives contacted their employers over social media comments they made about right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last week, following his assassination. Others have been punished for small acts of defiance — everyone from an Office Depot worker in Michigan who was sacked for refusing to print tribute flyers with Kirk's face on them, to late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, who ABC suspended after he seemed to criticize how MAGA supporters responded to Kirk's death. Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a backlash even within the Trump base for saying the administration would crack down on “hate speech,” suggesting the Justice Department could prosecute businesses and individuals on those grounds. But Vice President J.D. Vance has endorsed the idea of calling the employers of anyone seen as dancing on Kirk's grave.


	Kirk, for the record, wrote on X last year: “Hate speech does not exist legally in America. There's ugly speech. There's gross speech. There's evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment.” In practice, though, he and Turning Point USA, the non-profit he co-founded and led, could be openly retaliatory against those they disagreed with — the organization has long maintained, for example, a “Professor Watchlist” of educators they claim push liberal propaganda and discriminate against conservative students in the classroom. College faculty members have called it an attempt to intimidate and inspire harassment.

	It's no great shock, then, that Kirk's allies and admirers took it upon themselves to surveil public reactions to his death, singling out those who expressed a lack of sympathy or outright contempt for the activist — or simply quoted his most inflammatory statements. Right-wing influencers have relentlessly campaigned for these people to lose their jobs, tagging their employers' online accounts and inundating their places of work with aggrieved emails and phone calls. But the most concerted effort on this front came in the form of a website initially called CharliesMurderers.com, which was accessible as of last Thursday, the day after Kirk was assassinated. Billed by its anonymous organizers as “a searchable database of 20,000 people celebrating Charlie Kirk's murder,” the page provided, along with names and photos, personal information such as an individual's social media handles, employer, city of residence, and email address.

	Rachel Gilmore, a Canadian journalist and podcaster, appeared at the very top of the list, merely for theorizing on the day Kirk was shot that this violence would result in more of the same. “Terrified to think of how far-right fans of Kirk, aching for more violence, could very well turn this into an even more radicalizing moment,” she posted on X. “Will they now believe their fears have been proven right and feel they have a right to ‘retaliate,' regardless of who actually was behind the initial shooting?” 


	For Gilmore, the effect of being put on blast by CharliesMurderers.com over this measured comment was swift and frightening. “I was getting death threats, rape threats, and people claimed to know where I live,” Gilmore tells Rolling Stone. “Luckily, none of them provided an address, so I'm hoping it was all bluster — but there's no way to know for sure.” She's concerned she could wind up banned from the U.S., “despite the fact that I never celebrated anything,” calling the possibility “surreal.” She reported the incident to police.


Rolling Stone reached out to a dozen other people targeted on the website for what they said or shared about Kirk, but most did not respond. All had deleted at least one or more of their social media profiles, including X, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn accounts, presumably due to a torrent of harassment like the one Gilmore has endured.


	Hannah Molitor, another woman listed on CharliesMurderers.com, was subsequently fired from her job at Next Door, a Milwaukee childcare organization. Her entry included a screenshot of a post on her Facebook page, which began: “What happened to Charlie Kirk is horrible and no person should ever lose their life to gun violence.” She went on to point out, however, that Kirk's political movement had actively worked against attempts to reduce unnecessary gun deaths, adding, “If all you do is spew hate, you're bound to get some in return.”

	“It is really important to me that people realize both in my post and in my own personal opinion that I would never wish death upon anyone or celebrate anyone's death, especially victims of gun violence,” Molitor tells Rolling Stone. “I may have disagreed with Charlie Kirk politically, but no one deserves to be killed, especially in such a horrific and visible way.” She says far-right extremists distorted her comment and “spread misinformation about me all over the internet.” After her post was shared on the anti-LGBTQ hate account LibsOfTikTok the night of the shooting, she says, her email inbox filled up with “hundreds of vile messages telling me to either kill myself or that they wished I would die a horrible death.” Her phone number and home address were leaked. Molitor was also “receiving pictures of guns,” with people threatening to show up at her home or workplace.

	











	“I know I am not the monster these people want to paint me out to be,” Molitor says. “I refuse to let the bully win, and I know these people just want to scare me, and I will not give them the satisfaction.” She started a GoFundMe campaign called “Support Hannah's Fight Against Online Defamation” to cover living expenses after her firing — as well as the costs of potentially taking legal action — and has so far raised more than $2,000.


	Indeed, many observers speculated that those anonymously smearing random social media commenters as Kirk's “murderers” (while an actual suspect in the slaying, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, had been arrested and charged) could face lawsuits from the individuals who had their personal information shared on the site. A number of lawyers publicly volunteered their services, including civil rights attorney J. Alejandro Barrientos.


	“Many of the people listed on the ‘Charlie's murderers' website may have viable defamation claims,” Barrientos tells Rolling Stone, noting that “many of the posts contained statements that could not be reasonably interpreted as supporting political violence” while others “only quoted Kirk's own words.” He adds that the site, by collating personal data, “may have also violated anti-doxing laws that some states began enacting in recent years.”


	Nora Benavidez, another civil rights attorney and senior counsel at the watchdog group Free Press, called the site “dangerous” in a post on X, and agrees that it may have violated anti-doxing laws. She says that “alongside employment law remedies, people on the list may have a legal case in those instances,” but cautions that under the lawless Trump administration, “these avenues for relief offer little comfort.”


	“We are witnessing a chilling attempt to silence free speech,” Benavidez says. “This list was created to intimidate, harass and exact economic consequences. And now, the president and the vice president are promising fascistic revenge to classify people and organizations as terrorists if they exercise their own First Amendment rights criticizing Kirk.” She adds that MAGA world's hypocritical and “selective support” for Constitutional rights is nothing new, and has corroded discourse in the public square. “The ‘free speech for me but not for thee' attitude Trump embodies is dangerous, divisive, and helps create, not quell, the conditions for political violence,” she says.


	Late on Sunday night, the person or group behind CharliesMurderers.com announced on X that they were “rebranding” as the “Charlie Kirk Data Foundation,” switching over to the web domain CharlieKirkData.org. The new site included a jumbled disclaimer saying that it “lawfully” collected “publicly available data” on “support for political violence,” but was “not a doxxing website” and did not identify individuals. There was no accessible list of people supposedly celebrating Kirk's murder, and a submissions portal for offending posts about him remained inactive. As of Wednesday, this page had also been taken fully offline. 

	











	While it's not clear why the two successive websites went dark — there were unsubstantiated claims that the original was hacked — Barrientos says “the change towards less inflammatory language” on CharlieKirkData.org “suggests a concern for liability,” observing that the organizers “should have thought about that more seriously” before creating CharliesMurderers.com. “I have already had one person reach out to me about harassment they've received over a post about Kirk,” he says.

	Molitor does intend to pursue legal action, per her crowdfunding page. Gilmore, for her part, has not taken a step in that direction just yet. “That said, I haven't ruled anything out,” she says. “You can't just paint people as a murderer, inciting the hell I've lived through in the last few days, and have zero accountability. It doesn't seem right.” And while both women say the threats and harassment have fallen off since CharliesMurderers.com went down, the fact remains that they could be on the radar of extremists looking to avenge Kirk. The seeming retreat of the site's author(s) in the face of potential defamation claims has not undone the damage wrought by their overreach. 


	“Could someone still be planning retribution?” says Gilmore. “That's the thought that keeps me up at night.”

Another New York Fashion Week has come and gone, and if you were lucky, you got to see some of music's biggest stars play sets in some tiny rooms — or at the very least, stand next to them at the open bar. Plus, there's the fashion! Off-White came to New York for a second year in a row, Ralph Lauren went in-office (er, studio), Coach paid homage to the concrete jungle and more. From the runway to the afters and everything in between, here's all that Rolling Stone saw during this iteration of fashion's biggest week in New York City.

After heading out to Bridgehampton last year, Ralph Lauren's Spring 2026 women's show was a homecoming of sorts, with the brand returning to the designer's private studio on Madison Avenue. The show featured big hats, sharp tailoring, and looks that made us upset that we're coming out of summer and not going into it.

A party at Jean's celebrating jeans. Do you guys get it? Re/Done cleared all of the tables of one of the city's most if-you-know-you-know spots for a celebration of its FW25 campaign. At one point, New York-based band Arsun played a set that you could have sworn was about to start a mosh pit in one of the city's coolest dining rooms. Then, Dutch Faro and Earl Cave from The Gash hopped on for an impromptu set.

This one wasn't for the folks with a regular sleep schedule. Red Bull's big takeover of Square Diner kicked off at midnight on Sunday and went for 24 hours, playing host to runway regulars with some serious stamina or jet lag, or both. French house-music duo Polo & Pan kept the vibes up, and folks didn't seem to mind (or know) the time. Red Bull gives you wings — or, at the very least, chicken-tender baskets.

One thing about Usher, he's going to stay booked and busy. After popping out at Ralph Lauren's show in Bridgehampton last year, the star is back with the brand's fragrance arm as its new global brand ambassador. The eight-time Grammy winner presided over a packed room of champagne flutes and sharp tailoring, answering the question: What if Jay Gatsby had thrown his parties in FiDi instead?

It's not every night there's some kind of special edition Fiat 500e designed by Giorgio Armani right next to some late-night Hostess snacks. We call that range. Nearby, Sofi Tukker played one of the best sets of the week as Nylon celebrated fashion week at the Classic Car Club at Pier 76.

Saks Fifth Avenue has made quite a reputation for throwing a must-attend fete to kick off fashion's biggest week in New York. While this year's party was scaled back in some ways — it's tough to beat Caroline Polachek's set back in February — it did have everything a good party needs: a champagne tower, passed French dip, and Thom Browne (pictured — and who we'll forgive for showing in Paris this season).

J.Crew's been doing New York Fashion Week big the past couple of years: Either it's an indie-sleaze moment with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs or it's a full-on concert with the Strokes at Pier 17. This year, the brand took over the old Germania Bank building at 190 Bowery to preview a short pop-up at the location, complete with the Dare (pictured) in attendance. 

Pandora kicked off its New York Fashion Week with an immersive experience, complete with a sound chamber and tattoo stations, all serenaded by the sounds of FKA Twigs (pictured). Katseye came through (a couple days before their big VMAs win), Tyla and Ciara ran into each other, and attendees took turns taking in a light-and-shadow photography experience.

Turns out it's not just how you look, it's also about how you smell. Miu Miu Beauty's soiree to celebrate the brand's new fragrance served as an amuse-bouche to the New York Fashion Week celebrations. Emma Chamberlain sat at an elaborate Scrabble setup, Lola Tung took a break from hearing The Summer I Turned Pretty takes, and Maggie Rogers (pictured) performed a short set, including a beautiful even-more-stripped down rendition of “Alaska.”

Inspired by the streets of New York, the collection featured treated leathers, oversize pants, and rub-off foil elements. “I thought about a delicate balance of polish and shine with grit … the beauty of how the city comes back to life every morning,” creative director Stuart Vevers said.

For Tory Burch‘s Spring/Summer 2026 collection, the brand found an old bank in Brooklyn adorned with giant columns and marble floors. Model and actress Emily Ratajkowski walked in the show while a star-studded (Emma Roberts, Jessica Alba) front row looked on.

If you were outside this fashion week, it was hard to miss Olandria Carthen and Nic Vansteenberghe (“Nicolandria” to the Love Island fans) hitting up shows and attending parties. On Friday, the pair posted up at Boom, in the Meatpacking District, at Off-White's afterparty following the brand showing in New York for the second year in a row.

Todd Snyder‘s Spring/Summer 2026 show turned into a father-son outing for Brendan Fraser and his son, Holden.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Roswell footage uploaded to National Archives shows crashed 'UFO debris and alien bodies'","https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15111191/Roswell-footage-National-Archives-UFO-alien.html","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 15:54:30 GMT","

   11:54 EDT 18 Sep 2025, updated  11:55 EDT 18 Sep 2025    By STACY LIBERATORE, US SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY EDITOR  

A nearly 22-minute video titled 'The Roswell Incident' has been quietly uploaded to the National Archives, reigniting interest in the infamous 1947 crash.

The footage combines still images and motion-control camera shots sourced from the published Roswell Report, as well as various magazines and books about UFOs. 

It opens with a shot of the book 'The Roswell Report: Fact Versus Fiction in the New Mexico Desert' and ends with a stark black-and-white image that appears to show a crash site, with debris scattered across a massive crater in the ground.

The video has flooded the internet, with users claiming the crater bears a striking resemblance to eyewitness reports, suggesting it could be 'the first pictures of the 1947 UFO crash site.'

Major Jesse Marcel, who recovered debris from the crash, described the scene as 'a large area heavily scattered with metallic debris from a single impact point that scarred the earth.' 

Some viewers have also pointed to a dark formation on the right side of the image, claiming it resembles an alien body. 

UFO expert Mark Lee told the Daily Mail that the crater image was likely included to add intrigue. 

'In my opinion, it's either a hoax,' he said. 'Just because it's been added to the National Archives doesn't give it scientific validation. If it came out as a release from the military or Congress, I would take it a lot more seriously.'

Lee also noted that the 'alien' in the photo is nothing more than a case of pareidolia, a psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimuli.

The newly uploaded video appears to focus on 'The Roswell Report: Fact Versus Fiction in the New Mexico Desert,' a 1995 book that attributes the crashed 'UFO' debris to Project Mogul.

Project Mogul was a top-secret US military program from 1947 to 1949 that used high-altitude balloons equipped with microphones to detect sound waves from Soviet atomic bomb tests. 

A 1994 military investigation concluded that the debris found at the Roswell site was likely pieces of a high-altitude balloon from Project Mogul, not an extraterrestrial spacecraft. 

Despite this official explanation, the newly uploaded video has sparked debate online, with viewers offering widely differing interpretations.

'National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has uploaded a video of the Roswell 1947 UAP Crash site,' one user shared.

Another user posted on X: 'Like noted UFO researcher Grant Cameron has stated plenty of times, sometimes the disclosure of the real deal is a purposefully placed needle in the haystack. Roswell: slow drip…drip, drip, drip.'

In addition to the debris spotted in the footage, one user shared: 'Grey alien in the official video from the Roswell crash site.'

However, some social media suggested the footage 'is B-roll for the Roswell Report, and the images being posted do not show the Roswell debris site, nor does it even claim it's the actual debris site.'

One user posted: 'It's clearly B-roll for that Roswell presentation the government put together in 1996. Someone must have found this and uploaded it in the last couple of days.'

Others have suggested a dead alien can be seen in the image, pointing to what Marcle said following the Roswell incident.

'I later found out that the pilot of the aircraft was a Captain Henderson, who apparently saw far more than just the debris from the impact site... he may in fact have seen the remains of a crew,' the now deceased major said. 

In July 1947, a rancher reported pieces of debris scattered over his land.

Authorities were called to the scene and, after investigating the wreckage, determined the pieces were from a flying saucer.

The local paper's front page story reported that the Roswell Army Field recovered a flying saucer on a New Mexico Ranch after metallic-looking, light but strong material was scattered across the land.

'The intelligence office of the 509th Bombardment Group at Roswell Army Air Field announced at noon today that the field has come into the possession of a Flying Saucer,' Roswell Daily Record reported on July 8, 1947.

The statement was given by Marcel, who was the first on the scene and led the investigation, which he determined were pieces from an extraterrestrial vehicle. 

He also said that the material spread out from this point into a triangular-shaped area 200 to 300 feet wide at the end of the field, and 3/4 of a mile long.

Shortly after the 'UFO' discovery made headlines, the War Department in Washington released a statement claiming the debris was the remains of a weather balloon.

The US Air Force stated the weather balloon was part of Project Mogul's airborne system invented by Columbia University, New York University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

It was designed to search the atmosphere for weak reverberations from nuclear-test blasts.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Adaptive kayaking and canoeing equipment offered by the Department of Conservation and Recreation.

BOSTON — As part of a continued effort to make outdoor recreation welcoming and accessible to all Massachusetts residents, the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) on Wednesday announced the agency's Universal Access Program's (UAP) fall programming. The programming is designed to offer outdoor recreational opportunities at state parks for visitors of all abilities. This fall's programming lineup includes adaptive hiking, paddling, golfing, and cycling.

DCR partners with non-profit organizations to provide specialized adaptive equipment for programming that will take place at state parks across Massachusetts through the fall.

“DCR's Universal Access Program is committed to ensuring that our state park system is inclusive, accessible, and welcoming to people of all abilities,” Commissioner Nicole LaChapelle said. “Together with our partners, we are dedicated to providing opportunities that empower residents and visitors of all abilities to explore the beauty of the outdoors. We look forward to welcoming back returning UAP participants and introducing new faces to our programs this fall.”

“Through UAP, we strive to make sure the properties and programming of DCR can be enjoyed by all visitors, no matter their levels of ability,” said UAP Program Director Tom McCarthy. “This fall's schedule marks the return of many beloved opportunities to explore our state through outdoor recreation. We welcome all returning guests and encourage any curious new participants to join in as well.”

UAP offers adaptive, accessible programming seasonally at parks, pools, beaches and trails as well as other recreational facilities across the Massachusetts. This fall's schedule consists of 18 programs including hiking, cycling, kayaking, canoeing, and golfing.

UAP partners with organizations including All Out Adventures, EasterSeals Massachusetts, Holyoke Rows, and Waypoint Adventure to deliver a wide range of programs year-round to provide access to outdoor recreation for people of all abilities.

Police say Akshay Vashisht made ‘false, malicious and superstitious' claims about Manohar airport

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Police in India's popular coastal state of Goa have arrested a YouTuber after he posted a video claiming that the state's new international airport was haunted.

Akshay Vashisht, who runs a popular channel with more than 570,000 subscribers dedicated to horror stories and paranormal case studies, was detained in Delhi on Wednesday. 

His arrest followed a complaint by a police constable from Goa's social media monitoring cell, who alleged the video spread false information about the newly built Manohar International Airport at Mopa.

According to the police complaint, the video – shared on YouTube under the title Evil Haunted Goa Airport – alleged the airport had been built on a cremation ground. 

In the video, Mr Vashisht claimed that airline staff had reported “paranormal activities” and that pilots often refused to operate night flights due to ghostly sightings, including that of a mysterious woman in a red saree on the runway.

A version of the video remained viewable on Facebook but another on Mr Vashisht's main YouTube channel had been made private as of Thursday.

Police said the claims in the video were “false, malicious and superstitious” and designed to alarm the public while promoting the creator's channel. Authorities also accused him of narrating purported testimonies from his subscribers to lend credibility to the claims.

A team from Mopa Airport police station travelled to Delhi to arrest Vashisht from the Dwarka area. Officers seized his mobile phone, laptop and camera and brought him to the Mopa airport police station for further investigation.

He faces an initial chargesheet filed under sections of the Indian Penal Code covering public mischief and common intention – people gathering with the intent to commit a crime.

Police said they were also considering whether to pursue action against the administrator of the Facebook page that circulated the clip.

The £283m Manohar International Airport opened in December 2022 in Mopa and began operations a year later. As Goa's second airport, it has a goal of drawing 12 million passengers per year in the next five years in order to boost tourism and connectivity in one of India's most popular destinations for both domestic and international travel. 

Authorities said unfounded rumours could damage its reputation at a time when the facility is still building international credibility.

This isn't the first time officials have clashed with social media influencers over the state's image. Earlier this year, a spate of posts appeared claiming there was reduced footfall at Goa's beaches and resorts due to increased prices of hotels and restaurants. 

Goa's tourism minister Rohan Khaunte insisted in July that there had been no drop in tourist numbers and claimed, without evidence, that “paid” “so-called influencers” were deliberately perpetuating false narratives to harm the image of the state.

Florida Tech astrophysicist Howard Chen is offering new insights to help aid NASA's search for life beyond Earth. His latest theoretical work investigates the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system, one of the most widely studied exoplanetary systems in the galaxy. It has captured scientists' attention for its potential to host water, and thus possibly life, on its planets. Now, he's offering an explanation for why telescopes have yet to find definitive signs of either.

The paper, ""Born Dry or Born Wet? A Palette of Water Growth Histories in TRAPPIST-1 Analogs and Compact Planetary Systems,"" was authored by Chen, an assistant professor of space sciences, and researchers from NASA, Johns Hopkins University and Harvard University. It was published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters in September and explores the likelihood that TRAPPIST-1's three innermost exoplanets contained no water when they formed, despite existing in a zone where water is viable.

TRAPPIST-1 is a red dwarf star located about 40 light-years away from us. (One light year is about 6 trillion miles.) It is thought to be about 7.6 billion years old, or 3 billion years older than our sun.

Astronomers are captivated by the TRAPPIST-1 system because its seven known planets are rocky and Earth-like. They also fall within the star's habitable zone, which is the distance range from a star at which temperatures are not too hot or cold to support liquid water.

Researchers are searching for any evidence of water on these planets, but have yet to detect anything. Some think a lack of gas in the atmosphere is disrupting the light needed to pick up detailed visuals. Others predict water could have escaped the planets' atmospheres throughout their evolution.

Chen and his team, however, decided to research a different theory: that there was no water to begin with because there was no gas to contain it. He would test it not from an observational perspective, but with mathematical modeling of the planets' initial formation.

""You have astronomers who are using telescopes to see what's out there. I come from a different perspective,"" Chen said. ""I'm both trying to explain what we're seeing while trying to make predictions about what we can't.""

The researchers created models that examined the composition and growth of these planets starting when they were as small as 1 kilometer wide. They simulated how material aggregated during collisions with other celestial objects until they reached their final planetary formations.

There are several key factors in collision events that heavily influence a planet's final composition. Chen's models incorporated impact delivery, which is the transfer of materials like water and gases during a celestial collision; impact erosion, which refers to the removal of materials in a planet's atmosphere due to impact; and mantle-atmosphere exchange, which is the transfer of water and gases between a planet's atmosphere and mantle to maintain its conditions.

The team ran hundreds of collision simulations, which returned thousands of different possibilities for how TRAPPIST-1's planets might have formed. They varied several components, such as the amount of water available to the system, the profile of the initial planet formation environment, the planets' density profiles and the initial system conditions. For the inner worlds, specifically the first three planets, most of the simulations came back dry.

""Whatever we did, we couldn't get much water in these inner planets,"" Chen said.

He believes that the main reason the planets couldn't acquire water is due to the nature of the collision events. Compact planet collisions are higher velocity, so they are more aggressive and energetic, Chen said. This means that instead of acquiring material for a gaseous atmosphere, planets' atmospheres were completely cleared out by the power of the collisions. With no gas in the atmosphere to contain water, it's possible that any previously existing water escaped back into space during these collision events.

Understanding a planet's earliest characteristics, its water, air and carbon content, builds the foundation for how they evolve. That way, when researchers identify a planet that seems viable for life at the surface level, they can use Chen's model to simulate what these distant worlds might be like on the inside, on the surface and in the air.

Combining the theoretical context of a planet's formation with the state in which it was discovered can help researchers—and NASA—make informed, efficient decisions on which planets are worth investigating and when it's time to move on to the next.

While the United States seems to be good at its job of proffering peace throughout the world and maintaining stability, its unique landscape is not seeing many scientific expeditions like its other sectors. Utah, a landlocked state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States, is the location for this Dome; something that has set the geological world into a state of delirium.

If you love to go out particularly in the states, there is no way you wouldn't have come across Utah's Canyonlands National Park. This is because of its high number of massive canyons that offer a lot of intrigue and mystery. The “upheaval dome” in question refers to a strange circle of deformed rock that spans more than three kilometers across and rises like a bull's eye from the desert floor .

Geologists and scientists have come together to attempt to precisely determine the origin and cause of the dome's formation. An important fact to note is that over time, there have been several theories aimed at explaining and unravelling the mystery behind this seemingly extra terrestrial life form. 

The first theory about the upheaval dome was first proposed in the early 20th century. It stipulates that thick layers of ancient salt lie beneath the Canyonlands which over time, pushed these salt layers upward through the rock above them in bulbous formations called diapirs.

Another intriguing theory about Utah's upheaval rock formation is the meteorite impact hypothesis. This theory existed in the 1990s, a period before scientists started thinking in the direction of the diapir hypothesis. The theory was based on the fact that the upheaval dome was caused by a meteorite crashing down into the region over 60 million years ago sending shockwaves through the sandstone and creating concentric rings of fractured rock. At the time, the meteorite theory seemed coherent and well thought out until the diapir hypothesis that was later put forward in the early 20th century, just like this recently solved ancient mystery.

Amidst all the research chaos, some geological elements were also discovered. The first example is the discovery of shocked quartz. Ever heard of it before? If you've heard of it, there is no question you're a geological guru/wizard. 

But if not, shocked quartz are tiny grains of sand whose crystal structures have been rearranged under immense, instantaneous pressure. But the unshakable reality is that these elements do not form under normal seismic and planetary processes. Their existence proves the impact of a meteorite crash down. 

In the early 2000s, geologists identified such grains in sandstone samples from the “Upheaval Dome”. The presence of shocked quartz dramatically strengthened the underlying hypothesis that explained that a celestial crash-down into our planet's crust was the only reason shocked quartz existed freely on the surface of our planet's lithosphere. 

Still, questions remain. Unlike many well-studied craters, Upheaval Dome lacks extensive melt rocks or a thick blanket of ejecta—debris blasted outward during impact. Some researchers argue this absence leaves the door open for the salt dome hypothesis. Others suggest that erosion over tens of millions of years may have erased these features, leaving only the deeper structural traces.

Who said the United States does not also have its own unique set of wonders? If you're still doubting, pick up your hiking boots and head over to any park. This doesn't necessarily have to be Utah's Canyonlands National Park, it could be any park but you'll become easily intrigued by some of our planet's hints at the supernatural forming behind the scenes, like this mysterious ghost inland.

Tyler Robinson's alleged texts to his partner have been met with scepticism across the ideological spectrum.

By John Power

The deluge of conspiracy theories began almost the moment authorities revealed the text messages allegedly sent by the suspected assassin of right-wing American activist Charlie Kirk.

After prosecutors in the US state of Utah published alleged text exchanges between 22-year-old Tyler Robinson and his romantic partner on Tuesday, countless social media users, including numerous prominent influencers, cast doubt on their authenticity.

Some outright claimed that the texts, in which Robinson appears to confess to killing Kirk, had been fabricated by authorities.

Many of the posts suggested that the language and tone of the exchanges did not match someone of Robinson's age, and the account of the shooting was too forthcoming and detailed to be believable.

Notably, at a time of extreme political polarisation in the US, the conspiracy theorising united figures on the left and right.

Matt Walsh, a right-wing commentator and podcast host with millions of followers on X and YouTube, suggested the exchanges had been scripted to absolve Robinson's transgender partner of any involvement in the shooting.

“This feels like a strategy they cooked up from watching too much TV,” Walsh said on X.

Utah Governor Spencer Cox has said that the partner, described as a “male transitioning to female”, had no advance knowledge of the crime and has been cooperating fully with authorities.

Steve Bannon, US President Donald Trump's former adviser, said on his podcast that he was “not buying” the texts, describing them as “too stilted, too much like a script”.

On the other side of the political spectrum, Majid Padellan, a progressive influencer who goes by Brooklyn Dad Defiant on social media, said he did not believe for “one second” that the texts had been written by Robinson.

“I didn't know him personally, but I know that no 22 year old writes text messages like this,” Padellan said on X.

“This feels like that Steve Buscemi skateboard meme ‘How do you do, fellow kids?”'

Liberal commentator Joanne Carducci, who posts under the moniker JoJoFromJerz, noted that the official narrative around the assassination had prompted rare agreement across the ideological divide.

“No one is buying these text messages. No one on the left or the right,” Carducci said on X.

“We cannot agree on a damn thing anymore. But we agree on this. If that doesn't speak volumes, nothing does.”

The Utah County Attorney did not respond to a request for comment about the claims online.

Speculation and conspiracy theories have become a routine feature of the reaction to high-profile acts of violence in the US in the polarised and trigger-happy landscape of social media and online forums.

After a gunman shot dead a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband in June, right-wing conspiracy theorists claimed that the shooting had been perpetrated by a left-wing extremist or carried out on behalf of the state's Democratic governor, Tim Walz.

The alleged gunman, Vance Boelter, espoused staunchly conservative views on issues including abortion and LGBTQ rights.

The 2022 mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas; the 2018 high school shooting in Parkland, Florida; and the 2017 Las Vegas shooting all spawned right-wing conspiracy theories, including the claim that the attacks had been staged to give the US government a pretext to curtail gun rights.

While many conspiracy theories have been driven by a particular ideological faction, Kirk's assassination is the latest event to fuel unfounded claims with “cross-ideological appeal”, said Eric Oliver, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago who studies conspiracy theories.

Claims about Robinson fit the mould of theories about the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the pharmaceutical industry, which also cut across partisan and ideological lines, Oliver said.

“People are also really emotionally charged by this, both on the left and the right, and will often gravitate to stories that rationalise their fear, rage or feelings of powerlessness,” Oliver told Al Jazeera.

The “extraordinary circumstances” of Kirk's murder, including a relative lack of information about Robinson, had also left a vacuum that was being filled by people “already suspicious of anything either the government does or this administration does”, Oliver added.

The transcripts of Robinson's alleged texts released by prosecutors provided some of the clearest indications yet of a possible motive for assassinating Kirk, who was lauded by conservatives but seen as an inflammatory figure on the left for his right-wing stances on immigration, abortion and transgender rights, among other issues.

Robinson allegedly told his partner that he had “had enough” of Kirk's “hatred” and “some hate can't be negotiated out”.

Authorities previously announced that they recovered bullet casings inscribed with a number of politically-charged and internet subculture-influenced messages, including “Hey fascist! Catch!”

Prosecutors, who allege Kirk was targeted over his “political expression”, have charged Robinson with aggravated murder and six other charges.

Steven B Duke, an expert in criminal law at Yale Law School, offered a blunt assessment of the possibility that prosecutors had fabricated evidence as crucial as the suspect's text messages.

“There is nothing in those messages making it even plausible that they were written by law enforcement,” Duke told Al Jazeera.

“The conspiracy theorists are crazy, as is anyone who agrees with them.”

Nonetheless, that Robinson's alleged communications with his partner after Kirk's assassination have only further fuelled conspiracies is not surprising, experts suggest.

“Many people have a worldview in which conspiracies are going on all the time and explain our social and political circumstances – those people believe lots and lots of conspiracy theories and exist on both the right and left,” said Joseph Uscinski, a professor of political science at the University of Miami, whose research focuses on conspiracy theories.

And though conspiracy theorising has become rampant on social media, the platforms themselves are not the problem, Uscinski said.

“People have worldviews; some of those worldviews make conspiracy theories easy to believe, whether those people are on social media or not,” he told Al Jazeera.

“Conspiracy theories existed long before social media and may have been more prominent then. We have to remember that people seek out content on social media that they like; they are not necessarily persuaded by social media content as much as they are attracted to content that tells them what they already believe.”

Fox News host Mark Levin shares memories of his first conversations with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.'

In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, some critics of Israel have sought to drive a wedge between the conservative activist and the Jewish state, mischaracterizing his recent statements and making wild, unfounded accusations.

Within hours of Kirk's murder — and before a suspect was identified — unhinged conspiracies spread across social media. The Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism found thousands of posts containing the baseless claims. 

Seemingly aware of the effort to co-opt Kirk's legacy, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu eulogized him as a champion of ""speaking truth and defending freedom. A lion-hearted friend of Israel, he fought the lies and stood tall for Judeo-Christian civilization.""

WHAT I LEARNED FROM DEBATING CHARLIE KIRK, AND WHERE THE COUNTRY GOES FROM HERE

Mike Huckabee, Washington's ambassador to Israel, also took to X to condemn the misinformation. ""It's painful to see people back in the US attempt to get clicks & make $$ by making up outrageous lies while exploiting the death of Charlie Kirk whose impact & character the propagandists will never have. @IsraeliPM sets the record straight.""

Rabbi Pesach Wolicki, who spoke with Charlie Kirk via Zoom the night before his assassination, told Fox News Digital that while Kirk voiced criticism at times, he remained strongly supportive of Israel.

""The meeting was one he initiated,"" Wolicki said. ""He was heading out on a campus tour the next day and knew he'd face many questions about Israel. He wanted to hear what I had to say on issues he expected to be asked about. Why would he do that if he had abandoned Israel? The very fact the meeting happened proves he had not.""

Wolicki noted that only a month earlier, Kirk had been attacked by critics for being ""too supportive"" of Israel. Although they did not discuss the origins of his views, Wolicki pointed to Kirk's evangelical Christian beliefs, which he said aligned with the right of the Jewish nation to thrive.

""He said publicly many times that he believed the Land of Israel belongs to the Jewish people and that he supported Israel's war against Hamas,"" Wolicki added. ""He was not soft on our enemies. He supported Israel, even when he was critical.""

In a video of a May debate at Cambridge that went viral, Kirk staunchly defended the Jewish state.

""When you declare war on Israel, expect a firestorm in reaction,"" he declared. ""On Shabbat, Hamas invaded Israel, deciding to go recklessly to music concerts, to homes, to kibbutzes and taking 200-plus hostages. They knew what they were doing ...

""A tragic truth of war is that civilians die. I don't like it, and you don't like it,"" he continued. ""And they brought it upon themselves. The only operation and entity to blame is the leadership of Hamas, not the Israeli government, for fighting this defensive war. ... There is a good guy and there is a bad guy.""

Last month, Charlie Kirk appeared on Megyn Kelly's podcast, describing himself as having a ""bulletproof resume"" when it comes to defending Israel on both college campuses and social media.

""I believe in the scriptural land rights given to Israel, I believe in the fulfillment of prophecy. I am not a theologian, but I'm a Christian. My life was changed in Israel—the spiritual energy there is so amazing. I want them to win, and I've said that repeatedly,"" Kirk said.

He added that he often has ""less ability sometimes online to criticize the Israeli government without backlash than actual Israelis do.""

""I want civilization to win. I want the West to win. I don't want the Islamo-fascist barbarians to storm the gates of Jerusalem. I want the holy sites protected. I believe in the Holy Land, I love that Jesus walked on water there and rose from the dead,"" he said.

Kirk stressed his personal bond with Israel but warned against hostile reactions to criticism saying the result could eventually be the ""weakening and deflating of two of your strongest advocates if that continues.""

One of the Chief Rabbis of Israel, David Yosef, sent a letter to Kirk's family, expressing his ""deep sorrow"" over the assassination of ""a clear and unwavering voice of truth.""

Josh Nass, a former conservative youth commentator, met Kirk in 2012, when Kirk was just launching his organization, Turning Point USA.

""If you take Israel out of the picture, what Charlie dedicated his life to simply falls apart. He thought our value system was collapsing and was very passionate about the need to fight the culture war. His love for Israel was incredibly real and sincere. I know that because he told me so himself,"" Nass said.

Israel Ganz, head of the Yesha Council — the umbrella organization of local authorities in Judea and Samaria — reacted to Kirk's assassination, saying his community ""bow[ed] their heads in mourning over the murder of a friend and lover of Israel.""

In the spirit of coexistence that Kirk promoted, dozens of Christians and Jews gathered on Wednesday atop Jerusalem's Temple Mount to honor him. They prayed for peace for Kirk's widow and children, offering strength and solidarity in their time of grief.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Hundreds of liberal groups band together against Trump's threats of RICO cases and investigations","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/politics/liberal-groups-trump-threats-letter","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 19:02:15 GMT","


            Hundreds of nonprofit groups, most of them left-leaning, are joining together to urge President Donald Trump to end what they call the “unjustified” targeting of liberal organizations following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
    


            In an open letter issued Thursday and shared first with CNN, more than 500 groups condemned what they described as the use of government power to threaten their First Amendment rights. Organizations signing the letter ranged from the American Civil Liberties Union and Indivisible to Greenpeace USA and the Service Employees International Union.
    


            Trump and others in his administration have invoked Kirk's killing at a Utah university campus last week to say they will crack down on groups that they view as part of a coordinated left-wing effort to incite violence.
    


            “Political violence has targeted those of every political persuasion and of no political persuasion,” the groups said. “It is un-American and wrong to use this act of violence as a pretext for weaponizing the government to threaten nonprofit and charitable organizations, other perceived adversaries, or any class of people.”
    


            “They did not commit this murder,” the letter added, “and the vast powers of the government should not be abused to threaten their constitutionally-protected free speech and other rights.”
    


            The actions publicly floated by the president and some conservatives include revoking the tax-exempt status of left-leaning non-profits and launching racketeering investigations of organizations that have helped coordinate or fund protests against Trump's policies.
    


            So far, Trump has announced that he is designating the far-left movement Antifa as a terrorist organization, although it was not immediately clear how administration intends to carry out the designation.
    


            “The assassination of Kirk was a tragedy for his family and a danger for the nation,” said Lisa Gilbert, the co-president of Public Citizen, which helped organize Thursday's public statement from the liberal groups. “It is unconscionable to exploit this dangerous political moment to further divisions and violate rights, when what we desperately need right now is to lower the temperature of our discourse and bring the country together.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for a response.
    


            The letter from the nonprofits follows a similar action Wednesday from more than 100 philanthropies who banded together to defend free speech. In that letter, the foundations defended their work and denounced what they said were efforts to “exploit political violence to mischaracterize our good work of restrict our fundamental freedoms.”
    


            Signatories included the Open Society Foundations, the philanthropic group founded by billionaire financier and Democratic donor George Soros, who has been a repeated target of scorn from Trump and the right.

China is preparing to launch a new shipping route along Russia's Northern coast, via the Arctic to Europe, Politico has reported on Thursday.

The Northern Sea Route (NSR), which runs for thousands of miles through Russia's Arctic waters along its northern coast, has become more accessible due to receding sea ice and has been hailed in Moscow as an opportunity for new international projects.

On September 20 China is sending the Istanbul Bridge container ship on an 18-day trip with icebreaker escort from Ningbo-Zhoushan port to Felixstowe in the UK. The new route is significantly faster than traditional voyages, which take about 40 days via the Suez Canal, 50 days via the Cape of Good Hope at Africa's southern tip, and around 25 days via Eurasian railways.

“The Arctic is the first region where climate change is changing the geopolitical map,” Malte Humpert of the Arctic Institute told Politico, adding that the region is “changing the geopolitical dynamics because of resources and access to shipping routes.”

He noted that while most trade still flows through the Suez Canal, Mediterranean and Singapore, the Arctic could soon become an alternative because the voyage is about 40% shorter and faces “a lot less geopolitical uncertainty.”

His comments come as traditional corridors like the Suez Canal have faced piracy flare-ups near the Horn of Africa and missile and drone threats in the Red Sea, pushing some carriers to detour around Africa.

Russia has repeatedly called for international cooperation to develop the Arctic. Earlier this year, President Vladimir Putin outlined goals for the region, including making the Northern Sea Route a central part of the Trans-Arctic Transport Corridor and raising cargo volumes to 70–100 million tons by the end of the decade. 

He also announced plans to ensure year-round navigation supported by Russia's exclusive nuclear icebreaker fleet, as well as to expand existing ports such as Murmansk and build new ones along the route.

Putin has further highlighted the vast opportunities for oil, gas, metals and rare earth extraction in the Arctic, calling for joint ventures with foreign partners such as China, India, the UAE and others. He has also pledged to expand development of Arctic cities and promote tourism across the region.

Israeli tanks were seen in two Gaza City areas that are gateways to the city centre, residents said on Thursday, while internet and phone lines were cut off across the Gaza Strip, a sign that ground operations were likely to escalate imminently. 

Israeli forces control Gaza City's eastern suburbs and in recent days have been pounding the Sheikh Radwan and Tel Al-Hawa areas, from where they would be positioned to advance on central and western areas where most of the population is sheltering.

“We are scared, but what can we do?” said Bassam Al-Qanou, a displaced man sheltering with around 30 family members in one of countless ragged improvised tent camps along the city's beach.

He said the family had no way to get out, and nowhere to go.

At least 85 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes or gunfire across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, most in Gaza City, according to the territory's Health Ministry.

The Israeli military said four of its personnel had been killed during combat in southern Gaza.

In separate developments, Israel attacked Hezbollah military targets in southern Lebanon, while two Israelis were killed at Allenby Crossing between the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Jordan, in what the Israeli military called a “terror attack.”

Israeli army spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said troops had been operating in the city's periphery for several weeks but since the night of Monday to Tuesday large numbers of troops had begun moving toward the inner city.

Israel's ground offensive in Gaza City has begun. Here are the latest updates on the war

He said a combination of infantry, tanks and artillery was advancing, backed up by the air force, and that it was a gradual process that would increase as time went on.

“The strategy right now is to defeat Hamas and apply pressure on Hamas, which can lead to a deal or can lead to rescue missions [to free hostages],” Shoshani told Reuters on the Israeli side of the border with Gaza.

A total of 48 hostages captured during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, remain in Gaza and Israeli officials believe around 20 are still alive.

Hostage families have been imploring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop the offensive on Gaza and instead negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas to free their loved ones, but Netanyahu says military victory will bring them home.

The armed wing of Hamas said on Thursday the hostages were distributed throughout the neighbourhoods of Gaza City.

“The start of this criminal operation and its expansion means you will not receive any captive, alive or dead,” it said in a written statement.

The Palestinian Telecommunications Company said in a statement that its services had been cut off “due to the ongoing aggression and the targeting of the main network routes.”

“The disconnection of internet and phone services is a bad omen. It has always been a bad signal something very brutal is going to happen,” said Ismail, who only gave one name. He was using an e-SIM to connect his phone, a dangerous method as it requires seeking higher ground to receive a signal.

As Israeli ground invasion begins, Palestinians in Gaza City say they're trapped or fleeing on unsafe roads

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled Gaza City since Israel announced on Aug. 10 it intended to take control, but a greater number are staying put, either in battered homes among the ruins or in makeshift tent encampments.

The military has been dropping leaflets urging residents to flee towards a designated “humanitarian zone” in the south of the territory, but aid agencies say conditions there are dire, with insufficient food, medicine, space and inadequate shelter.

Four more Palestinians, including a child, have died of malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours, the Health Ministry said, raising deaths from such causes to at least 435 people, including 147 children, since the war started.

The Abu Jarad family has been forced to uproot and move across Gaza 11 times since war broke out nearly two years ago.

The Associated Press

Israel says the extent of hunger in Gaza has been exaggerated and blames Hamas for the continuation of the war, saying it could end it now if it surrendered, freed the hostages, disarmed and disbanded. Hamas says it won't disarm until a Palestinian state is established.

Along the coastal road, an unbroken column of every type of vehicle from carts and beaten-up cars to vans designed to carry goods was moving south, heavily laden with mattresses, gas cylinders and entire families perching on their belongings.

“We are heading to go sleep on the streets towards the beach, like this barefoot, we don't know where to go,” said Yasser Saleh, speaking as he stood on the edge of a rickety trailer being pulled by a car.

The total Palestinian death toll from the two-year war surpassed 65,000 on Wednesday, according to the Gaza health authorities.

The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

Allies of Donald Trump have dismissed claims Charlie Kirk was killed by a lone assassin.

Senior figures in the Maga movement believe Tyler Robinson, the student charged with Kirk's murder, is part of a wider conspiracy involving a Left-wing terrorist network, and that authorities need to widen the scope of their investigation.

The FBI has suggested Mr Robinson may have worked with others, although no one else has yet been charged in connection with the crime.

Kash Patel, the FBI director, told senators on Tuesday that the bureau was investigating “who, if anyone, was involved as an accomplice”.

Steve Bannon, Mr Trump's former chief strategist, claimed that Kirk's death was “not a simple murder” and that the truth was “far deeper and far more malignant”.

“There's a vast conspiracy at the back of this,” Mr Bannon said on his War Room podcast on Monday.

“I am absolutely not buying this [theory],” he added.

“Antifa needs to be designated as a domestic terrorist organisation,” he continued, referencing the radical Left-wing organisation that has been linked to recent attacks on immigration detention centres.

Mr Trump later announced on Truth Social on Wednesday evening that he would designate the Antifa movement as a “terrorist organisation”.

“I will also be strongly recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practices,” he said.

It was not clear what legal weight Mr Trump's proclamation carried.

Media reports emerged shortly after Kirk's death that the ammunition used by the assassin was engraved with expressions of transgender and Antifa “ideology”, but authorities later clarified this may have been a misunderstanding.

It later emerged one of the bullets was engraved with the phrase: “Hey fascist! Catch” and “Bella ciao,” a reference to a Second World War Italian antifascist song.

Mr Bannon went on to suggest that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) may have been involved in the incident by allegedly funding Antifa.

He doubled down on the comments on Wednesday, telling Politico: “The biggest thing is to broaden the assassination investigation from a single murder to the broader conspiracy. If we are going to go to war, let's go to war.”

Mr Bannon also told his podcast listeners he was highly sceptical about a text exchange prosecutors said took place between Mr Robinson and his transgender lover.

According to the messages, released by Utah authorities yesterday, Mr Robinson worried about his father's reaction if he failed to return with his grandfather's rifle, which he allegedly used to shoot Kirk last week.

“You shot a man in cold blood in front of the world... I think your parents may talk about that first before they say, ‘Oh, by the way, did you bring the rifle back?'” Mr Bannon said. “I am absolutely not buying this”.

Echoing sceptics on social media who claimed the messages setting out details of the alleged crime were too convenient, he added: “Why are you explaining everything?

“I'm particularly not buying those text messages, it just seems too stilted, too much like a script – actually, like a bad script.”

Matt Walsh, a Maga-aligned commentator with the Daily Wire, suggested the text exchange had been planned to protect Mr Robinson's lover from prosecution.

“The most plausible and sensible theory isn't that the FBI made up text messages and released them but that the killer and his boyfriend constructed this highly scripted text conversation as an alibi for the boyfriend,” he said.

Mr Bannon went on to urge investigators to probe connections to the assassination attempt on Mr Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year.

Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, shot at Mr Trump as he addressed a campaign rally in June 2024, grazing his ear with a bullet. Authorities have not commented on his motive and the shooting has spawned a number of conspiracy theories on the Right.

Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff and a long-time aide to Mr Trump, claimed a “vast domestic terror network” was responsible for Kirk's death.

Violence is being fomented by “organised doxing campaigns, the organised riots, the organised street violence… and the actual organised cells”, he claimed on an episode of Kirk's podcast on Monday, hosted by JD Vance, the vice-president.

“With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have… to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again,” he vowed.

Sean Davis, the founder of The Federalist, a conservative magazine, wrote on social media: “It's obvious now that Charlie Kirk's assassin was not working alone.

“He was clearly operating within a larger terrorist network focused on grooming, recruiting, and training terrorists for the purpose of planning and executing terrorist attacks.”

Mr Patel was repeatedly pressed by Republicans about whether Mr Robinson had allegedly acted alone when he testified in front of the Senate judiciary committee for several hours on Tuesday.

A number of people who communicated with the 22-year-old student on Discord, the gaming chat room, are being “investigated and interrogated” by the FBI, he told senators. Asked if others could have been involved in Kirk's death, he answered: “Yes.”

At one point, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley urged Mr Patel to investigate Kirk's murder as part of a wider wave of “anti-religion, anti-Christian violence”.

Dan Bongino, Mr Patel's deputy, has also said the bureau is looking into whether Mr Robinson acted as part of a “larger effort”.

“If there was any aiding and abetting, whether it be financial or someone who knew the specifics of it and failed to report that, we're looking into that,” Mr Bongino told Fox News on Monday, and declared: “There's not going to be a stone left unturned.”

Earlier this week, Mr Trump said he thought the 22-year-old had been radicalised on the internet and “went bad very quickly”.

Next month, the chief executives of Discord, Reddit, Twitch, and other forums popular with young men are invited to testify in front of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the radicalisation of users.

James Comer, the committee's chairman, said: “The politically motivated assassination of Charlie Kirk claimed the life of a husband, father, and American patriot. In the wake of this tragedy, and amid other acts of politically motivated violence, Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence.”

            Hot Stocks 





            When Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr suggested Jimmy Kimmel should be suspended and said, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” ABC and its local affiliates were listening. Within a matter of hours, ABC suspended Kimmel's show “indefinitely,” a stunning move that has raised serious First Amendment concerns.
    


            “Trump officials are repeatedly abusing their power to stop ideas they don't like, deciding who can speak, write, and even joke,” the ACLU said in a statement. “The Trump administration's actions, paired with ABC's capitulation, represent a grave threat to our First Amendment freedoms.”
    


            While many free speech groups are saying that Carr's conduct ran afoul of the spirit of the First Amendment, Carr did not violate the letter of the law. That's because the First Amendment bars government action limiting free speech. And Carr didn't take any action — he merely, and perhaps ironically, spoke.
    


            The takeaway: President Trump and his lieutenants have a clear grasp on how to pressure companies to change their entertainment content and news coverage without taking action that would provoke a legal battle.
    


            Carr is a long-serving member of the FCC who has become an increasingly visible attack dog for the Trump administration this year. He is an attorney who joined the FCC as a staffer in 2012 and became a commissioner, appointed by Trump, in 2017. Upon Trump's reelection, the president-elect chose him to chair the regulatory agency. Carr has been a regular at Mar-a-Lago as well as Fox News, and earlier this year he showed his loyalty to Trump by wearing a gold lapel pin of the president's face.
    


            He rose to prominence in 2024 after he wrote the chapter on the FCC in the conservative blueprint known as Project 2025. In it, he railed against technology and media companies' “censorship” of right-wing content and values — and promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion programs. He wrote that among the agency's top priorities should be “reining in Big Tech.”
    


            He has promised to hold broadcast TV and radio stations accountable, and just one hour after thanking the president for his appointment, Carr wrote on X, “We must dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.”
    


            Since Trump's election, Carr has gone on the attack, threatening broadcasters with enforcement actions and investigations for perceived slights against Trump and the MAGA movement. He also has an active presence on social media, and is unafraid to make his rooting interests known: Carr initially reacted to the news of ABC's Kimmel show suspension with a celebratory dancing GIF from “The Office.” On Thursday morning, he wrote on X that he was “glad to see that many broadcasters are responding to their viewers as intended.”
    


            On Wednesday afternoon, Carr tapped into preexisting MAGA media anger about a Monday night Kimmel monologue and used a right-wing podcaster's platform to blast Kimmel and pressure ABC's parent company Disney.
    


            “This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney,” Carr said.
    


            He also pointed out that local station owners have a lot of power over ABC, since those owners choose whether to carry ABC's national programming. “It's time for them to step up,” Carr said.
    


            Two big station group owners, Nexstar and Sinclair, came out publicly and criticized Kimmel after Carr's interview garnered attention on social media sites. Both station groups told ABC they would preempt Kimmel's show, which likely led the network to pull the show nationwide.
    


            Crucially, both station groups also need the Trump administration's blessing as they remake their businesses in the streaming age.
    


            Local stations broadcast over the public airwaves, so the FCC is tasked with licensing TV and radio stations and ensuring that they're operating in the “public interest.”
    


            While license renewals can be a time-consuming process for stations every eight years, they're typically not an uphill battle; the FCC hasn't denied any license renewal in decades. “Decades of regulatory capture has made case law that strongly favors incumbent licensees,” public interest lawyer Andrew Jay Schwartzman told CNN last year.
    


            But Trump repeatedly threatened TV license holders while campaigning for reelection, and he has continued to do so from his Oval Office desk. Carr has followed the president's lead and opened multiple investigations into media companies that Trump dislikes.
    


            Some of Carr's predecessors, and the one remaining Democratic FCC commissioner, Anna Gomez, have spoken out against what they view as the weaponization of the FCC.
    


            Pro-Trump influencers, meantime, have egged Carr on. Podcaster Benny Johnson reshared his interview with Carr after ABC yanked “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” and Johnson wrote, “This is what got Kimmel fired. Right here.”
    


            Johnson continued, “It's called soft power. The Left uses it all the time. Thanks to President Trump, the Right has learned how to wield power as well.”
    


            In this case, the power was rhetorical.
    


            “This is what's known as jawboning — when state actors use threats to inappropriately compel private action,” The Free Press wrote in an editorial on Thursday.
    


            “When a network drops high-profile talent hours after the FCC chairman makes a barely veiled threat, then it's no longer just a business decision. It's government coercion,” the editors wrote.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Earth-like exoplanet could be habitable, and astronomers may know soon","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/science/exoplanet-possibly-habitable","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 18:00:07 GMT","


            Astronomers might be close to confirming the presence of an Earth-like atmosphere on an exoplanet for the first time, if more detailed analyses verify preliminary observations from the James Webb Space Telescope.
    


            The planet is part of a planetary system about 40 light-years away from Earth called TRAPPIST-1, which five Belgian astronomers discovered in 2016 and named after their favorite beer. The system has been heavily studied ever since.
    


            “As a planetary system, it's as alien as it gets,” said Néstor Espinoza, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. “The star is very, very small — the size of Jupiter — and it has at least seven rocky planets orbiting around it. Three of those are in what we call the habitable zone, which means they are close enough to the star that if they had an atmosphere, they could sustain liquid water.”
    


            Espinoza and his colleagues focused on TRAPPIST-1 e, the fourth planet from the star in the system, in a study published last week in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Four observations performed in 2023 with the Webb telescope were unable to rule out the presence of an atmosphere, prompting  optimism.
    


            “Based on the first four observations, we cannot tell that (this planet) doesn't have an atmosphere, so the dream is still alive — it could still have an atmosphere,” Espinoza said, “and that's super exciting, because we do have a follow-up program of 15 more observations.”
    


            The Webb telescope has only been able to rule out any atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 b, the innermost planet, but the jury is still out on the other six, Espinoza said, with TRAPPIST-1 e seen as one of the best candidates for liquid surface water.
    


            “Three years ago, before the launch of James Webb, these kinds of studies were science fiction,” Espinoza said about the possibility of detecting atmospheres on faraway planets. “Now I'm pretty confident we'll be able to see what kind of atmosphere TRAPPIST-1 e could have — and if it has an Earth-like atmosphere, we'll be able to tell.”
    


TRAPPIST-1 e is similar to Earth in size and orbits its star every six days — a much faster rate than Earth orbits the sun. That's because the star is much smaller than our sun, and all the planets are close to it. “If you could magically bring the TRAPPIST-1 star to our solar system,” Espinoza said, “all the planets and their orbits would fit within the orbit of Mercury.”
    


            When looking for an atmosphere, astronomers wait for a planet to transit in front of its star and notice any minor changes in the starlight that filters through. They search for telltale signs of an atmosphere while learning about its chemical composition.
    


            With the four transits observed by the Webb telescope in 2023, astronomers were able to rule out the presence of a primary, hydrogen-based atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 e, which was likely blown away by significant amounts of radiation emitted by its star. (Earth similarly lost its primordial, primary atmosphere early on but then built a secondary one; astronomers hope that TRAPPIST-1 e could have done the same.)
    


            This scenario is detailed in a second study, also published last week in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. It notes that the planet is unlikely to have an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide like those of Venus and Mars, and points toward a nitrogen-heavy one, more similar to Earth and Saturn's icy moon Titan.
    


            “TRAPPIST-1e remains one of our most compelling habitable-zone planets, and these new results take us a step closer to knowing what kind of world it is,” Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and coauthor of both studies, said in a statement. “The evidence pointing away from Venus- and Mars-like atmospheres sharpens our focus on the scenarios still in play.”
    


            Espinoza said that his team plans to finish the new round of 15 observations by the end of the year, with two-thirds already completed. If the team finds irrefutable signs of an atmosphere, even more Webb telescope observations could be warranted in the hopes of detecting specific chemical signatures of gases such as methane, which is associated with life on Earth.
    


            Confirmation of an atmosphere would be groundbreaking, Espinoza said. “It would settle a huge debate going on right now on whether these red dwarf systems can sustain an atmosphere or not,” he said. “Red dwarfs are actually the majority of the stars in the universe. So, if it can happen there, it can happen anywhere. The possibilities for life just kind of multiply.”
    


            However, even if an atmosphere was ruled out, the result would still be exciting, he said, because it would make life on Earth even more special. It would also set the stage for future research to look at exoplanets orbiting around yellow dwarf stars such as the sun, using telescopes even more powerful than Webb that are still in the planning stages.
    


            These first James Webb results for TRAPPIST-1e are immensely exciting, said Michaël Gillon, research director of the Astrobiology Research Unit at Belgium's University of Liège. Gillon, who led the original discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system, was not part of the recent study.
    


            “The data are not yet conclusive,” he added in an email, “but they prove that JWST has the power to detect an Earth-like atmosphere if it exists. For the first time in history, we are truly within reach of discovering an atmosphere around a potentially habitable rocky exoplanet.”
    


            The planets in TRAPPIST-1 have a range of conditions similar to the terrestrial planets in our solar system. These conditions make them potential hosts for surface liquid water, but they require an atmosphere to prevent the water from freezing on the surface or sublimating to space, said Eric Agol, a professor in the department of astronomy at the University of Washington. Agol was not involved with the study but is working on the new set of observations with Espinoza and his colleagues.
    


            TRAPPIST-1 e is the most promising of the seven planets for hosting an Earth-like atmosphere, according to Agol.
    


            “The results are interesting, but also incomplete,” he added in an email. “I am agnostic about whether TRAPPIST-1 e may have an Earth-like atmosphere or not, and the current study hasn't affected my opinion.”
    


            According to Howard Chen, an assistant professor of space sciences at the Florida Institute of Technology, TRAPPIST-1e sits right at a “tipping point” between opposite states, based on computer simulations that he detailed in a new study that published Wednesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Based on its history, the planet can emerge as either extremely dry or water-rich: “That means both ‘bare rock' and ‘atmosphere-bearing' scenarios remain physically plausible,” he added in an email. Chen was not involved with the new research.
    


            TRAPPIST-1e could have formed as a desert world, like its inner neighbors, or as a wet, ocean-covered planet, he concluded. “JWST's current data can't distinguish between those scenarios yet, but that ambiguity is exactly what our simulations predict,” Chen said. “The fact that TRAPPIST-1e can plausibly be either very dry or very wet means the next few JWST (observations) could deliver a dramatic reveal.”

BRUSSELS, September 18. /TASS/. The Chinese port of Ningbo is preparing to launch a cargo ship that will test a new shipping route via the Northern Sea Route (NSR), Politico wrote.

The vessel's departure is scheduled for September 20. Although Chinese companies have previously conducted trial shipments via the NSR, the upcoming route will be more challenging. ""They did point-to-point trips, like from one Chinese port to Hamburg or to St. Petersburg,"" Malte Humpert, senior fellow and founder of the Arctic Institute, a Washington-based think tank that studies Arctic security, told Politico. ""This voyage is different. They're trying four ports in China, then through the Arctic, then the UK, Rotterdam, Hamburg and Gdansk. That actually resembles a normal shipping route,"" he said.

Ten years ago, everyone thought that before 2040 or 2050, container shipping in the Arctic would hardly be possible, the expert noted. ""And here we are in 2025, and the Chinese are doing it. Do they make money? It doesn't really matter <...> it's about gaining the knowledge, understanding how to do it. That's what the Chinese are doing - they're gaining the experience and training the shipping crews,"" he said.

The development of the Northern Sea Route became possible due to climate change as changes occur more rapidly in the Arctic region than in other parts of the planet, Humpert said. However, he believes that most global trade will continue to flow through the traditional route via the Suez Canal.

""If you play this 30 or 40 years into the future, and the ice melts another 30, 40, 50%, suddenly you have six months of no ice [in the waters of the NSR], and the Arctic becomes a very interesting equation. <…> The Arctic is not going to replace the Suez Canal tomorrow. That's not what's happening. The Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, they will remain there. But the Arctic will become supplemental,"" the expert concluded.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Critics say ‘authoritarianism isn't coming – it's already here' amid widespread condemnation of talkshow's suspension

The indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show has prompted impassioned calls for a boycott against Disney, ABC's parent company, and other major media conglomerates that have refused to air Kimmel's show.

Boycott calls grew after ABC announced it would indefinitely suspend the popular show following complaints from Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr. Carr's complaints stem from Kimmel's recent monologue in which he addressed the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk by saying: “Many in Maga land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.”

Carr, who was appointed by Donald Trump earlier this year, said Kimmel's comments were “truly sick” and that ABC had violated its “public interest” broadcast obligations. ABC's suspension of the show also came after Nexstar Media, one of the US's largest owners of TV stations, said it “strongly object[ed]” to Kimmel's comments and would pre-empt, or halt, any of the show's episodes set to air on its stations “for the foreseeable future”.

Meanwhile, conservative TV conglomerate Sinclair announced it would run a tribute to Kirk during Kimmel's time slot on Friday. It also called on Kimmel to issue a formal apology and make a personal donation to Kirk's family and his rightwing political advocacy group, Turning Point USA.

Overnight, calls to boycott ABC and Disney emerged, with grassroots political advocacy group 50501 leading the charge. In a statement, the group said: “Jimmy Kimmel wasn't suspended because of what he said. He was suspended because the FCC threatened his employer. That's state-sanctioned censorship and it is a giant red flag … Authoritarianism isn't coming, it's already here. Today it's Jimmy. Tomorrow it's the rest of us.”

The group went on to add: “Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group own the largest number of local ABC affiliates. These two companies are currently seeking approval from the FCC for business deals. In other words these media giants have every incentive to bend the knee to authoritarian pressure coming from the FCC and the administration to get their deals across the finish line. We're done watching this unfold in silence … It's time we speak in the only language they seem to respect – their money.”

As part of its boycott calls, 50501 urged the public to write to ABC, Nexstar and Sinclair with the following script: “I object to the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel Live after pressure from the administration. This is censorship plain and simple and it's not what American values stand for. We need leaders to protect freedom of speech, not punish it.”

Boycott calls have also emerged on numerous Reddit threads as well as on X via the hashtag #BoycottDisney.

One user wrote on BlueSky: “Heard from a friend at Disney+ that there are multiple levels of freakout internally, both from internal dissatisfaction, concerns about subscription cancelations, and of course the big one: concern about a boycott spilling over into parks and cruises.”

On Wednesday, CNN correspondent Brian Stelter wrote on X that he asked Carr if he had any new comments following Kimmel's show suspension. “He sent me this gif,” Stelter said, alongside a gif from The Office, where two characters, Michael Scott and Dwight Schrute, are shown celebrating with their hands in the air.

The Guardian has contacted ABC, Disney, Nexstar, Sinclair and the FCC for comment.

Reacting to the news of Kimmel's show suspension, Trump responded gleefully, saying: “Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.” He added that Kimmel had “worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible”.

In July, Trump celebrated Paramount's decision to cancel The Late Show With Stephen Colbert – the US's highest rated late-night show – after Colbert also mocked Trump. Writing on TruthSocial, Trump said: “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert!”

The suspension of Kimmel's show has also prompted condemnation from the public and lawmakers, with House Democratic leaders demanding the resignation of Carr.

Free speech advocacy group Pen America, decried ABC's decision, saying: “This marks a dark new level of capitulation and censorship of speech more redolent of autocracies than democracies.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Cult of Fitness column by Alex Cyr dives into the wonderful, weird world of fitness trends and why they endure.

Here are a few things that make a successful cult: Grandiose goals, devoted members and a collective distaste for the status quo.

The new Don't Die movement – which comprises more than 11,000 supporters who plan to cheat death by foregoing worldly pleasures such as alcohol, cigarettes, late bedtimes and potato chips – has all three. The goal, according to Don't Die's online oath, is living as healthily as possible to build “towards an infinite horizon, and fighting for the freedom to exist as long as one chooses.”

A note to readers: The Globe introduces new design for Life, Culture and Style sections

It's an ideology for those more concerned with being here for a long time rather than a good time. And at its centre is a fourth and crucially important part of a thriving cult: an influential leader. At the helm of Don't Die is multi-millionaire Bryan Johnson, the world's top biohacker who, at 48, is trying to live forever.

In case you missed the Netflix documentary on Johnson, the book he wrote on the movement or my piece on my day at his Don't Die Summit earlier this year in New York City, let me catch you up. Johnson, guided by a team of 30 medical professionals, has eliminated aging accelerators including smoking, alcohol and poor sleep from his life, while adopting a strict diet, exercise regime and red light therapy practice. That's in addition to the blood transfusions, hormone therapy and facial fat injections to stave off Father Time. 

Johnson's one-man science experiment has morphed into a full-blown ideology, or, as he calls it, a religion.Courtesy of Netflix/Netflix

His extreme lifestyle precludes him from doing normal human things such as dating, traditional partying and being in India (the air quality just didn't cut it). In exchange, his way of life has granted him – by his team's measurement – the biological health of a young adult, and a pace of aging that is nearly half of normal.

Johnson's weird, one-man science experiment has morphed into a full-blown ideology, or, as he calls it, a religion. He now has a social media follower base across several platforms of more than four million, which includes fervent superfans, curious onlookers and downright haters. His previous lives as a devout Mormon, and then a founder and chief executive of Braintree (a company he sold to PayPal in 2013 for US$800-million) have clearly helped Johnson blossom into a gifted frontman. 

He has full plans to change the world, and is already at work: He has hinted at an initiative to test the nutritional value of popular processed foods and lay bare the results to challenge companies to produce healthier snacks. Johnson wants to grow this diverse “army” to a billion. He's even considering selling its adjacent wellness company, Blueprint. 

“Here's the truth: my secret plan is for Don't Die to become the world's most influential ideology by 2027,” he wrote on X in January. “Our existence depends upon it … It's a fight against our self-destructive tendencies and the systems that enable them.”

So, yeah, he has created a cult around making proper health choices, and it's all so … Gen-Z. In the Church of Johnson, health is the highest virtue, biometric data is the grand judge and junk food is the devil. It's easy to see how following Johnson's regime could quickly descend into a totalitarian approach to physical wellness for the rest of us mere mortals, and make us feel bad about ourselves the next time we eat just about anything from a 7-Eleven.

Are annual check-ups still a thing? It depends

Some people also criticize Johnson's gonzo brand of N=1 science, calling it unrealistic and reckless in how it influences his followers to make snap judgments on everything from macadamia nuts and shiitake mushrooms to gene therapy and the psychoactive drug ketamine.

Successful cults tend to have a fifth thing in common, often rooted underneath a pile of nonsense: a point. Even the catastrophically deadly People's Temple was founded on the desire for progressive ideals in postwar U.S.

Johnson's point is that we suck at aging. Three-quarters of Canadians aged 65 or older have a chronic disease such as hypertension, diabetes or cancer. All of our ailments have made drug expenditure in Canada go from $55 billion to $84 billion in the last 12 years. Meanwhile, almost three-quarters of American adults are overweight or obese.

On some level, we know all of this. And yet, most of us have grown up on processed and fast foods and still eat them. One in four Canadians are chronically sleep-deprived, and only half of us exercise enough. Now, our health care system is too burdened to make meaningful waves in preventative medicine, so they play catch up and treat the sick, as the rest of us wait for it to be our turn.

We lose muscle power as we age. Here's how to stay strong and fast

But when a middle-aged man with glowing skin and chiselled abs exposes that dissonance to millions daily, it strikes a deep chord with those afraid of death, and grates on those who just don't want to accept that he might be right, and that his constant reminders of our own self-destruction are deeply uncomfortable.

Like him or not, Johnson is creating a new category of health aspiration, somewhere between the safe but slow mainstream and a scattered web of hopeful but unproven holistic treatments. At the very least, his propensity to measure everything he ingests is a refreshing alternative to the multitude of influencers claiming that we should pop Advil like candy, or cure our cancers with apple cider vinegar.

A lack of time, energy, desire, money, or all four will probably preclude the majority of us from becoming Don't Die diehards, anyway. We can just keep taking it all in with a grain of salt – unless, of course, you have high blood pressure.

First Person is a daily personal piece submitted by readers. Have a story to tell? See our guidelines at tgam.ca/essayguide.

When cancer unexpectedly happens, it gives you a new way to look at life. 

Two years ago I was diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic melanoma. After surgery, radiation and immunotherapy I am now in remission and feeling really good. 

A note to readers: The Globe introduces new design for Life, Culture and Style sections

During treatment I thought about what I really enjoyed in my life. That bucket list didn't seem too important. But family and grandchildren? They are a big source of happiness.

As I looked back at my 70-plus years to see what gave me contentment, happiness and strength, I had to really think. Teaching high school was important. I loved working with teenagers. I loved volunteering, organizing fall fairs and helping newcomers settle in Canada. And I remembered I also loved learning how to work with willow. 

About 30 years ago I took a two-day class that taught participants how to build a bent willow chair. It was fantastic! Willow has a spirituality about it. It has strength and flexibility in each piece. We had to learn how to bend the soft wood, not to force it but to feel the way the willow wants to bend. It is a lot like life – learning how to bend with things without breaking.

First Person: My death doula training also taught me how to talk to the living

I came home from the class and thought I could teach it to others in one day. Over the next three decades I ran classes about making a diamondback willow chair. Almost all the participants were women. The days were magical. Some women had barely ever held a hammer let alone an electric drill. They came unsure and afraid that they would wreck their chair. But willow is so flexible that with kindness and care you can shape it. Everyone finished their chair, and took it home that day. They left tired, but proud, and many were surprised at what they could accomplish. 

In that class we learned how to adjust to what life throws at us. Whether it be cancer or building willow chairs. Years later, when I see these women, they still talk about the day they made their willow chair. 

Now as I enter a new phase in life, I have found something new I want to check off that bucket list after all. I want to build my own willow coffin. What would be better than a green burial? Willow is a symbol of endurance, strength and female energy. 

I can't do the building on my own. I'll be assisting a master coffin builder who was trained in the U.K. under a master weaver. 

It still hasn't sunk in that I will be building my own coffin, until Tamara, the builder, asked me for my height. Of course the coffin is made to fit just me. So we began.

First Person: My battle with cancer taught me that a supportive family is a gift, not a given

On the first day, I spent three hours weaving willow branches to form the base. I started on the floor, then moved to a stool. My fingers and thumbs were sore but the bottom of my coffin looked perfect to me. I remembered that you have to treat the willow with care, bend too fast or too much and it can break. And some did.

Next time, I worked on the body part of the coffin. I even laid down inside to see if it fit. Lying in your coffin is a bit of a mind game but I just enjoyed the experience, took a photo and laughed. The longer, body compartment took the longest to build and was the most difficult. Tamara patiently guided me how to weave the three willow rods, over two and under one. I definitely needed patience.

The final section to work on was the lid. Fortunately, the top is similar to the bottom and I was much faster weaving it this time. There were some details that Tamara showed me how to fix, and I didn't realize that I could weave three pieces of fine willow to make a braid for a loop. We only broke about four pieces this time, and I successfully made loops to hold the lid on. 

The finished product is a willow work of art. I feel proud of what I've done, but I have no plans to use it for a long time. 

Since willow can last indoors for years, my coffin now sits in my spare room on a guest bed. Each time I enter that room I am taken back when I see the large coffin sitting there, my coffin. I simply smile and breathe in the wonderful willow fragrance. 

I'm still not sure if I should show off my work to those who come to visit. What would my friends and family think if I ask, “Do you want to see my coffin?” I'll play it by ear. 

Talking about death can be difficult. We all will die one day, and we should plan ahead. Think about what you want for your burial and celebration.

Fighting the Russians after Moscow invaded Ukraine was an attractive prospect for Craig Lang.

His marriage had broken down, he was dishonourably discharged from the US army and had spent time in a Kenyan jail.

But he hit rock bottom this week when a Florida judge found the 35-year-old guilty of conspiracy to murder, after Serafin Lorenzo Jr and his wife Deanna were sprayed with bullets in an office park in Estero, on the Gulf Coast, in 2018.

Lang was initially wanted for murder but Ukraine is barred from deporting anyone who could face the death penalty, suggesting prosecutors may have revised his charges so that he could be extradited.

During the trial, Lang was accused of launching an “international crime spree”.

His signing up to fight in Ukraine was the latest in his military career, which started when he joined the US army in 2008.

Serving in uniform seemed to be the best way to deal with his troubled childhood, which included five years in a foster home.

He saw action in Iraq and Afghanistan, suffering brain injuries when his Humvee hit a roadside bomb.

Lang's time in the US military effectively ended when he deserted in 2013. With his marriage crumbling, he drove non-stop from the army base in El Paso, Texas, to his wife's home in North Carolina, some 1,800 miles.

Equipped with night vision goggles, two assault rifles, and claymore mines, he planned to kill her, but was thwarted by the police.

After a spell in jail, Lang was dishonourably discharged in June 2014.

He lost everything. His veterans' benefits stopped, and he had no health insurance.

A messy divorce culminated with his wife being awarded the family home, custody of their child, and his truck.

He drifted from one job to the next.

Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, Russia was making its play to annex Crimea.

With only 6,000 combat-trained troops, it fell to a gaggle of paramilitary units to halt the advance, whose ranks were swelled by foreigners.

Around 40 Americans answered the call, Lang was one of them.

He joined the “Right Sector”, an ultra-nationalist unit led by Dmytro Yarosh, whose dream was to build an ethnically pure Ukraine.

According to Buzzfeed News, Lang's interviews with the US media turned him into a poster boy for Ukrainians and other Americans who wanted to join the fight.

But after two years in Ukraine, Lang was bored.

The fighting had died down. He joined forces with Alex Zwiefelhofer, another American deserter who had joined the Right Sector.

Searching for adventure, the pair decided the time had come to go elsewhere.

In June 2017, they drew up plans to fight al-Shabaab, a jihadist terrorist organisation allied with al-Qaeda in East Africa. It did not go well.

The pair were arrested on the Kenya–South Sudan border and held for a couple of months in a Nairobi jail, with Zwiefelhofer contracting cholera.

They were deported back to the US and met up in Florida in April 2018.

Still yearning for excitement, they hatched plans to fight the Maduro regime in Venezuela.

But there was one snag. Lang and Zwiefelhofer needed money.

They placed an advert on the website Armslist.com which read: “For Sale: Lots Of Guns. Leaving the country soon. Looking to sale [sic] all my guns as I can't take them with me.”

Serafin “Danny” Lorenzo, 52, and his wife 50-year-old Deana, who wheeled and dealed in property, antiques and weapons, responded.

The cache, being offered by “Jeremy Goldstein”, a pseudonym, included five Glocks and a Uzi, they claimed.

“Goldstein” turned down the offer of an Oris watch, but accepted an offer of $3,000.

The deal was to be completed in Estero, between Naples and Fort Myers.

Waiting in the shade, Lang and Zwiefelhofer, pretending to be Goldstein, awaited the arrival of their victims.

The crackle of gunfire erupted as they unleashed a volley of bullets.

In all, 63 rounds were fired. Mrs Lorenzo was hit in the abdomen, neck, and head, her husband was hit in the head and elsewhere on his body.

Police rushed to the scene, but they did not find the blood-soaked bodies until the following morning, after being called by staff at a nearby business complex.

The $3,000 Lorenzo had withdrawn for the deal was gone.

Details of Lang and Zwiefelhofer's plans and how they made their escape emerged in a court indictment.

In the weeks beforehand, the pair had met in a Miami hotel room, where they discussed smuggling weapons to Miami, stealing a yacht and smuggling themselves to South America, court records show.

After the killings, they split up. Zwiefelhofer returned to Wisconsin, where he was arrested in May the following year.

Lang abandoned his ambition to fight in Venezuela for reasons that remain unclear. Instead, he applied for a passport in the name of Dameon Shae Adcock, a co-conspirator, which he used to return to Ukraine.

Adcock was paid $1,500 (£1,100) cash and given a case of guns and smoke bombs in return for his part in the escape plot. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years and eight months in jail.

In Kyiv, Lang laid low working as an English tutor and quickly became engaged to Anna Osipovich, an English-speaking Ukrainian.

However, Interpol were alerted to his location when he left the country, prompting Ukrainian authorities to detain him in August 2019.

His conviction at a Florida court on Monday brought to an end a four-year extradition battle that went to the European Court of Human Rights, after Lang argued that he would face execution in Florida.

In exchange for his extradition, federal prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty and he was taken into custody by Ukrainian special forces in 2024 before being handed over to the US.

Lang and Zwiefelhofer, who were convicted in March, both face life sentences, having been found guilty of firearms offences, robbery, and violating the Neutrality Act, in addition to murder.

Lang will be sentenced in March 2026 and faces a maximum sentence of life in federal prison.

The resolution was introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace, who has repeatedly attacked Omar for her faith and Somalian origin.

An extremist House Republican's attempt to censure Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) failed by just one vote on Wednesday, after Democrats maneuvered against it.

A vote to table the censure resolution succeeded 214 to 213, with all Democrats and four Republicans voting to kill the measure. The resolution, introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina), would have removed Omar from her assignments on the Education and Workforce Committee and the Budget Committee.

Mace claimed her censure effort was about Omar's criticism of Charlie Kirk. In an interview last week, Omar had offered sympathy to Kirk's family, while criticizing many of Kirk's far right beliefs and condemning Republicans for their attacks on the left following the shooting.

However, Republicans have attempted to censure the progressive lawmaker numerous times over the years. Mace posted about Omar over 75 times on her X account in recent days, reporters noted, spreading false accusations about her beliefs and waging outright racist, Islamophobic attacks on her faith and Somalian origin.

Democrats said that Mace was just trying to boost her profile after entering the South Carolina gubernatorial race last month. Omar noted that Mace is sending out fundraising messages based on her attacks.

“This is what Nancy Mace is sending out to fundraise. It is unbefitting of a Member of Congress to spread blatant lies and misinformation. Utterly shameful,” Omar wrote on X, posting a screenshot of a Mace fundraiser calling Omar a “sick, racist, USA-hating RADICAL.” 

Omar also pointed out that the resolution itself doesn't include a single quote from Omar on Kirk.

“Nancy Mace is trying to censure me over comments I never said,” Omar said. “Unlike her, I have routinely condemned political violence, no matter the political ideology. This is all an attempt to push a false story so she can fundraise and boost her run for Governor.”

The progressive lawmaker thanked Republican lawmakers for joining Democrats in opposing the censure and “defend[ing] the first amendment.” 

Republican Representatives Mike Flood (Nebraska), Jeff Hurd (Colorado), Tom McClintock (California) and Cory Mills (Florida) voted with Democrats to table the resolution. Mace had fast tracked the resolution, bypassing the normal committee process to bring it to a floor vote.

Mills had voted against the censure after Democrats threatened a retaliatory censure against him, as Axios reported, introduced by Congressional Progressive Caucus leader Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas). Casar said he plans to withdraw his resolution now that the censure attempt against Omar failed.

The vote comes as Republicans have increasingly taken steps after Kirk's death last week to silence the voices of those they claim are disrespecting him — though many on the left say the right is actually seeking to use the event as a bludgeon to punish anyone they disagree with. President Donald Trump has launched a sweeping campaign to crack down on his opponents in the wake of the killing.

            A spellbinding image of two tiny but vibrant “ladybugs of the sea” has won the Ocean Photographer of the Year 2025 award.
    


            Taken by Indonesia-based photographer Yury Ivanov at his local dive site in Bali, the winning photograph shows two amphipods, which stand at just three millimeters tall, resting on a piece of coral, according to a press release from competition organizers Oceanographic Magazine and Blancpain on Thursday.
    


            “It required a lot of patience and precision to compose and light the shot properly,” said Ivanov in a statement. “The result reveals an intimate glimpse of underwater life that is often overlooked.”
    


Otherworldly images show beauty of oceans in photo competition



            Winning the competition “is an incredible feeling,” added Ivanov. “This award is not just about one image, but about celebrating the ocean itself – its fragility, its diversity, and its extraordinary power to inspire us.”
    


            His picture was chosen as the overall winner from a field of more than 15,000 images submitted by photographers all over the world, with nine category winners also selected.
    


            Category winners include a stunning shot of a personal watercraft navigating huge waves at the famed Nazaré surf spot in Portugal; a haunting image of a long-finned pilot whale foetus lying under their dead mother's body during whale hunting season in the Faroe Islands; and a beautiful photo of a female yellow pygmy goby fish releasing newly-hatched larvae from her mouth.
    


            “The winners of this year's Ocean Photographer of the Year remind us that photography is more than art – it is a bridge. Their images connect people to the ocean in ways words cannot, reaching those who may never dive in it or paddle on it, but whose lives are deeply intertwined with it,” said Will Harrison, director of Ocean Photographer of the Year, in the release.
    


            “In a time of planetary urgency, this year's photographers invite the world to see, feel, and ultimately care. Their work is critical, because we protect what we understand,” he added.
    


            The winning photographs will form part of an Ocean Photographer of the Year exhibition, which will make its first stop at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney from November 6.

            Irish novelist Sally Rooney skipped an awards ceremony in London, saying that she risked being arrested under terror laws due to her support for the banned activist group Palestine Action.
    


            Rooney's editor Alex Bowler read her statement at the Sky Arts Awards on Tuesday, where the author's fourth book “Intermezzo” won the award for literature.
    


            “I wish I could be here with you this evening to accept the honor in person,” her statement read, “but, because of my support for non-violent anti-war protest, I'm advised I can no longer safely enter the UK without potentially facing arrest.”
    


            Rooney reiterated her “belief in the dignity and beauty of all human life, and my solidarity with the people of Palestine,” in the statement.
    


            London's Metropolitan Police told CNN in a statement Thursday it “wouldn't comment on an individual at the point of arrest or prior to this.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Rooney and Bowler for comment through Faber, her publisher.
    


            Palestine Action is a UK-based organization that aims to disrupt the operations of weapons manufacturers connected to the Israeli government.
    


            British authorities have had their eyes   on the group since 2020, but its June 2025 action – when activists broke into Britain's largest airbase, RAF Brize Norton, vandalizing two Airbus Voyager refueling planes – led to its proscription.
    


            Palestine Action is believed to be the first direct-action group to be designated a terrorist organization in the UK. The ban means that showing support for the organization carries a maximum sentence of up to 14 years in prison.
    


            Civil liberties campaigners across the UK and beyond have condemned the designation, saying that applying terrorism laws to such a group risk chilling free speech and assembly and sets a dangerous precedent for protest rights.
    


What is Palestine Action, the group linked to hundreds of arrests in the UK?



            Since its terror designation, more than 1,500 individuals have been arrested at solidarity protests across the UK, many for holding signs that read: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”
    


            In August, Rooney also denounced the ban, writing an Irish Times column titled: “I too support Palestine Action. If this makes me a ‘supporter of terror' under UK law, so be it.”
    


            She wrote that “an increasing number of artists and writers can no longer safely travel to Britain to speak in public” and that she intended to take the residual fees from BBC adaptations of her first two novels to donate them toward “supporting Palestine Action and direct action against genocide in whatever way I can.”
    


            Israel has been facing growing international condemnation. A United Nations commission concluded this week that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. Israel denies any accusations of genocide.
    


            “If the British state considers this ‘terrorism,'” Rooney wrote, “then perhaps it should investigate the shady organizations that continue to promote my work and fund my activities, such as WH Smith and the BBC.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the retailer WH Smith. A spokesperson for the BBC told CNN in a statement that Rooney does not currently receive payment directly from the BBC, “and she is not contracted by us.”
    


            Rooney, best known for her novel “Normal People” and its subsequent adaptation for TV, has long criticized Israel's occupation of the West Bank and its pre-war blockade of Gaza.
    


            In 2021, she refused to sell the Hebrew-language rights for her third novel “Beautiful World, Where Are You” to an Israeli publisher out of her support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a Palestinian-led global campaign promoting boycotts, divestments, and economic sanctions against Israel.
    


            The writer's stance underlines Ireland's longstanding support of the Palestinian cause.
    


            Ireland is one of the most pro-Palestinian countries in Europe, a position born out of a shared experience of subjugation by an occupying state.
    


            In January, the Irish government joined South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) accusing Israel of genocide, and the country appears close to passing a bill that will ban trade with illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
    


            Nonetheless, Rooney has criticized Ireland's government for not speaking out more forcefully in favor of protesters recently arrested in the UK.
    


            “If the Government in Dublin truly believes that Israel is committing genocide,” Rooney said, “how can it look elsewhere while its nearest neighbor funds and supports that genocide and its own citizens are arrested simply for speaking out?”
    


            CNN has reached out to Ireland's Foreign Ministry for comment.

            A federal judge has blocked the US government from repatriating some Guatemalan minors in its custody, citing concerns the Trump administration may be violating their legal and constitutional protections.
    


            The decision Thursday from Judge Timothy Kelly halts the removals while the court considers a lawsuit that argues that the children, who have received neither a final removal order nor permission from the attorney general to voluntarily depart from the United States, must be allowed full immigration proceedings under federal law.
    


            Kelly, an appointee of President Donald Trump, questioned the administration's handling of the operation.
    


            “Defendants' conduct does not inspire confidence that they themselves are convinced that they have the authority to proceed as they would like,” Kelly wrote. “If their statutory authority is so ‘unambiguous,' why exercise it in the middle of the night on a holiday weekend with nothing but a late-night (or early-morning) notice to the children's caretakers and advocates?”
    


            Kelly also added, “Defendants should not construe this decision as an invitation to take similar action with respect to these other unaccompanied alien children.”
    


            The lawsuit, filed by the National Immigration Law Center, includes 10 Guatemalan children ages 10 to 17, most of whom are in ongoing immigration proceedings. Lawyers argued the children – including an indigenous 10-year-old who had been abused in Guatemala – would face grave risks if returned.
    


            Declarations filed in the case described children “confused and scared” when they were pulled from their beds. At one shelter, “a young girl was so scared that she vomited.” One 17-year-old recalled being woken at 2 a.m. and said he “felt like [he] lost [his] breath.” Another child told the court she feared she would kill herself if forced to return.
    


            The Justice Department and Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment.
    


            Kelly emphasized that Congress had created a specific process for handling unaccompanied minors and that the government's late-night flights appeared to skirt those rules. “Plaintiffs also face irreparable harm absent an injunction. And the balance of equities supports relief now,” he wrote.
    


            “Today's court decision is a significant victory for the hundreds of children who are now safe from the Trump administration's unlawful attempt to expel them from the United States,” said Efrén C. Olivares, vice president of litigation and legal strategy at the National Immigration Law Center.
    


            “This decision should send a clear message to the administration that they have no legal authority to circumvent law to expel unaccompanied children without due process,” Olivares added.

TERRA ALTA, W.V. (AP) — Every day, LaRanda Schoolcraft drives five minutes down the hill from her Terra Alta home to visit the family member she calls her “person.”

“My grandpa has dementia now and doesn't always make sense,” she said. “But I see the care he receives every day, and I ride the emotional rollercoaster beside him.”

Carl Schoolcraft, originally from Clendenin, has a white beard that nursing home workers keep well trimmed. He used to dress as Santa Claus each year.

His granddaughter says the nurses and aides at Hopemont Hospital see him as their adopted grandfather.

Last month, Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced the sale of this state-owned nursing home and the three others to a private company.

And while the company says it has no plans to cut staff, public records show it employs fewer nursing staff on average at its facilities in other states than are employed at the state's hospitals.

For people like Schoolcraft, living at home until the end of life isn't an option.

With few family members left, Schoolcraft lived alone, but his granddaughter checked on him every day. Earlier this year, she arrived to find the man who built her a treehouse beyond her ability to care for him, and she moved him to the state-owned nursing home.

He was diagnosed with a fatal brain disease that causes dementia and other problems like confusion and trouble with mobility.

▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel.

During a recent visit, she found him making his way down a well-traveled linoleum hall and told him she would wheel him to his room for their daily talk.




She told him about a trip she's planning and asked him how he likes the workers.

“I ask them about their lives,” he said. “I ask them about their loves. I ask them about their happies.”

Other nursing home options were more than an hour away from her, so she wouldn't have been able to visit as often.

And when he was first diagnosed about six months ago, he was combative, and a private nursing home in nearby Kingwood wouldn't accept him.

“Deciding to put him there was the hardest decision I've ever had to make,” she said. “And it was awful to come to that decision. But if there's anything that was of consolation or that did make it better, it is the staff that's there.”

She said she knows the facility could use upgrades and more workers. She sees single employees feeding two people at a time on a daily basis.

But she knows he would have wanted to be close to her.

“I'll be able to sleep at night,” she said. “I'll know that I was there, and I did everything he would have wanted.”

The nursing homes being sold are Hopemont Hospital, Jackie Withrow Hospital in Beckley, Lakin Hospital in West Columbia in Mason County and John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont.

West Virginia opened the historic buildings to meet the urgent health needs of their times.

State lawmakers passed an act in 1911 to build Hopemont Hospital for the isolation of tuberculosis patients.

Jackie Withrow Hospital in Beckley originally served people with that infectious disease as well.

In 1899, lawmakers passed a law requiring hospitals to be built for people who worked in dangerous industries. The Fairmont site where the John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center is located was once the location of Miners Hospital Three, where victims of mining accidents were treated.

And Black delegates in the West Virginia Legislature proposed the creation of Lakin Hospital during the era of segregation to serve as the state's Black mental hospital.

All four became state-run nursing homes, often serving people who couldn't pay for care or whom private companies wouldn't accept.

Morrisey announced the $60 million sale of the health care facilities on Aug. 12. He said they were operating at a $6 million yearly loss to the state.

The nursing home company Majestic Care will run the nursing homes.

Company officials have said they are in the early stages of evaluating the construction of three to five new facilities, although they haven't said where or when.

The CEO, Paul Pruitt, has said Jackie Withrow and Hopemont have outlived their lifespans.

They have said they won't trim staff to save money.

But residents in Majestic Care's nursing homes in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana receive around an hour less nursing care per day on average than residents at the state's four hospitals, Hopemont, Jackie Withrow, Lakin and John Manchin, according to federal health agency reports.

Lower staffing levels increase the risk of falls, bedsores, missed medications, infections, behavioral health crises and emergency room visits.

Majestic officials said the company meets all state and federal staffing requirements and that it offers competitive pay and benefits.

“Staffing levels are only one measure,” they added. “Equally important is how we invest in training, recruitment, and resources, so staff can deliver safe, compassionate care.”

Despite Majestic Care's staffing level track record, Morrisey said he expects to see patient care improve.

“I think you're going to get the benefit of having a company that does this for a living, as opposed to having a government that really shouldn't have been in the business in the first place,” he said.

Gailyn Markham, spokesperson for the Department of Health Facilities, said health officials also believe the company is well-equipped to provide patients with better care amid a nationwide nursing shortage.

Mary Stein-Johnson feels like she grew up at Lakin Hospital, where she works as a nurse. Her mother worked there before her, so she knew the employees and residents well.

Patients live their lives there too. She said that many patients have serious mental illnesses or disabilities, and some are deemed too difficult to care for by private companies.

She used to work in the private sector and remembers severe understaffing and companies picking and choosing patients with fewer needs.

“My mother's words to me when I was considering it were, ‘go back to Lakin, Mary, the state's always taken care of me,'” she said. “Well, the state's not taking care of us now.”

Many of Lakin's patients have been accused of crimes but were too ill to understand the charges, or they show aggressive behaviors associated with their illnesses.

She predicts a private provider will release patients, and they'll end up in jails or homeless shelters.

Pastor Leah Starkey said she shows up to minister and finds patients have drawn her pictures. One woman who used to never speak now gives her regular hugs and prays for her. One man is training to teach his own Bible study courses.

She's also called to minister when patients are on their deathbeds, and she'll ask if she can expect family to be there.

“A lot of times that's when they'll tell me there is no family,” she said. “That is their family. That is one of my concerns. Are they going to keep them all together?”

Stein-Johnson said the health and retirement benefits she has been offered are so inferior in comparison to state benefits, they're essentially equivalent to a pay cut.

Majestic officials said the company is offering jobs with no pay cuts to all employees, as well as health insurance, retirement, paid time off and other perks like a relief fund, leadership development, sign-on bonuses and tuition reimbursement.

“Our goal isn't just to keep staff,” the company said in a statement. “It's to help them grow and thrive with us.”

They've also said they will keep current patients.

In Rivesville in Marion County, flags line the streets with the names and faces of “Hometown Heroes.”

Across from City Hall, one waves for Andrew Dorsey, a coal miner and Purple Heart veteran who served in World War II and lived out the last of his 92 years of life at the John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center.

Like the miners who stayed there a century before him, he died in the care of the state after developing black lung through years of inhaling coal dust.

He also had hearing loss and was starting to fall often.

His son, Mark Dorsey, lives a few minutes away from City Hall, and about ten minutes away from the center.

Dorsey, a retired coal miner himself, said his dad liked to hunt, fish and bowl.

He didn't talk much about the war.

He wasn't a big talker at all really. But he wouldn't have kept quiet about any mistreatment.

And because the center was so close, Dorsey was there every day, so he was able to spend time with his father at the end of his life and also monitor staff.

“It wasn't just a job for them,” he said. “They actually care about the people there.”

He noted that private companies are different from state programs because they are motivated by profit.

“They're not buying it to lose money,” he said. “Is that what their game is? And if it is, you know, they're going to cut staff, and the health care is not going to be as good.”

Dorsey said the rest home has a strong reputation among families in the area.

Even so, residents have regularly had to come out and protest the potential sale of the center when state officials have considered it in years past.

He said, “It's always about the money.”

President Donald Trump argues that Jimmy Kimmel's talk show was pulled because of “bad ratings.” Speaking in Aylesbury, Trump also said Kimmel said a “horrible thing” about Charlie Kirk. PM Keir Starmer defends Britain's record on free speech.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has used threats, lawsuits and government pressure as he remakes the American media landscape, unleashing his long-standing grievances against an industry that has mocked, criticized and scorned him for years.

He's extracted multimillion-dollar settlements, forced companies into costly litigation and prompted changes to programming that he found objectionable. 

Now Trump is escalating his campaign of censure and retaliation, invigorated by successful efforts to push ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air for his commentary on conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One while returning from Great Britain on Thursday, Trump said federal regulators should consider revoking broadcast licenses for networks that “give me only bad publicity.”

“All they do is hit Trump,” he said. “They're licensed! They're not allowed to do that. They're an arm of the Democrat Party.”

Brendan Carr, Trump's handpicked head of the Federal Communications Commission, issued a similar warning the previous day while criticizing Kimmel's remarks about the political ideology of the suspected assassin.

“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said. “These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”




ABC suspended Kimmel hours later.

It was the kind of brute force response that Trump and his loyalists have routinely flexed since the Republican president returned to the White House with a vow to retaliate against critics and political opponents. Trump's reach has extended deep into the private sector, using the apparatus of the federal government to pressure companies to make changes that can reshape the public dialogue.

Trump has already reached settlements with ABC and CBS over their coverage. He has filed defamation lawsuits against The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Republicans in Congress stripped federal funding from NPR and PBS. At the FCC, Carr has used his influence to target diversity, equity and inclusion programs and to root out what he describes as liberal bias.

In the aftermath of Kirk's assassination, Trump has clamped down more firmly, with broader implications for the future of free speech protections that have been a bedrock of the American political system. 

Attorney General Pam Bondi recently said that “we will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.” Her words alarmed advocates who fear an elastic definition of the term could be used to criminalize dissent.

The First Amendment is widely viewed as protecting even the most disparaging remarks, and the Supreme Court said in an unanimous opinion last year that “government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors.”

Bondi later revised her comments to say she was focused on “hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence.”

Todd Blanche, Bondi's deputy, suggested that protesters could have violated the law by yelling at Trump while he visited a restaurant near the White House. 

“Is it sheer happenstance that individuals show up at a restaurant where the president is trying to enjoy dinner in Washington, D.C., and accost him with vile words and vile anger?” Blanche said. He said authorities could investigate whether it's “part of an organized effort to inflict harm and terror and damage to the United States.”

The latest saga with Kimmel began Monday night with the comedian's commentary about last week's shooting of Kirk, which took place on a college campus in Utah. 

“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said. He also compared Trump's grief to “how a 4-year-old mourns a goldfish.”

Trump allies said Kimmel was falsely suggesting that the shooter was right-wing. Authorities have not formally presented a motive for the killing, but evidence indicates that he held liberal beliefs. Gov. Spencer Cox, R-Utah, has said “there clearly was a leftist ideology,” 

On Wednesday, Carr appeared on a podcast hosted by Benny Johnson, a conservative commentator, and accused Kimmel of the “sickest conduct possible.” Carr said “you could make a strong argument that this is sort of an intentional effort to mislead the American people about a very core fundamental fact.”

Carr placed the move against Kimmel in the broader context of Trump's efforts to undermine the power of legacy media companies. 

“He smashed the facade that they get to control what we say, what we think, the narrative around events,” Carr said. “And we're seeing a lot of consequences from President Trump doing that.”

Reminding affiliates that their broadcast licenses come with an “obligation to operate in the public interest,” Carr said “it's time for them to step up” and say Kimmel's content “isn't something that we think serves the needs of our local communities.”

It didn't take long for Nexstar Media Group, the country's biggest operator of television stations, to echo some of Carr's language. 

“Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time,” Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said in statement.

The controversy landed at a sensitive time for Nexstar, which needs FCC approval for its $6.2 billion acquisition of Tegna. 

ABC soon announced that Kimmel would be taken off the air. It is unclear when or whether he will return. Kimmel has not commented publicly. 

Later in the evening, the television company Sinclair said its stations would carry “a special in remembrance of Charlie Kirk” on Friday during Kimmel's usual time slot. The company also asked Kimmel to apologize to Kirk's family and donate money to Turning Point USA, the conservative group that Kirk turned into a political powerhouse.

House Democratic leaders, in a statement, accused Carr of “bullying ABC” and “forcing the company to bend the knee to the Trump administration,” and said a “war” on the First Amendment by Trump and the GOP “is blatantly inconsistent with American values.”

The news of Kimmel's suspension broke after midnight in Britain, where Trump was traveling for a state visit. But the president soon posted on Truth Social, his social media platform, to celebrate what he called “Great News for America.”

CBS had already announced the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show over the summer, and Trump said more dominoes should fall, calling for the cancellation of shows by Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.

“Do it NBC!!!” he wrote.

President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hold a joint news conference from Aylesbury, England, during the president's second official state visit to the country.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused President Donald Trump of exploiting the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in order to go after critics.

Schumer's charge came as Senate Democrats teed up legislation called the ""No Political Enemies Act,"" which would prohibit Trump and his administration from weaponizing government agencies. It comes in the wake of late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel's sidelining by ABC over comments he made related to Kirk.

The top Senate Democrat said freedom of speech is ""one of the great hallmarks of our country"" but that the Trump administration ""is trying to snuff it out.""

""Those who break the law, of course, resort to any source of violence ought to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" Schumer said. ""But using the tragic death of Charlie Kirk as an excuse to supercharge the political witch hunt against critics is abhorrent, obnoxious and as un-American as it gets.""

""To attack civil society, whether it's Jimmy Kimmel, civil society organizations or the Trump administration's perceived political enemies, its crusade is unending,"" he continued. ""And this is one of the saddest parts of all, because of congressional Republicans' obeisance to Trump, it's unchecked because they are scared to stand up to Trump.""

Democrats' legislation would prevent the administration from using agencies like the Justice Department, FBI and the IRS from going after people for criticizing the government, according to a one-page description of the bill.

It would also hold officials accountable for using their office to go after critics, ensure courts quickly dismiss ""abusive actions,"" and provide due process for U.S. nonprofits that the government tries to ""label as criminal or terrorist organizations.""

FOLLOWING KIRK'S ASSASSINATION, LAWMAKERS REACT TO LETHAL POLITICAL CLIMATE: 'VIOLENT WORDS PRECEDE VIOLENT ACTIONS'

Their legislative push also comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi said earlier this week that the administration would ""go after you if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.""

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., called her comments ""bone chilling.""

""The shooting of Charlie Kirk was a national tragedy,"" he said. ""It should have been a line in the sand, an opportunity for President Trump to bring this country together to do whatever is necessary to stamp out political violence that's targeted both Republicans and Democrats, political violence that emanates from both right-wing and left-wing radicalization.""

""But Trump and his lieutenants are choosing a different path,"" he continued. ""They are choosing to exploit this tragedy, to weaponize the federal government to destroy Donald Trump's political opposition.""

A DOJ spokesperson referred Fox News Digital to statements Bondi made on her X page, including where she told reporters that the First Amendment is ""one of the most important amendments, of course, in our Constitution. We will always protect the First Amendment.""

""But you cannot, you cannot create violence, and that's what's happening … and that's when you cross the line from First Amendment to a crime, and we will prosecute you,"" she said. 

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment but did not immediately hear back.

During a joint news conference Thursday with President Donald Trump, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the assassination of Charlie Kirk should ""be condemned.""

The sports world continues to be shaken up by the assassination of Charlie Kirk last week.

Kirk was shot while debating at Utah Valley University and died of his injuries soon after.

Many prominent figures in sports reacted to the news, and in a recent appearance on Logan Paul's podcast, UFC president Dana White shared his thoughts.

""I just woke up, and my phone was blowing up. I was f---ing blown away,"" White said.

As dumbfounded as White was, he said his children also took it hard.

""I was actually surprised by how impacted my kids were. My kids used to watch him on social media. My daughter, she's 19, she's in college, and she's been just destroyed over this thing for the last couple days. You have to feel horrible for his family. It's f---ing crazy,"" White said.

JONATHAN ISAAC'S NEW SNEAKERS SUDDENLY MIRROR CHARLIE KIRK'S MESSAGE AFTER ASSASSINATION

""The fact that it happened during what he was known for, which was just peaceful debate and conversation, which was a pillar of American virtue,"" added Paul. ""This country was built on people having conversation and talking to people maybe you don't always agree with and hopefully reaching a resolution -- or even if not, saying we respectfully. But that's a lot of the times how progress is made.""

""When you are unable to talk, shoot and go to violence is just so pathetic,"" Paul continued. ""It's so weak, and I think it's totally against everything that is America.""

White replied, ""That's what happens with people who aren't intelligent enough to debate.""

Paul also said he ""really respected"" Kirk for ""his ability to step into a room and be the person who he said he was.""

George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley joins 'Fox & Friends' to weigh in on Attorney General Pam Bondi warning against inciting political violence.

Several public officials have faced expulsion calls over their reactions to Charlie Kirk's murder, including a West Virginia delegate who compared him to the Charlotte train stabbing suspect and framed the issue in terms of alleged ""racist"" language and domestic terrorism.

Their comments highlight how Kirk's death has become a flashpoint in the national debate over political rhetoric and violence.

Del. Anitra Hamilton, D-Morgantown, who leads the NAACP branch in Monongalia and Preston counties, faced blowback for Facebook posts that appear to have since been deleted accusing the late conservative activist of racism and claiming such ""words of a racist nature"" are tantamount to domestic terrorism.

""The value of truth exposes your values, priorities and beliefs. You can profess Jesus, tweet about Him, and talk about Him in your speeches, and yet be a racist,"" Hamilton posted, according to screenshots circulated by Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.V., former top Ted Cruz staffer Steve Guest and others.

""You can murder one woman on a train by stabbing her in the neck and be condemned by the masses or you can travel the nation spewing hatred and racism, harming thousands and be loved by the masses and both have the same outcome,"" the posts read.

CHARLIE KIRK'S MURDER THE LATEST IN INCREASING POLITICAL VIOLENCE NATIONWIDE, FROM PA GOVERNOR TO SCOTUS

""Speaking words of a racist nature is not your First Amendment right, but are acts of domestic terrorism upon the souls of American people,"" Hamilton continued, per the screenshots. 

Hamilton also said proper debate cannot take place where the Black population is ""1.36%,"" which matches figures for Utah, where Kirk was killed.

Moore responded by calling for Charleston lawmakers to expel Hamilton, adding, ""This is the ideology we are up against.""

""Tolerating the warped mindset that leads to disgusting behavior like this from radical Leftists with no consequence is how we end up with a 31-year-old dad being shot and killed in cold blood.""

Moore added that lawmakers cannot be ""justifying murder.""

Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.V., strongly condemned Hamilton.

""The delegate from the 81st (District) ought to be ashamed because celebrating the death of an individual who engages in regular political dialogue on college campuses is really, truly sad to see,"" said Justice.

The governor-turned-senator originally appointed Hamilton to the role — with a senior government staffer familiar with the appointment telling Fox News Digital he was bound by a rule to choose one of Democrats' handpicked options.

The staffer told Fox News Digital that Hamilton's comments show how common it is for the opposing parties in West Virginia to offer only the ""most radical"" candidates for vacancy appointments.

Del. Wayne Clark, R-Charles Town, reserved comment on Hamilton's statements but told Fox News Digital that Kirk's murder is a ""tragic loss for our country"" and that his ""ability to debate while maintaining civility is unmatched in anyone in our lifetime.""

""Those who feel that his assassination is justified for any reason should question their moral beliefs on the preservation of life,"" Clark said.

State Del. Geno Chiarelli, a Republican who also represents Monongalia County like Hamilton, confirmed discussions have been going on in the legislature about how to punish Hamilton, up to and including expulsion.

Chiarelli told Fox News Digital he isn't officially part of such considerations but would support expulsion if the caucus leadership decided that was the route they want to go.

A Charleston official also cited an uphill climb for expulsion versus censure or other punishments, as it would require a 2/3 vote of the 91-9 GOP-majority chamber.

""The left is already trying to downplay this, but the reality is sobering: Charlie Kirk was murdered by somebody who thought he was ‘full of hate',"" Moore said, calling the murder ""left-wing terrorism"" brought about by ""endless demonization"" by the Democratic Party.

Beyond Mountaineer country, several other lawmakers have come under fire for their responses to Kirk's murder.

In Bernville, Pennsylvania — a quiet Pennsylvania Dutch community best known for its nationally recognized Christmas Village — the town's Democratic mayor posted a clip from Charlie Kirk's podcast implying he was glad Kirk had died.

""This is what MAGA represents. This is what Trump lowered flags for,"" wrote Mayor Shawn Raup-Konsavage, according to Allentown's WFMZ-69 News.

""If this represents you, then I don't want to hear that you are offended that I'm glad he is gone.""

Raup-Konsavage previously made headlines after President Donald Trump's first assassination attempt, with a post that reportedly read, ""Try harder.""

Bernville Borough Councilman Wayne Lesher told WFMZ that while he disagrees with Raup-Konsavage, the remarks were made on a private page under First Amendment protections.

""You're celebrating the death of somebody. That's nothing to celebrate,"" Lesher said.

Separately, a councilmember in Tucson, Arizona, faced blowback for an apparently misspelled post meant to read ""Karma,"" after Kirk's murder, according to the city's CBS affiliate.

Another West Virginia official – a mayor in the Northern Panhandle – expressed surprise at criticisms he said outnumbered people who voted in the previous municipal election.

Wellsburg, West Virginia, Mayor Dan Dudley reportedly wrote, ""Sad day in America. Flying an American flag half-mast for a racist. Priceless. Wellsburg Mayor Daniel L. Dudley,"" according to Wheeling's ABC affiliate.

State Del. Jimmy Willis, R-Wellsburg, told the outlet that whether it is attacks on Kirk, Trump or Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, ""violence is never the answer.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Hamilton and the NAACP's Kingwood chapter for comment.

LONDON — President Donald Trump‘s Marine One presidential helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing while traveling from Chequers to London‘s Stansted Airport.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump were aboard the helicopter as the first leg of their journey back to the United States after a state visit when the pilots made an unexpected landing.

“Due to a minor hydraulic issue, and out of an abundance of caution, the pilots landed at a local airfield before reaching Stansted airport,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “The president and first lady safely boarded the support helicopter.”

Trump arrived roughly 20 minutes behind the traveling press pool, but the White House did not provide an explanation for the delay before Air Force One took off for Washington.

Turning Point USA announced on Thursday that it has unanimously elected Charlie Kirk‘s widow, Erika, as the new CEO and board chairwoman following the conservative activist's death.

The conservative group revealed that Charlie Kirk told multiple executives that he wanted Erika Kirk to take his place if he died.

“Charlie prepared all of us for a moment like this one,” TPUSA's Board of Directors wrote in a letter dated Wednesday. “He worked tirelessly to ensure Turning Point USA was built to survive even the greatest tests. And now, it is our great pride to announce Erika Kirk as the new CEO and Chair of the Board for Turning Point USA.”

TPUSA vowed to carry on its founder's mission, quoting Charlie Kirk's own words: “We have a country to save.”

Charlie Kirk founded the organization in 2012 and was its figurehead until his death last week. He was shot once in the neck while speaking during an event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. He is survived by Erika Kirk and their two young children.

Two days after her husband's death, Erika Kirk said in a video that the conservative movement will only grow. Her words were mixed with defiance and sorrow.

“May God Bless Erika, the Kirk family, and the entire team at Turning Point USA,” the letter concludes.

Free speech is endangered; unbiased and trustworthy news is elusive. In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

The former Man Show host has gone from the least political voice in late night to a victim of the war on woke.

ABC pulled late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air “indefinitely” Wednesday night following pressure from the Federal Communications Commission over comments Kimmel made on the suspect apprehended for the killing of right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk.

Kimmel's suspension comes after a monologue Monday night in which he said, “We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” Many read this as Kimmel implying that the shooter himself was right-wing.

Late-night talk show monologues are supposed to be funny, not rigorous journalism. It's very unusual for a comedian to be suspended because of one, and it's clear that Kimmel would not have been suspended if President Donald Trump's FCC had not put extraordinary pressure on Disney-ABC. (In this case, that pressure was applied via Nexstar Media, the largest owner of TV stations in the US, which announced it would preempt Kimmel's show. Nexstar is currently awaiting FCC approval for a planned $6.2 billion acquisition.) On Thursday morning, amid mounting outcry over Kimmel's suspension, it was reported that ABC “hopes to have the matter resolved and the show return.”

The whole controversy is a shocking turn both in the Trump administration's escalating war on its critics and in Jimmy Kimmel's once pointedly apolitical career. Kimmel, after all, has spent most of his career embodying one archetype: regular American straight white dude. What could be more harmless and less controversial than that?

Kimmel started his career as a comic and radio host, an approachable everyman. In his first major television role as a host of Comedy Central's Win Ben Stein's Money in 1997, he was the audience surrogate, with his schlubby persona and his blue-collar accent an easy balance to Stein's erudite snobbery. When Kimmel became the co-host of The Man Show in 1999, he was continuing to play the same character, only with the boorishness dialed up: leering at hot girls and circulating petitions to end women's suffrage. In the raunch-obsessed 2000s, the crassness played as edgy: not politically correct, certainly, but the kind of thing it was assumed any man would probably do, if he could only unleash his id.

Kimmel left The Man Show in 2003 to launch Jimmy Kimmel Live! on ABC, where he dialed down the ogling but maintained his everyday dude persona. He also stayed away from talking too much politics. In those years when The Daily Show and The Colbert Report were at the height of their power and influence, Kimmel's biggest running gag was a mock feud with Matt Damon. Regular guys, after all, are not policy wonks. They like making chill jokes about movie stars.

Kimmel wouldn't start to get political in earnest until 2017, when his son was born with a rare congenital heart defect. At the time, a Republican-controlled Congress was pushing to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Kimmel lashed out in a rare emotional monologue. “Before 2014, if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was, there was a good chance you'd never be able to get health insurance because you had a preexisting condition,” Kimmel said, adding through tears. “If your baby is going to die, and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make.”

Later that year, Kimmel was once again in tears over the news. There was a mass shooting in Las Vegas, Kimmel's hometown. “It's the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,” Kimmel said. “I don't know why our so-called leaders continue to allow this to happen, or maybe a better question, why do we continue to let them to allow it to happen?”

All of a sudden, marveled New York magazine, Jimmy Kimmel was Walter Cronkite. In an interview, Kimmel noted that his background made it “hit harder” when he talked about politics: “To hear the guy from The Man Show talk about [gay rights] in an inclusive way — I have some credibility,” he allowed. He felt his evolution showed that “the country has come a long way.”

Kimmel, after all, was the avatar of regular American straight white guys. He was where the mainstream was. In The Man Show days, the implication was that you would have to be a humorless prude not to laugh at the joke if Kimmel was the guy making it. Now, if Kimmel was cool with gay rights and health care and gun control, the implication was that you would have to be a real heartless freak not to agree with him.

Kimmel's liberal turn came with a fair amount of anti-Trump jokes, all of which infuriated Trump. In 2018, in a sign of things to come, Trump reportedly had his administration make repeated calls to executives at ABC parent company Disney, telling them to rein Kimmel in. Much to Trump's displeasure, Kimmel, if anything, doubled down on his Trump material.

“Jimmy Kimmel is — every night, he hits me, I guess. His ratings are terrible,” Trump told Fox News in 2024. “He's not a talented guy.” During Trump's 2024 criminal trial, Kimmel made an unexpected cameo: Prosecutors entered into evidence text messages in which Trump's lawyers fretted over Trump's anger when Stormy Daniels appeared on Kimmel's show. After CBS fired Stephen Colbert earlier this year, Trump gloated that Kimmel would be next.

Now, Trump has finally managed to accomplish what he wanted to do in 2018. He used government pressure to get Jimmy Kimmel off the air.

Yet Kimmel's suspension throws into relief how symbolic he's become. His evolution from smug post-feminist crassness in the 2000s to a sincere and outraged liberalism during Trump's first term mirrors the political evolution American pop culture underwent at the same time. Perhaps that's why, despite how dramatically American culture has shifted since the days of The Man Show, and despite how envelope-pushing his early comedy looks now, Kimmel emerged from the so-called cancel culture moment relatively unscathed. He's never faced serious career repercussions for people outraged in retrospect by the Juggy Dance Squad or Hot Girls Jumping on Trampolines. In 2020, he apologized for having worn blackface in old Man Show episodes, and that was the end of that. People have been more or less willing to take him at his word when he says that his intentions were good and that his outlook has sincerely changed.

Instead, the thing that got Jimmy Kimmel right up to the edge of losing his show is that he said something the president doesn't like. Kimmel is acting as a mirror yet again, and this time, what he's showing us is that we are lost in an illiberal moment.

How to prevent one hour of animal suffering for just one penny.

According to a new commentary paper in the journal Nature Food, some of the worst animal suffering in the world can be prevented at a rate of just a couple of pennies per hour: the extreme pain experienced by chickens raised for meat.

Over the last 75 years, chickens have been bred to grow incredibly large and incredibly fast. Their rapid growth rate has made chicken the most affordable and plentiful meat in the US, where over 9 billion are raised and slaughtered annually.

But it's come at the cost of making chickens suffer terribly throughout their short lives from a range of health and welfare issues, like heat stress, heart failure, and lameness — difficulty walking — which can be so severe that chickens die of dehydration or starvation because they can't even stand and move to get water and food.

It's arguably the largest form of systematized animal cruelty humans have ever invented.

Despite the scale and cruelty of conventional chicken farming — and other forms of livestock production — animal welfare has largely been left out of food policy discussions. The nonprofit Welfare Footprint Institute, composed of a team of animal welfare researchers that led the Nature Food paper, is looking to change that by putting a cost on preventing animal pain.

The group looks at how animals are bred, the conditions in which they're raised, and the prevalence and frequency of problems like injury and disease in those systems to determine how many hours of certain types of pain they experience. Scientific research on animal welfare — using behavioral observations, neurophysiological markers, and response to pain-relieving drugs — informs WFI's work, and the group's population-level estimates try to account for differences in individual animals' experiences.

According to their research, the average factory-farmed chicken experiences:

That's about 700 hours of pain. Considering that chickens raised for meat only live for around 1,100 hours, or 45 days, and sleep for a sizable portion of that, they experience some level of pain for much of their waking life. These painful hours represent a kind of “welfare footprint,” the authors argue.

“As consumers, producers, policy-makers, investors and advocates, we are able to easily find out the prices of products, and we now also have carbon footprints to understand environmental impacts,” Kate Hartcher, a senior researcher with WFI and a co-author of the paper, told me over email. “So, why not have the same for animals?”

One simple change, Hartcher and her co-authors argue, can improve the welfare footprint of chicken meat for mere pennies: switching to slower-growing chicken breeds.

For the last decade, animal welfare groups have campaigned for meat producers and major food brands to adopt what they call the Better Chicken Commitment, a slate of reforms including using slower-growing chicken breeds, which are known to have lower rates of lameness, heart and lung disease, heat stress, and other issues. It also calls for other changes, like giving chickens more space and using a more humane slaughter method.

According to the Welfare Footprint Institute, chickens raised according to these standards suffer about 33 fewer hours of disabling and excruciating pain compared to conventional fast-growing chickens. Poultry companies have resisted calls to switch to slower-growing chicken breeds because they cost more to raise, taking about two weeks longer to reach their lower slaughter weight.

But, according to the Welfare Footprint Institute's new paper, which was written in conjunction with researchers from the Stockholm Environment Institute and the University of Colorado Boulder, the cost is minuscule in terms of how much it costs to prevent pain. Switching to slower-growing breeds, according to their analysis, would prevent at least 15 to 100 hours of disabling and excruciating pain at a rate of 45 cents per pound for producers. (And even that range is a very conservative estimate, Hartcher told me, because it doesn't account for all of the many serious welfare problems on chicken factory farms.)

Put in other words, an hour of these intense forms of pain could be averted at a rate of just half a cent to three cents.

In 2019, agricultural economists estimated that slower-growing breeds raise production costs by 11 percent to 26 percent and increase wholesale chicken prices by 10 to 36 cents per pound. The switch could moderately raise the price of chicken for consumers but, Hartcher said, “instead of focusing on the ‘costs' of improving animal welfare, we show that the cost of preventing pain is tiny, and the benefits are enormous.”

The National Chicken Council, the industry's leading trade group, however, has argued against using slower-growing breeds — not just on economic grounds, but also on environmental ones. To meet current chicken demand with smaller, slower-growing breeds, the NCC says, the US industry would need to raise a lot more birds — an additional 4.5 billion or so per year, an approximately 50 percent increase. That also means using more land, pesticides, and fertilizer to grow chicken feed, all of which contribute to climate change.

This is generally true, even if the National Chicken Council is far from an authority on environmental sustainability (the poultry industry is a major air and water polluter). The National Chicken Council didn't respond to a request for comment on the Nature Food paper.

Exactly how much slower-growing breeds increase greenhouse gas emissions is unclear and can vary depending on the specific breed, feed sourcing, and farming practices. A 2022 study found a 16 percent emissions increase, while a 2022 trial by poultry giant Perdue Farms found a 9 percent to 13.4 percent increase. According to a European chicken industry group, using slower-growing breeds when paired with other welfare reforms increases the climate footprint of chicken meat by 24 percent.

Whatever the exact environmental difference, arguing against treating animals better because it would marginally raise climate emissions implies a disturbing position: That raising animals who've been bred to suffer terribly is permissible so long as it's better for the climate. In surveys, consumers say they care similarly or even more about animal welfare than sustainability.

However, this logic has proven persuasive to influential policymakers, environmental researchers, and some environmental groups. In 2023, when the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization published a road map on how the world can feed a growing population without blowing past climate targets, it wrote that the livestock sector “requires intensified productivity via improved genetics” — in other words, using breeds that make animals grow bigger and faster, and suffer more.

But Hartcher said her and her coauthors' analysis challenges the notion “that the intensification of animal production, including faster growth rates, can be justified by environmental considerations alone, given the disproportionate and severe animal welfare harms and only minimal variations in environmental indicators.”

The switch to slower-growing chickens does, however, present a different dilemma for animal advocates: Is it better to farm fewer chickens who are all suffering a lot, or more chickens who are each suffering somewhat less?

Ultimately, most animal advocates — and some environmentalists, too — try to square the tensions in these trade-offs by recommending that we eat less meat overall and treat each animal better, an approach sometimes called “less but better.”

“Almost in all of these cases, you're never going to land on the optimal thing,” Cleo Verkuijl, a senior scientist at the US branch of the Stockholm Environment Institute and a co-author of the Nature Food paper, told me. But now businesses and policymakers can at least account for animal suffering rather than ignore it, and make more reasoned — and hopefully, more humane — decisions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Companies from ABC to Office Depot are disciplining employees for their public comments on Charlie Kirk's death","https://www.businessinsider.com/charlie-kirk-microsoft-nasdaq-delta-office-depot-employees-public-comments-2025-9","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 18:37:00 GMT","

In the days since Charlie Kirk's death, some companies have been forced to navigate a delicate situation: employees sharing their personal views about the conservative activist in public.

For employers, those remarks highlight the growing challenge of balancing free expression with corporate values and workplace harmony.

Major corporations such as Microsoft and Delta Air Lines are taking action against employees who have made social media posts critical of Kirk's own views, or even ones celebrating his death, which could be considered a violation of company values.

Kirk, an ally of President Donald Trump, advocated conservative beliefs on college campuses and was influential among young people on the right. But many find his comments about immigrants, trans rights, and feminism intolerant and divisive.

Here is how some companies are responding.

Microsoft shared an X post on Friday addressing negative remarks about Kirk made online by some of its employees.

""We're aware of the views expressed by a small subset of our employees regarding recent events,"" the company said. ""We take matters like this very seriously and we are currently reviewing each individual situation.""

Microsoft said, ""Comments celebrating violence against anyone are unacceptable and do not align with our values.""

Microsoft's statement came after Tesla CEO Elon Musk called out Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on X in response to an unverified claim that some employees at Blizzard, a video game company owned by Microsoft, had posted comments ""trashing"" Kirk.

The ODP Corporation, the parent company of Office Depot, apologized to consumers on Friday after footage taken at a Michigan Office Depot gained attention on social media. The footage appeared to show an employee refusing to print a poster for a vigil associated with Kirk.

""The behavior displayed by our associate is completely unacceptable and insensitive, violates our company policies, and does not reflect the values we uphold at Office Depot. On behalf of the Company, we sincerely apologize for this regrettable situation,"" the company said in a press release.

The company said it fired the employee involved in the interaction.

""We also launched an immediate internal review and, as a result, the associate involved is no longer with the organization,"" the press release said. ""We continue to aggressively investigate the matter and will take action where appropriate.""

A spokesperson told Business Insider that Office Depot was continuing to ""closely manage"" its response to the interaction.

On Friday, Nasdaq said it fired an employee for their remarks about Kirk because they violated company policy.

""We are aware of social media posts by an employee regarding the shooting of Charlie Kirk that were a clear violation of our policy. Nasdaq has a zero-tolerance policy toward violence and any commentary that condones or celebrates violence,"" the company said on X. ""The employee in question has been terminated, effective immediately.""

The political analyst Matthew Dowd was widely attacked online after making remarks about Kirk during an appearance on MSNBC's ""Katy Tur Reports"" on Wednesday.

MSNBC's president, Rebecca Kutler, called Dowd's comments ""insensitive"" in an X post later that day.

""During our breaking news coverage of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, Matthew Dowd made comments that were inappropriate, insensitive, and unacceptable,"" the statement said. ""We apologize for his statements, as has he. There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise.""

Dowd responded in a subsequent Substack article on Friday, confirming that MSNBC had fired him.

""The Right Wing media mob ginned up, went after me on a plethora of platforms, and MSNBC reacted to that mob,"" he wrote. ""Even though most at MSNBC knew my words were being misconstrued, the timing of my words forgotten (remember I said this before anyone knew Kirk was a target), and that I apologized for any miscommunication on my part, I was terminated by the end of the day.""

Comcast and Versant executives urged employees to ""treat people with kindness"" in a memo on Friday. Comcast is MSNBC's parent company. Versant is an independent media company being spun off from Comcast and NBCUniversal that will eventually own MSNBC.

""Regardless of whether you agreed with his political views, his words and actions underscore the urgency to maintain a respectful exchange of ideas — a principle we must champion,"" the memo said.

The memo added: ""As employees, we ask you to embody our values in your work and communities. We should engage with respect, listen, and treat people with kindness.""

Perkins Coie, a law firm already at odds with the Trump administration, didn't escape the fray either.

The firm fired a lawyer whose social media posts about Kirk gained attention online, where commentators noted his place of work, a spokesperson told Business Insider.

""These comments do not reflect the views of our firm, and the individual's conduct in posting them fell far short of the expectations we have of everyone who works here,"" the spokesperson said. ""This is not who we are, and the individual was separated from the firm with immediate effect. We offer our deepest sympathies to Mr. Kirk's family.""

On Thursday, the Carolina Panthers addressed comments from one of its employees, writing on X, ""The views expressed by our employees are their own and do not represent those of the Carolina Panthers.""

""We do not condone violence of any kind. We are taking this matter very seriously and have accordingly addressed it with the individual,"" the post said.

A source told The Athletic the organization fired a public relations employee over his remarks about Kirk.

Delta Air Lines suspended an unknown number of employees over their social media posts about Kirk, a companywide memo viewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian wrote in the memo that those employees were under investigation because the content ""went well beyond healthy, respectful debate,"" according to the AJC.

He added, ""Violations of our social media policy can carry meaningful consequences, including termination.""

Karen Attiah said she was fired as an opinion writer from The Washington Post after posting on social media about Charlie Kirk.

Attiah wrote a Substack post published Monday that said she was fired after ""speaking out against political violence, racial double standards, and America's apathy toward guns.""

A Washington Post spokesperson said the paper doesn't comment on personnel matters. The Post's social media policy says in part that Post journalists should not undermine the paper's ability to cover the news fairly and should be civil and treat people with respect.

The day Kirk was shot, Attiah said in a Bluesky post that there was a double standard in how the shooting deaths of Democrats were treated and a failure to address ""white men"" who commit violence. Attiah wrote a post mentioning Kirk that said the left was prematurely being blamed for his death. Another of her posts referred to not doing performative mourning for ""a white man that espoused violence.""

It is not clear what particular social-media posts led to Attiah's firing.

Attiah's departure comes in the wake of the Jeff Bezos-owned Post's overhaul of its opinion section, which is now focused on ""personal liberties and free markets."" That led to the departure of opinion editor David Shipley, along with several of his colleagues, and the appointment of Adam O'Neal to replace him in June.

An ABC spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that it ""indefinitely"" suspended production of ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" on Wednesday.

The decision came after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr criticized Kimmel's remarks about Charlie Kirk during a recent episode. During an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson, Carr said the FCC could intervene after Kimmel's comments.

Nexstar, an ABC affiliate, subsequently issued a press release saying it would ""preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' for the foreseeable future.""

""Nexstar strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk and will replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets,"" a press release said.

Sinclair, another ABC affiliate, also suspended the show on its stations. The broadcasting company said ABC did not reprimand Kimmel enough and called on the network and the FCC to take ""additional action.""

""Sinclair also calls upon Mr. Kimmel to issue a direct apology to the Kirk family,"" a press release said. ""Furthermore, we ask Mr. Kimmel to make a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA.""

Sinclair said it would fill Kimmel's timeslot with a special dedication to Kirk.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Starbucks clears up confusion after barista refused to write Charlie Kirk's name on a cup","https://www.businessinsider.com/charlie-kirk-starbucks-drink-mint-majesty-tea-2025-9","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 15:20:00 GMT","

Starbucks says that customers can ask for political names on their drinks following a viral video in which a barista declined to write the name of assassinated conservative Charlie Kirk on a customer's cup.

Eight baristas told Business Insider that before the corporate clarification, they felt trapped between corporate policy, social media infamy, and, in some cases, their own personal beliefs when customers requested politically loaded names on their to-go cups.

A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the company does not restrict customers who want to use a fake name on their order, even if that name is political. However, the company prohibits baristas from writing other political messages or pop culture references on drinks.

""We aim to be a community coffeehouse where everyone feels welcome, so we have previously provided guidance to our partners to respectfully ask the customer to use a different name when attempting to use political slogans or phrases in place of their name,"" Starbucks said in a statement published Wednesday. ""We are clarifying with our team now that names, on their own, can be used by customers on their café order, as they wish.""

The statement was made in response to a TikTok video that went viral on Tuesday. The video showed a Starbucks customer requesting Kirk's name on their Mint Majesty tea, a nod to what the political commentator said in a July video was his favorite drink. The barista behind the counter declined the request to write Kirk's name, citing a corporate policy not to write political messages on cups, and offered instead to write ""Charlie.""

The customer, who did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, then told the barista to ""forget it"" and canceled the order.

After the TikTok clip was posted online, it gained traction on conservative social media accounts. It racked up hundreds of thousands of views across platforms and more than 4,000 comments on TikTok, and prompted an avalanche of negative Yelp reviews of the Starbucks store in Yucaipa, California. Many commenters said the barista should be fired.

Kirk, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump's and a right-wing podcaster, was shot and killed on September 10 during an event at Utah Valley University in what authorities have called a ""political assassination.""

While it's unclear how often Starbucks customers are making such requests of their baristas, several subsequent copycat posts have sprung up on social media, and some Kirk fans have begun posting online, calling for a boycott of the coffee brand.

While the most recent viral incident centered on Kirk, baristas told Business Insider that customers have made similar requests related to Trump, the war in Gaza, Black Lives Matter protests, and other social movements. They said it has become more common since cup notes became required.

""When things like this gain traction, they basically become a meme,"" one West Coast barista told Business Insider. ""And I won't be the punchline.""

Since CEO Brian Niccol took the helm in September 2024, the company has mandated that ""meaningful"" handwritten notes in Sharpie be added to each customer's to-go cup.

Eight baristas who spoke to Business Insider had varying interpretations of Starbucks' guidelines for writing political names on cups, based on what they were told by managers before Wednesday's clarification. Six said they believed they were prohibited, while two said they believed customer requests for political names on their orders would be acceptable under the policy.

Six said the seemingly conflicting policies make them feel set up to fail when customers come in requesting political names written on their to-go cups.

The baristas were granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about Starbucks, but their identities are known to Business Insider. Many others have taken to posting online about how customers increasingly use them as characters in their social media posts about culture war topics. Starbucks has more than 350,000 global staff.

A Kentucky-based Starbucks shift supervisor who has been with the company for over a year told Business Insider they would instruct the baristas in their store to refuse a customer request if they were uncomfortable, despite the risk of discipline or harassment.

""It puts baristas in a very uncomfortable position, given that we are at a workplace and would effectively be getting caught up in a customer's opinion that we may or may not agree with and cannot walk away from,"" a barista who has worked at Starbucks for more than six years told Business Insider.

A New York-based barista who is a fan of Kirk said such a request wouldn't make them uncomfortable. ""I do believe the people doing it are probably just trying to get a reaction out of Starbucks workers,"" they said.

Robert Post, a constitutional law professor and First Amendment scholar at Yale, told Business Insider that these types of viral social media issues become problematic for Starbucks because they result in negative publicity and put baristas in a ""stressful situation.""

""You can't win for trying,"" Post said.

Michael Goldberg, a professor of entrepreneurship and finance at Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Management, told Business Insider that if Starbucks doesn't clearly communicate the rules to in-store staff, it risks problems with retaining talent at a delicate time while striving to improve the customer experience and its stock performance.

Goldberg said the incident is an example of a company policy that aims to better connect the business with its customers, but has a messy rollout at the individual or store level. That messiness results in customers questioning the corporation's position ""because these hundreds of thousands of baristas represent the company.""

""Retention of talent is paramount to a company like Starbucks — you're only as good as your employees are,"" Goldberg added. ""And it seems as though people genuinely like working at Starbucks, but if they strip away all the things that are appealing about working there, there are many other retail establishments that are hiring, like McDonald's or Wendy's — are they writing notes on their burgers? Maybe Starbucks becomes less attractive.""

President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested that the federal government might revoke the licenses of broadcast television networks that are ""against"" him.

Trump's comment came a day after ABC suspended airing the ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" show because of comments its host made linking the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to Trump's MAGA movement.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr earlier on Wednesday had hinted that the broadcast license of ABC — which is a subsidiary of Disney — was at risk if it did not ""take action on Kimmel.""

Speaking on Thursday to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said, ""I have read someplace that the networks were 97% against me, again, 97% negative, and yet I won and easily, all seven swing states,"" referring to his 2024 election win.

""They give me only bad publicity, press. I mean, they're getting a license,"" Trump said, according to audio from a press gaggle provided by the White House.

""I would think maybe their license should be taken away,"" Trump said.

The president said that the decision ""will be up to Brendan Carr.""

Trump specifically referred to criticism he has gotten from Kimmel and CBS late-night talk-show host Stephen Colbert.

""Look, that's something that should be talked about for licensing, too,"" Trump said.

""When you have a network and you have evening shows, and all they do is hit Trump,"" he said. ""That's all they do. If you go back, I guess they haven't had a conservative on in years or something, somebody said.""

""But when you go back, take a look, all they do is hit Trump. They're licensed. They're not allowed to do that. They're an arm of the Democrat party,"" he said.

Carr earlier Thursday told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" that ""we're not done yet"" with changes in ""the media ecosystem"" that are consequences of Trump's election.

""I think Brendan Carr is outstanding, he's a patriot,"" said Trump, who nominated Carr to his position.

""He loves our country, and he's a tough guy. So we'll have to see.""

Broadcast television stations affiliated with networks, including ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox, must receive a license from the FCC to operate because their content is transmitted over the air, and is technically free for viewers as long as they have an antenna.

That contrasts with cable TV networks, whose subscribers pay fees to distributors to watch.

In this article

Nvidia said it will invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a deal to co-develop data center and PC chips with the troubled chipmaker, which took on the U.S. government as an investor last month.

Nvidia is investing its stake at a price of $23.28 a share, a release from the company said. Intel shares closed 22.8% higher to $30.57 following news of the deal.

Intel posted its best day since October 1987. Nvidia shares closed 3.54% higher on Thursday.

""This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem -- a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing,"" said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a release.

Nvidia now joins Softbank and the U.S. government in supporting Intel's turnaround.

Intel shares, which hit their lowest in more than a decade earlier this year, rebounded after finding renewed support from the Trump administration, striking a deal for the U.S. government to invest 10% in the chipmaker in August.

White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said in a statement Thursday that the partnership was a ""major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing.""

SoftBank also made a $2 billion investment with Intel in August.

The government put $8.9 billion into the chipmaker for 433.3 million shares. That stake is now worth $13.2 billion with shares at $30.57.

A senior White House official said the administration was not involved with the Nvidia-Intel deal.

""What's unclear is whether this represents token cooperation intended for political purposes, or if it's the start of a wider collaboration that would more significantly benefit INTC,"" wrote Wolfe Research's Chris Caso in a note Thursday following the announcement.

Caso said the biggest question is if Nvidia will manufacture at Intel's fabs.

The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, does not appear to include the manufacturing of Nvidia chips with Intel's foundry.

Intel will build x86 central processing units for Nvidia's AI infrastructure platforms, according to the release. On the PC front, Intel will build x86 system-on-chips using Nvidia's RTX graphics processing units that will power computers.

Nvidia is in the middle of U.S. and China trade negotiations to get approval to sell less-advanced chips in China.

The Federal Reserve's decision to cut its key borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point seems to be sitting well with the White House, if National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is any indication.

In a CNBC interview Thursday, the day after the Fed's move, Hassett noted that the administration, and new Fed Governor Stephen Miran, had been pushing for a bigger reduction. Miran, who is on leave as head of the Council of Economic Advisers, pushed for a half-point cut but was outvoted 11 to 1 on the Federal Open Market Committee.

However, Hassett was not critical of the committee's decision.

""The bottom line is that moving kind of slow and steady and heading towards a target, watch the data come in, that's what prudent policy is,"" he said on ""Squawk Box."" ""So I know that my colleague Stephen wanted to go to 50 [basis points], but I think 25 was pretty broad consensus, and I think that's a good first step in the right direction to much lower rates.""

President Donald Trump, who nominated Miran to the post, has yet to comment on the Fed's decision.

In the past, Trump has launched a barrage of criticism at the central bank, nicknaming Chair Jerome Powell ""Too Late"" and calling for quick and aggressive cuts. The president has suggested the benchmark federal funds rate should be 3 percentage points lower, a position not reflected in FOMC projections for the future course of policy in updates released Wednesday.

Hassett noted strong economic growth trending above 3% for the third quarter, something that normally wouldn't argue for lower interest rates, particularly with inflation running above the Fed's 2% target.

However, Trump has said cuts are needed to support the struggling U.S. housing market and to help manage financing costs for the nation's $37 trillion debt.

Assessing the economic variables at play and deciding on the incremental reduction was a proper move, said Hassett, who has been mentioned on the short list of Trump's picks to succeed Powell as chair next year.

""I think it's much more prudent for the Fed to be looking at all the models, to have a diversity of opinions and decide, 'What are we going to do in this economy that really looks to be taken off with inflation that's decelerating, but higher than the target?'"" he said. ""They split the baby in this decision, and I think that's probably a pretty prudent call.""

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and other crypto executives took to Capitol Hill this week as part of a regulatory showdown between the industry and banks with potentially trillions at stake.

Banking advocacy groups are urging lawmakers to prohibit crypto exchanges like Coinbase from offering customers rewards that are structured like interest payments banks offer.

""I'm not sure why the banks would want to bring that up again at this point, but they should have to compete on a level playing field in crypto,"" Armstrong told CNBC on Wednesday.

Coinbase currently offers a 4.1% reward for those holding USDC stablecoin. Kraken offers a 5.5% on USDC holdings.

Under the recently passed GENIUS Act, customers can't earn interest on stablecoins, but exchanges can offer rewards.

Bank advocacy groups are warning that allowing the rewards will lead to a rush of customers yanking funds from community banks and putting them into stablecoins or other crypto.

""If people are pulling their deposits out of their bank accounts and transferring them into stablecoin investments, you are effectively neutering, to some degree, the ability of the banks to continue to lend into the real economy and to support and fuel the economic growth,"" said John Court, executive vice president at the Bank Policy Institute, an advocacy group representing banks.

The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee estimated that $6.6 trillion could go from deposits to stablecoins in an April report.

Armstrong called the argument a ""boogeyman.""

""The real reason that they're bringing this up as an issue is that they're trying to protect the $180 billion that they made on their payment business,"" he said. ""This is something that big banks are funding behind the scenes. It's not small banks whatsoever.""

Following a meeting with Senate Republicans on Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the subject of stablecoin rewards did not come up, but that regulators need to be thoughtful about any regulations.

""We're not against crypto,"" he said.

The American Bankers Association and state association asked in an August 12 letter for lawmakers to ""close this loophole and protect the financial system.""

Crypto groups hit back several days later in their own letter to lawmakers, saying that preventing exchanges from offering rewards ""would tilt the playing field in favor of legacy institutions, particularly larger banks, that routinely fail to deliver competitive returns and deprive consumers of meaningful choice.""

While senators have released several drafts of the market structure bill, changes to crypto exchanges offering rewards are still being worked out. 

Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., who is working on the bill with Banking Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., said she believes the issue is settled.

""The issue was heavily litigated in the GENIUS Act, and I am supportive of the compromise achieved by the banks and the digital asset industry,"" she said in a statement to CNBC. ""I do not think this issue should be reopened.""

Key Points

This network is likely going to become a load-bearing portion of the global financial system.

Ethereum (ETH 1.57%) is an asset that has a high potential to turn your patience into future purchasing power. While it definitely won't mint any new millionaires overnight, it can certainly help disciplined investors get there the slow way.

Here's how and why diligent investment into this cryptocurrency could pay off significantly by the time you retire, assuming that it's at least 10 years out.

Image source: Getty Images.

For Ethereum to gain in value over time, there need to be more reasons for people to buy it and hold it in the future than there are today. Given that every transaction on its blockchain costs a gas (user) fee paid in Ethereum, more activity on the chain equates to rising demand for the coin. And there's no shortage of long-lived trends that will continue to do just that.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is Ethereum's cornerstone, as is its smart contract capability.

Services that once required interacting with financial institutions and filing reams of burdensome paperwork are now at least partially automatable by code. Banks and other institutions are going to be moving their financial plumbing over to Ethereum to cut down on the manual work they need to do. So, the chain is going to become an important fintech tool for the big players in the traditional financial system, in addition to being the home of DeFi, making it a critical nexus for all sorts of capital.

One particularly important area of that transition is in asset tokenization. If you aren't familiar, tokenization is the process of putting the ownership records for real-world assets, like U.S. Treasury bills or even real estate, onto a blockchain as a transferable crypto token. Today, about $8.3 billion in tokenized assets are tracked on Ethereum's chain, not including the $162.2 billion in stablecoins that are also parked there.

Major asset managers like BlackRock are putting their tokenized assets on the network because it's already the place where they can access the deepest liquidity and tap the most resources for critical tasks like borrowing, lending, and generating a yield via staking or DeFi platforms. Ethereum's early lead in asset tokenization means that today it has a 52% share of all of the tokenized assets in the crypto sector. That's important, as banks expect the value of tokenized assets to balloon, with trillions of dollars of growth this decade alone. When capital flows, it tends to pool precisely where there's already a lot of other capital, and that is likely to help drive significant returns for holders of this coin.

So, Ethereum could help you to become a millionaire by the time you retire by virtue of becoming a platform that Wall Street favors to move large volumes of capital. And that process is just starting to pick up speed.

With its long runway for growth in mind, there are two pretty easy ways to make investing in Ethereum work well for a retirement plan.

The first is to dollar‑cost average (DCA) into Ethereum on a set cadence, regardless of news or price. This will ensure that the coin's volatility works in your favor by spreading out your cost basis among both lower and higher price points, and it takes your emotions out of the investing loop, which is very valuable. The coin has gone through prolonged downturns in the past, and it will probably do so in the future as well -- but those who continued buying it came out ahead anyway.

The second approach is to consider staking some or all of the Ethereum you accumulate. Native staking yields between 2% and 4% are available through reputable providers, though rates float, and staking requires locking up your coins for a while and not being able to withdraw them without a delay of a few days. The staking yields won't ever make you rich, but the point here is that it will help to juice your returns a bit, which can make a big difference over the long run if you do it consistently.

Assuming that tokenization keeps increasing, and new capital on-ramps like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to lower frictions for new buyers, Ethereum's growth should continue for quite some time. More assets and more on-chain activity will bring more developers and encourage them to develop more decentralized applications (dApps) and other products, which then attract more users and capital, including from financial institutions. This is essentially an adapted version of the ""network‑effects"" investment thesis that has rewarded patient investors in the tech sector many times before.

If your goal is to retire with more financial flexibility than you have today, Ethereum can play a role, even if it will be a long marathon for an investor building a position today to make a sum as large as $1 million. Keep your contributions automatic, keep your expectations grounded, and let compounding and the adoption curve of this financial technology grind onward to deliver returns.

Ethereum is approaching a decisive phase that could carry it into five-figure territory, according to a multi-timeframe analysis from trader Cantonese Cat (@Cantonmeow).

Ethereum Ready To Smash All-Time Highs

In a video published today, the analyst argues that ETH has cleared a cluster of late-cycle resistances and is now exhibiting a confluence of technical signals—on monthly, weekly, daily, and intraday charts—that “favor some of the higher targets to be met, maybe 1.272, 1.414, 1.618, anywhere around potentially five figures.” These Fib levels would put ETH at $7,752, $9,883 and $14,011 respectively.

On the monthly chart, the analyst centers his case on the log-scale Fibonacci structure and volatility regime. ETH, he says, spent months stalling around the 0.886 retracement near $4,000—the same zone that repeatedly repelled the market in prior attempts—but “last month, we had the break through that here, convincingly.”

He notes that the wick of the latest push already poked above the wick from the November 2021 peak, reinforcing the idea that supply at the former top is thinning. Simultaneously, the monthly Bollinger Bands are expanding while price “is impulsively going to the upside here along with the upper Bollinger Band,” a backdrop he describes as consistent with trend acceleration rather than mean reversion. “It does favor some of the higher targets to be met,” he said, while stressing sequencing: “We need to kind of break above the previous all-time high here first before we can actually talk about moving further up.”

A second pillar of the bullish thesis is the Ichimoku profile across cycles—specifically the fusion of Tenkan-sen (conversion line) and Kijun-sen (base line). “When you have the Tenkan and Kijin fused together and price is riding up along with it, this fusion over here is called Katana,” he explained. Historically, he said, this “precipitates a big move,” and with price now above the Katana, “the Katana is shooting the price up.” On the current structure: “We got a Katana here being built up and price is currently impulsively going to the upside, so that is also favorable for Ethereum.”

On the weekly timeframe, Cantonese Cat frames ETH's advance through a three-cycle template defined by a “cycle liquidity zone” acting as a pivot. Each prior cycle saw deviations above and below a governing trend line before a sustained move once the zone was recaptured. He places the present consolidation directly on that blueprint: after breaking the “$4,000 liquidity level,” ETH is “consoling sideways… trying to find some energy before breaking up higher.” A back-test is possible but not required, he said; the “primary case” remains continuation unless the chart invalidates.

Lower Timeframe Signals

The lower timeframes, in his view, are already aligning with that outcome. On the daily chart, he highlights a developing “Adam and Eve continuation pattern” nested within a classic cup-and-handle, where “the handle… volume is not that great,” which he views as textbook, followed by “a pretty decent volume bullish engulfing candle.”

Measured against log-scale retracements, price was rejected at 0.786, found support at 0.5, and is now “trying to break through 0.6… work our way back… to 0.786,” a rhythm he says “is being respected pretty decently.” He also points to a short-term bottoming sequence—“you can see something called a tweezer bottom… if you have anywhere around two or three of these kind of wick sticking down like that, that's usually a pretty decent bottom”—and a three-candle “morning star” reversal: “It's a reversal pattern and it could end up leading to a reversal here… seems to be working out pretty well.”

On the 12-hour chart, he reads the structure as reaccumulation in a Wyckoff sense, referencing the “rounded bottom,” a strengthening secondary test—“the ST is higher than the VCLX”—and the emergence of a “creek” overhead that price appears ready to vault. “It does look like a reaccumulation type pattern… showing some strength… consolidating sideways… to reaccumulate before [a] bullish continuation,” he said, adding that after the prior vertical leg, digestion at elevated levels is constructive.

Relative-strength diagnostics, he argues, reinforce the ETH-led narrative. Ethereum's market-share gauge (ETH.D) “has broken above the Ichimoku cloud… with strength,” then “back-tested the cloud for about four weeks,” and may be waiting for the Tenkan to “rise… as support” before the next leg. On a monthly volatility basis, he adds, “the 20-month moving average was reclaimed… and we simply spent a month here back-testing” it—evidence that dominance could trend higher if the back-test holds. “That's basically meaning that Ethereum wants to continue to outperform the rest of the cryptocurrency market here for [the] foreseeable future,” he said.

Breadth indicators outside of ETH also tilt risk-on in his framework. The Total3 index (total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) is “trying to break above and form an all-time high” on a monthly “cup and handle” structure, while the “Others” index (market cap excluding the top 10 coins) has punched through the 0.786 level on the weekly and is “gravitat[ing]… to the next level, the 0.886.”

He emphasizes the distinction between log and linear retracements, noting a failed linear 0.886 breakout in a prior attempt: “If we were to break above the linear, as well as the log 0.886 here with style, then I think Others would end up performing extremely well and would end up following the footsteps of Ethereum.” His conclusion is unambiguous: “I am bullish on Ethereum. I'm bullish on altcoin. I'm bullish on the cryptocurrency market space in general.”

At press time, ETH traded at $4,565.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.

As Bitcoin BTC/USD edges closer to $118,000, prominent analyst Trader Mayne says the long-awaited 25-basis points interest rate cut clears the macro overhang and sets up one last Bitcoin-led push before an altcoin finale.

What Happened: On his podcast after the FOMC decision, Mayne argued the market can ""just focus on the charts,"" noting a whipsaw in the S&P 500, strength in gold and muted initial crypto reaction.

He expects the current range to resolve upward, which could ""sucker more people into the market,"" followed by a cleaner buying opportunity on weakness.

Structurally, Mayne still treats the higher time frame as bullish. 

His trading sequence for the coming weeks: look for a final pop toward the upper boundary of Bitcoin's range around $120,000, short into that resistance for a potential flush of long positions, then flip long for what he calls the final parabolic leg. 

That roadmap features Bitcoin leading one more surge, after which dominance stalls and extreme altcoin moves see Ethereum ETH/USD hitting up to $7,000, Solana SOL/USD surging above $400 and Dogecoin DOGE/USD pushing for a new all-time high.

Why It Matters: Mayne established clear invalidation levels for his thesis.

Referring to 2024's all-time high of $109,00 as a critical support level, he says any significant time spent below that level should be seen as weakness.

Otherwise, the playbook stays simple: fade the over-extension, buy the flush, and ride Bitcoin's last push into the long-awaited “altcoin season.”

Altseason is upon us. Bitcoin's reign seems to be waning, and a new wave of altcoins is reshaping the crypto landscape. I get it, it's exciting, but what does this mean for companies handling payroll? You know, those things we thought we were done with when we started getting paid in crypto? 

For the uninitiated, altseason is when alternative cryptocurrencies (the altcoins) do better than Bitcoin. This often happens when Bitcoin's price plateaus or dips, pushing traders to explore other options. During this phase, money flows from Bitcoin to a wider array of cryptocurrencies, causing increased trading activity. 

Recently, the Altcoin Season Index has shown strong signals of an altseason, which might mean that smart investors are diversifying their portfolios. This isn't just an investment play; it's got serious implications for payroll systems too.

Bitcoin has historically impacted altcoin performance, and the recent dip in its dominance is no exception. A recent analysis even pointed out a rare “death cross” in Bitcoin's dominance, hinting that altcoins are ready to rise. This could mean a shift in focus, making altcoins seem like more viable options for payment solutions.

What does this mean for companies? It's time to consider that relying solely on Bitcoin for payroll might not be the best move anymore. Altcoins are making headway, and businesses might want to entertain the idea of paying with them. 

Altcoins are revolutionizing payroll, especially for remote teams. Here are some of the ways:

Altcoins and stablecoins allow for fast transfers, even across borders. This is crucial for startups with international teams, ensuring that salaries are paid on time without the headaches of currency conversion.

Using cryptocurrencies can slash traditional foreign exchange fees and cross-border transaction costs. This is a big win for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) looking to tighten their payroll budgets.

Younger workers, especially millennials and Gen Z, are leaning towards crypto compensation. Paying in altcoins can increase employee satisfaction and help retain talent, especially in tech.

Blockchain tech can automate payroll through smart contracts. This ensures timely, transparent payments without manual intervention. Imagine the time saved!

Some companies are already adopting crypto payroll solutions. Startups in Argentina are looking to stablecoin salaries to combat inflation. Tech firms in the Valley are offering the option to get paid in Bitcoin. These examples highlight the growing trend of crypto payroll and its potential to attract talent. 

Of course, there are challenges. Price volatility, regulatory compliance, and cybersecurity risks are not to be ignored. Implementing solid risk management strategies is crucial for a smooth transition to crypto payroll.

We're looking at a future where the crypto payroll landscape keeps evolving. Expect more stablecoin adoption and real-time payroll systems. With clearer regulations, more businesses will likely embrace crypto payments.

Altseason is not just a temporary trend; it's changing how businesses approach payroll and asset management. By embracing altcoins, companies can enhance their payroll solutions, attract talent, and position themselves for success in a rapidly changing economic landscape. Adaptability will be key in this new era of payroll innovation.

Oops, something went wrong

Plasma, a new blockchain built specifically for stablecoins, is set to flip the switch on its long-awaited mainnet beta next week, introducing the chain and its native token, XPL, on Sept. 25.

According to a blog post from the team, the network will debut with more than $2 billion in stablecoin liquidity from over a hundred partners on day one — an aggressive attempt to position Plasma not as just another general-purpose chain, but as the backbone for stablecoin transfers.

That won't be an easy feat. Ethereum and Solana already dominate stablecoin volumes, while newer chains continue to optimize for similar flows. Plasma's bet is that its architecture, dubbed PlasmaBFT, will give it an edge. The system is designed for fast, composable stablecoin transactions the team said, and from launch, users will be able to move USDT with zero fees through Plasma's dashboard — a feature the team hopes will stand out in a crowded DeFi landscape.

Token distribution is also aimed at broad accessibility. Prior to launch, 10% of XPL was sold in a public offering. At launch, 25 million tokens will be allocated to the community, with another 2.5 million reserved for members of the so-called Stablecoin Collective.

Backing the project are heavyweights from the crypto and venture worlds: the $24 million in seed and Series A funding was led by Framework Ventures, with participation from Bitfinex, Peter Thiel and Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, among others.

“Plasma's mission is to become the foundation for global money movement. Mainnet beta is the next step in making that vision real,” the team wrote.

Milk & Mocha aren't just cartoon bears anymore; they're the face of one of the most community-driven presales of the year. Their $HUGS token brings together fans and blockchain utility in a way that's simple, fun, and rewarding. However, everything is currently locked behind one thing: the whitelist.

The Milk Mocha $HUGS whitelist is filling fast, and without signing up, you'll miss early access to every perk. That means no chance to enter mini-games with token prize pools, no shot at NFTs that can be upgraded with burns, and no ability to start staking $HUGS at a fixed 50% APY.

Later buyers will face higher prices, fewer rewards, and a long climb to catch up with leaderboard players and stakers who got in first. The whitelist isn't just early access, it's early dominance.



At the center of the Milk & Mocha ecosystem are interactive mini-games that turn holding into playing. Every action inside these games requires $HUGS, whether it's entering a tournament, unlocking a cosmetic upgrade, or competing in time-limited events.

This closed-loop system means that $HUGS doesn't just sit idle; it circulates, rewards players, and constantly pushes demand upward. Whitelist participants have the advantage of gaining entry before the crowds, allowing them to secure first entry into tournaments and enjoy better access to reward pools. Missing the whitelist means showing up late to the game when prizes are already being claimed and the competition is stacked against you.

Staking is one of the most attractive features of the $HUGS token. From the moment you stake, you start earning a fixed 50% APY. Rewards accumulate in real time and can be claimed daily, offering flexibility and consistent growth.

Unlike other systems that lock you down, $HUGS staking is designed to be both accessible and powerful. Additionally, leaderboards will recognize top stakers with exclusive NFT badges and bonus prizes.

Early whitelist members who accumulate tokens first will naturally have a stronger staking position, securing higher returns long before the wider audience gets in. Those who wait risk buying at higher prices later and missing weeks of compounding rewards.



Milk & Mocha NFTs are not just collectibles; they are functional assets within the $HUGS ecosystem. Every NFT drop can only be purchased with $HUGS, meaning whitelist members have early access to limited collections.

This system creates both demand and scarcity simultaneously. With each upgrade or merge, more $HUGS are permanently removed from circulation. The result is a constantly deflationary supply while providing holders with interactive and valuable assets. Whitelist members will be first in line for the rarest drops and upgrades, while non-whitelisted users will be forced to chase the leftovers at higher prices.

The $HUGS whitelist is more than a form; it's the master key to the entire Milk & Mocha ecosystem. Inside, participants unlock the opportunity to play mini-games with live reward pools, stake tokens at a 50% APY with daily payouts, and mint NFTs that serve as both collectibles and ecosystem tools. Each of these activities burns supply, drives demand, and rewards those who got in early.

Those who skip the whitelist will pay more later, miss out on early staking compounding, and face competition that has already secured positions at the top of leaderboards. Whitelist members aren't just early buyers, they're early winners. The whitelist isn't just early access, it's early dominance. Missing it means falling behind before the game even starts. Sign up today and secure your place inside the story Milk & Mocha is building.

What is the whitelist for $HUGS?
It's the only way to get early access to the presale before the public phase.

Do I need KYC to join?
No, whitelist entry is simple and open to everyone with just an email sign-up.

What are the benefits of being whitelisted?
Lower entry price, early staking rewards, NFT access, and better chances in mini-games.

How does staking work?
All stakers earn a fixed 50% APY, with rewards calculated daily and withdrawable anytime.

Do NFTs provide utility?
Yes, they unlock events, discounts, and can be upgraded through token burns.

As Telegram trading bot Snorter Bot Token (SNORT) nears $4 million in presale funding, the project has also rolled out major ecosystem updates that strengthen its position as a serious competitor to existing Telegram bots.

Snorter is Solana-native by design, which gives it faster speeds and lower transaction costs than Ethereum-based rivals that remain weighed down by that network's limitations, even as they expand multichain.

The latest updates show pieces of the roadmap now becoming reality, with features like MEV protection, automated copy trading, and expanded DEX support already taking shape.

The presale remains ongoing, with the current round pricing SNORT at $0.1047 per token for the next 20 hours before the price moves higher in the following round.

The main value of Snorter lies in its ability to spot tokens before the moonshot begins. It achieves this through dedicated RPC endpoints – essentially private data highways that connect directly to the blockchain – giving it faster visibility into the mempool, where pending transactions appear before reaching public order books. 

By tracking liquidity injections, wallet flows, and new contract deployments in real time, the bot identifies tokens showing breakout potential and executes sub-second swaps directly inside Telegram. This gives retail traders a rare chance to act before the wider market catches on.

Until recently, most of that trading happened on Raydium, Solana's primary DEX, which meant Snorter's reach was limited to a fraction of the opportunities. The latest update – first shared by the team on August 22 – expands support to Pump.fun and PumpSwap, Solana's busiest launchpads for new meme coins.

With this integration, Snorter can now plug directly into their smart contracts, scanning fresh pools and routing trades instantly. In practice, this widens coverage so retail users can catch plays at the very start of a coin's lifecycle, when the upside is often greatest.

The updates also make trading more hands-off for users. Automated trading now runs on smarter infrastructure that watches the market continuously and pulls the trigger when targets are met, with real-time notifications sent the moment trades go through. 

Copy-trading has been upgraded as well, with faster wallet mirroring that lets users reliably follow top traders without missing a move.

Source: https://snortertoken.com/en/updates/6

On September 11, the project released new updates that show the team fine-tuning some of Snorter's core features. 

Withdrawals are now in testing, with added security checks and fee calculations being refined to ensure smooth transfers of SOL and other tokens to third-party wallets. 

Copy-trading is also undergoing early testing, with the team refining mirror logic to ensure trades from tracked wallets are matched smoothly and accurately. 

At the same time, reliability upgrades are being implemented to strengthen failover systems and improve transaction handling, keeping the bot consistent even under heavy load.

These refinements matter because they push Snorter beyond raw speed and early detection. In crypto – where retail often struggles with failed transactions, unreliable copy-trading, or clunky withdrawal processes – stability and security can make the difference between securing profits and losing them.

Taken together, these updates show that Snorter is progressing from concept to a fully operational system tailored for retail traders. 

They lay the foundation for a bot built to give smaller players the same kind of edge whales have long enjoyed, packaged in a tool that runs accessibly inside Telegram.

Investor interest in the presale reflects that potential as $4 million could be hit in a matter of hours. Traders see Snorter as a rare chance to back a bot that could soon rival – or even surpass – incumbents like Banana Gun, Maestro, and Trojan.

And at the center of it all is the SNORT token, which powers the ecosystem by unlocking the lowest fees in the market at just 0.85%, while also serving as the currency for staking rewards, governance, and advanced features that make the bot more effective.

It's no surprise then that top crypto news outlets like Cryptonews have already predicted SNORT could deliver a 30x return once it launches.

To join the presale, head to the Snorter Bot Token site to secure your SNORT tokens using SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or even a credit card.

For the smoothest transaction, use a WalletConnect-certified non-custodial wallet such as Best Wallet, which is regarded as one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets in the space. 

Balances from the presale display directly in-app, with claiming made easy. Holders also gain exclusive access to brand new project launches through its Upcoming Tokens section.

Best Wallet is available for download on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

A towering 12-foot statue of former President Donald Trump holding a Bitcoin was installed outside the US Capitol on Wednesday, coinciding with a significant monetary policy announcement by the Federal Reserve.

At 2 p.m., the Federal Reserve announced a quarter-point reduction of its key interest rate, lowering it to approximately 4.1% from 4.3%.

This marks the central bank's first rate cut since December 2024, a response to slowing job growth and rising unemployment.

The Fed also indicated plans for two additional cuts in 2025, but only one is forecast for 2026, falling short of Wall Street's expectations for five cuts by next year.

The Trump statue stood on 3rd Street from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. as a temporary installation, funded by a group of bitcoin investors.

Organizers described the piece as a catalyst for discussion about the direction of digital currency, US monetary policy, and the federal government's influence in financial markets.

Hichem Zaghdoudi, a spokesperson for the collective, explained:

“The installation is designed to ignite conversation about the future of government-issued currency and is a symbol of the intersection between modern politics and financial innovation. As the Federal Reserve shapes economic policy, we hope this statue prompts reflection on cryptocurrency's growing influence.”

Group members noted the statue also pays tribute to Trump's vocal support for bitcoin, aiming to draw attention from the public and lawmakers alike.

The artwork arrives at a time when debate over the role of bitcoin in the US economy is intensifying, particularly as the Fed's actions continue to affect both traditional and digital asset markets.

Can Greater Boston become a hub for blockchain and crypto businesses?

Fidelity investments chief executive Abby Johnson sure hopes so. That's how she responded when asked this question by Qubic Labs cofounder Ian Cain during the Boston Blockchain Week conference, held in Quincy Center.

For many big financial players in Boston such as Fidelity and State Street, so-called “digital assets” are becoming an increasing part of doing business. (Fidelity, in particular, was an early mover in crypto.) But the city lacks a globally known pure-play crypto or blockchain business after Circle, which distributes its own digital currency, decamped to New York. 

Still, organizations like Qubic Labs see the potential for growth, in part because of the city's tech and financial talent and its concentration of universities. Cain and others started the nonprofit incubator a few years ago during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a stated goal of positioning “Quincy and the region as a leader in the global blockchain ecosystem.”

It felt like they had succeeded last week, with around 500 people attending the multi-day blockchain conference. Mayor Tom Koch stopped by, mentioning the time Quincy was the first seller of a municipal bond on blockchain in 2024, a $10 million issuance by investment bank JPMorgan Chase. (Blockchains are distributed databases or ledgers shared across computers, used for exchanging cryptocurrency but also for more conventional transactions.)

As head of one of the biggest financial companies in the world, Johnson brought some star power to the proceedings. During her presentation, Johnson talked about how Fidelity first experimented with digital assets about 12 years ago, later embraced them, and is now actively lobbying members of Congress for policies that encourage their growth. This year, Fidelity launched a product that allows investors to trade and hold cryptocurrency assets in a tax-advantaged IRA, and rolled out a tokenized money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain.

“I would love to see Boston as a hub for all this activity,” Johnson said. “I think that one of the things that really helped us thrive in our core business [of mutual funds] was that we were here in Boston and there were lots of other companies similar to ours.”

She added: “Sometimes people say, ‘Well, someone can quit and walk down the street and get the same job [with a competitor]. That's true and that is a negative or a risk. But the positive of being a talent destination for an area that is exciting and growing makes it all worth it.”

NBA champion Tristan Thompson is teaming up with Improbable CEO Herman Narula and co-founder Hadi Teherany to roll out a new web3 experience designed to reinvent basketball fandom for the digital era.

The project, named basketball.fun, will debut in October ahead of the NBA season and will attempt to gamify the way fans interact with players and games, Thompson announced. 

It has been developed on Somnia, a layer 1 blockchain that went live at the start of this month, already notching billions of dollars worth of trading volume in its first two weeks.

“This is how we experience moments together, it's not just about basketball,” Tristan Thompson said in a press release. “We're creating something for the fans that lives beyond the game, where your presence, passion, and play actually matter.”

Unlike traditional fantasy sports or fan tokens, the platform will tokenize NBA players with values that fluctuate in real time based on sentiment and performance. Fans will be able to assemble rosters, speculate on rising talent, and earn rewards tied to their predictions and engagement.

“The way fans value and perceive players should be different than owners and news networks,” Teherany said in an interview with CoinDesk. “We're trying to give power back to the fan — not just to predict who they think is great, but to actually earn incentives from it. Imagine being able to prove that the fan consensus on a rookie's potential is more accurate than a team's front office.”

Teherany stressed that the app won't launch with a native token, distancing itself from projects like Socios that hinge on token price. Instead, players will hold in-app value that reflects fan sentiment and game outcomes.

Asked why the team chose to build on Somnia instead of more established chains like Solana or Avalanche, Teherany pointed to both relationships and philosophy.

“Everything in this industry comes from authentic relationships,” he said. “When we met Herman Narula, it was an alignment of vision. He's not chasing short-term token hype but is committed to building sports and entertainment on-chain for the long term. That gave us confidence that this wouldn't just be valued on market speculation.”

The decision also came after lessons learned from a previous project, TracyAI, which Teherany said became too dependent on token performance. This time, the focus is on infrastructure, gamification, and sustainability.

Somnia went live on Sep. 2, following a six-month testnet that processed over 10 billion transactions and onboarded 118 million wallets. Backed by UK-based metaverse company Improbable, the network is positioning itself as the fastest EVM-compatible chain, claiming to handle more than one million transactions per second with sub-second finality.

At launch, Somnia onboarded 60 validators, including Google Cloud, and has integrated with protocols like LayerZero, Sequence, and Thirdweb. Its native token, SOMI, has nearly doubled in value since launch and is already processing billions in daily volume.

For Teherany, Somnia's traction adds credibility: “They've done billions in daily volume, bigger than some of the major exchanges. That's a testament to what they're building—and what we're building on top of it.”

The project's first major reveal is scheduled for Korea Blockchain Week, where Thompson will share his vision alongside Narula and Teherany. Attendees of Somnia House, the network's flagship side event in Seoul on September 23, will get an early look at the app and roadmap.

“We want to make this as approachable as possible,” Teherany said. “The blockchain layer should feel invisible. Whether you're a crypto native or just a basketball fan, you'll be able to join, play, and help define the narrative of the sport.”

 Solana's price may jump 20% within weeks, mirroring BNB's breakout pattern that led to fresh record highs above $1,000. 

Key takeaways:

Solana is mirroring BNB's 2024–25 rally, eyeing a breakout above $295.

A cup-and-handle pattern sets SOL's upside target near $540.

Solana (SOL) appears to be following a nearly identical chart trajectory to BNB (BNB), suggesting it may be on the verge of its own breakout.

A side-by-side comparison of SOL and BNB weekly charts shows striking similarities for more than a year, as highlighted by BitBull on Thursday. 

Both BNB and Solana have traced nearly identical market structures since early 2024. 

Each posted a sharp first-leg rally, followed by a multimonth reaccumulation phase between mid-2024 and early 2025, characterized by sideways consolidation and corrective pullbacks, before resuming their uptrends.

For BNB, this setup matured in August 2025, when it reclaimed its previous all-time high of $794.30. The breakout quickly gathered momentum, and within weeks, BNB extended its rally to a new record peak above $1,000 on Thursday.

Solana now appears to be entering the same breakout phase that fueled BNB's parabolic rise, eyeing a breakout over its current record high at around $295 within a month, up about 20% from current levels. 

The pattern underscores how investor behavior tends to rhyme across markets: Early rallies draw in momentum, consolidations shake out weak hands and renewed liquidity inflows help the uptrend resume. 

For instance, Ether (ETH) surged from ~$10 to ~$400 in the first half of 2017, entered a six-month reaccumulation phase, then broke out again to hit about $1,400 by January 2018. 

The structure looked almost identical to Bitcoin's (BTC) earlier 2013 cycle.

Solana is painting a classic bullish continuation pattern known as a “cup and handle,” positioning it for a potential breakout to new highs.

The weekly SOL/USDT chart shows the “cup” phase forming during the long bottoming process from late 2021 to mid-2023, followed by the “handle” consolidation stretching into 2025. 

This structure has created a neckline resistance around $267, which SOL has been testing for a breakout since November 2024. 

A decisive close above this neckline could trigger the next leg higher, with a technical breakout target projected over $540, up 120% from current price levels, by the year's end or early 2026.

SOL's weekly relative strength index (RSI) remains below the overbought threshold of 70 despite steady gains, further hinting that there's more room to climb.

 Livestreamers on Pump.fun placed a golden statue of Donald Trump holding a Bitcoin outside the US Capitol as part of a memecoin stunt. 

Memecoiners plonked a giant golden statue of President Donald Trump holding a Bitcoin outside the US Capitol as part of a Pump.fun livestream stunt on Wednesday, as an ode to the crypto-supporting president. 

The statue was placed just opposite Union Square in Washington, DC, on the National Mall that leads up to Capitol Hill, which is also roughly a mile from the White House. 

A website for the stunt said it was a tribute to Trump's “unwavering commitment to advancing the future of finance through Bitcoin and decentralized technologies.”

The statue's unveiling coincided with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates for the first time this year by 25 basis points, typically seen as bullish for risky assets like crypto, as it lowers the cost of borrowing money.

Trump embraced crypto in his presidential run, leading the industry to massively bankroll his campaign. The president and his family have deepened their financial interests in crypto while in office, sparking conflict-of-interest concerns as Trump has unwound regulatory oversight of the sector.

Hichem Zaghdoudi, one of the organisers of the statue, told ABC 7News DC that it was “designed to ignite conversation about the future of government-issued currency and is a symbol of the intersection between modern politics and financial innovation.”

“This is a statement, this is to show everybody that without the president, we could never have had this mass adoption of Bitcoin, of cryptocurrencies, of all these big institutions buying Bitcoin,” Zaghdoudi told DC News Now. 

“It shows that's the future and this is our thank you, our statement, to the president,” he added.

However, some could also argue that Bitcoin (BTC) has been in a bull market since at least late 2023, starting in the Biden administration, as hype surrounding the regulatory approval and the eventual launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds pushed the crypto higher as it became more easily available to institutional investors.

The organisers of the stunt, most of whom are anonymous, also created a memecoin on Pump.fun, where they created several livestreams aiming to boost the token.

One organizer said during a livestream on Tuesday that the statue was made from “extremely hard foam” to make it light and manageable to handle.

Posts on the organisers' X account show a machine carving the head of the statue and multiple people carrying the statue into place.

The organiser said on the stream that the statue is 12 feet (3.6 meters) tall and he hoped Trump would “walk out there and see it,” seemingly unaware that the president is currently visiting the UK.

The golden Trump statue is at least the third statue to appear on the National Mall this year in reference to Trump, but seemingly the first in support of the president.

In June, an eight-foot (2.4-meter) tall statue dubbed “Dictator Approved” appeared on the strip, depicting a giant golden hand giving a thumbs-up and crushing the crown of the Statue of Liberty. It was in protest of Trump's highly criticized military parade days earlier.

Later that same month, a gold television adorned with a bald eagle appeared, showing a video of Trump dancing with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein amid his administration's controversial U-turn on releasing more of the so-called Epstein Files.

Some Dogs Can Learn Categories like Human Toddlers Do

These dogs can extend words to new objects based on function the way children do in early language learning

By Anirban Mukhopadhyay edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Researchers found that some dogs can learn terms for functional categories, such as ‘pull' and ‘throw' toys.

Arya, a six-year-old border collie in Italy, can learn a new toy's name from just one or two mentions. Her owners say she even knows her favorite foods' names; when pizza is on the menu, the word has to be whispered. Arya's gift made her a natural for a new Current Biology study showing that some dogs with unusually large vocabularies can go beyond simply memorizing names.

For the study, owners of 10 talented dogs—mostly border collies—taught them words for two categories: tug toys, called pulls, and fetch toys, called throws. All toys were different in size, shape and color, so appearance could not guide learning.

Arya was one of 10 gifted word-learner dogs—eight border collies, one blue heeler, one Labrador retriever and one Welsh corgi pembroke—to participate in the new experiment.

After four weeks of training, brand-new toys that looked nothing like typical pulls or throws were introduced. This time, the dogs only experienced each toy's function (either tugging or fetching) during play; they were not taught words for any of them. After a week of play, when asked to fetch a pull or a throw, the dogs chose the right toy two thirds of the time—well above the 12.5 percent expected by chance. “These gifted word-learner dogs are not only able to memorize the labels of many different objects, but can also extend a familiar word to new objects that share the same function, even if they look very different,” says study lead author Claudia Fugazza, an ethologist at Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary.

Fugazza emphasizes that these animals are exceptional; most family dogs never build such vocabularies. She says the dogs' ease and flexibility applying words by function, similar to how human children begin extending their vocabularies, was surprising.

Elika Bergelson, a Harvard University language scientist who was not part of the new study, says human infants “mostly rely on how things look. But by 14 months they can also use role or function—for instance, telling apart who is chasing and who is being chased in a scenario—to extend words” to new things, much like the dogs in the study did. In everyday life, function and appearance usually go together: all cups share a basic shape because it makes them good at holding liquid. “Unlike the real world, where ropes look tug-worthy and balls appear throwable, this study isolates the function,” Bergelson says. “Taking away visual cues is a clean way to probe how categories might form across species.”

Back home, Arya is busy with her favorite search games and word play, oblivious to her superpower. “Because these dogs live in families and pick up words naturally,” Fugazza says, “their parallel to early child learning could offer scientists unique possibilities to explore how language-related abilities might have evolved—and how they can emerge in a nonlinguistic species.”

Arya relaxes.

Andrew Daniels and John Gilpatrick discuss how your brain could fight to stay alive after your body gives up.

You know the stories: a flash of light, a tunnel, maybe even a mysterious voice telling you it's not your time. Near-death experiences have fascinated people for decades, but now scientists are starting to think there's something even stranger going on: Right as the body shuts down, the brain might be kicking into overdrive, firing off one last burst of consciousness in a final push to stay alive.

That's the mind-blowing idea behind one of Pop Mech's most-read recent stories, “A ‘Twilight Consciousness' May Exist in Dying Patients. Could That Mean Death Isn't Final?” In the story, scientists detail a huge spike in gamma brainwaves—those linked with memory, awareness, and sensory experience—after patients are declared clinically dead. The discovery basically challenges everything we thought we knew about what it means to die.

Watch Andrew Daniels and John Gilpatrick break down the weird phenomenon of “twilight consciousness” and share a few stranger-than-fiction stories, like the man who woke up on the operating table just before his organs were harvested, and the 95-year-old woman who rose from her coffin after six days and made herself a bowl of porridge because she was hungry.

Andrew and John also explore the deeper implications: Does your brain really make one last attempt to find a reason to live? What if we're seriously misjudging the moment of death entirely?

Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as known quantum schemes require precise single-site control. Here, we propose a dissipation-engineering protocol that induces non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces a decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins, resulting in chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase occurs. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.

The free energy minimization principle for equilibrium systems states that all interactions between constituents must obey action-reaction symmetry. However, this constraint is no longer present once the system is driven out of equilibrium1,2. Such non-reciprocal interactions are in fact ubiquitous in Nature: the brain is composed of inhibitory and excitatory neurons that interact in an asymmetric manner3,4,5,6; the predator chases the prey and the prey runs away because of their asymmetry in the interaction; colloids immersed in a chemically/optically active media exhibit non-reciprocal forces that give rise to chase-and-run dynamics7,8,9,10. Recent studies revealed that non-reciprocal interactions fundamentally affect the collective properties of many-body systems11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26. A prominent example is the emergence of non-reciprocal phase transitions15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,27,28, where a time-dependent phase exhibiting a collective and persistent chase-and-run motion of macroscopic quantities arises. Its critical point is characterized by the coalescence of a collective mode to the Nambu-Goldstone mode15,17,20,21,22,23,25 – rather than mere degeneracy as in the conventional cases – which is strictly forbidden in equilibrium.

Non-reciprocal interactions are not restricted to the classical systems mentioned above. Quantum systems may also exhibit non-reciprocity28,29,30 by carefully tailoring dissipation microscopically31,32. Indeed, such non-reciprocity has been implemented in synthetic quantum systems such as cold atoms33, optomechanics34, and circuit QED35. However, these schemes require fine control of dissipation and gauge flux at a single-site/plaquette level, imposing a challenge to realize non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems.

In this work, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering scheme to realize non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems with light (Fig. 1(a),(b)). Specifically, we show that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)36,37,38 interaction between localized spins in a magnetic metal can be made non-reciprocal by irradiating the sample at a frequency that opens a decay channel from the doubly occupied state of a selected subset of spins, while leaving the rest off-resonant. The optical drive continuously removes these activated spins from the system—a loss that is compensated by the conduction band. Crucially, we point out that this process is most efficient when the activated spins reside in the energetically favored configuration, thereby generating a torque that pushes them away from the ground-state configuration. Since the inactive spins experience no such torque (Fig. 1b), the resulting exchange becomes intrinsically non-reciprocal: spin A attempts to align with spin B, but spin B attempts to anti-align with spin A, leading to a chase-and-run dynamics. We estimate the injection power needed for their emergence is within reach of the current techniques. Applying this scheme to a layered ferromagnet, we find that the light-induced interlayer non-reciprocal interaction triggers a non-reciprocal phase transition15 to a time-dependent chiral phase in which the magnetization of the two layers perpetually chase and flee one another (Fig. 1c). The origin of the non-reciprocity of our proposal is the imbalance in the amount of energy injected into each spin, conceptually akin to those arising in soft active matter8,9,10,39, yet distinct from earlier quantum schemes that use engineered gauge fluxes to control interference effects31,32.

a In the absence of light, the interaction between the local spins (thick blue arrow) is reciprocal. The spins are driven towards the equilibrium configuration [alignment in the ferromagnetic case illustrated here] through a magnetic friction called the Gilbert damping (green arrows). b When the light is tuned to a frequency hν that selectively activates the red spin [in the way illustrated in Fig. 3], the light-induced torque (pink arrows) acts on the activated spin. As a result, the two spins effectively interact non-reciprocally, where the active (inactive) spin tries to anti-align (align) with the opponent's spin. c Phase diagram of a layered ferromagnet under light injection, determined by our meanfield description (Eq. (8)). Here, the two ferromagnetic layers (A and B) are separated by a non-magnetic metal and the laser is injected to introduce active dissipation to the B layer at rate γB, making the interlayer magnetic interactions non-reciprocal. When the light is off (γB = 0), the magnetization of the two layers aligns for ferromagnetic interlayer interaction jAB(=jBA) > 0 (blue region). As the light-induced dissipation is turned on γB > 0, the system exhibits a phase transition to an antialigned configuration (red) at γB ≃ αB∣gB∣ and a non-reciprocal phase transition to a time-dependent chiral phase [where the two magnetizations exhibit many-body chase-and-runaway dynamics](cyan). [See text and Fig. 5 for further details.] We set the intralayer interaction and Gilbert damping of the layer A (B) as jAA = 10meV(jBB = 5meV) and αA = 0.1(αB = 2 × 10−3), respectively. The sd coupling strength for B is gB = − 10meV, the filling n = 1, and the temperature is kBT = 9meV. The dashed lines are the phase boundary at a lower temperature kBT = 5meV.

We expect our scheme to be applicable to a wide class of quantum materials such as Mott insulating phases in strongly correlated electrons40,41, multi-band superconductivity42,43, and optical phonon-mediated superconductivity that arises e.g., in SrTiO344,45. This broad applicability is anticipated because our proposal does not rely on any properties specific to magnetic metals: as long as the interaction is mediated via a virtual high-energy state, our scheme should equally work.

To illustrate our idea of creating non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms, we first briefly review how such non-reciprocal interactions arise in soft active systems, which inspired this work. Consider a metal colloidal system under light irradiation as a paradigmatic example9,10 (Fig. 2). When light reaches metal colloid B, part of it is absorbed while the rest is reflected. The reflected light then reaches metal colloid A, exerting an optical force FAB on it. Conversely, a similar optical force FBA is generated when the light incident on colloid A is partially absorbed and partially reflected toward colloid B. Crucially, in this situation, Newton's third law is not necessarily satisfied (FAB ≠ − FBA). This can be seen clearly by considering the extreme case where one colloid, say A, is a perfect absorber, leading to FBA = 0 while FAB ≠ 0. This has been verified experimentally, where the “chase-and-runaway” dynamics of the colloids are observed9,10.

Here, two metal colloids are immersed under light irradiation. The light that reaches the metal colloid A(B) is partly absorbed, and the rest is reflected. The reflected light reaches the metal colloid B(A), giving rise to an optical force FBA(AB). When the absorption/reflection properties of the two colloids are different, the optical forces need not obey Newton's third law FAB ≠ − FBA.

Fundamentally, the interaction is non-reciprocal because (a) the energy conservation law is violated for the degrees of freedom of interest, and (b) a mediating field facilitates the interaction. Condition (a) indicates that there is an external energy source that is continuously injected into the relevant system, and condition (b) enables the system to transform the absorbed energy into mechanical force, such that a net force is exerted on the center of mass of the two colloids only during the interaction process – an effect that is the very hallmark of non-reciprocal interactions. Notably, many of the known examples of non-reciprocal interactions in soft active systems are induced by such a mediating field: phoretic active matter8,46 (where two colloids interact via the hydrodynamic interaction arising from the coupling to a chemically reactive medium), living matter39,47 (the self-propulsion or rotation of the agents affects the surrounding environments that affect the hydrodynamic interactions between the agents), and quorum sensing48,49 (where cells interact by detecting and reacting to the released chemicals) all satisfy the above conditions (a) and (b).

In this paper, we propose to implement a solid-state analog of the above scenario to realize non-reciprocal interactions between electrons in a solid-state platform. The electrons in solid-state systems often interact by exchanging bosonic excitations, such as phonons, spin waves, and density waves, etc. Our idea is to inject light that induces dissipation during this interaction process, satisfying the two conditions (a) and (b) mentioned above and hence, gives rise to non-reciprocal interaction.

In this paper, for concreteness, we consider magnetic metals50 (Fig. 3). These materials are composed of localized spins (responsible for magnetic properties) and conduction electrons that are free to move (responsible for metallic properties), which couple through the spin-exchange coupling called the sd coupling51,52 (Fig. 3a). The sd coupling arises through the exchange of electrons, where the conduction electrons tunnel to the localized orbital to virtually excite the localized electron to a double-occupied state (see the “speech bubble” in Fig. 3a). Even in the case where the localized spins do not directly interact with each other, they may interact indirectly through this sd coupling using the conduction electrons as the mediating field, giving rise to magnetic interactions known as the RKKY interactions36,37,38.

a Schematic description of magnetic metals. It is composed of localized spins (thick blue arrows) and conduction electrons (yellow spheres with arrows attached). The conduction electrons form a Fermi sea up to the Fermi energy εF. The localized electrons are modeled as a spin degenerate localized orbital of bare energy εd with an on-site Coulomb interaction U. The two types of electrons couple through a spin exchange coupling called the sd coupling. Here, the sd spin exchange coupling arises through the second-order process where the conduction electron tunnels into the localized orbital to virtually excite to a double-occupied state and back, which involves spin-flip (the bottom panel). Using the conduction electrons as a medium, a magnetic interaction between the localized spins arises (the so-called RKKY interaction). [Note: there is another process where the localized electron first tunnels to the conduction band and back.] As these perturbative processes lower the energy, the ground state configuration is the state that activates these processes the most. b Our dissipation-engineering scheme is to inject light at a frequency hν resonant with the double-occupied state and a higher-level state (say, an unoccupied higher-level f-orbital state) at the energy εf,B that quickly dissipates with rate Γf,B. Since the decay occurs only when the localized-conduction electron exchange process activates (which lowers the energy), this process selectively destroys the energetically favored states, giving rise to a light-induced torque (pink arrow in Fig. 1b) that applies opposite to Gilbert damping (green arrows in Fig. 1(a),(b)). When this decay is turned on only to spin B but not A, the light-induced torque is applied only to B spins and hence a non-reciprocal interaction emerges. The lost electron is immediately resupplied from the surrounding environment.

We propose to dissipation engineer the RKKY interaction by injecting light that has its energy hν tuned to selectively turn on the tunneling from the double-occupied state to a higher-energy state that quickly dissipates (Fig. 3b). This introduces a finite lifetime to the virtual state, directly affecting the properties of the sd coupling and hence the RKKY interaction. The lost electron is immediately resupplied from the conduction electrons so that localized electrons are always singly occupied.

We show below from explicit microscopic calculations that this light-induced dissipation gives rise to a torque (pink arrows in Fig. 1b), which interestingly applies in the direction opposite to the energetically favored configuration. This light-induced torque competes with the magnetic friction called the Gilbert damping53,54 (green arrows) that relaxes the system to the ground state. When we choose the frequency of the light hν in a way that it only resonates with a portion of the spins (red spins in Fig. 1b), this light-induced torque only applies to those activated spins, giving rise to non-reciprocal interactions.

Why does our dissipation scheme give rise to torque that applies in the opposite direction from the Gilbert damping? This can be understood from the general picture we provide below. Our light-injection scheme only dissipates the virtual state of the second-order process illustrated in Fig. 3(b). Hence, the decay channel is turned on only when this process is activated; the configuration that activates the process more is the one that is likely to decay faster. Note crucially that these second-order processes always lower the energy in equilibrium because, according to the second-order perturbation theory, the energy change due to this process is given by ΔE = ∑m∣vi,m∣2/(Ei − Em) < 0, where Ei(m) is the energy of the initial (intermediate) state of the unperturbed system and vi,m is the matrix element between these states. (Note that Ei < Em.) For example, the sd exchange coupling is antiferromagnetic because the above process can only be activated when conduction and localized spins are antialigned due to the Pauli-blocking effect. Similarly, the sign of RKKY interactions is determined by which configuration the perturbative processes activate the most frequently. Therefore, the energetically favorable state is the state that experiences the strongest decay. This results in dissipative interaction in the direction opposite from the friction towards the ground state arising due to the coupling with the surrounding environment, such as the substrate, bulk phonons, etc. We remark that similar physics was discussed in Refs. 55,56 in the context of cold atomic systems, where they also dissipation-engineered sign-reversal of (reciprocal) interactions, but see also Methods for their crucial differences arising from the absence of the surrounding environment.

Since the above scenario does not rely on features specific to magnetic systems, we expect our scheme to be equally relevant to a wide class of quantum materials40,41,42,43,44,45.

Our goal from here on is to develop a formalism that allows us to describe the effective spin dynamics of the open quantum system with dissipation induced by continuous light injection. In this work, we consider magnetic metals modeled by the Anderson impurity model50,57 (Fig. 3a), described by the Hamiltonian \({\hat{H}}_{{{{\rm{A}}}}}={\hat{H}}_{0}+{\hat{H}}_{cd}\),

Here, conduction electrons are modeled as free electrons, where \({\hat{c}}_{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}},{{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}}\) is the fermionic annihilation operator of the conduction electrons with spin σ = ↑, ↓ and momentum k and \({\hat{c}}_{{{{\boldsymbol{r}}}},{{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}}={\sum }_{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}{e}^{i{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}\cdot {{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}}{\hat{c}}_{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}},{{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}}\) is its Fourier transform. εk is the kinetic energy. The conduction electrons are assumed to be large enough to be always in thermal equilibrium, where its distribution is given by the Fermi distribution function \(f({\varepsilon }_{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}})={[{e}^{({\varepsilon }_{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}-{\varepsilon }_{{{{\rm{F}}}}})/({k}_{{{{\rm{B}}}}}T)}+1]}^{-1}\) (εF is the Fermi energy and kB is the Boltzmann constant) at low temperature kBT ≪ εF. The localized electron at site a is modeled as a spin-degenerate localized orbital of bare energy εd,a; if both spin states are occupied, the configuration is penalized by an on-site Coulomb energy Ua. va is the conduction-localized electron mixing (c-d mixing), and Ra is the position of the localized electron. The energy level of localized electrons εd,a sits below the Fermi energy εF, but the double-occupied state εd,a + Ua is above it. As a result, the localized electrons are singly occupied in the steady state. Below, we consider systems with strong enough Coulomb repulsion Ua ≫ va that justifies the perturbative treatment of the c-d mixing va (See Supplemental Information (SI) Sec. III.C for a more precise condition).

As mentioned previously, we introduce a decay channel to localized electrons in the double-occupied state by injecting a laser that couples this state to a higher-energy state that quickly relaxes (see Fig. 3b). This dissipative process can be safely regarded as a Markov process as long as the higher-energy state decays fast enough compared to its re-population rate, which is true in the range of interest (see Methods for details). Such Markovian open quantum systems are generally described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation58,59 (also called the Lindblad master equation; see e.g., Ref. 60 and SI Sec. I for a brief review), given by (where \(\hat{\rho }\) is the reduced system density operator),

for our system. The dissipator \({{{\mathcal{D}}}}[\hat{L}]\hat{\rho }=\hat{L}\hat{\rho }{\hat{L}}^{{{\dagger}} }-\frac{1}{2}\{{\hat{L}}^{{{\dagger}} }\hat{L},\hat{\rho }\}\) makes the time evolution non-unitary. Here, \({\hat{P}}_{\uparrow \downarrow }^{a}\) is a projection operator onto the double-occupied state at site a, turning on a decay channel at the rate κa only when site a is double-occupied. We note that Eq. (3) can be derived from a microscopic model that treats the time-dependent laser drive and a higher unoccupied level explicitly, as done in SI Sec. V.

We wish to derive the localized spin dynamics in the presence of light-induced dissipation κa > 0. In the equilibrium limit κa → 0, a standard procedure to analyze the Anderson impurity model (Eq. (1) and (2)) is to map the localized electrons in the fermionic picture to localized spins, which is performed by projecting out the virtual excited states that have fast oscillations50,52. This incorporates the second-order process in terms of va illustrated in Fig. 3a). Here, we perform the same procedure in spirit but employ it to the GKSL master equation (3)61,62,63,64,65,66, see Methods and SI Sec. I-III for details. It yields,

The first term on the right-hand side describes the coherent dynamics that have an identical form to those found in equilibrium and the second and the third are the light-induced dissipative terms. The sd Hamiltonian51\({\hat{H}}_{{{{\rm{sd}}}}}=-(1/2){\sum }_{a}{g}_{a}{\hat{P}}_{{{{\rm{s}}}}}^{a}[\hat{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}({{{{\boldsymbol{R}}}}}_{a})\cdot {\hat{{{{\boldsymbol{S}}}}}}_{a}]{\hat{P}}_{{{{\rm{s}}}}}^{a}\) describes the spin exchange coupling between the conduction and localized spins, where \({\hat{P}}_{{{{\rm{s}}}}}^{a}\) is the projection operator to singly-occupied localized electron states at site a. Here, \({({\hat{{{{\boldsymbol{S}}}}}}_{a})}_{i}={\sum }_{\sigma,{\sigma }^{{\prime} }}{\hat{d}}_{\sigma,a}^{{{\dagger}} }{({\sigma }_{i})}_{\sigma {\sigma }^{{\prime} }}{\hat{d}}_{{\sigma }^{{\prime} },a}\) is the localized spins, σ = (σ1, σ2, σ3) are the Pauli matrices, \(\hat{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}({{{{\boldsymbol{R}}}}}_{a})={\sum }_{\sigma,{\sigma }^{{\prime} }}({\hat{c}}_{{{{{\boldsymbol{R}}}}}_{a},{{{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}}^{{\prime} }}^{{{\dagger}} }{{{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}}_{{\sigma }^{{\prime} },\sigma }{\hat{c}}_{{{{{\boldsymbol{R}}}}}_{a},{{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}})\) is the conduction spin at position Ra, and \({g}_{a}\simeq -| {v}_{a}{| }^{2}[{({\varepsilon }_{d,a}+{U}_{a}-{\varepsilon }_{{{{\rm{F}}}}})}^{-1}+{({\varepsilon }_{{{{\rm{F}}}}}-{\varepsilon }_{d,a})}^{-1}] < 0\) (where κa ≪ Ua is assumed) is the sd coupling strength that is antiferromagnetic. (Note that εd,a < εF < εd,a + Ua.) As usual, we have assumed that only the excitations near the Fermi surface are responsible. We have also ignored the impurity potential of conduction electrons, as they play a minor role.

The second term is the emergent correlated dissipation with the rate \({\gamma }_{a}\simeq {\kappa }_{a}| {v}_{a}{| }^{2}/{({\varepsilon }_{d,a}+{U}_{a}-{\varepsilon }_{{{{\rm{F}}}}})}^{2}\) that arises from the interplay between the strong correlation effect and the light-induced decay. (See also Methods.) This term induces dissipative tunneling of electrons from the conduction band to the localized orbital when the electron a is singly occupied. The third term describes the decay of electrons from the double-occupied state at a much faster rate than the correlated tunneling (κa ≫ γa), driving the system immediately back to the singly occupied state.

The emergent correlated dissipation (the second term in Eq. (4)) already captures the underlying mechanism of the dissipation-induced sign-reversal of interactions described in the previous section. This can be seen from the localized spin dynamics that are derived from the master equation (4),

where \(\langle \hat{O}\rangle={{{\rm{tr}}}}[\hat{\rho }\hat{O}]\) represents the expectation value, \({{{{\boldsymbol{S}}}}}_{a}=\langle {\hat{{{{\boldsymbol{S}}}}}}_{a}\rangle, {{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}({{{{\boldsymbol{R}}}}}_{a})=\langle \hat{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}({{{{\boldsymbol{R}}}}}_{a})\rangle\), and n is the filling of the conduction electron. The first and second terms describe the coherent dynamics arising from sd interaction and the light-induced decay of the dipole moment of the localized spin, respectively. Here, the latter arises since the localized electrons that carry the spins are continuously lost and resupplied, which makes the (statistically averaged) spin dipole decay. The third term is the emergent dissipative torque, which drives the localized spin toward alignment with the conduction spins. This is the opposite of what is expected from energetics, where the sd coupling is antiferromagnetic ga < 0. We note that it was crucial for this light-induced dissipator in Eq. (4) to have the form \({{{\mathcal{D}}}}[{\sum }_{\sigma }{\hat{o}}_{\sigma }]\) instead of \({\sum }_{\sigma }{{{\mathcal{D}}}}[{\hat{o}}_{\sigma }]\) for the dissipative torque to appear, generating quantum entanglement between localized and conduction electrons that is important for non-reciprocal interactions to emerge; see SI Sec. III.C for details.

The remaining task to obtain the effective interaction between the localized spins36,37,38 (i.e., the dissipation-engineered RKKY interaction) is to integrate out the conduction electron degrees of freedom that we regard as a (non-Markovian) bath. We perform this by mapping the master equation (4) to a Keldysh action67 that allows us to utilize field-theoretic approaches, taking into account non-adiabatic effects from the Fermi statistics of the conduction electrons. Once the Keldysh action is obtained, we integrate out the conduction electrons' degrees of freedom within the second-order perturbation in terms of sd coupling ga and light-induced correlated decay rate γa under the gradient approximation (i.e., Markov approximation plus a first-order non-Markovian correction). We extract the localized spin dynamics in the saddle-point approximation from the obtained reduced Keldysh action consisting only of localized electrons' degrees of freedom. We detail the procedure in Methods and SI Sec. IV.

The obtained semiclassical localized spin dynamics are

which is one of the main results of this work. We emphasize that all terms, including the Gilbert damping term, are obtained microscopically. Here, for simplicity, we have assumed that we are at low temperature (kBT/εF ≪ 1) and omitted the non-local non-Markovian (Gilbert-damping-like) terms68,69,70 arising from the dissipative part of the spin wave propagator.

The first two terms on the right-hand side reproduce the conventional the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert form53,54, while the last two terms are terms generated through our controlled dissipation. The first term gives rise to the coherent precession motion around the effective magnetic field Beff = ∑b(≠a)Jab(Rab)Sb, where Jab(= Jba) is the RKKY interaction strength given by Jab(Rab) = − 9π[(gagb)/εF]n2F(2kFRab) in the case of parabolic dispersion εk = ℏ2k2/(2m) in three spatial dimensions, where m is the conduction electron mass, \({k}_{{{{\rm{F}}}}}=\sqrt{2m{\varepsilon }_{{{{\rm{F}}}}}}/\hslash\) is the Fermi momentum, Rab = ∣Ra − Rb∣ is the inter-spin distance, \(F(x)=[-x\cos x+\sin x]/{x}^{4}\), and ℏ is the Dirac constant. The second term, obtained as the first-order correction to the Markov approximation70, is the Gilbert damping term describing the spins' magnetic friction53,54. This drives the system toward the ground state configuration when combined with the first term (green arrows in Fig. 1). Here, αa is the Gilbert damping rate, which, in the parabolic dispersion case, reads \({\alpha }_{a}=(9{\pi }^{2}/2){n}^{2}{({g}_{a}/{\varepsilon }_{{{{\rm{F}}}}})}^{2}\). The relaxation rate for such a process is \({\gamma }_{{{{\rm{Gil}}}}}^{ab} \sim {\alpha }_{a}| {J}_{ab}|\).

The light-induced dissipative interactions Ωab(Rab) = (γa/∣ga∣)Jab(Rab) ≃ (κa/Ua)Jab(Rab)[≠Ωba] compete with this equilibration dynamics (pink arrows in Fig. 1b). In addition to the unavoidable decay with rate γa of the dipole moment described by the third term, our light induces effective interactions that cannot be written as the derivative of the energy function. (We briefly note that we have ignored the contribution from self-dissipative interaction Ωaa, which merely renormalizes the decay rate γa.) This dissipative interaction drives the system towards a configuration opposite to the ground state configuration. When κa ≳ αaUa, this light-induced contribution (Ωab = κa/Ua ⋅ Jab) exceeds the Gilbert damping (\({\gamma }_{{{{\rm{Gil}}}}}^{ab} \sim {\alpha }_{a}\,{J}_{ab}\)), causing the effective interaction to change its sign. When this sign flip occurs to one of the spins but not the other, non-reciprocal interactions with effective opposite signs emerge, resulting in chase-and-runaway dynamics (the situation illustrated in Fig. 1b).

In Methods, we estimate the pumping power P required to achieve this regime as

using a Lorentz oscillator model, where e is the electron charge, m0 is the electron mass, ϵ0 is the vaccuum dielectric constant, and c is the speed of light. Setting the typical values Ua ~1 eV, αa ~10−2, Γf,a ~10 meV, hν ~1 eV, the required pump power is P ≳ 108W/cm2. Not only is this pump power achievable, e.g., with Raman lasers with pulse duration of O(10ns)71 or even with a steady-state resource72, but the heating effect should be minimal for magnetic metals. For instance, in Ref. 73, it was reported that the sample (GdFeCo) did not demagnetize until the pump power exceeded P ~1010W/cm2 for the pulsed experiment, and in Ref. 72, the ferromagnetic of the sample (NiFe) retained at least up to P ~ 108W/cm2 (3.5 mW power on a 580 nm diameter spot). For convenience for the readers, we have summarized the typical energy scales in Fig. 4.

The energy scales in (left panel) localized electrons immersed in conduction electrons picture described by Eq. (3), (middle panel) localized spins immersed in conduction electrons picture described by Eq. (4), and (right panel) in the interacting localized spin picture (where the conduction electrons are integrated out) described by Eq. (6). These pictures map from one to the other via the projection method (SI Sec. III) and Keldysh theory (SI Sec. IV). Each panel lists the energy scales in the coherent (Hamiltonian) and dissipative dynamics. The equilibration occurs at the timescale set by the energy scale in the Hamiltonian multiplied by the Gilbert damping rate αa. This competes with the light-induced dissipation and the sign reversal of interaction occurs when the latter exceeds the former.

So far, we have shown from microscopic calculations that one can generate non-reciprocal interactions with light. An intriguing question is how such non-reciprocal interaction affects the collective properties of many-body systems. In this work, at the outset, we consider a simple setup illustrated in Fig. 5a), where light is exposed to two layers of ferromagnets (that we label A and B) that sandwich a non-magnetic metal. The light is tuned to activate only layer B spins. In the absence of light, this is a type of MRAM device. The itinerant electrons in the non-magnetic metal layer mediate the interlayer RKKY interaction74,75,76,77. The light injection induces additional torque to the B layer, applying oppositely from conventional RKKY interaction, giving rise to non-reciprocal interlayer interaction (Fig. 5a).

a Layered ferromagnet composed of A and B layers separated by a non-magnetic metal exposed of light injection that activates the B layer. The interlayer RKKY interaction is mediated by the itinerant electrons in the non-magnetic metal layer, which is modified by light. In particular, the magnetization in the A layer aligns with the rate αAjAB for ferromagnetic interlayer interactions jAB > 0, while the B layer may align or antialign with layer A depending on the sign of the modified effective interaction αBjAB − ΩAB. φA(B) is the orientation direction of the magnetization mA(B) of A(B)-layer ferromagnet. b–d Different phases arising in this system. b Aligned phase (Δφ = φA − φB = 0) realized in the equilibrium limit γB = 0. c Antialigned phase (Δφ = π) at γB/(αB∣gB∣) = 1.1. d Chiral phase (Δφ ≠ 0, π) at γB/(αB∣gB∣) = 1.5. (e) The orientation angle difference Δφ and (f) the magnitude of the magnetization ∣mA,B∣ as a function of γB. We set jAB = 5 meV, kBT = 9 meV, and the other parameters are the same as those used in Fig. 1c). The simulations were run from random initial conditions and have been checked that there is essentially no initial condition dependence on the final state.

We wish to predict the magnetization dynamics of this system. Unfortunately, deriving the governing equation of the collective magnetization dynamics from a microscopic model is a highly non-trivial task that requires a beyond-saddle-point approximation we employed above (where a longitudinal relaxation is not incorporated)78. Although deriving such a coarse-grained description from microscopics is an important challenge, here, we take a phenomenological approach below.

We make the following observations: (a) In the absence of light, the magnetism ma=A,B should converge to the known equilibrium value. (b) Since the relaxation towards this state occurs through the Gilbert damping, their relaxation time for the a-layer is expected to be \({\tau }_{{{{\rm{Gil}}}}}^{a}=O({[{\alpha }_{a}{\sum }_{b}\,{j}_{ab}]}^{-1})\), where jab(= jba) is the interaction strength Jab multiplied by the number of spins a given spin couples to. (c) When light is injected into the B layer, the light-induced torque ΩBA and a decay with the rate γB is introduced to B layer magnetization mB. This brings us to propose the following phenomenological meanfield description:

where \({{{{\boldsymbol{h}}}}}_{{{{\rm{eff}}}}}^{a}={\sum }_{b={{{\rm{A,B}}}}}\,{j}_{ab}{{{{\boldsymbol{m}}}}}_{b}\) is the effective field applied to ma and ΩBA = (γB/∣gB∣)jAB is the light-induced torque. For simplicity, we have assumed that the system is close enough to the disordered-ordered transition point such that the Ginzburg-Landau expansion is justified and the anisotropy is strong enough that z-component of the magnetization vanishes \({m}_{a}^{z}=0\). In the absence of light γB = 0, the steady state \({\dot{{{{\boldsymbol{m}}}}}}_{a}=0\) reproduces the known result from the Weiss theory. This is of the general form introduced in Ref. 15.

Figure 1c shows the phase diagram obtained by simulating Eq. (8). In the absence of the light injection γB = 0, unsurprisingly, the magnetization orientation of the two layers aligns Δφ = φA − φB = 0 (Fig. 5b), where the orientation of the magnetism is defined by \({{{{\boldsymbol{m}}}}}_{a}=| {{{{\boldsymbol{m}}}}}_{a}| (\cos {\varphi }_{a},\sin {\varphi }_{a})\). As one increases the laser power that increases γB, the light-induced torque ΩBA weakens the ferromagnetic interaction, until it swaps the sign at ΩBA ≳ αBjAB or γB ≳ αB∣gB∣ (see Fig. 5(e)). This causes a transition from aligned Δφ = 0 to antialigned configuration Δφ = π (blue thin line in Figs. 1c and 5c). Remarkably, the B layer completely demagnetizes at the transition point ∣mB∣ = 0, while the A layer is still ferromagnetic mA ≠ 0 (Fig. 5f) even though the interlayer coupling is still present.

As γB is further increased, the system exhibits a non-reciprocal phase transition15,26 to a time-dependent chiral phase (see Fig. 1c) exhibiting a many-body chase-and-runaway motion (Fig. 5d). The parity spontaneously breaks in this chiral phase, where the relative orientation angle converges to a state Δφ = (≠ 0, π) that is not invariant under the parity operation Δφ → − Δφ. This cannot be understood from the Landau theory15, where the critical point is characterized by the coalescence of the collective modes to the Nambu-Goldstone mode17,20.

One can estimate the necessary condition for the emergence of the chiral phase as (See SI Sec. VI for the derivation),

where we have assumed a small Gilbert damping rate of the B layer spins αBjBB ≪ αAjAA and αB ≪ γB/∣gB∣. Plugging in the values used in Figs. 1(c) and 5(b)-(f), we find the required interlayer RKKY interaction strength to be jAB ≳ 1 meV, in agreement with our numerics. Since the electrons in the non-magnetic metal layer mediate the RKKY interaction, we estimate the interlayer RKKY interaction strength as jAB ~gAgBρspacer, where ρspacer is the density of states of the electrons in the non-magnetic spacer layer at the Fermi level. The condition for the chiral phase is then derived as

This implies that the larger the density of states of the spacer is, the more likely the chiral phase is achievable. For instance, taking typical values gA = 0.1 eV, αA = 0.1, n = 1, and αB = 0.001, we expect the chiral phase may emerge by choosing the spacer material with ρspacer ≳ 1 eV−1. (See SI Sec. VI for more details, including phase diagrams with different parameters).

Interestingly, there are regions where this symmetry-broken phase expands when increasing the temperature, which is opposite from what is conventionally expected (see the dashed lines in Fig. 1c) that show the phase boundary at a lower temperature). This is a signature of order-by-disorder phenomena discussed in Ref. 26, where a direct analogy between the geometrically frustrated systems and non-reciprocal matter was drawn.

In summary, we have proposed a scheme to dissipation-engineer non-reciprocal interactions with light. We showed microscopically that the light injection to magnetic metals that introduces decay of a virtually excited state induces non-reciprocal interaction between localized spins. Applying this method to layered ferromagnets, we showed that a non-reciprocal phase transition to a time-dependent chiral phase emerges15,26. The pump intensity required to achieve this is estimated to be within reach of the current experimental techniques.

The effect of non-reciprocal interactions on the collective properties of many-body systems is currently under heavy investigation in many different disciplines of science, ranging from active matter8,9,10,15,46,47,48,49,79,80,81,82,83, levitated particles84,85,86, photonics7, robotics87, living matter39,88,89,90, open quantum systems27,28,29,30,31,91, ecology92,93,94,95,96,97, and neuroscience3,4,5,6, to sociology98. Particularly, recent works showed that non-reciprocal phase transitions exhibit unconventional critical phenomena associated with anomalously giant fluctuations17, fluctuation-induced first-order transition20, and diverging entropy production21,22,23, due to the unique feature that the criticality is driven by the coalescence of the modes to the Nambu-Goldstone mode. Furthermore, non-reciprocal interactions have been shown to give rise to emergent features such as odd elasticity11,12 (anti-symmetric part of the static elastic modulus tensor), long-ranged order in two spatial dimensions13,14 (in an apparent violation of the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem), and phenomena analogous to those occurring in geometrically frustrated systems26. Our dissipation-engineering scheme may allow exploring these non-reciprocal physics in solid-state platforms.

We provide here a brief outline of the derivation of Eq. (4) and Eq. (6) in the main text. The full detail is provided in the SI Sec. III and IV, respectively.

Our starting point to derive Eq. (4) is the quantum master equation (3), which, for convenience, we write it as

where we have expressed the right-hand side of Eq. (3) using a superoperator (an operator that acts on a matrix) called the Lindbladian \({{{\mathcal{L}}}}\). We split the Lindbladian into two contributions \({{{\mathcal{L}}}}={{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{0}+{{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{1}\):

is the contribution from the c-d mixing \({\hat{H}}_{cd}={\sum }_{a,\sigma }[{v}_{a}{\hat{d}}_{\sigma,a}^{{{\dagger}} }{\hat{c}}_{{{{{\boldsymbol{R}}}}}_{a}{{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}}+{{{\rm{h.c.}}}}]={\sum }_{a}{\sum }_{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}},{{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}}[{v}_{a}{e}^{i{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}\cdot {{{{\boldsymbol{R}}}}}_{a}}{\hat{d}}_{\sigma,a}^{{{\dagger}} }{\hat{c}}_{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}{{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}}+{{{\rm{h.c.}}}}]\) that we treat as a perturbation. The rest \({{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{0}={{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{c0}+{\sum }_{a}{{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{d0,a}\) is the non-perturbative part, given by,

In the following, we take advantage of the property that our system has a separation of timescales by dividing the double Hilbert space (where the density operator \(\hat{\rho }\) lives in) into slow and fast degrees of freedom. By perturbatively projecting out the latter52, we obtain an effective low-energy description. Specifically, we first divide the right (left) eigenstates \({\hat{r}}_{n}^{(0)}\) (\({\hat{l}}_{n}^{(0)}\)) with the eigenvalue \({\lambda }_{n}^{(0)}\) of the non-perturbative Lindbladian, defined as \({{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{0}{\hat{r}}_{n}^{(0)}={\lambda }_{n}^{(0)}{\hat{r}}_{n}^{(0)}\) (\({\hat{l}}_{n}^{(0){{\dagger}} }{{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{0}={\hat{l}}_{n}^{(0){{\dagger}} }{\lambda }_{n}^{(0)}\)), to slow (\(n\in {\mathfrak{s}}\)) and fast (\(n\in {\mathfrak{f}}\)) degrees of freedom (\(| {\lambda }_{n\in {\mathfrak{s}}}^{(0)}| \ll | | {\lambda }_{n\in {\mathfrak{f}}}^{(0)}|\)). The perturbative Lindbladian \({{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{1}\) couples the slow and fast modes. Then, as derived in SI Sec. I.A.2, we perturbatively project out the fast degrees of freedom to yield the effective low-energy Lindbladian,

Here, \((\hat{A},\hat{B})={{{\rm{tr}}}}[{\hat{A}}^{{{\dagger}} }\hat{B}]\) is the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product and \({\hat{r}}_{{n}_{r}}^{(0)}\) (\({\hat{l}}_{{n}_{l}}^{(0)}\)) is the right (left) eigenstates that form the basis of the slow degrees of freedom (\({n}_{r},{n}_{l}\in {\mathfrak{s}}\)). The first, second, and third terms on the rightmost side are the zeroth, first, and second-order contributions in terms of \({{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{1}\), respectively. In the third term, the sum is taken over the fast degrees of freedom. Note how the third term has a similar form to the familiar second-order Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory, which is given by the matrix element \({{{\rm{tr}}}}[{\hat{l}}_{{n}_{l}}^{(0){{\dagger}} }{{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{1}{\hat{r}}_{m}^{(0)}]{{{\rm{tr}}}}[{\hat{l}}_{m}^{(0){{\dagger}} }{{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{1}{\hat{r}}_{{n}_{r}}^{(0)}]\) divided by the eigenvalue of the intermediate state \({\lambda }_{m}^{(0)}\). Equation (15) is consistent with the so-called Lindblad perturbation theory63,64,65.

In our problem, first note that the localized and conduction electrons are decoupled in the non-perturbative Lindbladian \({{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{0}={{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{c0}+{\sum }_{a}{{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{d0,a}\) and therefore the right eigenstate is expressed as a direct product \({\hat{r}}_{{n}_{r}}^{(0)}=({\prod }_{a}{\hat{r}}_{a,{n}_{r}}^{d(0)})\otimes {\hat{r}}_{{n}_{r}}^{c(0)}\) of the right eigenstates of \({{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{d0,a}\) and \({{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{c0}\) described by \({\hat{r}}_{a,{n}_{r}}^{d(0)}\) and \({\hat{r}}_{{n}_{r}}^{c(0)}\), respectively. For the conduction electrons, we will always be considering low-temperature states that have their conduction electrons in their ground state that forms a Fermi sea \({\hat{r}}_{{n}_{r}}^{c(0)}=| F\left.\right\rangle \left\langle \right.F|\), where \(| F\left.\right\rangle={\prod }_{{\varepsilon }_{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}} < {\varepsilon }_{{{{\rm{F}}}}}}{\prod }_{\sigma=\uparrow,\downarrow }{\hat{c}}_{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}},{{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}}^{{{\dagger}} }| 0\left.\right\rangle\). For the localized electrons, we regard the eigenstates with singly occupied state as slow degrees of freedom, i.e., \(\{{|\!\! \uparrow \!\!\left.\right\rangle }_{a}{\left\langle \right.\!\!\uparrow \!\!| }_{a},{|\!\! \uparrow \!\!\left.\right\rangle }_{a}{\left\langle \right.\!\!\downarrow \!\!| }_{a},{|\!\! \downarrow \!\!\left.\right\rangle }_{a}{\left\langle \right.\!\!\uparrow \!\!| }_{a},{|\!\! \downarrow \!\!\left.\right\rangle }_{a}{\left\langle \right.\!\!\downarrow \!\!| }_{a},\}\) where \({| \sigma \left.\right\rangle }_{a}={\hat{d}}_{\sigma,a}^{{{\dagger}} }{| \varnothing \left.\right\rangle }_{a}\) is a singly occupied state and \({| \varnothing \left.\right\rangle }_{a}\) is a vacant state. We also regard eigenstates that are diagonal in the Fock basis as slow modes for the localized electrons (which includes states like \({|\!\! \uparrow \!\!\downarrow \!\!\left.\right\rangle }_{a}{\left\langle \right.\!\!\uparrow \downarrow \!\!| }_{a}\), where \({|\!\! \uparrow \!\!\downarrow \!\!\left.\right\rangle }_{a}\) is a double-occupied state) as they do not involve fast coherent dynamics. The rest, such as \({|\!\! \uparrow \!\!\downarrow \!\!\left.\right\rangle }_{a}{\left\langle \right.\!\!\uparrow \!\!| }_{a}\) and \({| \varnothing \left.\right\rangle }_{a}{\left\langle \right.\downarrow | }_{a}\), are fast degrees of freedom.

Among these slow degrees of freedom, we are mainly interested in the states where the localized electron is singly occupied, i.e., \({\hat{r}}_{{n}_{r}}^{(0)}={\prod }_{a}{| {\sigma }_{a}\left.\right\rangle }_{a}{\left\langle \right.{\sigma }_{a}^{{\prime} }| }_{a}\otimes | F\left.\right\rangle \left\langle \right.F|\) (\({\sigma }_{a},{\sigma }_{a}^{{\prime} }=\!\! \uparrow \!\!,\!\downarrow\)). In this case, note that the c-d mixing \({{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{1}\) transfers the state into a state where (a) the localized electron is double-occupied and a hole is excited in the conduction band [the process illustrated in Fig. 3] or (b) the localized electron is vacant and a particle is excited in the conduction band. Since these processes excite the system to a fast mode, the first-order contribution (the second term in the rightmost side of Eq. (15)) is absent and the leading term is second-order. The second-order contribution (the third term in Eq. (15)) arises from the processes where the intermediate state involves states with eigenvalues \({\lambda }_{{{{\rm{(a)}}}}\pm }^{(0)}=\pm i({\varepsilon }_{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}}-{\varepsilon }_{d,a}-{U}_{a})-{\kappa }_{a}/2\) from the process (a) and \({\lambda }_{{{{\rm{(b)}}}}\pm }^{(0)}=\pm i({\varepsilon }_{d,a}-{\varepsilon }_{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}}})\) from the process (b). The real part of the process (a) \({{{\rm{Re}}}}{\lambda }_{{{{\rm{(a)}}}}\pm }=-{\kappa }_{a}/2\) reflects the light-induced decay that turns on in the double-occupied state. Assuming further that only excitation near the Fermi surface contributes εk ≈ εF, this yields, as detailed in SI Sec. III,

Here, the sd coupling

in the sd Hamiltonian \({\hat{H}}_{{{{\rm{sd}}}}}=-(1/2){\sum }_{a}{g}_{a}{\hat{P}}_{{{{\rm{s}}}}}^{a}[\hat{{{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}}}({{{{\boldsymbol{R}}}}}_{a})\cdot {\hat{{{{\boldsymbol{S}}}}}}_{a}]{\hat{P}}_{{{{\rm{s}}}}}^{a}\) and the correlated dissipation

are given by the imaginary and real part, respectively, of \(| {v}_{a}{| }^{2}[{\lambda }_{{{{\rm{(a)}}}}+}^{-1}+{\lambda }_{{{{\rm{(b)}}}}+}^{-1}]\) that arise from the two processes (a) and (b). The expression valid at regimes κa ≪ εF, εd,a, Ua is reported in the main text.

The correlated dissipation (the second term in Eq. (16)) adds an electron to the localized orbital such that the state transfers to a double-occupied state. This is quickly returned to a singly-occupied state via the light-induced decay with rate κa, which can readily be seen from the effective Lindbladian applied to \({\hat{r}}_{{n}_{r}}^{(0)}={|\!\! \uparrow \!\!\downarrow \!\!\left.\right\rangle }_{a}{\left\langle \right.\!\!\uparrow \downarrow \!\!| }_{a}\otimes | F\left.\right\rangle \left\langle \right.F|\) as,

where we have ignored the contribution to the coherent dynamics since we are not interested in the details of the double-occupied state. When applied to a vacant state \({\hat{r}}_{{n}_{r}}^{(0)}={\prod }_{a}{| \varnothing \left.\right\rangle }_{a}{\left\langle \right.\varnothing | }_{a}\otimes | F\left.\right\rangle \left\langle \right.F|\), we find \({{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{{{{\rm{eff}}}}}^{{{{\rm{sd}}}}}({\hat{P}}_{\varnothing }^{a}\hat{\rho }{\hat{P}}_{\varnothing }^{a})=0\) (\({\hat{P}}_{\varnothing }^{a}\) is a projection operator to a vacant state), where again, we have ignored the contribution to the coherent dynamics. Summing up these results gives the desired Eq. (4) in the main text.

We next integrate out the conduction electron degrees of freedom to derive the RKKY interactions between the localized spins modified by light. As emphasized in the main text, it is crucial to consider the non-adiabatic (non-Markovian) effect arising from the Fermi distribution function of the conduction electrons. A useful approach to take such effect into account is to analyze a generating function called the Keldysh partition function, defined as67,99,100 (See SI Sec. I for a brief review.),

for the master equation (4). We expand the time evolution operator \({e}^{{{{{\mathcal{L}}}}}_{{{{\rm{eff}}}}}({t}_{f}-{t}_{0})}\) in terms of fermionic coherent states into a product of infinitesimally short time intervals, similarly to the path integral formalism in quantum mechanics. Unlike in quantum mechanics (that deals with wave functions \(| \psi \left.\right\rangle\)) that involves one Grassmann field ψ(t) per degree of freedom, however, as we are dealing with the dynamics of the density matrix \(\hat{\rho }\) that lives in the double Hilbert space, each degree of freedom is assigned with two fields ψ+(t) and ψ−(t) that loosely describes the time evolution of the ket and bra space, respectively. For our system (Eq. (4)), the Keldysh partition function is given by,

where \(S[{d}_{+},{\bar{d}}_{+},{d}_{-},{\bar{d}}_{-},{c}_{+},{\bar{c}}_{+},{c}_{-},{\bar{c}}_{-}]={S}_{d}^{0}[d,\bar{d}]+{S}_{c}^{0}[c,\bar{c}]+{S}_{{{{\rm{sd}}}}}^{{{{\rm{coh}}}}}[c,\bar{c},d,\bar{d}]+{S}_{{{{\rm{sd}}}}}^{{{{\rm{dis}}}}}[c,\bar{c},d,\bar{d}]\) is the so-called Keldysh action, given by

Here, \({c}_{{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}},{{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}}^{\pm }\) and \({d}_{\sigma,a}^{\pm }\) are the Grassmann variables of conduction and localized electrons, respectively, and t±δ = t ± 0+.

Since the Keldysh action S is quadratic in terms of \((c,\bar{c})\), one can analytically integrate out the conduction electron degrees of freedom to obtain the effective action \({S}_{{{{\rm{eff}}}}}[d,\bar{d}]\) defined as \(Z\equiv \int\,{{{\mathcal{D}}}}(d,\bar{d}){e}^{i{S}_{{{{\rm{eff}}}}}[d,\bar{d}]}\). As detailed in SI Sec IV, the effective action within the second-order perturbation in terms of ga and γa (with several additional assumptions detailed in SI Sec. IV) reads \({S}_{{{{\rm{eff}}}}}[d,\bar{d}]={S}_{d}^{0}[d,\bar{d}]+{S}_{\gamma }[d,\bar{d}]+{S}_{M}[d,\bar{d}]\), where

is the first-order contribution and \({S}_{M}[d,\bar{d}]={S}_{{{{\rm{RKKY}}}}}^{{{{\rm{coh}}}}}[d,\bar{d}]+{S}_{{{{\rm{Gilbert}}}}}[d,\bar{d}]+{S}_{{{{\rm{RKKY}}}}}^{{{{\rm{neq}}}}}[d,\bar{d}]\) is the second-order contribution, with

Here, \({\hat{m}}_{a,j}^{{l}_{1},{l}_{2}}[d,\bar{d}]={\sum }_{\mu,\nu=\!\! \uparrow \!\!,\downarrow }{\bar{d}}_{\mu,a}^{{l}_{1}}{\hat{\sigma }}_{j}^{\mu \nu }{d}_{\nu,a}^{{l}_{2}}\,({l}_{1},{l}_{2}=+ ,-)\) is a localized spin written in terms of Grassmann variables, and

with ε± = εk±q/2 and f± = f(εk±q/2). Ja,b(Ra,b) is identical to the well-known form of the RKKY interaction strength50. In calculating SM, we have employed a gradient approximation, i.e., a Markovian approximation (\({S}_{{{{\rm{RKKY}}}}}^{{{{\rm{coh}}}}}\) and \({S}_{{{{\rm{RKKY}}}}}^{{{{\rm{neq}}}}}\)) plus the first-order correction to it (SGilbert).

The physical meaning of each term becomes clear by deriving the equation of motion of the spins. To do this, we introduce a set of auxiliary fields m and Lagrange multipliers λ as

with

As detailed in SI Sec. IV.C, taking the saddle-point approximation of Eq. (33) as \(\frac{\delta {S}_{M}^{{{{\rm{eff}}}}}[\lambda,m]}{\delta {\lambda }_{a,j}^{{l}_{1},{l}_{2}}}=\frac{\delta {S}_{M}^{{{{\rm{eff}}}}}[\lambda,m]}{\delta {m}_{a,j}^{{l}_{1},{l}_{2}}}=0\) (where \({S}_{M}^{{{{\rm{eff}}}}}[\lambda,m]={S}_{M}[m]+{S}_{B}^{\lambda }[\lambda,m]\)) gives

where \({S}_{a,j}={m}_{a,j}^{++ }(t)={m}_{a,j}^{--}(t)=\langle {\sum }_{\sigma,{\sigma }^{{\prime} }=\!\! \uparrow \!\!,\downarrow }{\hat{d}}_{\sigma,a}^{{{\dagger}} }(t){\sigma }_{j}^{\sigma,{\sigma }^{{\prime} }}{\hat{d}}_{a,{\sigma }^{{\prime} }}(t)\rangle\) and \({m}_{a,j}^{+-}(t)={m}_{a,j}^{-+}(t)=0\), which is the desired Eq. (6) in the main text. The first, second, third, and fourth terms on the right-hand side arise from \({S}_{\gamma },{S}_{{{{\rm{RKKY}}}}}^{{{{\rm{neq}}}}},{S}_{{{{\rm{RKKY}}}}}^{{{{\rm{coh}}}}}\), and SGilbert, respectively.

Below, we estimate the required laser power P to realize the sign-inversion of the interactions, which occurs when the decay rate of the double-occupied state κa exceeds αaUa (see main text and Fig. 4). Our scheme considers the situation where the double-occupied (at energy εd,a + Ua) and higher-level states (at energy εf,a) are coupled through the injected laser. We assume that the higher-level state is localized and dissipates with the rate Γf,a, so one can model it with a Lorentz oscillator model101.

When a laser with the pump power P is injected into the material, the dissipation causes the energy loss of the laser intensity if the system is in a double-occupied state. The lost energy density per unit time and volume W is given by

where ω = 2πν is the laser frequency. Here, we have expressed the pump power \(P=\frac{1}{2}c{\epsilon }_{0}| E{| }^{2}\) in terms of speed of light c, vacuum dielectric constant ϵ0, and electric field E. The absorption susceptibility χ″(ω) is computed according to the Lorentz oscillator model as

Here, ω0 is the resonant frequency (which, in our case, corresponds to ℏω0 = εf,a − (εd,a + Ua)), n is the number of electrons per unit volume, and m0 is the electron mass. In the second equality, we have set the laser frequency to be on resonance hν = ℏω = ℏω0.

The decay rate of the double-occupied state κa per electron is estimated as

This needs to be larger than αaUa to achieve the regime for showing laser-induced switching of interactions. This condition is given by,

This yields the condition,

shown in Eq. (7).

For the Markov approximation to be valid, the relaxation rate of the bath must be much faster than the timescale of the system dynamics. We argue here that this is likely to be justified in the range of interest at realistic parameters for magnetic metals.

In our setup, the double-occupied state couples to the higher-level state with the decay rate Γf,a via a laser injection tuned to be resonant with the two states. The higher-level state can be regarded as our “external bath” in the context of open quantum systems. As explained above, this process gives rise to the decay rate κa once the site a is double occupied (see Fig. 6a). Note crucially that, as illustrated in Fig. 6b, this is different from the rate at which the relevant system pumps an electron to this high-energy state because the relevant system transfers into a double-occupied state only once in a while when the conduction electron tunnels to the localized orbital. For example, when the c-d mixing is absent va = 0, there would be no electron transfer from the relevant system to the higher-energy state. The relevant transfer rate of a localized electron from the relevant system to the higher-energy state is estimated to be \({\gamma }_{a}\simeq {\kappa }_{a}| {v}_{a}{| }^{2}/{U}_{a}^{2}\), which we have derived in Eq. (4).

a The double-occupied (at the energy εd,a + Ua) and the higher energy states (at the energy εf,a) are coupled by the injection of a resonant laser hν = εf,a − (εd,a + Ua). The higher-energy state dissipates with the rate Γf,a. The localized electrons are typically in a single-occupied state but may virtually excite once in a while to a double-occupied state via the c-d mixing va. Note that no electrons decay in the absence of c-d mixing va = 0 because they are always in the single-occupied state. b Localized spin picture obtained after projecting out the double-occupied states (see Eq. (5)). In this picture, one finds that the effective transfer rate from the localized electron to the higher-energy state is given by \({\gamma }_{a}\approx {\kappa }_{a}| {v}_{a}{| }^{2}/{U}_{a}^{2}\). We require γa ≪ Γf,a to justify the Markov approximation.

For the Markov approximation to be valid, the dissipation rate of this higher energy state (i.e., the “external bath”) Γf,a must be much faster than the supply rate to this state γa ≪ Γf,a. This is because when the higher-level state is occupied, the Pauli blocking effect would suppress the decay. A slow relaxation of the occupancy of the state would lead to a non-Markovian effect.

It should be relatively easy to satisfy this Markov condition at the regime of interest. We are interested in the regime where we see the sign-reversal of the RKKY interactions, which happens when the dissipation rate exceeds κa ≳ αaUa or γa ≳ αa∣ga∣ (see the discussion above Eq. (7)). In the case αa = 10−2 and ∣ga∣ = 10 meV, this sets the condition, γa ≳ 0.1 meV. This required dissipation rate is less than the typical value of linewidth Γf,a, satisfying the justification condition for the Markov approximation, γa ≪ Γf,a.

Putting the conditions together,

This shows that the required pump power P to achieve sign inversion becomes less by choosing the higher-energy state that has a longer lifetime (i.e., smaller Γf,a) as shown in Eq. (7) but small Γf,a makes it more difficult to satisfy the Markovian condition γa ≪ Γf,a. We remark that a smaller c-d mixing ∣va∣/Ua helps satisfy the Markovian condition γa ≪ Γf,a without modifying the condition for the sign inversion, which physically makes sense because small va makes the double-occupied state rarer and hence rarer for the electrons to escape from the relevant system.

It is interesting to compare our proposal relevant to solid-state systems to the recent cold atom experiment of dissipative Fermi Hubbard model55,56, where they demonstrated a dynamic sign reversal of interactions. In their experiment, similar to our situation, they introduced a controlled decay channel that is activated only when the sites are double occupied, causing both atoms to decay whenever they are on the same site. They demonstrated that this engineered dissipation decreases the anti-ferromagnetic correlation (present in the ground state) and increases the ferromagnetic correlation, again analogous to our sign reversal of effective interactions. We briefly note, however, that the possibility of implementing non-reciprocal interactions was not explored in their work.

In contrast to our solid-state case, where the coupling to the environment is unavoidable, their cold atomic systems are almost perfectly isolated from the environment other than the decay to the vacuum they purposely introduced. This fundamental difference critically impacts the resulting dynamics. First, in our proposal, the surrounding environment (i.e., the conduction band) immediately compensates for the lost electrons such that localized orbitals are always singly occupied, while their atomic system only has a loss channel. As a result, their dissipation stops activating when the atoms stop colliding, resulting in a strong initial state dependence on the final configuration. This is in stark contrast to ours, where no initial-state dependence is present and even exhibits persistent time-dependent to a collective chase and runaway phase due to non-reciprocal interaction. Second, the Gilbert damping (present in our system) is absent in the cold atomic systems, as there is no environment where the atoms can dissipate their spin angular momentum. The competition between the friction (that drives the system toward equilibrium) and the light-induced dissipative interaction is hence a unique feature of our proposal for solid-state systems.

Differences in risk factor exposure and access to prevention resources have led to unequal health outcomes for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) globally. Recent studies elucidate the health benefits of arts participation, but no systematic reviews have focused on NCD prevention and health promotion. Here we share results of a mixed-methods systematic review that included 95 studies of arts programs, practices and activities, addressing NCD risk factors across 27 countries. We found that most reported outcomes were related to physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, mental health, and systemic, structural and social drivers of health. Our findings suggest that the arts may support NCDs prevention and health promotion by generating cultural relevance, providing opportunities for increased physical activity and social connectedness and by helping to identify and address systemic, structural and social forces contributing to health disparities and inequities.

Thousands of paper documents in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's meteorological archives are now being digitized.Credit: Derrick Muheki/INERA DRC

Crucial climate questions are spurring researchers to tap into vast repositories of handwritten weather records languishing in archives all over the world. For example, climate scientist Derrick Muheki spent two months scanning thousands of pages of weather logs in a remote weather station in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and his MeteoSaver machine-learning tool was able to transcribe 90% of the contents. The resulting data will provide crucial information about how conditions have changed over time in the world's second largest rainforest. Another group is working to digitize thousands of logbooks from Danish ships from the 1800s covering the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea.

Material deep inside Earth — thousands of kilometres down, near the planet's core — has undergone a mysterious shift. Scientists spotted signs of the change in measurements of the planet's gravity, recorded around 2007 by the US–German GRACE satellites. Researchers think that the movement could be linked to a type of mineral called a perovskite, in rocks near the bottom of Earth's mantle, that changed its structural configuration in response to the crushing pressures deep inside the planet.

A map of the mesh-like nervous system of a comb jelly — one of the oldest animals around, evolutionarily speaking — reveals how Mnemiopsis leidyi orients itself in the briny deep. The study shows how brain-mapping techniques can be used on “some of the weirder nervous systems”, says neurobiologist and biophysicist John Tuthill, who was the reviewing editor of the paper. “That's a really effective way to kind of do comparative neuroscience.”

A new connectome suggests that similar neural circuits evolved in very different animals — comb jellies and marine segmented worms — to control the little hair-like cilia that they wave to orient themselves.

By studying the vocalizations of primates, birds and whales, researchers have spotted features of animal communication once thought unique to human language. To probe deeper, some researchers are turning to artificial intelligence tools to explore whether we can infer meaning from such communications. Their research raises a tantalizing question: if we can decode the ‘language' of animals, could we one day talk back? If it's possible, there are ethical issues to iron out, such as the impact it could have on animals' behaviour, say researchers.

In the past decade, the arrival of anti-amyloid therapies has provided hope for people diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer's disease in the United States. These drugs can slow the accumulation of amyloid-β in the brain — one of the hallmark symptoms of Alzheimer's. But despite their promise, the drugs have been mired in controversy. They come with a considerable risk of serious side effects such as brain swelling and bleeding, and there's still a question mark over whether their effect slows the cognitive decline associated with the disease.

The Breakthrough Starshot project launched with blinding scientific starpower: astronaut Mae Jemison and cosmologist Stephen Hawking were among the luminaries on stage for the announcement in 2016. Its goal was even more lofty: A US$100-million proof-of-concept for an interstellar trip to our neighbouring star system Alpha Centauri. Now, scientists say that the project has gone quiet and it's not known how much of billionaire tech-investor Yuri Milner's money materialized. Nevertheless, say participants, the dream lives on. “Breakthrough changed society's conception of this kind of stuff as a legitimate area of scientific inquiry,” says roboticist Zachary Manchester, who was involved from the beginning.

Today I'm delighted to hear that a museum has acquired a treasure trove of scientific items, including Rosalind Franklin's original Photo 51, the X-ray diffraction image made in 1952 that launched our understanding of the structure of DNA. The collection has a jaw-dropping history involving a conman who posed as a neuroscientist, and years spent in obscurity in a vault overseen by high-profile geneticist J. Craig Venter.

Google is adding multiple new AI features to Chrome, the most popular browser in the world. The most visible change is a new button in Chrome that launches the Gemini chatbot, but there are also new tools for searching, researching, and answering questions with AI. Google has additional cursor-controlling “agentic” tools in the pipeline for Chrome as well.

The Gemini in Chrome mode for the web browser uses generative AI to answer questions about content on a page and synthesize information across multiple open tabs. Gemini in Chrome first rolled out to Google's paying subscribers in May. The AI-focused features are now available to all desktop users in the US browsing in English; they'll show up in a browser update.

On mobile devices, Android users can already use aspects of Gemini within the Chrome app, and Google is expected to launch an update for iOS users of Chrome in the near future.

When I wrote about web browsers starting to add more generative AI tools back in 2023, it was primarily something that served as an alternative to the norm. The software was built by misfits and change-makers who were experimenting with new tools, or hunting for a break-out feature to grow their small user bases. All of this activity was dwarfed by the commanding number of users who preferred Chrome.

Two years later, while Google's browser remains the market leader, the internet overall is completely seeped in AI tools, many of them also made by Google. Still, today marks the moment when the concept of an “AI browser” truly went mainstream with the weaving of Gemini so closely into the Chrome browser.

The Gemini strategy at Google has already been to leverage as many of its in-house integrations as possible, from Gmail to Google Docs. So, the decision to AI-ify the Chrome browser for a wider set of users does not come as a shock.

Even so, the larger roll out will likely be met with ire by some users who are either exhausted by the onslaught of AI-focused features in 2025 or want to abstain from using generative AI, whether for environmental reasons or because they don't want their activity to be used to train an algorithm. Users who don't want to see the Gemini option will be able to click on the Gemini sparkle icon and unpin it from the top right corner of the Chrome browser.

The new button at the top of the browser will launch Gemini. Users in the US will see these changes first.

Before the end of September, Google also plans to incorporate its chatbot-style search feature, AI Mode, into Chrome's address bar, which Google calls the Omnibox. This means users will have an AI Mode button and keyboard shortcut that uses Gemini and suggests prompts based on what's shown on the web page.

This feature is optional and won't replace a user's ability to just run a regular Google search by typing a query into the address bar. Though generative AI's looming presence does feel inescapable—you'll probably bump into an AI Overview at the top of those results anyways.

While they're not rolling out yet, Chrome users can expect to see agentic features come to the browser in the next few months. This basically means that a user could ask Gemini to complete a web-based task, like adding items to an Instacart order. Then, the generative AI tool will run in the background, attempt to choose groceries by clicking around, and then show you the results before you make the final purchasing decision. Aspects of this are similar to what Google has previously demoed with its Project Mariner experiment.

When I tried out a comparable agent feature released by OpenAI earlier this year, previously called Operator, the results were messy and fairly slow. The agentic experience felt akin to letting a sloppy ghost loose to haunt my browser. Based on my past tests of similar features, I'm skeptical these agent features for Chrome will feel like more than a parlor trick at release.

AI Overviews will become more embedded and interactive.

Throughout 2025, every major software release has had some kind of generative AI angle. Browsers are no different. Picture me doing my best Oprah impression: Your browser gets AI features! And your browser gets AI features! Yours too!

For example, a startup called The Browser Company had previously dabbled in AI browser tools for a couple of years with Arc. In June, the company released its rebranded browser, now called Dia, with a bevy of new AI integrations. Another rising startup, Perplexity, has focused extensively this year on launching a new browser named Comet that heavily incorporates aspects of its generative AI-powered search engine. It's rumored that OpenAI also could eventually release its own version of an AI browser.

At the same time as the rollout of these new features for Chrome, the Gemini app for smartphones is at the top of the free download charts for iOS, right above ChatGPT, the previous leader. The app rose in popularity after the release of Google's latest version of its image generator, called Nano Banana.

While early adopters who enjoy experimenting with new tools have probably already downloaded an alternative browser out of curiosity, Google putting Gemini inside of Chrome will likely be the first time millions of users have encountered AI-focused features like this in their browser. You can definitely expect to receive a call from your relatives in the next few weeks asking what the hell Gemini is.

Gemini is integrated into the mobile version of Chrome on Android, and iOS will get an update soon.

As businesses around the world have shifted their digital infrastructure over the last decade from self-hosted servers to the cloud, they've benefitted from the standardized, built-in security features of major cloud providers like Microsoft. But with so much riding on these systems, there can be potentially disastrous consequences at a massive scale if something goes wrong. Case in point: Security researcher Dirk-jan Mollema recently stumbled upon a pair of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Azure's identity and access management platform that could have been exploited for a potentially cataclysmic takeover of all Azure customer accounts.

Known as Entra ID, the system stores each Azure cloud customer's user identities, sign-in access controls, applications, and subscription management tools. Mollema has studied Entra ID security in depth and published multiple studies about weaknesses in the system, which was formerly known as Azure Active Directory. But while preparing to present at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas in July, Mollema discovered two vulnerabilities that he realized could be used to gain global administrator privileges—essentially god mode—and compromise every Entra ID directory, or what is known as a “tenant.” Mollema says that this would have exposed nearly every Entra ID tenant in the world other than, perhaps, government cloud infrastructure.

“I was just staring at my screen. I was like, ‘No, this shouldn''t really happen,'” says Mollema, who runs the Dutch cybersecurity company Outsider Security and specializes in cloud security. “It was quite bad. As bad as it gets, I would say.”

“From my own tenants—my test tenant or even a trial tenant—you could request these tokens and you could impersonate basically anybody else in anybody else's tenant,” Mollema adds. “That means you could modify other people's configuration, create new and admin users in that tenant, and do anything you would like.”

Given the seriousness of the vulnerability, Mollema disclosed his findings to the Microsoft Security Response Center on July 14, the same day that he discovered the flaws. Microsoft started investigating the findings that day and issued a fix globally on July 17. The company confirmed to Mollema that the issue was fixed by July 23 and implemented extra measures in August. Microsoft issued a CVE for the vulnerability on September 4.

“We mitigated the newly identified issue quickly, and accelerated the remediation work underway to decommission this legacy protocol usage, as part of our Secure Future Initiative,” Tom Gallagher, Microsoft's Security Response Center vice president of engineering, told WIRED in a statement. “We implemented a code change within the vulnerable validation logic, tested the fix, and applied it across our cloud ecosystem.”

Gallagher says that Microsoft found “no evidence of abuse” of the vulnerability during its investigation.

Both vulnerabilities relate to legacy systems still functioning within Entra ID. The first involves a type of Azure authentication token Mollema discovered known as Actor Tokens that are issued by an obscure Azure mechanism called the “Access Control Service.” Actor Tokens have some special system properties that Mollema realized could be useful to an attacker when combined with another vulnerability. The other bug was a major flaw in a historic Azure Active Directory application programming interface known as “Graph” that was used to facilitate access to data stored in Microsoft 365. Microsoft is in the process of retiring Azure Active Directory Graph and transitioning users to its successor, Microsoft Graph, which is designed for Entra ID. The flaw was related to a failure by Azure AD Graph to properly validate which Azure tenant was making an access request, which could be manipulated so the API would accept an Actor Token from a different tenant that should have been rejected.

“Microsoft built security controls around identity like conditional access and logs, but this internal impression token mechanism bypasses them all,” says Michael Bargury, the CTO at security firm Zenity. “This is the most impactful vulnerability you can find in an identity provider, effectively allowing full compromise of any tenant of any customer.”

If the vulnerability had been discovered by, or fallen into the hands of, malicious hackers, the fallout could have been devastating.

“We don't need to guess what the impact may have been; we saw two years ago what happened when Storm-0558 compromised a signing key that allowed them to log in as any user on any tenant,” Bargury says.

While the specific technical details are different, Microsoft revealed in July 2023 that the Chinese cyber espionage group known as Storm-0558 had stolen a cryptographic key that allowed them to generate authentication tokens and access cloud-based Outlook email systems, including those belonging to US government departments.

Conducted over the course of several months, a Microsoft postmortem on the Storm-0558 attack revealed several errors that led to the Chinese group slipping past cloud defenses. The security incident was one of a string of Microsoft issues around that time. These motivated the company to launch its “Secure Future Initiative,” which expanded protections for cloud security systems and set more aggressive goals for responding to vulnerability disclosures and issuing patches.

Mollema says that Microsoft was extremely responsive about his findings and seemed to grasp their urgency. But he emphasizes that his findings could have allowed malicious hackers to go even farther than they did in the 2023 incident.

“With the vulnerability, you could just add yourself as the highest privileged admin in the tenant, so then you have full access,” Mollema says. Any Microsoft service “that you use EntraID to sign into, whether that be Azure, whether that be SharePoint, whether that be Exchange—that could have been compromised with this.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Lisa Stiffler on Sep 18, 2025 at 8:24 amSeptember 18, 2025 at 9:35 am

Katie Wilson has never held elected office, but the longtime community organizer and Transit Riders Union co-founder is now the Democratic front-runner for Seattle mayor after winning nearly 51% of the vote in the August primary against incumbent Bruce Harrell.

For many Seattle civic leaders, the tech companies operating here have often represented a double-edged sword. Corporations including Amazon, Expedia Group, Google, Meta and numerous others provide well-paying jobs that stoke the economy, but the influx of affluent workers has strained the region's housing affordability and availability.

As Seattle grapples with persistent issues including homelessness and fentanyl abuse while debating how to fund city services, Wilson wants to engage the tech sector as part of the solution. But how that would specifically play out is unclear.

“Seattle's a very innovative city,” she said. “We have a lot of big challenges here, but as I'm going around the city and I'm talking to residents and I'm talking to business owners and talking to tech workers, there's so much promise here.”

Wilson helped design and pass Seattle's controversial JumpStart payroll expense tax in 2020. A majority of the revenue — $360 million in 2024 — is generated from 10 companies, including Amazon. 

“The JumpStart tax, overall, I would call it a very successful policy,” she told GeekWire. “It both prevented devastating service cuts during the recession, and also has basically allowed the city's budget to be balanced for the last four years.”

The tax evolved from a previous “head tax” proposal in 2018 that drew sharp criticism from Amazon, which later announced that it was moving thousands of jobs to nearby Bellevue. 

Speaking at the GeekWire Summit in 2021, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy called out the strained relations with Seattle leadership, saying that “the City Council has become less enamored with business or with Amazon.” 

Those tensions have eased during Harrell's term, and Wilson said she aims to work with the company. She touted her coalition building efforts and said collaboration is possible even if parties are not aligned on every issue.

“Obviously Amazon and the other big tech companies are very important players in our city and in our economy, and so I think it's very important that the city has working relationships there,” she said. 

But the question of how to fund city operations continues to plague Seattle, which now faces a two-year budget deficit of nearly $150 million.   

The overarching challenge, Wilson said, is that Washington has the nation's second-most regressive tax system due to its lack of a state or local income taxes, and reliance on taxes that hit lower-income residents harder than the wealthy.

The state passed several new taxes on businesses earlier this year to help fund public schools, community safety programs and other services. Some tech leaders in Washington, including Microsoft President Brad Smith, have been vocal in criticizing recent state tax proposals that impact businesses.

To help fill Seattle's budget hole, voters earlier this year passed a tax on big companies to pay for public housing. Wilson supported the measure, while Harrell, Amazon and Microsoft opposed it. 

Harrell proposed an alternative funding mechanism for public housing from the existing JumpStart tax. In a recent debate, the mayor said he wants affordable housing, but expressed concern about businesses leaving Seattle over higher taxes.

Wilson is also a proponent of taxing profits made from the sale of stocks and bonds, though the Seattle City Council last year narrowly rejected a proposed 2% capital gains tax.

What the state and city need, Wilson said, “is a progressive tax system that is robust enough that it is funding the public goods and services that we all depend on to have a functional state, to have a functional city.” 

Economic diversification

While tech dominates the Seattle economy, Wilson is interested in diversifying that focus. In a recent post on Reddit, she cautioned that a heavy reliance on the tech sector could pose problems for Seattle down the road.

“We've really been blithely riding the tech wave for the past 15 years and I don't think we can just assume that will continue,” she wrote.

Wilson told GeekWire she's making “building a green economy” a high priority. That would include partnering with the University of Washington and the Port of Seattle to foster job creation around clean energy and other climate technologies.

In January, the city teamed up with the UW and others in launching the Seattle Climate Innovation Hub to support entrepreneurs in the climate sector and to aid the revitalization of the city's downtown.

Revitalizing and re-envisioning downtown

Seattle's downtown continues to regain some of its pre-COVID vitality, which has improved as employees are recalled to offices. But the recovery remains fragile as downtown vacancy rates are above 30%. Wilson is interested in developing a stronger residential presence in the city's core to boost its vibrancy beyond 9-5 working hours.

“The future of downtown is obviously very central to Seattle's future as a whole,” she said. “And I would really want to put a big focus on the transformation of downtown to also more of a residential, 24-hour neighborhood.”

That could entail building more housing downtown and converting offices to residential spaces where feasible. The city would also need to add more amenities such as grocery stores, pharmacies and childcare, plus improving safety.

Tackling homelessness and substance abuse

While Amazon and Microsoft have stoked the region's economy, those gains have contributed to rising housing costs. To help address the situation, the tech giants are funding the construction and preservation of affordable housing. Amazon recently touted the creation of 10,000 units in the Seattle area since 2021. 

But the homeless crisis in Seattle and the surrounding county has continued to worsen over the past decade. 

Wilson has vowed to establish 4,000 spaces for people experiencing homelessness, including tiny shelters, overnight beds in church facilities, and other emergency solutions. She said next summer's World Cup matches in Seattle will put pressure on the city to move unhoused people off the streets.

She also wants to explore the creation of a municipal voucher program to help people rent the thousands of vacant apartments that are earmarked for affordable housing, but still too expensive for many renters.

And as the fentanyl crisis continues in Seattle, Wilson is eager to employ new treatments available to people struggling with the drug, and also wants to pair treatment with shelter stability and housing.

“It's going to take money,” Wilson said of her plans to address homelessness. “A lot of that is going to be existing, repurposed money, and potentially also new money. But I think we can get there over four years.”

Top tech names were on the guest list for the banquet thrown for President Trump during his second state visit to the UK on Wednesday. 

The banquet seating chart included NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang; Apple CEO Tim Cook; venture capitalist and White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks; Alphabet and Google president Ruth Porat; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff; and OpenAI's Sam Altman, according to the New York Times.

On Thursday, the US and UK signed a partnership called the Tech Prosperity Deal to focus on developing nuclear, AI, and quantum technologies. Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and OpenAI also made announcements earlier this week to build data centers in the UK, while CoreWeave and Salesforce announced a multi-billion-pound investment in the country. Overall, American tech firms committed a total of £31 billion ($42 billion) to boost AI infrastructure in the UK.

This state banquet guest list seems to have featured more tech and business names rather than the Hollywood types that often attend such affairs.

This change reveals the shifting economic needs of the UK and US in the age of AI, and the rising prominence of technology and its leaders in Trump's second administration. Just this past year, numerous Big Tech companies like OpenAI, Google, and Apple have pledged to work with the government, from providing AI assistant tools to government services to building digital health ecosystems for the U.S. health industry. 

The president has also taken a sharper focus on tech — criticizing Tim Cook for Apple's outsourced supply chain, signing an “anti-work” AI order, as well as instructing the attorney general to investigate private companies receiving federal funds that have DEI programs deemed “illegal.” 

Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and other tech leaders attended the president's inauguration this year. And, in early September, President Trump threw a tech dinner with 33 top names in Silicon Valley, including Altman, Cook, and Zuckerberg. Musk, a former senior advisor to the president, once known as “First Buddy“, was not present at either dinner.

At the “Make with Notion” event on Thursday, the company announced the launch of its first AI agent. The agent will draw on all a user's notion pages and database as context, automatically generating notes and analysis for meetings, competitor evaluation reports, and feedback landing pages.

The productivity platform said that the agent can create pages and databases, or update them with new data, properties, or views. Users can also trigger Notion agents from outside platforms that are linked to the service. For instance, you can ask Notion agent to create a bug tracking dashboard from various sources, including Slack, email, and Google Drive.

The newly announced Agent builds on Notion AI, a pre-existing feature which could search or summarize content. But the new agent is able to tackle more complex multi-step tasks, using the powers of agentic AI. The company said that the current version of agent can perform a task that runs up to 20 minutes across hundreds of pages.

Users can set up a “profile” page for the agent to instruct it to follow directions on referencing sources, style of output, and where to update tasks and final results. You'll also be able to ask the agent to “remember” key points as people use them. Those memories will be stored on the profile page, and users can edit them there.

In demo videos, the company gave examples of agents that could provide feedback for landing pages and update them, create a restaurant tracker, create an analysis from meeting notes, and prepare a competition analysis report.

At the moment, you have to trigger these actions manually. But Notion said that the ability to create customized agents that work on a schedule or triggers is coming soon. The company will also release a template library for agents so you can pick ready-made prompts that might suit your task.

Over the last two years, Notion has released a calendar app, a Gmail client, a meeting notetaker, and an enterprise search to get information from different sources. These are features that gave the company enough contextual building blocks to create automations. Other enterprise knowledge and productivity platforms, including Salesforce, Fireflies, Read AI have launched their own agents to extract and update information.

The House Oversight Committee has requested that the CEOs of Discord, Twitch, Reddit, and gaming platform Steam testify on October 8 about their platforms' alleged involvement in any online “radicalization” and the “incitement to commit politically motivated acts,” according to letters sent from the House committee to the four tech CEOs. 

In a statement, Rep. James Comer, chairman of the Oversight Committee, referenced the murder of Charlie Kirk and “other acts of politically motivated violence” as reasons why Congress has a “duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,” he said. 

“To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes.” 

TechCrunch reached out to the companies summoned.

Discord told TechCrunch it looked forward to testifying in October. 

“We continuously engage with policymakers on these critical issues and look forward to continuing this important dialogue next month,” a spokesperson said. 

Reddit, meanwhile, told Reuters it was investigating the link between its platform and Kirk's death, saying it hasn't yet seen proof that the suspect in Kirk's death was an active Reddit user. The company told the outlet that it “has strong policies against hateful content and content that incites, encourages, glorifies or calls for violence.”

Kirk was a prominent conservative activist and a close ally of President Trump. Suspect Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Utah resident, has been arrested for shooting and killing Kirk last week while Kirk spoke at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Robinson appeared to have confessed to committing the crime in a chat on Discord shortly before his arrest. The bullets used were also apparently engraved with memes and references to video games. 

This piece was updated to add a statement from Discord's spokesperson.

Sam Ross, the co-founder and CEO of Numeral, came up with the idea for his sales tax compliance startup while traveling the world after having worked as a product manager at Airbnb.

“This was early 2018, where you didn't have remote work like you do today,” he told TechCrunch in an interview. Direct-to-consumer businesses were a big trend then, so he supported his travel dreams by running several self-funded e-commerce brands from the road. He operated an online jewelry store and still maintains a vitamin DTC site.

While he loved the freedom his businesses offered, Ross (pictured above, left) was perpetually annoyed by the complex and bureaucratic process of handling sales tax on the merchandise he was selling.

Until 2018, e-commerce and SaaS (Software as a Service) companies didn't have to pay sales tax to states where they had customers, but no physical presence. But the Supreme Court ruled later that year that these businesses must collect taxes in the jurisdictions where their customers are located.

“All of a sudden, I went from having to deal with collecting tax on my customers in California, to all of a sudden dealing with 40 plus states,” Ross said. “That was painful.”

When Ross applied to startup accelerator Y Combinator in 2023, he was encouraged by partner Gustaf Alstromer—his former boss at Airbnb—to build a startup that automates every aspect of sales tax management.

On Thursday, Numeral announced that it raised $35 million in Series B funding, valuing the two-year-old company at $350 million. The round, which comes just six months after raising an $18 million Series A, was led by Mayfield, with participation from other investors including Benchmark, Uncork Capital, Y Combinator, and Mantis, the VC firm co-founded by the members of the electronic DJ group The Chainsmokers.

While there are many software products for managing sales tax on the market, Ross believed that AI can remove the complexities and serve clients as a human tax accountant would. That includes everything from keeping track of how tax laws are changing in over 11,000 jurisdictions to keeping track of tax-related mail and filing and paying tax on behalf of the client.

AI can handle most aspects of sales tax because most of the rules have no ambiguity, so the risk of hallucinations is low.

“But some of the laws are pretty crazy,” Ross said. “In New York, if you have a full bagel, it's tax exempt, but if you cut it in half, it is considered ready to eat, and it becomes taxable.” 

Numeral's AI is aware of thousands of such laws.

Over the last year, the startup has grown its revenue 3.5 times and now serves over 2,000 software and e-commerce clients, including EightSleep, Graza Olive Oil, and Manus.

While managing sales tax may seem niche, there are several startups trying to solve it. Competitors include Anrok, Zamp, and others. And a 26-year-old incumbent, Avalara, owned by Vista Equity Partners, is expected to go public later this year.

Ross says that Numeral's international offering differentiates it from its competitors.

“We're filing taxes for people in Tanzania and Kenya, in all these small markets where traditionally they would have had to use a CPA firm,” he said.

Google is making it possible to now share your Gemini Gems — custom AI assistants and experts designed for specific tasks — the company announced on Thursday. The feature launched last year, initially as part of the Gemini Advanced paid subscription, allowing users to write instructions to create an AI chatbot for different scenarios. For instance, Google launched with premade Gems like a learning coach, a brainstorming assistant, a career guide, a writing editor, and a coding partner.

Now, Google says you'll be able to share your Gems with friends, family, or coworkers as easily as you can share a file from Google Drive. 

This would make Gems more accessible to more people, as not everyone uses the advanced customization feature. It could also help prevent people from building the same Gems as others. For instance, if multiple coworkers were using a similar type of custom Gemini assistant, they could just share the same resource instead of each making their own version that could have slight inconsistencies between them. 

Google suggests Gem sharing could also be useful for people working on family vacation plans and guides, meal planners, or collaborative writing projects.

To share a Gem, you'll open the Gem manager on the web app and click the “Share” icon next to any Gem you've created. Also similar to Google Drive, you can control who can view and use your Gems and who's allowed to edit them.

After first rolling out to Gemini Advanced, Gemini Business, and Gemini Enterprise subscribers in over 150 countries, Google announced in March that Gems were now available to everyone and could support file uploads.

Why does every HN app re-implement bookmarks? Why can't they just save them to the HN website? Sure, you'd maybe need to fetch the static page from HN itself instead of using the API, and parse it for the favorite link to get the URL necessary, but it should be fairly simple regardless of whatever other changes are made (the link text is favorite, it's probably the first occurrence of a link with that text and has predictable URL format)

Many Republicans are blaming social media for the murder of MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk since it's been revealed the suspect engraved internet meme messages on the bullets and used Discord to allegedly confess to the killing. And now a high-profile congressman wants some of the executives from various tech platforms to testify about it all.

James Comer, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, released a statement Wednesday calling for the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit to testify at a committee hearing on October 8, 2025.

“The politically motivated assassination of Charlie Kirk claimed the life of a husband, father, and American patriot. In the wake of this tragedy, and amid other acts of politically motivated violence, Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,” Comer said in a statement published online.

“To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes.”

Discord told Gizmodo in a statement on Wednesday that its CEO would be testifying.

“We have received the Committee's invitation and welcome the opportunity to testify,” a spokesperson told Gizmodo. “We continuously engage with policymakers on these critical issues and look forward to continuing this important dialogue next month.”

Kirk was shot and killed Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, while doing one of his debate-style talks on campus. Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old from Utah, turned himself in to authorities late the next day after his parents reportedly recognized him from security footage released by the FBI.

The bullet cartridges found near the scene of the crime were found to have messages engraved, one of many signs that the suspect was plugged in to internet trolling culture.

The messages reportedly included:

Robinson also allegedly talked with friends on Discord, which is presumably why Comer wants to bring the CEO of the company in for a hearing. But it's unclear why he's also calling in executives who oversee companies like Twitch, Steam, and Reddit.

The shooter's exact politics have yet to be determined, but the indictment alleges Robinson said Kirk was full of “hate.” The indictment also suggests that Robinson's messages were just a way to perform as a troll rather than an attempt to make an earnest statement.

But that's not going to stop legislators from insisting that something about platforms like Discord is in some way responsible for Kirk's death, no matter how ridiculous that idea may be.

Reddit, Twitch, and Valve (the owner of Steam) didn't respond to questions emailed on Wednesday about whether their respective CEOs would be attending the hearing. Gizmodo will update this article when we hear back.

The full-screen Xbox experience is no longer exclusive.

Earlier this year, Microsoft and Asus announced the ROG Xbox Ally, an update to the first-gen ROG Ally, now adorned with Xbox branding. Along with the new name came new specs, but more importantly, the Xbox partnership wasn't just a token collaboration — rather, a deeply integrated experience finally meant to ""fix"" Windows on handheld devices. Hence, the ROG Xbox Ally would ship with a new full-screen Xbox app that it would boot into by default, superseding Windows 11 entirely. This was exclusive to the ROG Xbox Ally and was supposed to come to other handhelds later; however, it seems the opposite has happened.

The Verge's Tom Warren reports that the full-screen Xbox experience meant for ROG Xbox Ally devices has leaked early, and can now be installed on any handheld running Windows. The actual ROG Xbox Ally is set to launch next month, which means that everyone else will get to enjoy Microsoft's new handheld gaming mode before the very device that was set to debut it. There's a full guide on Reddit that breaks down how to install it, and it's relatively easy to follow as long as you know your way around Windows. If you have a regular Ally, Lenovo's Legion Go, or the myriad of PC handhelds out there, you should be eligible.

The only requirement for this to work is the 25H2 Windows 11 update, for which you need to be part of the Windows Insider program. The build resides in the Release Preview channel, so once you've got that going, there are a few registry edits you need to make if you don't see the ""Enter full-screen experience on start up"" toggle right away. After all is said and done, a restart should boot you directly into the new Xbox experience, where all your favorite games should be consolidated into one place — including stores like Steam, Epic Games, and Battle.net.

The full-screen handheld mode is still based on Windows 11, just running without any of the extra stuff that hogs up resources in the background. It should use less memory, and the UI should be a lot more handheld-friendly. Windows Central tested the update on an original ROG Ally and saw marked improvements across the board in terms of performance—going from 29 FPS in Shadow of the Tomb Raider to 38 FPS—and even an extra hour gained in battery life. These upgrades mostly come courtesy of disabling unnecessary background processing and startup apps, not some significant underlying change to the Windows kernel itself.

It's important to note that you're not locked into the full-screen experience either; the ability to Alt-Tab out of apps and go into the regular desktop environment is still there. That being said, Microsoft itself recommends using mouse and keyboard for that since it's not designed for handhelds.

Single-dose benzathine penicillin G was as effective as three weekly doses in achieving a 6-month serologic response among patients with early syphilis — including those with HIV — while simplifying treatment and reducing the burden of multiple injections and clinic visits.

“The elimination of unnecessary doses of benzathine penicillin G reduces the cost of treatment, aligns with the principles of antimicrobial stewardship, and is more convenient for patients in that the numbers of clinic visits and painful intramuscular injections are decreased,” the authors wrote.

“The findings from this trial should provide reassurance to clinicians, particularly those caring for patients with HIV infection, that a single dose of benzathine penicillin G is sufficient to treat early syphilis,” the authors of a linked editorial added.

The study was led by Edward W. Hook III, MD, The University of Alabama at Birmingham. It was published online on September 3, 2025, in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The number of female participants was notably low. The study excluded people with latent syphilis of unknown duration, which represents a significant patient population. Additionally, the trial produced limited data on people with advanced or untreated HIV infection.

The study was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Sexually Transmitted Infections Clinical Trials Group. One of the authors disclosed being employed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Some authors reported receiving financial aid from and having other ties with companies including Entasis, Hologic Inc., Cepheid, and Mayne Pharma Inc.

Once a rare phenomenon, the consumption of nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, has increased in France, raising public health concerns and prompting medical and legal measures.

Medically, nitrous oxide is used for anaesthesia and pain relief and as a propellant in aerosol products in the food industry (eg, whipping cream propellant).

“Since the 2000s, the Observatoire français des drogues et des tendances addictives (OFDT) and its monitoring system for emerging drug trends (TREND) have reported recreational use of nitrous oxide, which produces brief euphoric effects. Users typically release the gas from food-grade cartridges, such as those used for whipped cream, into a balloon and inhale it,” the OFDT said.

The sale of nitrous oxide has been widespread in France since 2017 and is available in local shops, bars, and nightclubs. In 2019, online platforms began offering canisters of up to 600 g, enough for approximately 80 balloons, or bottles weighing up to 15 kg, allowing 1000-2000 balloons to be produced.

Since 2020, nitrous oxide resale has been linked to drug trafficking networks. “A quantity of 7 tons of nitrous oxide with a market value of 2.7 million euros was seized by law enforcement in Seine-et-Marne, Île-de-France, France, in December 2021,” the OFDT said.

It is accessible and inexpensive and is primarily used by adolescents and students. According to the national survey in 2021 on health and substance use in middle and high schools in France (EnCLASS), 5.5% of 9th grade students reported consuming nitrous oxide.

A 2023 European survey on recreational psychoactive substances (EROPP) found that 6.7% of adults aged 18-64 years had used nitrous oxide at least once.

According to the OFDT, the mechanism of action is not fully understood; the acute effects include reduced pain, euphoria, reduced anxiety, sensory illusions, and altered consciousness, which subside within minutes.

According to Santé Publique France, repeated and prolonged use of nitrous oxide can lead to dependence and serious complications. These include neurologic disorders, such as numbness, muscle weakness, severe nerve pain, coordination problems, and urinary symptoms; cardiovascular issues, including blood clot formation; and psychiatric problems, such as hallucinations, delusional episodes, and mood disorders.

As nitrous oxide use has increased, severe cases have become more frequent. The Centre d'Addictovigilance de Lille (CEIP-A Lille, Addictovigilance Centre) in Lille, France, reported 17 serious cases in 2017, which increased to 81 in 2022, all requiring hospitalisation.

In 2024, the Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL) in Lyon, France, launched a teleconsultation service specifically for individuals misusing nitrous oxide. Christophe Riou, MD, an addiction specialist at HCL, explained, “Because the sale of nitrous oxide is legal and its euphoric effects are brief, many users believe it is harmless. However, it can be addictive, activating pleasure receptors, creating emotional dependence, and being neurotoxic. Excessive use can cause serious, irreversible neurological damage, including limb paralysis. Early symptoms, often mild tingling in the arms or legs, are frequently overlooked; therefore, many patients, mostly young people, seek help only when the damage is severe. Teleconsultation allows us to intervene at the subclinical stage.”

The service offers four appointment slots every Tuesday afternoon, with follow-up care that may include drug treatment, monitoring, or hospitalisation.

In June 2021, France enacted Law No. 2021-695, aimed at curbing the misuse of nitrous oxide. This legislation prohibits the sale or distribution of nitrous oxide to minors and imposes a €15,000 fine on anyone found guilty of encouraging a minor to misuse the substance because of its psychoactive effect.

It also restricts sales in certain venues, including bars, nightclubs, and temporary drinking establishments, such as fairs, public festivals, and tobacco shops. The law allows limits on the quantity of nitrous oxide that can be sold to individuals and bans the sale and distribution of accessories that facilitate its consumption, such as “crackers” or balloons intended for this purpose.

In response to rising concerns over recreational nitrous oxide use, several cities in northern France have issued local legal orders to restrict it. Roubaix and Lille, both in Hauts-de-France, France, for example, ban the possession, use, transfer, and resale of nitrous oxide in public spaces, regardless of packaging. Other French cities have introduced similar rules to curb misuse.

The French National Assembly passed a bill to restrict the sale of nitrous oxide to professionals and strengthen the prevention of its misuse. The text has since been referred to the Senate for consideration.

Article 1 bans the sale of nitrous oxide to consumers, both in shops and online, in France. Article 2 would strengthen coordination between the Interministerial Mission for the Fight Against Drugs and Addictive Behaviours and Regional Health Agencies to monitor misuse, publish reports, and run prevention programs. Article 3 includes prevention measures in schools, and Article 4 calls for an evaluation report of the said law.

The French Senate approved a bill pending review by the National Assembly. It would make nitrous oxide misuse illegal, increase penalties for selling to minors, require licences for sales, ban sales at night, and fine people who leave any form of nitrous oxide containers in public areas.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Here's my advice on the best way to draft the perfect thank-you email. 

After residency or medical school interviews, you are going to send a thank-you email to everybody that you encountered that day. That's going to include the program director and anyone who interviewed you. I also email the program administrators — the people who set up the whole interview day — a thank you as well, because that is not an easy task.

This is what I do to make sure the thank you is concise, but it gets to the point and jogs their memory about how great of an interview you had together. 

Number one, make it personal. Give a little touch of what you talked about in the interview, about how you maybe grew up in the same state, you both like the same food, or have the same hobby. Throw that in there so it can spark their memory of what you talked about. 

Then — this is almost my best piece of advice — under where you say, “Best,” and then your name, you are going to include your AAMC residency interview picture. This way, they can put a face to the name, and they can be like, ""Oh yes — I remember Kaitlin. She looked like this andwe talked about this."" 

To make it even easier, you are also going to include your application ID number under that signature so they can easily refer to your file and see what credentials you have. 

I hope this helps. Those are my three best tips to drafting the perfect thank you.

Research led by The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and College of Medicine explores the ways brain cells communicate, revealing fresh insight into the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

A multidisciplinary team used advanced imaging and computational modeling to analyze the ""crosstalk"" between neurons and their supporting glial cells in the human brain. This approach highlights the brain's interconnected cellular network.

""By mapping these cell interactions at the molecular level, we identified key pathways that could be pivotal in both the onset and progression of neurodegeneration,"" said study co-author Oscar Harari, PhD, director of the Division of Neurogenetics and director of the Center for Neurobiology of Aging and Resiliency at The Ohio State University Neuroscience Research Institute.

Study findings are published in Science Translational Medicine.

""This insight is critical for developing effective treatments, as 'cellular crosstalk' may serve as an attractive molecular target for drug development. Many of these cell-to-cell communication pathways include proteins at the cell membrane, which are often regarded as promising targets for therapeutic intervention,"" said Harari, who is also the Helen C. Kurtz Associate Professor of Neurology at Ohio State.

Harari, who joined Ohio State in early 2024, completed the manuscript for the research he started while at the Washington University School of Medicine. He collaborated equally with study co-author Tae-Wan Kim, PhD, associate professor of Pathology and Cell Biology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York.

Our research shows that Alzheimer's is not only driven by plaques and tangles, but also by a breakdown in communication between brain cells. By uncovering the SEMA6D–TREM2 crosstalk pathway, we reveal a new way to enhance the amyloid-clearing functions of microglia and potentially slow Alzheimer's progression.""

Tae-Wan Kim, PhD, associate professor of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York

The study included investigators from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, as well as collaborators from Australia, South Korea, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Indiana University School of Medicine, and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network.

The Massage Therapy Foundation (MTF) announces the award of a research grant to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The grant will support a three-year study entitled Myofascial Release Therapy in Irritable Bowel Syndrome led by Primary Investigators Maria Mascarenhas, MBBS and Alain J. Benitez, MD, MSTR.

The study aims to evaluate the impact of abdominal myofascial release (MFR)-a gentle, manual therapy-on symptom relief, quality of life, and bowel function in adolescents with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C). This randomized controlled study pairs MFR with a novel, non-invasive Wireless Patch System to objectively measure gastrointestinal activity. By integrating patient-reported outcomes with real-time physiological data, the study aims to uncover both therapeutic benefits and underlying mechanisms of MFR. Findings could pave the way for safer, developmentally appropriate treatments for pediatric irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and establish new standards for non-invasive motility assessment. 

We're excited to explore how massage helps children and adolescents with IBS and to better understand how it works in the body. This research can help make massage a regular part of care, not just a nice addition to the care plan. It will support efforts to get insurance to cover the service, so more families can access the option.""

Maria Mascarehhas, MBBS, pediatric gastroenterologist and Medical Director of the Integrative Health Program at CHOP

""This study exemplifies the power of interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together researchers and skilled massage therapists to co-develop and deliver a practice-informed intervention for pediatric IBS-C. We're proud to support research that not only advances scientific understanding but also honors the expertise of massage therapy professionals in creating meaningful, patient-centered care,"" said Kim Kane-Santos, MTF President.

Funds for this groundbreaking research project were provided by the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA), in alignment with their shared mission with MTF to advance the art, science, and practice of massage therapy.

""We are proud to support this groundbreaking research exploring myofascial release therapy for pediatric IBS-C. By combining manual therapy with innovative, non-invasive monitoring, this study exemplifies the kind of integrative, evidence-based care that can transform lives and advance the massage therapy profession,"" said Cindy E. Farrar, AMTA National President.

Women suffering from long COVID have a greater risk of experiencing abnormal uterine bleeding. The symptoms of the illness intensify during the perimenstrual and proliferative phases of the menstrual cycle, notably fatigue, headaches, and muscle pain. This bidirectional relationship between long COVID and menstrual disorders has been revealed by a French-British research team co-led by a CNRS researcher. An inflammatory reaction is suspected of being behind this connection, after the discovery of an immune cell cluster in the endometrium of the patients receiving treatment. No abnormalities were detected in relation to ovarian hormones.

These conclusions, which were just published in Nature Communications, are based on a combination of three approaches: a study conducted among 12,187 British women; follow-up care for 54 women suffering from long COVID for three months; and analysis of blood and endometrial samples.

As long COVID affects 3-7% of the world's population, and is twice as prevalent among women than men, this novel study paves the way for new therapeutic prospects. It also underscores the importance of considering the menstrual cycle in long COVID biomarkers, as well as the need to develop therapies specifically adapted to women.

PSG Reaffirms Dominance in Ligue 1 Ahead of Clásico Against Marseille


Paris Saint-Germain has returned to the top of the Ligue 1 table, once again confirming its supremacy in French football. The reigning champions are not only defending their domestic crown but also cemented their status as the latest UEFA Champions League winners, joining Olympique de Marseille as the only French clubs to conquer Europe's most prestigious trophy.





In the last French Clásico, played in March 2025, PSG defeated Marseille 3-1 at the Parc des Princes. That victory not only widened the gap between the two teams but also reinforced Paris' hegemony in the modern era, driven by young stars and a dynamic playing style. Months later, the club lifted the Champions League trophy.


PSG vs. Marseille: A Clash Steeped in History and Pride


This Sunday, September 21, PSG will face Marseille again in one of the most anticipated matches of the season. The last time Marseille managed to come out on top was in February 2023 in the Coupe de France. Can they repeat the feat now in Ligue 1?

The PSG vs. Marseille Clásico is more than just a football match: it's a rivalry that pits the North against the South, Paris' elite against Marseille's working class, with national pride and prestige on the line.

Where to Watch the PSG vs. Marseille Clásico

Every French Clásico is unforgettable, and this one will be no exception. The PSG vs. Olympique de Marseille match can be watched live this Sunday, September 21, at 2:45 PM ET / 11:45 AM PT on beIN Sports and beIN Sports en Español.

Spain and Lamine Yamal took top spot from Argentina and Lionel Messi in the FIFA men's rankings published on Thursday, and lead for the first time since being dethroned as world champion in June 2014.

Spain's two-win start to a 2026 World Cup qualifying group this month — against Turkey and Bulgaria — lifted the European champion up from second place behind 2022 World Cup winner Argentina, which fell to third.

Argentina's loss in a World Cup qualifier in Ecuador also let France rise one place to No. 2.

England stayed at No. 4, and Portugal climbed one place to No. 5 in a swap with Brazil, which lost a game at Bolivia.

Morocco at No. 11 was the best of the African nations and Japan led Asia at No. 19. Both have already qualified for the World Cup.

Mexico and the United States were Nos. 14 and 16 respectively as the World Cup co-hosts both fell one place. Canada, the third co-host next year, rose two to No. 26.

The rankings are updated in October and again in November when the standings are more significant.

The November rankings should decide seedings for the 48-team World Cup tournament draw being held on Dec. 5 in Washington, plus draws for playoffs in Europe and the intercontinental brackets. Those games are scheduled in March.

The World Cup draw will have 42 confirmed entries and six placeholders for the eventual playoff winners. Those placeholders all must come from the lowest-ranked teams in seeding pot 4 and could include Italy.

FIFA have made a major announcement regarding Spain after the country threatened to boycott the World Cup in 2026.

The global governing body today released the updated world rankings for the men's national teams, with Spain rising to the top spot.

Luis de la Fuente's side impressed in recent World Cup qualifiers, beating Bulgaria, before thrashing Turkey 6-0. The EURO 2024 winners have been awarded with the recognition of currently being the best team in the world.

Argentina, who previously held the top sport, dropped to third following a recent defeat to Ecuador. Despite the setback, the World Cup winners have dominated South American qualifying, as they prepare for Lionel Messi's final international tournament next summer.

Advert

France have also climbed the rankings, moving from third to second and Didier Deschamps' side will once again be among the favourites for the tournament. England, who boast a perfect qualifying record after five games, remain the fourth in the rankings.

Spanish government officials warned they would pull out of next summer's World Cup if Israel qualify for the tournament.

Advert

Israel are currently third in their group with nine points from five games, behind Norway and Italy. With trips to both Norway and Italy in October, they still may finish second and potentially secure a play-off spot depending on results.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called for Israel to be excluded from sporting competitions.

He said: ""Israel cannot continue to use any international platform to whitewash its image.""

A recent UN commission of inquiry said there are grounds to believe that four of five genocidal acts under international law, have been carried out by Israel in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry responded by rejecting the report, describing it as 'distorted and false'.

Advert

More than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Many within the sporting world have called for Israel to face a ban from international football, in a similar manner to Russia.Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, both UEFA and FIFA suspended the national team and Russian clubs from competitions.

Advert

Russia appealed against the ban, but it was dismissed.

Their last appearance at a global competition was the 2018 World Cup, as they were barred from the 2022 World Cup and next summer's tournament. UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin has spoken about the ongoing ban, expressing sympathy for the athletes.

He said: ""The ban for Russian teams is, I think, three and a half years. Did the war stop? It didn't. So for now, I don't know.

""I have to say that with the situation in Russia and Ukraine, there was a super strong political pressure.

Advert

""Now it's more a pressure of the civil society than politicians, because politicians are obviously, when it comes to wars and victims, very pragmatic.

""I cannot say what will happen. There are talks about everything, but me personally, I'm against kicking the athletes out.""","{'href': 'https://www.sportbible.com', 'title': 'SPORTbible'}","soccer"

When the Missouri legislature allocated $50 million toward FIFA World Cup 26 efforts in May 2023, the bulk — $42.5 million — was earmarked to help get GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium ready.

With two of five phases now complete, KSHB 41 has obtained documents that detail the money has been spent so far — more than $19.6 million — and what work remains.

During the second phase of the project, which was completed between Chiefs seasons, the club removed 3,000 seats along the visiting sideline and replaced them with modular, removable seating.

RELATED | How seating changes at Arrowhead could make Chiefs games even louder

The changes are necessary to accommodate the wider and perfectly leveled playing surface FIFA requires for next summer's six World Cup games, including two knockout games.

According to invoices submitted for the project, most of the taxpayer money paid out so far went to general contractor Turner Construction, which has received more than $17.1 million through the Sept. 16 batch of receipts.

Populous, a world-renowned Kansas City-based architecture firm, has received more than $1.73 million so far and serves as the construction administrator for renovation.

But that leaves another $23.5 million earmarked for the final three phases.

After the 2025 Chiefs season ends, the temporary seats in place for football season will be taken out again and work will begin on the field, which will impact the schedule once again at Arrowhead.

“The quality of the playing surface is of the highest priority,” Chiefs Executive Vice President of Operations and Events Matt Kenny said. “We'll need enough time to do that, which means no concerts during next summer. … We'll also raise, as opposed to lower (the playing surface), so that crown, as we call it, in the center of the pitch, the football field, will actually go away because you raised the sides.”

Kansas City Stadium — as the unbranded Arrowhead will be known during the World Cup — also has to be stripped of current branding.

“They are required to provide what FIFA calls a clean site,” KC2026 CEO Pam Kramer said. “Any commercial branding that is not a FIFA commercial partner will need to be covered for the World Cup inside the stadium, so they (the Chiefs) are working with FIFA right now on those — understanding and developing the clean-site look, and what the details of that will be.”

It's a huge undertaking.

“FIFA and their subcontractors will come in and do a number of things related to media, broadcasting, signage and things of that nature,” Kenny said.

Kramer added, “How much signage is at Arrowhead, right? It's just one of the requirements that FIFA has for all host cities — not just Arrowhead, but all host cities — in delivering that stadium.”

After the final World Cup match in Kansas City, a quarterfinal on July 11, the Chiefs must revert all the branding, re-install the modular seats and restore the crown, or midfield hump that assists with drainage, before another NFL season gets rolling.

“That's a tight window for all the activity, because not not only do I have to prepare the pitch, you have to sort of unravel all of the FIFA elements that come through, but we're working with them and their subcontractors on that schedule,” Kenny said.

FIFA is aware that the Chiefs and other NFL teams need to be able to host preseason games within a few weeks of the soccer tournament ending.

“We'll hit the mark,” Kenny said.

The final phase of taxpayer-funded construction comes after the 2026 season, when the Chiefs remove the modular seats again and rebuild permanent concrete seating all over again.

KC2026, the nonprofit formed to deliver on the contractual obligations between the city and FIFA, received the other $7.5 million from the state legislature's allocation two and a half years ago.

Kindly share this story:

The world's football governing body, FIFA, has officially opened disciplinary actions against South Africa for fielding an ineligible player, Teboho Mokoena, during a 2026 World Cup qualifying match against Lesotho in March, PUNCH Online reports.
South African outlet, SABC Sport, reports that FIFA has levelled charges against the South African Football Association and Mokoena.
The report stated, “In a letter to SAFA dated September 15, 2025 – seen by the public broadcaster, FIFA confirmed that both the player and the association face charges of breaching several disciplinary regulations, including the fielding of an ineligible player.
“The case has been referred to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, with SAFA and Mokoena given six days to submit their response.” 






Bafana Bafana are facing charges after fielding Mokoena, who was ineligible to play in March's 2026 World Cup qualifier against Lesotho.
The 28-year-old midfielder had accumulated two yellow cards earlier in the qualifiers – first against Benin in November 2023 and then against Zimbabwe in June 2024 – which, under FIFA rules, triggered a one-match ban.

South Africa currently lead Group C with 17 points, but a potential deduction will see them level on points with the Benin Republic (14) and also reduce the gap between them and Nigeria to three points, leaving the chances of picking the automatic ticket open with two games to go.
Lesotho, meanwhile, will find their tally bumped up from six points to nine, but will remain in fifth position, two points behind third-placed Nigeria and fourth-placed Rwanda on 11 points each.
South Africa will face Zimbabwe and Rwanda in their final two qualifiers in October.
Meanwhile, Nigeria will face Lesotho (away) and the Benin Republic (home), with the hope that South Africa slip up in either or both of their fixtures.

Lesotho, meanwhile, will find their tally bumped up from six points to nine, but will remain in fifth position, two points behind third-placed Nigeria and fourth-placed Rwanda on 11 points each.
South Africa will face Zimbabwe and Rwanda in their final two qualifiers in October.
Meanwhile, Nigeria will face Lesotho (away) and the Benin Republic (home), with the hope that South Africa slip up in either or both of their fixtures.
FIFA has recently punished Equatorial Guinea for also fielding an ineligible player, Emilio Nsue, during the qualifiers, and the decision was upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sports.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

McLaren's Norris 'reasonably confident' of 'another good weekend' as constructors' title beckons

Oscar Piastri is satisfied that all parties are aligned on the racing guidelines at McLaren, after a post-Monza discussion on 'papaya rules'...

Oscar Piastri has voiced his “trust” in McLaren's handling of the battle for the Formula 1 Drivers' title, after being ordered to allow team mate Lando Norris past at Monza.

McLaren sparked debate at the Italian Grand Prix when instructing Piastri to allow his title rival past for second place following a slow pit stop for Norris – this after the latter had suggested Piastri stopped first to prevent an unlikely undercut from Charles Leclerc.

Prior to this weekend's Azerbaijan Grand Prix, McLaren discussed their ‘papaya rules' – the team's code for their rules of engagement on track – with both drivers said to be “aligned” on racing scenarios going forward.

“Naturally, there have been thoughts, yes,” said Piastri. “We've had good discussions with the team.

“Obviously, it's a highly talked about moment, but we've had a lot of discussions, have clarified a lot of things, and we know how we're going to go racing going forward, which is the most important thing. What's happened is done, and I'm excited to go racing here.”

To this point, McLaren have maintained a focus on sealing the Teams' Championship for a second year running, an achievement which could be sealed this weekend with a record-breaking seven events to go.

Pressed on whether he expects less interference from the pit wall after this consideration is out of the way, Piastri added: “Not necessarily because of the Constructors' Championship.

“But I think we've had a lot of discussions about how we want to go racing and a lot of that is to stay for us, because ultimately, if we give out that information, then we become very easy targets to pick off because everyone knows what we're going to do. That's all very aligned with all of us, but stays in-house.”

While unwilling to detail wider scenarios, points-leader Piastri did confirm an expectation that papaya rules would be invoked should the McLaren pairing find themselves in “exactly the same scenario”.

Conceding a belief that he didn't deserve to finish higher than third given his pace across the weekend, Piastri had an element of sympathy for his team, highlighting how the on-track scenario put McLaren between a rock and a hard place.

“If we had of done the opposite thing, then you'd have had the opposite half of the fans saying that it was wrong. Ultimately, there's no correct decision in that,” he said.

“Am I surprised? Not really. Obviously, it's a big moment from the race and I feel like a lot of fans are quite quick to jump on things that are deemed controversial. I'm not that surprised, but I do think that we have enough freedom to control our own destiny in the championship.”

Offering his take on the situation later in the day, and whether there have been any discussions regarding what would happen in a decisive championship situation, Norris added: “We discuss all of these things. It's not something we need to finalise now. Of course, it was a talking point. It was all we ever heard from every person doing our interviews [at Monza].

“It's something that was brought up, it's something we all spoke about as a team, we all have a very good understanding of, and all accept it. We're happy. We'll continue working the way we want, and that's what we need to do.”

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

McLaren's Norris 'reasonably confident' of 'another good weekend' as constructors' title beckons

Valtteri Bottas was linked to a seat at Alpine before signing for Cadillac.

Flavio Briatore says there was “never really a discussion” around Valtteri Bottas racing for Alpine in the future, following confirmation of the Finn's deal with new F1 team Cadillac.

Alpine are one of four outfits – alongside Red Bull, Mercedes and Racing Bulls – yet to confirm their full 2026 driver line-ups, with Pierre Gasly recently signing a contract extension but no word yet on who his team mate will be next year or beyond.

Given Franco Colapinto's challenges since replacing Jack Doohan earlier in the season, two drivers who had been linked to Alpine were current Mercedes reserve Bottas, and Sergio Perez – both left without seats at the end of last year.

However, while he admitted to speaking with “a lot of people” over the summer, Alpine Executive Advisor Briatore has insisted that the multiple race winners were never seriously in the frame for a seat at his squad.

Asked if he saw Bottas and Perez as options, before the pair signed for Cadillac, Briatore replied: “No, really. I talked with a lot of people. I talked with Bottas. We talked with Toto [Wolff, Mercedes boss] as well at the time. But really, there was never a discussion for Bottas to drive for Alpine.

“I think Alpine helped Bottas a little bit to sign the contract with Cadillac. We did some marketing. I like Valtteri because he's a super driver. He was unlucky to be in Mercedes at the same time as Lewis [Hamilton], when Lewis was really at the peak of his driving.

“We have a different idea, but it's nice to have Valtteri back. It's nice to have a driver back with a lot of experience, but I'm looking for something else.”

Briatore, speaking in the team bosses' press conference at the Dutch Grand Prix, also shared his thoughts on Colapinto's future – and what he needs to see from the Argentinian youngster if he is to secure his place beyond 2025.

“I think I see everything already,” said Briatore. “I don't need to see anything anymore. It's difficult. For this driver, it's very difficult to cope with this car. These cars are very, very heavy, very quick.

“For a young driver to [be] put in F1, maybe it was not the timing to have Franco in F1. Maybe he needs another year or two to be part of F1. I know that, in the end, what is important is the result.

“Franco tries very hard. He tries very hard with the engineers to please them in everything, but it's not what I expect from Colapinto.”

That said, Briatore went on to praise Colapinto for delivering “probably his strongest” race of the season at Zandvoort, after the F2 race winner narrowly missed out on a points finish.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

McLaren's Norris 'reasonably confident' of 'another good weekend' as constructors' title beckons

Heading to the Azerbaijan Grand Prix? Make the most of the weekend with running, cycling, and outdoor workout routes in and around Baku. From sunrise on the seafront to breathtaking natural phenomena, there's something for every ability and a perfect diversion from the action on track.

Baku welcomes Formula 1 with open arms as the Azeri capital on the shores of the Caspain Sea becomes the epicentre of the motorsport world this weekend. Fans come in droves from all corners of the world to watch the drama unfold in Baku – but how do you make the most of your time outside of the racing action?

With many only in the city for a long weekend, it can often feel like there's little opportunity to properly explore. That's exactly why running and cycling are such good options, especially out of town, where you can surround yourself with the region's unique landscapes, and experience more of Baku than just the route from the hotel to the grandstands.

That's why we've put together this guide. Whether you're a casual jogger, a weekend rider, or a seasoned endurance athlete, there are routes here to suit every ability and every ounce of spare time.

Baku Boulevard (seaside promenade)

Why do it? The city's most iconic run: flat, breezy, and perfect for a morning shakeout before the racing starts. Sunrise over the Caspian is easily worth the early alarm.

Highland Park and Flame Towers stairs

Why do it? A short but intense workout. You'll test your legs on the stairs while soaking in stunning panoramic views of Baku and the circuit below.

Old City (Icherisheher) loop

Why do it? It feels like you're running through history, with medieval walls, caravanserais (inns), and mosques that make this more than just exercise.

Absheron National Park trail run

Why do it? A chance to leave the city behind and run through wild stepped landscapes – with the bonus of spotting gazelles, Caspian seals, or migratory birds.

Baku Boulevard ride

Why do it? It's gentle, scenic, and stress-free, so the ideal active recovery ride ahead of busy track days.

Ateshgah Fire Temple and Yanar Dag ride

Why do it? A cultural and physical workout: combine a big ride with two of Azerbaijan's most unique natural and historic sites.

Gobustan Rock art ride

Why do it? For any adventurous cyclists, this is a perfect mix of endurance and exploration, with ancient carvings, mud volcanoes, and sweeping Caspian views.

If running and cycling isn't your thing and you'd rather keep things short and sharp, here are some locations for an outdoor workout in Baku:

Baku Boulevard has plenty of open space for bodyweight circuits (such as lunges, push-ups, sprints)

Highland Park doubles as a stair workout spot

Local parks such as Zabitlər Parkı and Dədə Qorqud Parkı offer green space and trails if you want a low-key workout away from the crowds

Late September in Azerbaijan is warm but can be variable. In Baku itself, daytime highs often sit between 24-28°C, with cooler evenings around 18-20°C thanks to the breeze off the Caspian Sea. Out on the Absheron Peninsula, it can feel hotter and more exposed due to minimal shade, while in the Caucasus foothills around Sheki or Qabala, expect fresher mountain air and even cooler nights.

The best time to train is early mornings (before 9am) or evenings (after 6pm), as they will be the most comfortable for runs and rides.

Hydration will be crucial – make sure to carry water or plan routes with refill points. Baku Boulevard has plenty of kiosks, but outside the city you'll need to stock up in advance.

Sun protection will be required – sunscreen, sunglasses, and a cap are essential on exposed routes like Absheron or Gobustan.

Advised clothing includes lightweight, breathable kit – as it is best for the city – but pack an extra layer if venturing into higher terrain near the Caucasus. Consider bringing trail shoes if you want to explore Gobustan or Absheron, where sandy and rocky paths dominate.

Transport: Central Baku is walkable, but for routes further afield (Absheron, Gobustan, Sheki), taxis, trains, or day tours are the most practical way to access start points.

The FCC chair's latest comments come after he condemned 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' for remarks made about the Charlie Kirk shooter. Jimmy Kimmel's show was later ""indefinitely"" suspended by ABC.



		By Carly Thomas, Alex Weprin 

	September 18, 2025 1:14pm	




Brendan Carr, the Federal Communications Commission chair, is now turning his attention to The View.


	This comes after he threatened Jimmy Kimmel Live! for the host's remarks about the Charlie Kirk shooter on Monday night's show, which ultimately led to Jimmy Kimmel's show being “indefinitely” suspended by ABC.




	Carr went on The Scott Jennings Radio Show on Thursday, where he suggested that he may look into The View.

	While The View was created by the legendary journalist Barbara Walters, it is primarily a panel talk show, albeit one that tackles current events.

					'The View' Panel Oddly Silent About 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' Being Pulled by ABC		
			









	“When you look at these other TV shows, what's interesting is the FCC does have a rule called the equal opportunity rule,” he said. “But there's an exception to that rule called the bona fide news exception, which means if you are a bona fide news program, you don't have to abide by the equal opportunity rule.”


	Carr continued, “And over the years, the FCC has developed a body of case law on that and has suggested that most of these late night shows, other than SNL, are bona fide news programs. And potentially I would assume you can make the argument that The View is a bona fide news show, but I'm not so sure about that, and I think it's worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether The View and some of the programs that you have still qualify as bona fide news programs and therefore exempt from the equal opportunity regime that Congress has put in place.”

	











	At issue is whether The View, which is produced by ABC News, qualifies as a bona fide news program and is thus exempt from certain FCC rules, including the equal opportunity or equal time rule.


	If a candidate for office receives time on a broadcast that is deemed to be applicable to the rule, the network must give their opponents the opportunity to appear on the network for a similar amount of time. It is worth noting that the rule “does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate,” per FCC regulations, but rather comparable time and placement.


	Last year, for example, Vice President Kamala Harris appeared in a sketch on Saturday Night Live. She was only on air for 90 seconds, but NBC proactively reached out to the Trump campaign and gave him a similar amount of time during a NASCAR race and an NFL game.


	Carr had called out the appearance as a potential violation of the rule.


	While The View has frequently hosted guests of all political persuasions over the years, it was a favored stop by former President Biden. It was his first TV interview after leaving office.


	If the FCC does determine that The View or late night talk shows are not exempt under FCC equal time rules, the networks would need to provide equal time for all political candidates during elections, which could prove onerous.

""Sony Music Group and Spotify have long been mutually committed to advancing music streaming and growing the marketplace for all,"" Sony Music Group chairman Rob Stringer said.

Music Editor


Spotify and Sony Music Group have reached an agreement for new multiyear global licensing deals in recorded music and publishing, the companies announced Wednesday.


	The companies didn't disclose specifics on the deals but said the agreements means “songwriters share more directly in the growth of streaming.”




	“Sony Music Group and Spotify have long been mutually committed to advancing music streaming and growing the marketplace for all,” Sony Music Group chairman Rob Stringer said in a statement. “This is further reflected in our new agreements where we're working to develop futuristic approaches that ensure our artists and songwriters remain appropriately compensated for their work, and audiences are getting a high-quality experience that's ever evolving.”

	With Sony secured, Spotify has officially reached new agreements with all three of the major music companies, after announcing new deals with Universal Music Group back in January and Warner Music Group a month later.

	For the first time, Spotify now holds direct licensing agreements with all three major music publishers, a notable development after the streaming company caught major heat in the industry last year over Spotify's controversial audiobook bundling strategy that led to lower payments to publishers and songwriters. The Mechanical Licensing Collective sued over that move, though Spotify won as the suit was dismissed earlier this year. 

	











	“Our partnership with Sony is built on a shared drive to shape the future of music,” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said in a statement. “Together, we're accelerating the pace of innovation to create powerful new opportunities and increasing revenue for artists and songwriters. These agreements aren't just a milestone; they're a catalyst for building a more dynamic and prosperous music ecosystem for everyone.”

""Knowing all of my music is in the hands of my long-time label team makes this a full-circle moment,"" the country star says.

	Marc Schneider


Industry News Editor


Country superstar Jason Aldean is feeling right at home at BMG. The company announced on Thursday that it has acquired the recorded music catalog encompassing Aldean's first big batch of chart-topping albums, along with publishing and recorded rights from a diverse group of nearly two dozen other artists and songwriters, totaling over 1,000 songs across multiple genres.


	The deal brings Aldean's full discography back under BMG's umbrella, following its 2017 acquisition of BBR Music Group, which originally released Aldean's music through its Broken Bow Records imprint. This acquisition spans nine studio albums, from Aldean's platinum-certified self-titled debut in 2005 to 2019's aptly-titled 9, four of which reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200. BMG continued to release Aldean's subsequent albums, including Macon, Georgia (2021–2022) and Highway Desperado (2023), which featured the Hot 100-topping hit “Try That In a Small Town.” In April, Aldean celebrated his 40th top 10 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart with “Whiskey Drink.”


	Aldean had previously signed a distribution and marketing deal with BMG in 2019, expanding the company's rights beyond the U.S. and Canada. This new acquisition ensures BMG controls the full scope of Aldean's recorded output and neighboring rights (the public performance rights associated with a sound recording).




			Trending on Billboard		







	BMG said the multi-layered acquisition is its largest catalog investment to date and part of broader investment strategy under parent company Bertelsmann's Boost program, which has surpassed $1.5 billion in music rights investments since 2021. Financial details and the seller were not disclosed.


	BMG CEO Thomas Coesfeld called the deal a “landmark” moment that “sets a new level of catalog acquisitions” at the company. “By bringing together the iconic catalog of Jason Aldean, we are strengthening our footprint in country music while expanding across genres and deepening our investment in the U.S.,” he said. “This move highlights our ability to maximize the value of music rights and represents a powerful step in BMG's strategy to be the most effective, artist-first music company in the world.”


	Aldean said he was proud of the deal, noting the long-standing support from BBR and BMG. “Knowing all of my music is in the hands of my long-time label team makes this a full-circle moment,” he said.


Jon Loba, president of Frontline Recordings in the Americas, praised Aldean's impact on country music, crediting his debut album with helping define the genre's sound and adding that “while his signature style has remained a common thread across every release, Jason has consistently pushed the envelope both sonically and lyrically.”

The Billboard interview comes as ""Golden"" spends its fifth week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	It's fair to say that the world has never seen anything quite like KPop Demon Hunters, which has absolutely captivated audiences — to the point that fictional band HUNTR/X is now making very real moves in the music industry. Its single “Golden,” for instance, has spent five weeks so far at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the first female K-pop group to reach the chart's summit.

	











	That said, the imaginary trio also has some very real musical influences that informed its look and sound — and in a conversation with Billboard over noodles, the singing voices behind HUNTR/X spoke about some of their personal favorite K-pop acts. EJAE, who portrays Rumi in the KPop Demon Hunters musical numbers, begins, “I like the OG generation, so, like, G.O.D, shout-out.”


	“H.O.T, S.E.S, like, they are the reasons why I fell in love with K-pop,” she continues. “And like, aespa, BLACKPINK, BTS, TWICE.”


	“I'm a big 2010s era [fan], like, I fainted at a Big Bang concert when I was like 12,” Audrey Nuna, who sings for Mira, says. “2NE1 was hugely inspirational, because I feel like they were just so cool. Obviously they're amazingly beautiful as well, but I think for me, it was like they led with their coolness, and they led with their kind of self empowerment. That was huge to see, like, an Asian female face who was owning their stuff to that degree.”

	











	REI AMI, who voices Zoey, agrees. “They weren't doing like the traditional girl group, aesthetic approach, of, like, very good, frilly, girly,” she says of 2NE1. “No, they were hard, in your face, full of attitude. And I think us being raised in the West, there was a part of us that we saw in them. Because, you know, we are Korean-American. There's a whole Western side to us, and it shows in our music and our artistry.”


	The ladies' outing with Billboard comes as KPop Demon Hunters is dominating on the charts following the film's premiere on Netflix in June. In addition to the mini-residency “Golden” has taken up on the Hot 100, the project's soundtrack recently reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	And while HUNTR/X is the first female K-pop group to top the Hot 100, they're also the first all-female group, period, to rule the chart since Destiny's Child did it with “Bootylicious” in 2001.


	“It is really cool, because I feel like they were so trailblazing in their own way as well,” says Nuna of the iconic R&B trio comprised of Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. “It feels like a similar narrative, in the sense of three women of color just –.”


	“Dominating,” REI AMI jumps in.


	With all the success Demon Hunters is seeing, fans have been clamoring for another installment. A part two is reportedly in talks, but as REI AMI reminds Billboard, “The sequel has not been confirmed.”


	“We are, you know, looking forward, and we will know once we get that email,” she continues.


	So what do the voices of HUNTR/X intend to do in the meantime? “We should start, like, a tap-dancing group or something,” says Nuna as REI AMI and EJAE laugh. “Or a whistle chorus. An a cappella group.”

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: AFA, the production company and talent incubator of Kenan Thompson and Johnny Ryan Jr., has acquired remake rights to Sleepaway Camp, the cult classic '80s slasher from writer-director Robert Hiltzik.


	Specifics as to AFA's take on the material are under wraps for now. But AFA has placed Hiltzik back at the helm to direct from his own script. While for decades, Hiltzik and his wife have been approached for rights to the franchise, they've held out in hopes of a scenario where they can be involved in revitalizing the franchise. To Thompson and Ryan Jr., whose AFA places an emphasis on keeping creative control and ownership with the artist, keeping the original architects of the franchise at the forefront of its evolution is a given.

	Released in 1983, Sleepaway Camp is a low-budget summer-camp slasher in which a shy teen's summer at Camp Arawak turns deadly as campers are murdered one by one. The film plays like a whodunit in the Friday the 13th mold and is famous for an iconic twisty finale. Hiltzik shot it at Camp Algonquin in Argyle, New York, which he attended as a kid. Made for roughly $350,000, with a cast of unknowns, the film grossed around $11 million and has endured as a cult favorite, spurring a number of sequels spanning decades. Michael A. Simpson took the reins on sequels Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers (1988) and Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland (1989), which starred Pamela Springsteen (yes, Bruce's sister). Hiltzik returned for 2008's Return to Sleepaway Camp, with Jim Markovic helming 2012's Sleepaway Camp IV: The Survivor.




			Watch on Deadline		







	No stranger to summer camp, having starred opposite Ben Stiller in the Steven Brill & Judd Apatow-penned kids' classic Heavyweights at the start of his career, Thompson will produce the reimagining for AFA alongside Ryan Jr., with Robinson Velasco, Monica Weber, Cory Litwin, and Boris Shvarts exec producing. Development on the script is underway now, with the project marking AFA's first since exiting their three-year overall deal at Universal. Development is made possible by a new strategic partnership and investment from Shvarts, in a deal negotiated by Cory Litwin of Range Media Partners, which reps AFA. Range Select will handle sales on the project.

	











	In a statement to Deadline, Hiltzik said, “I am both thrilled and humbled to be working with AFA on the reimagined Sleepaway Camp. Though I have been approached by several companies regarding the remake of Sleepaway Camp, only AFA has shared my vision and is excited to have me helm the film, therefore preserving the integrity of the original film for the fans, as well as introducing Sleepaway Camp to a whole new generation. Be prepared for a new member of the Sleepaway Camp family.”


	Thompson told us, “Excited to work with the original genius Robert and bring back to life a camp classic!!!”


	Ryan Jr., meanwhile, teased, “This is only the beginning. Kenan and I always say we're fans first and this couldn't be more on brand for us.”


	Thompson's partner added, ‘I've been obsessed with the Sleepaway Camp franchise since I was a kid. We've wanted this title for 20 years and we're over the moon Robert came back to write it. We're staying true to the OG story while Robert adding in some insane new twists, we're going crazy with the merch too!”


	Founded in 2021, AFA was Emmy-nominated for Olympic Highlights with Kevin Hart and Kenan Thompson, and won a Kids Choice Award for Fan Film of the Year on Good Burger 2. Thompson, a six-time Emmy nominee and the longest-tenured cast member of Saturday Night Live, continues to balance comedy and producing efforts through AFA, alongside veteran manager and producer Ryan Jr.


	On his work with AFA, Range's Litwin told us, “Johnny and Kenan are beyond impressive in their talent, character, and hustle. We've been looking for the right people to team up as we launch and expand our careers as producers and investors in the film space. What they've built with AFA and their entire slate of projects, including Sleepaway Camp, is incredible. Boris and I couldn't be more excited to partner with them. Stay tuned!”

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	In the wake of ABC's decision to sideline Jimmy Kimmel following a threat from the FCC, Donald Trump suggested that the agency should weigh late-night criticism as broadcasters seek licensing renewals.


	As he talked to reporters on Air Force One on his return to the U.S. from Great Britain, Trump said that the late-night hosts' biting humor at his expense is “something that should be talked about for licensing.”


	Trump told reporters, “When you have a network, and they have evening shows, and all they do is hit Trump. If you go back — I guess they haven't had a conservative on in years or something — all they do is hit Trump. They're licensed. They're not allowed to do that. They're an arm of the Democrat party.”

					'The View' Hosts Don't Address ABC's Suspension Of Jimmy Kimmel Following FCC Chairman's Threat		
			








	The president seemed to be suggesting a return to the Fairness Doctrine. That required that broadcasters provide a mix of points of view on issues of major importance. But that requirement was abandoned by the FCC in 1987, during the Reagan administration. 


	The lifting of the Fairness Doctrine was credited with ushering in a new era of partisan talk radio, led by conservative host Rush Limbaugh, as broadcasters no longer had to meet the obligation of providing a diversity of viewpoints.


	It's very rare for the FCC to revoke a broadcast license. The next round of TV station license renewals don't start until 2028, when Trump's term will be in its final year.


	On Wednesday, Trump's FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, threatened to take action against ABC and its stations over a remark that Kimmel made in his monologue on Monday.


	Kimmel said, “We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.”


	Carr said on Benny Johnson's podcast, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”

	











	Hours later, Nexstar, the largest station group in the country, said that it was dropping Kimmel's show from is ABC affiliates for the “foreseeable future.” Sinclair Broadcast Group followed later. Shortly after Nexstar's announcement, ABC said that it was pulling Kimmel's show indefinitely.


	In interviews, Carr has noted that broadcasters have an obligation to operate in the public interest.


	On Hannity on Thursday, he said, “We at the FCC are going to enforce the public interest obligation. If there's broadcasters out there that don't like it, they can turn their license into the FCC. But that's our job. And again, we're making some progress now.”


	But the FCC says that it has limited authority over program content, and Carr himself has decried government efforts to censor speech based on the “public interest” standard. He wrote on Twitter in 2019, “The FCC does not have a roving mandate to police speech in the name of the ‘public interest.'”


	Anna Gomez, the sole Democrat on the FCC, suggested in a statement on Thursday that Carr was using the threat of FCC action to extract concessions, even though he does not have legal standing to sanction broadcasters on what Kimmel said.


	Gomez said, “This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes. If it were to take the unprecedented step of trying to revoke broadcast licenses, which are held by local stations rather than national networks, it would run headlong into the First Amendment and fail in court on both the facts and the law. But even the threat to revoke a license is no small matter. It poses an existential risk to a broadcaster, which by definition cannot exist without its license. That makes billion-dollar companies with pending business before the agency all the more vulnerable to pressure to bend to the government's ideological demands.”


	Earlier on Thursday, at a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump was asked about Kimmel. “Kimmel is not a talented person, he has very bad ratings more than anything else and they should have fired him a long time ago. You can call that free speech or not, he was fired for lack of talent.” 


	Kimmel was not fired, but suspended, and there is no word on if or when he will return.

Natasha Lyonne and Matt Berry are co-creating and starring in a new series called Force & Majeure, which has nothing to do with avalanches, cowardly dads, or the Ruben Östlund film with a very similar name. In fact, it seems like Lyonne and Berry's character will do quite the opposite of sprinting away from trouble. (They'll probably scream about it in a silly voice, though, if their respective histories are anything to go by.) “Force & Majeure follows a British art expert, Thomas Force (Berry) and American mercenary Jennifer Majeure (Lyonne),” Deadline‘s description reads. The conveniently-named duo are “recruited by an eccentric, justice-obsessed billionaire named Amanda Daventry and find themselves tasked with defeating the evil plans of international villains operating in locations across Europe,” it continues. “But as Force & Majeure team up to defeat the forces of evil, they must also work together to escape the clutches of Amanda, who may not be telling them the whole story.” Casting for Amanda and all those evil international villains has not yet been announced, nor has a release date for the series. 

Natasha Lyonne is also busy right now with her directorial debut, an AI “hybrid” film called Uncanny Valley. She launched an “ethical” AI production company called Asteria Studios in connection with that project, but at least as of this writing, Force & Majeure won't incorporate the technology. Matt Berry also hitched his name to a controversial project recently. He'll be voicing Sir Cadogan, a moving portrait, in Audible's full-cast Harry Potter audiobook series. The What We Do In The Shadows actor's other recent credits include The Wild Robot, A Minecraft Movie, and the upcoming animated Cat In The Hat film.

Force & Majeure will reunite Lyonne with Russian Doll writer Cirocco Dunlap. Other writers include What We Do In The Shadows‘ Tom Scharpling, who co-created the series along with Lyonne and Berry, and The Inbetweeners‘ Iain Morris. Force & Majeure will air on U.K. broadcaster Sky. The trade reports that Sky is expected to take the project to U.S. buyers “shortly.”

Following similar efforts made in the film community, a group of independent artists and labels have launched a boycott to prevent their music from being streamed in Israel. The coalition, called No Music For Genocide, encourages artists and rights-holders to request their music be geo-blocked as “in response to the genocide in Gaza; ethnic cleansing of the Occupied West Bank; apartheid within Israel; and political repression of Pro-Palestine efforts wherever we live.” The pledge has so far been signed by more than 400 labels and artists, including Nourished By Time, MJ Lenderman, Massive Attack, Rina Sawayama, Oklou, Mannequin Pussy, Kneecap, Jockstrap, Japanese Breakfast, Grizzly Bear, Fontaines D.C., Faye Webster, Deerhoof, Ben Howard, Arca, Amyl and The Sniffers, Aminé, MØ, and Soccer Mommy. 

According to a press release, the action is inspired by “the successful cultural boycott of apartheid South Africa in the 1980s,” adapted for the streaming era. No Music For Genocide points out that major labels removed their catalogues and closed operations in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, but have stopped short of taking the same measures in Israel. Major label acts who have signed the pledge are also urging Sony, UMG, and Warner to follow suit.

“Culture can't stop bombs on its own, but it can help reject political repression, shift public opinion toward justice, and refuse the art-washing and normalization of any company or nation that commits crimes against humanity. This initiative is one part of a worldwide movement to erode the support Israel needs to continue its genocide. We're inspired by the escalating efforts in pursuit of that goal, from the recent Film Workers For Palestine pledge to Spain's ban of Israel-bound ships and planes to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition to Demilitarize Brooklyn Navy Yard to dockworkers in Morocco who've refused to load weapons onto vessels ordered by Tel Aviv,” No Music For Genocide said in a statement. “Many of our peers have felt, like ourselves, unsure how to use music in this moment. Our first goal with No Music For Genocide is to inspire others to reclaim their agency and direct their influence toward a tangible act. We are so grateful for all of the artists, managers and labels who have already committed to this first step, and we're excited to expand this together. The more of us there are, the stronger we will be. This is just the beginning.”

Lori Harvey, the daughter of entertainment icon Steve Harvey, is bravely opening up about her health and a painful condition she has been suffering with since she was a teenager. 

In an interview on the “SheMD” podcast with Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi and Mary Alice Haney on Tuesday, September 16, Harvey discussed how receiving polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis diagnoses ended years of not knowing what she was struggling with and being dismissed by medical professionals. 

“I've been so frustrated. I've been going to my gynecologist because I've just been feeling like something's off in my body,” she said, People reports. “But every time I go to her, she's like, ‘You're fine, you're fine, you're fine. Nothing's wrong.' And I was like, ‘But I don't feel fine. I feel like something is just off.'”

A visit to Los Angeles-based OB-GYN Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi gave her a diagnosis of a condition Harvey had been experiencing since she was 16. “I was like, what's happening?” she said of her body before learning of her diagnosis. “I'm like, okay, something is not adding up here. My body's trying to tell me something, but I'm not getting the answers that I need.”

Before learning of her diagnosis, Harvey felt “sad” and described the experience as “disheartening.” She continued, “I used to have the most excruciating periods of my life, every single time I felt like I needed to go to the hospital, just crazy cramps. I'm taking 800 milligrams of Ibuprofen. Nothing is working, it's just debilitating. “They'd be like, ‘Oh, just take some Tylenol, you'll be fine.' And I'm like, ‘There's no way this is normal.' And [Aliabadi] told me, ‘Yeah, babe, you're right. It was not normal, and I'm so sorry that you've just been living with this.' So she literally changed my life.”

A post shared by SHE MD Podcast (@shemdpodcast)

Speaking out about her diagnosis and how she continued to push for answers can help raise awareness for endometriosis and help other women who find themselves experiencing similar symptoms. 

A clip from Harvey's interview was shared on the “SheMD” Instagram page on September 17, and fans used it as a way to show their support for the actress. “Thank you for sharing and helping to raise awareness about PCOS and Endometriosis,” a comment reads.

“It's so frustrating how so many women's symptoms just get brushed aside as'“normal' you are your best advocate. So glad she kept pushing for more!” another person shared. 

“Omg… she literally explained it to the tee!” a third person wrote. “Explaining to different doctors and the making you feel like its just mundane and like I was making it a big deal.”

When the rise of television threatened movie attendance in the 1950s, Hollywood responded by introducing several new exhibition formats designed to bring people back to theaters with the promise of widescreen images and stereophonic sound. CinemaScope, Cinerama, and VistaVision were just a few of these processes, which dazzled audiences and yielded films like “The Robe,” “The Bridge on the River Kwai,” and “Around the World in 80 Days,” attracting customers in droves.

Now, as exhibitors struggle with the rise of streaming and declining theater attendance, one of America's greatest living filmmakers has revived one of the greatest of all widescreen formats, giving today's audiences the same reason to get off their couches that Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Curtiz, and other premier directors of their era gave in the 1950s. The glorious return of VistaVision began last year when Brady Corbet shot “The Brutalist” in the format and exhibited the film in several venues in 70mm, a gauge that approximates VistaVision's high resolution — but that was only the beginning.

 








Related Stories What Lilly Singh Does Is Not ‘Niche' There's Never Been a Better Time to Own the Full ‘Bluey' Blu-ray Collection 

Now, director Paul Thomas Anderson has not only filmed but is releasing “One Battle After Another” in VistaVision, with a handful of venues projecting the movie in a format that hasn't been seen by audiences of a new release film since Marlon Brando's “One-Eyed Jacks” in 1961. (Lucky viewers at this year's TCM Film Festival did get to see revivals of “We're No Angels” and “Gunfight at the O.K. Corral” in true VistaVision.)

 










Why is that important? And what does it mean for audiences, filmmakers, and projectionists? Let's break it down.

What made VistaVision special compared to rival formats like CinemaScope was its larger negative — around twice the size of a typical 35mm film frame, as the film was run through the camera horizontally rather than vertically. As Margaret Bodde, who works with Martin Scorsese's Film Foundation, told IndieWire, “With CinemaScope, you have a four-perf negative. VistaVision is eight-perf, so you're doubling the size of the image. It just has a superior image quality.” 

In spite of that superior quality, VistaVision ultimately became more or less obsolete for feature film production, though it continued to be used extensively for special effects work on blockbusters like the original “Star Wars,” “Back to the Future,” and “Jurassic Park.” “One Battle After Another” was shot using a combination of VistaVision and Super 35, and will be released in no fewer than seven formats. This has led to intense excitement among cinephiles — and no small amount of misinformation.

In one example, a fan-created graphic recently took off on social media and led to widespread confusion over aspect ratios of the various exhibition formats. (Among other things, it incorrectly stated that the movie would be released in a 2.20:1 aspect ratio in 70mm.) To clarify what formats “One Battle After Another” will be presented in, their technical specs, and where to see them, IndieWire reached out to the source: Paul Thomas Anderson.

 










Anderson referred us to three members of his post-production team: editor Andy Jurgensen, post-production supervisor Erica Frauman, and associate editor Jay Trautman, all of whom dealt with the complexities of VistaVision and the movie's varied release prints throughout the post-production process. Together, they addressed several important questions related to the different ways you can watch “One Battle After Another” when it opens in theaters on September 26.

The below interview condenses and combines responses from Jurgensen, Frauman, and Trautman on the specifics of formats for seeing “One Battle After Another.”

The film was shot using a combination of VistaVision (8-perf) and Super 35 (4-perf) formats. (“Perf” referring to the perforations that run alongside or — depending on the format — above and below the image so that the celluloid can be pulled through the projector.) Both offer a tall enough negative to accommodate the full IMAX 1.43:1 aspect ratio, though the image can be cropped top and bottom to fit the 1.90:1 IMAX or standard 1.85:1 aspect ratios. Camera operator Colin Anderson used ground glass marked with framelines for both 1.85:1 and 1.43:1 compositions to ensure flexibility in framing.

 










When the opportunity for special VistaVision screenings arose, Paul Thomas Anderson chose to present the film in the full 1.50:1 VistaVision frame, an aspect ratio very close to IMAX's 1.43:1. The 5-perf 70mm version is presented in 1.85:1, pillarboxed within a 2.20:1 frame, while standard DCPs are also formatted in 1.85:1.

We often say that each release format offers its own unique experience of the film. In the photochemical world, it's impossible to make all formats look exactly the same!

Because the film was shot with both VistaVision and Super 35mm cameras, we had to navigate not only multiple release formats but also multiple capture formats. If we were using the digital intermediate process that nearly every modern film uses, we would just scan all of the negative and resize it in a computer. However, we cut and splice the camera negative and print photochemically. This means that we had to figure out how to create the VistaVision negative from our Super 35mm shots and our digital visual effects. We started testing these processes over two years ago. In the end, FotoKem configured both an optical printer and a digital film recorder specifically for VistaVision, allowing us to create all the necessary elements to assemble a complete VistaVision negative and produce a VistaVision release print.

 










Paul has noted that the VistaVision presentation is the closest to the film's intended look, as it's struck directly from the VistaVision cut negative. There are only four of these special screening venues currently scheduled — in Los Angeles, New York, Boston, and London.

That said, we always knew there would be an IMAX release, so from the beginning, the 1.43:1 and 1.90:1 IMAX presentations (both film and digital) were intended to be the most immersive. This is the first narrative feature film to be presented entirely in IMAX's 1.43:1 aspect ratio (with no jumping between aspect ratios). The 70mm (5-perf) version is an optical blow-up from the VistaVision-cut negative. It has slightly more grain and contrast, and its 1.85:1 aspect ratio matches the non-IMAX DCP presentations.

Unlike traditional 35mm film, which runs vertically through the camera gate, VistaVision uses a horizontal feed. This allows the image to be recorded on a frame that is twice the size of a standard 4-perf 35mm frame, resulting in a finer-grained negative with improved image quality.

Just like the cameras, VistaVision projectors must also run the film horizontally. Very few of these projectors still exist today. According to VistaVision expert Charlotte Barker, “It's been exactly 70 years since VistaVision projectors were first installed for commercial use, debuting with Paramount's ‘Strategic Air Command' in 1955. Back then, seven U.S. theaters were outfitted with VistaVision projectors, custom 2-foot-deep curvilinear screens, and special aperture plates. ‘One Battle After Another' will echo this historic rollout next week at The Vista in Los Angeles, Regal Union Square 17 in New York, Coolidge Corner Theater in Boston, and Odeon Leicester Square in London.”

 










Warner Bros. refurbished two Ballantyne VistaVision projectors for use in Los Angeles and New York; Barry Wright (Bell Theatre Services) refreshed their VistaVision projector in London. Boston Light & Sound had previously refurbished two projectors supplied by the George Eastman Museum for the TCM Festival in April of 2025; these will be used in Boston. Each Ballantyne projector is equipped with DTS readers to synchronize audio and fitted with custom-built platters capable of running the entire two-hour, 40-minute film on a single reel. The Boston location will utilize two projectors and play reel-to-reel. Projectionists at each location are receiving specialized training to operate the equipment.

Projecting in VistaVision allows prints made directly from the original cut negative to be shown to an audience. This hasn't been possible for over 60 years. Historically, footage shot on VistaVision had to be converted to another format for exhibition. As far as we know, this is the first new release feature film to be projected from true VistaVision prints since “One-Eyed Jacks” in 1961.

MJ Lenderman, King Krule, Arca, Massive Attack, MIKE, and Yaeji are among more than 400 artists and labels who have signed up to a campaign asking distributors to block their music from streaming in Israel. A statement from No Music for Genocide rallies more artists and labels to join the cultural embargo, in protest of “Israel's genocide in Gaza; ethnic cleansing of the Occupied West Bank; apartheid within Israel,” and the repression of pro-Palestine activism, as well as the music industry's own links to military tools. In a separate statement, Massive Attack announced they would remove their music from Spotify globally.

Other artists to sign up to No Music for Genocide include Fontaines D.C., Oklou, Wednesday, Kelela, Faye Webster, Japanese Breakfast, Rina Sawayama, Aminé, Erika de Casier, Kneecap, Primal Scream, Eartheater, Aja Monet, Maryam Saleh, Ana Tijoux, Annahstasia, Amyl and the Sniffers, Nadah El Shazly, Ben Howard, Fat Tony, Mannequin Pussy, Liv.e, Mø, Mechatok, Redveil, Horsegiirl, Chanel Beads, Nick León, Escho, Saul Williams, and Verraco. Bayonet, 10k, and Pan are among the labels joining the embargo.

According to the campaign, all three major labels geo-blocked their catalogs from streaming services in Russia within a month of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Those labels did close offices and suspend operations in Russia, and Spotify shut down in Russia altogether. But Russians could still stream the labels' music on platforms, like Apple Music, that remained in operation. In late 2022, Sony Music Entertainment eventually pulled its catalog from all streaming services in Russia.

A statement from No Music for Genocide reads, in part, “Culture can't stop bombs on its own, but it can help reject political repression, shift public opinion toward justice, and refuse the art-washing and normalization of any company or nation that commits crimes against humanity. This initiative is one part of a worldwide movement to erode the support Israel needs to continue its genocide. We're inspired by the escalating efforts in pursuit of that goal, from the recent Film Workers for Palestine pledge to Spain's ban of Israel-bound ships and planes to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition to Demilitarize Brooklyn Navy Yard to dockworkers in Morocco who've refused to load weapons onto vessels ordered by Tel Aviv.”

	A little after noon on Sept. 8, Los Angeles police responded to a call from a tow yard in Hollywood about a “foul odor” coming from an impounded Tesla. When the car's front trunk was opened, detectives discovered decomposing human remains.


	The victim's body had deteriorated to such a degree, it took medical examiners a full week to identify her as Celeste Rivas, a teenager reported missing by her family in February and April of last year. But what was confirmed at the time the body was discovered was that the 2023 Tesla Model Y with Texas license plates was registered to David Anthony Burke, the real name of the up-and-coming singer D4vd. 


	Burke was on tour when the body was discovered, and a representative said he was “cooperating” with authorities. Police have yet to name a suspect, or even a person of interest, in the case, nor have any arrests been made. 


	As police continue their investigation, here's everything we know about the shocking case so far. 

	











	After detectives discovered Rivas' body, a report from the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner described her as a female with wavy black hair wearing a tube top and black leggings, size small, as well as yellow metal-stud earrings and a yellow metal-chain bracelet. Her height was listed as five foot two. But Rivas' body was so “severely decomposed” that examiners were unable to determine her eye color, age, or race/ethnicity. 


	One of the only potential identifying details they were able to share was a tattoo on the right index finger that read “Shhh …” 

	











	Just over a week after the body was discovered, on Sept. 16, authorities finally identified Celeste Rivas Hernandez, a 15-year-old from Lake Elsinore, California, who was reported missing by her family last year. A GoFundMe has been set up to help her family cover the cost of funeral arrangements. 


	After Rivas was identified, reporters quickly swarmed the family's home. While the family declined to speak with them, TMZ reported that Rivas' mother said her daughter had been dating someone named “David” before her death.

	A friend, Rubi Alonso, who was visiting the house, described Rivas as sweet and “studious” to Rolling Stone, adding, “It's so sad. She was very beautiful.” 


	Despite identifying Rivas, there's still much authorities do not know, including a cause of death. A report on the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner website still listed her cause of death as “deferred.”


	Much of the information that's trickled out about the investigation has centered around the impounded Tesla. The car was towed from the tony Bird Streets neighborhood in the Hollywood Hills, and it was sitting in the tow yard for three days before the police were called about the smell.


	Residents told Rolling Stone that the car was spotted in various places around the neighborhood in the preceding months, as far back as the end of May. The city finally towed the sedan after a citizen complained that the car had been abandoned for more than 72 hours. Neighborhood sources said the sedan had been sitting in its final spot, on Bluebird Avenue, for at least three weeks. 


	“It moved around,” one resident told Rolling Stone. “It's chilling.”


	The investigation ramped up Wednesday night after Rivas' body was identified. Per ABC 7 in Los Angeles, investigators searched a house on Doheny Place, close to where the car was abandoned. After several hours at the home, police left with a computer and other items.

	Beyond the initial statement confirming that he was “cooperating” with authorities, reps for Burke have yet to make any public comments. The musician has continued to tour and play shows in support of his debut album, Withered, which arrived in April. At a concert on Sept. 9 — the day after the body was discovered — D4vd performed in Minneapolis, where he was seen tossing Labubus into the crowd and hyping his hit song “Crashing,” with singer Kali Uchis. (“Not my friend i did a song with him which is currently in the process of being taken down given today's disturbing news,” she wrote on social media following the body's discovery.)

	











	D4vd has enjoyed an impressive rise over the past few years. He broke through in 2022 with his singles “Romantic Homicide” and “Here With Me,” both of which garnered significant traction on TikTok. He released his debut EP, Petals to Thorns, in May 2023, then followed it up a few months later with The Lost Petals.


	While Burke has largely appeared unfazed by the investigation, the initial discovery of the corpse in the car did prompt the fashion companies Crocs and Hollister to pull back on a campaign that was set to feature D4vd. “We are aware of this developing story,” the brands said in a joint statement. “With respect to the current situation, we have removed campaign content featuring D4vd while the investigation continues.”

	On Wednesday, as news of Rivas' identification spread, D4vd also had his first show canceled (a gig at the Showbox SoDo in Seattle). As it stands, D4vd's next two shows are still set to go ahead as planned: A Sept. 18 gig at the Warfield in San Francisco, followed by a show at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on Sept. 20. 


	The identification of Rivas set off a wave of speculation and rumor, especially regarding her possible ties to Burke. (As of press time, Burke has not been accused of any crimes.) TMZ in particular has surfaced several alleged links, including a photo of Burke that appears to show him with a “Shhh …” tattoo on his finger similar to the one Rivas had. The tabloid also uncovered a photo of Burke in Lake Elsinore, close to where Rivas lived before her disappearance. (It's unclear when the photo was taken.) An allegedly leaked and unreleased D4vd song has also started floating around the web, called “Celeste.”

	The announcement was made shortly after ABC said is was suspending the late-night show “indefinitely” after both Sinclair and Nexstar kicked it off its U.S. stations following Kimmel's comments about Kirk's assassination during a Monday monologue.


	“Mr. Kimmel's remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country,” said Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith in a statement. “We believe broadcasters have a responsibility to educate and elevate respectful, constructive dialogue in our communities. We appreciate FCC Chairman Carr's remarks today and this incident highlights the critical need for the FCC to take immediate regulatory action to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.”

	











	The company also stated that it will not lift the suspension on Jimmy Kimmel Live! “until formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability,” and called on Kimmel to apologize to Kirk's family, as well as make “a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk family and Turning Point USA.”

	Earlier today, the Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, publicly demanded licensed broadcasters to stop airing Kimmel's show. “I think that it's really sort of past time that a lot of these licensed broadcasters themselves push back on Comcast and Disney and say, ‘Listen, we are going to preempt, we are not going to run Kimmel anymore, until you straighten this out because we, we licensed broadcaster, are running the possibility of fines or license revocation from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion,'” Carr said when speaking with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson.

	











	Kimmel is the latest late-night host to be yanked from a major network. In July, CBS announced its decision to abruptly end Stephen Colbert's The Late Show in 2026. In a previous statement, the network claimed the cancellation was financial. However, the decision to end Colbert's show garnered criticism, since the announcement came days after he criticized Paramount, CBS' parent company, over its decision to agree to a settlement with President Donald Trump.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","The raging bull market for gold is far from over. Here are more reasons why","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-the-raging-bull-market-for-gold-is-far-from-over-here-are-more-reasons/","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 13:12:05 GMT","

Gold continues to be supported by both fundamental and technical factors. We've written previously on why we're so bullish on the commodity, and today it's time for even more reasons it deserves a prominent place in portfolios. 

Gold has a 60% positive correlation to the general level of economic uncertainty, which has definitely come off the boil, but is still twice the long-run average. Concerns over monetary policy and political influence have taken center stage after the Big Beautiful Bill in the U.S. got passed, and the tariff file became less onerous than feared in April. Fed policy uncertainty is close to 3 times higher than normal levels, and this is not going away any time soon.

Gold also has a huge historical 85% inverse correlation (although it may be lower now) to real interest rates and the U.S. dollar. Both are on downslopes. Real 10-year yields have come down 60 basis points from the nearby peak to 1.8%, but are still some 90 basis points above the long-run mean. While the ECB and BoE may be done cutting, the Fed is just starting to rekindle the rate-cutting cycle. Same for the Bank of Canada. 

As for the DXY dollar index, it is already down well over 10% from the earlier highs, and if it breaks below 95 (currently around 97), then we will see a cyclical bear market in the U.S. dollar index morph into something more secular in nature.

Commodities could be on the verge of a new super cycle

The supply-demand fundamentals for gold are very bullish to this day. Mined production growth is growing at 1.5% at an annual rate, but demand in aggregate is running north of 3.0% and from a variety of sources.

One of the critical sources of demand is the deep pockets of world central banks, which are no longer confined to the BRICS. We are seeing a classic mean-reversion trade here. In the 1980s and 1990s, when central banks were winding down their bullion reserves in favour of interest-bearing securities, sales of gold brought its price down by 50% and into a fundamental bear market that ended in 1999 with the Washington Agreement. And that coincided with the secular low of US$250 per ounce at that point.

But that is now reversing course. Back in 1980, the FX reserve share of gold in central bank vaults stood at 70%; by the late 1990s, down to 10%; and today, it is just over 20%. If this share mean-reverts to 30%, we are talking about gold going to US$4,500 per ounce on that sustained fund-flow support; and to over US$6,000 if we ever do go back to that 70% share that pre-dated the strategy to dump gold in the early 1980s. Keep in mind that global central banks still have a lot of work to do — a classic case in point is the U.K., which cut its gold reserves by half in the 1980s and 1990s, and Canada, where the central bank wound down its exposure to zero (talk about terrible timing).

Gold remains under-owned and underrepresented to this day, even amidst this raging bull market. From the research we have gleaned, just 1% of global assets are in bullion, and that is down from 26% in the early 1980s — the last time gold was where it is today adjusted for inflation.

The technical picture also looks very strong. Mapping out the 1971-1980 cycle and the current one since 1999, for the two legs to match on scale, we would need to see a peak of over US$6,000 this cycle. I don't know the timing of the peak, but I know what the path to the peak looks like. Treat any corrections along the way (and they have been brief affairs) as buying opportunities in a secular uptrend.

In fact, that is a story in its own right. All gold has done is go back to around where it was 45 years ago in real terms. The S&P 500 on this basis has shot up over 13x by way of comparison.

We get asked all the time about comparing gold to Bitcoin. The problem is that gold is a classic “risk-off” asset, and Bitcoin is a “risk-on” asset that is more correlated with the Nasdaq 100 than anything else. It has three ties to gold's volatility: the major point being that gold is a ballast and diversifier in the portfolio. Unlike Bitcoin, gold is a hedge against risk, while Bitcoin and crypto in general possess far riskier characteristics. There is something else to consider, which is that the first Bitcoin was mined 16 years ago, so it has barely made it through one full cycle. The earliest archaeological evidence of gold mining production goes back as far as 6,000 years. You be the judge as to which of these has withstood the test of time.

Meanwhile, the case for the gold miners is compelling. 

In Canada (the world's fourth largest producer), the sector has contributed 7.5 points to the TSX's +18.5% YTD gain

The all-in production cost for the lowest-cost producers is US$1,500 per ounce and US$1,900 per ounce for the highest cost companies. Margins are fat, and 2026 free cash-flow yields are running at 10.0%.

The forward P/E multiple is at 16x, which is a nice discount to the overall market. Expected EPS growth is so huge that the sector trades at a 0.3x PEG ratio — compared to a near-2.0x ratio for the overall S&P 500 and TSX composite.

Not just that, but the Canadian gold mining group, even at current record levels, is still trading at a 40% historical discount to the underlying price of the commodity. In the U.S., we are talking about more than a full standard deviation when it comes to the gap between valuations in the S&P 500 gold equity group and the spot gold price.

Closing these gaps would require a doubling in the North American gold miners, even assuming no more price appreciation for bullion.

I know that I haven't mentioned silver — “poor man's gold.” We love gold, but we like silver. For the miners, margins are 3x fatter for the gold sector. And while the gold/silver price ratio did hit an extreme last April, half of that gap has been resolved. That said, we own both in our Rosie Macro Fund, and between the metals and the equities, they comprise just over 20% of the total assets in the model portfolio.

The last thing that we would like to highlight is that gold has registered new highs in terms of every major currency. So while the depreciating U.S. dollar continues to act as a catalyst, you know that gold is in a bona fide secular bull market when it is breaking out to fresh records across all exchange rates.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested that he is working to reestablish a U.S. presence at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, four years after America's chaotic withdrawal from the country left the base in the Taliban's hands.

Trump floated the idea during a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer as he wrapped up a state visit to the U.K. and tied it to the need for the U.S. to counter its top rival, China.

“We're trying to get it back,” Trump said of the base in an aside to a question about ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

While Trump described his call for the U.S. military to reestablish a position in Afghanistan as “breaking news,” the Republican president has previously raised the idea. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about whether it or the Pentagon has done any planning around returning to the sprawling air base, which was central to America's longest war.




During his first presidency, Trump set the terms for the U.S. withdrawal by negotiating a deal with the Taliban. The 20-year conflict came to an end in disquieting fashion under President Joe Biden: The U.S.-backed Afghan government collapsed, a grisly bombing killed 13 U.S. troops and 170 others, and thousands of desperate Afghans descended on Kabul's airport in search of a way out before the final U.S. aircraft departed over the Hindu Kush.

The Afghanistan debacle was a major setback just eight months into Biden's Democratic presidency that he struggled to recover from.

Biden's Republican detractors, including Trump, seized on it as a signal moment in a failed presidency. Those criticisms have persisted into the present day, including as recently as last week, when Trump claimed the move emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine in February 2022.

“He would have never done what he did, except that he didn't respect the leadership of the United States,” Trump said, speaking of Putin. “They just went through the Afghanistan total disaster for no reason whatsoever. We were going to leave Afghanistan, but we were going to leave it with strength and dignity. We were going to keep Bagram Air Base — one of the biggest air bases in the world. We gave it to them for nothing.”

Asked again about the proposal hours later on Air Force One, Trump offered no details but again bashed Biden for “gross incompetence” and said the base should have “never been given back.”

“It's one of the most powerful bases in the world in terms of runway strength and length,” he said. “You can land anything on there. You can land a planet on top of it.”

It is unclear if the U.S. has any new direct or indirect conversations with the Taliban government about returning to the country. But Trump hinted that the Taliban, who have struggled with an economic crisis, international legitimacy, internal rifts and rival militant groups since their return to power in 2021, could be game to allow the U.S. military to return.

“We're trying to get it back because they need things from us,” Trump said of the Taliban.

The president repeated his view that a U.S. presence at Bagram is of value because of its proximity to China, the most significant economic and military competitor to the United States.

“But one of the reasons we want that base is, as you know, it's an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,” Trump said. “So a lot of things are happening.”

While the U.S. and the Taliban have no formal diplomatic ties, the sides have had hostage conversations. An American man who was abducted more than two years ago while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist was released by the Taliban in March.

Last week, the Taliban also said they reached an agreement with U.S. envoys on an exchange of prisoners as part of an effort to normalize relations between the United States and Afghanistan.

The Taliban gave no details of a detainee swap, and the White House did not comment on the meeting in Kabul or the results described in a Taliban statement. The Taliban released photographs from their talks, showing their foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, with Trump's special envoy for hostage response, Adam Boehler.

Officials at U.S. Central Command in the Middle East and the Pentagon, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office, referred questions about reestablishing a presence at Bagram to the White House.

Pennsylvania State Police and Gov. Josh Shapiro give an update on an officer-involved shooting.

Officials on Thursday identified the three police officers that were killed when they were ambushed while responding to a domestic call Wednesday in York County, Pennsylvania.

The fallen included Northern York County Regional Police Department's Sgt. Cody Becker, Detective Mark Baker and Detective Isaiah Emenheiser, according to York County District Attorney Tim Barker.

Another Northern York County Regional Police detective and a York County Sheriff's Office deputy were critically wounded, but remain stable at the hospital, Barker said.

The suspected gunman, identified as Matthew James Ruth, 24, was killed by police, officials said. He did not have any prior criminal convictions.

Barker said that the investigation began on Tuesday night, when Ruth's ex-girlfriend's mother reported seeing him on her property in camouflage, peering into the home with binoculars. Trail camera footage showed Ruth armed with an AR-15-style rifle, and his truck was left nearby. 

The ex-girlfriend also told police her pickup truck was set on fire in August, but she was not sure if Ruth was to blame, so she requested they not investigate.

Detectives returned to the empty home just after 2 p.m. Wednesday, and as they walked through the unlocked front door, the suspect launched an ambush, firing multiple suppressed rounds, according to Barker. Ruth was later killed in a final shootout near the road.

Inside the house, investigators later discovered shell casings from the initial ambush and, in the basement, the body of the ex-girlfriend's mother's black Labrador, which the suspect had shot and killed.

Authorities are continuing to investigate the motive, but Barker emphasized the root of the tragedy was domestic violence.

""All actions by law enforcement were justified. They weren't only justified, they were necessary,"" Barker said. ""We are so thankful and appreciative to them, and especially our northern York County Regional detective who fired the last shot and who rendered aid. I can't imagine the strength and the fortitude that it takes to immediately, after having seen and been engaged in that … immediately thinking of rendering critical aid.""

""He saved many lives that day,"" he added. ""If the actor was not eliminated, and his threat and murderous rampage eliminated, who knows where this would have stopped.""

Prior to the shooting, Ruth was charged with stalking, trespassing, loitering and prowling at night in relation to the investigation, court documents show. 

The FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the Pennsylvania State Police are assisting local authorities. Attorney General Pam Bondi offered the full support of the federal government.

The shooting, which took place about 115 miles west of Philadelphia in North Codorus Township, came just a few months after another York County officer was killed in the line of duty. 

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said during a news conference Wednesday he is continuing to pray for everyone involved. 

""This is an absolutely tragic and devastating day for your county and for the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,"" Shapiro said. ""[We] grieve for the loss of life of the three precious souls who served this county, served this commonwealth and served this country. We continue to pray for the full recovery of those who are dealing with their wounds.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","‘One Battle After Another' Touches a Raw Nerve","https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/09/one-battle-after-another-movie-review/684262/","Thu, 18 Sep 2025 19:42:30 GMT","

One Battle After Another is as blisteringly fun as it is daringly political.

Bob Ferguson, the protagonist of Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, One Battle After Another, is a familiar sort of burnout. He's a single dad shambling around his secluded California home, watching old movies and smoking weed while he fuzzily recalls his salad days as a revolutionary. He doesn't own a cellphone, and he barks angrily at his teenage daughter's friends when they come up his driveway. His paranoia, played with clumsy charm by a mustachioed and bleary-eyed Leonardo DiCaprio, is half-cocked and somewhat comical. But Bob's behavior, One Battle After Another argues, is also entirely justified because of the terrifying brutality of the world—a reality that crashes into Bob's hazy reverie to create an electrifying, thoughtful blockbuster.

The credits cite as inspiration Thomas Pynchon's novel Vineland, a tale concerned with the entropy of 1960s radicalism. One Battle After Another does have the same basic plot setup as that book: A hippie finds himself and his child in the sights of an outrageous government adversary. But the movie spins in wildly different directions. The most important change is that the events are now set in the present day. Anderson doesn't portray Bob, an alias that the character assumes after going into hiding, as a crusty leftover from an earlier era. Instead, he's a former paramilitary vigilante who waged war against a fascist-leaning government more than a decade ago, freeing migrants from federal camps and bombing law enforcement as part of an insurgency group called the French 75.

Anderson's willingness to touch such a raw nerve is astonishing. One Battle After Another feels urgent against the backdrop of a country debating the complexities of political violence and government overreach into its criminal-justice system. That's especially true when compared with the director's usual, backward-looking fare, which has dominated his oeuvre during the past two decades. Instead of contemporary settings, he's previously turned to contexts such as the oil boom of the early 20th century (There Will Be Blood), early-'70s California (Inherent Vice), and high-society London in the '50s (Phantom Thread). His most recent movie, Licorice Pizza, was an oft-gorgeous but almost myopic look at a Hollywood of yesteryear.

Read: Licorice Pizza is a tragicomic tale of 1970s Hollywood

One Battle After Another is Licorice Pizza's opposite: a bleak, captivating vision of modern times as seen through the eyes of someone who tried to beat off the dread, then eventually gave up the fight. The film's first section condenses Bob's origin story into a kinetic action thriller: He was once an explosives expert known as “Ghetto Pat” who quickly fell in love with one of the French 75's fiercest warriors, Perfidia Beverly Hills (played by Teyana Taylor). We watch as they become parents, before Perfidia quickly declares herself too independent for domestic life. Instead, she becomes more reckless in her guerrilla campaign against the Army operative Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw (Sean Penn), an avowed white supremacist. As Lockjaw descends on them, the group relocates Bob and his daughter to California, gives them new names, and tells them to lie low.

All of that is just the opening salvo of the film, delivered with breakneck assurance by Anderson. I could barely believe what I was witnessing; Anderson tends to work at a slow, moody, unapologetically arty pace. Think of There Will Be Blood's drawn-out, almost-wordless prelude; the pregnant pauses of Punch-Drunk Love; the languid obsessiveness of Phantom Thread: None of that patience is present at the outset of One Battle After Another.

When we flash forward to Bob's life as a retired radical, however, a little more of Anderson's shaggy humor rears its head. DiCaprio is a perfect vessel for that sensibility—he's still plausible as the youthful action hero of the first chunk of the film, but he's also loaded with pathos and expert comic timing as an older, crabbier Bob. His daughter, Willa (the luminous Chase Infiniti, in her first film), is affectionate but short with him. Yet for all of his stoned foolishness, Bob has clearly imparted a real distrust of authority to his kid. His parenting pays off grandly when Lockjaw returns to try to devastate their lives once again.

I won't say much more about the plot, which is somehow sprawling and taut at the same time. The film clocks in at nearly three hours but feels half as long. And though all of Anderson's artistry and jittery comedic sensibility is present, the director hasn't created a pretentious version of an action flick; One Battle After Another is the real thing, filled with beautifully shot car chases and shoot-outs. (An extended sequence in which Bob tries to escape a literal siege on his hometown with the help of his daughter's karate teacher, played by Benicio del Toro, had me ready to fall out of my seat.) The most impressive part of the director's approach is how well he melds the genre storytelling with its commentary on the tension between committing to a life as a true renegade and trying to safely raise a child in America. The movie gives its characters a lot to do, not just points to make.

One Battle After Another is rife with big ideas, but it's never didactic; it's too committed to emotionally investing the audience. Penn, giving a brilliant performance of cold villainy that could win him a third Oscar, is unafraid of lancing the inherent goofiness of a fascist. DiCaprio plays Bob as a sweetheart rather than a buffoon; he's a tired, strung-out antihero made weary not by his yearslong efforts to fight back but by the relentlessness of the world. The whole movie is similarly daunted by how dark our current political battles have become, yet it strains for optimism throughout. Yes, an all-powerful government might be sending soldiers to its citizens' doorstep, but One Battle After Another is about once-dispirited people searching for the will to best and survive them—perhaps regardless of whether their means are moral. More often than not, they succeed. So, too, does the film: It's an emotional, visceral triumph.

Nvidia, once again, has stolen the show — specifically the chip titan's announcement of a massive investment in a struggling rival. 

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite touched fresh records on Thursday, with the indexes coming to life after a tepid response to a widely expected rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. 

The catalyst? A $ 5 billion deal between Nvidia and Intel, which sparked a big rally led by chip stocks in early morning trading. 

Nvidia shares ticked rose 3%, while Intel soared as much as 28%. That puts Nvidia up 30% for the year, while Intel is up about 53% year-to-date.

Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday:

Here were the biggest gainers in the market:

The two chip giants said they would jointly develop custom products, with Nvidia incorporating some of Intel's chips into its AI infrastructure for datacenters, while Intel incorporates some of Nvidia's chips into its PC systems.

""This is a game changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game. Along with the recent US Government investment for 10% this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors,"" Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note.

The good news is coming after a disappointing Fed day for markets. The central bank issued its widely anticipated 25 basis-point rate cut after its policy meeting on Wednesday.

Investors appeared to sell the news as the cut was priced in for weeks leading up to the meeting, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, told BI.

Bees are critical for ensuring an abundant food supply year-round, but the bee population is in big trouble.

More than one-third of the crops we eat are pollinated by bees, but 40% of bee colonies are collapsing each year, California-based Beewise said.

One reason is climate change – specifically, stronger hurricanes, more frequent fires and the use of more pesticides.

The wooden beehive was invented around 1850 for commercial pollination, but these basic boxes are not very protective and not at all nurturing.

Startup Beewise is taking on the traditional beehive with AI and robotics. The company invented the BeeHome, a robotic, AI-directed beehive that growers can rent.

""A robotic beehive is essentially like a traditional beehive. It's completely backwards compatible, so it uses the same frame, same bees. We populate these robotic beehives, and in that robotic beehive, there's cameras that monitor the bees,"" said Saar Safra, CEO of Beewise.

The cameras connect with AI software that monitors each individual bee and identifies its needs. The robotic apparatus can then treat the bees according to their characteristics.

""So if there's not enough food in the hive, there's a food container inside this robotic beehive and the robot will take some food supply to the bees. Same thing with medicine, thermoregulation, too cold, too warm, there's a storm. We can keep the bees comfortable in their home without them being harmed by external weather patterns,"" said Safra.

Last year, hurricanes Helene and Milton damaged or destroyed thousands of commercial beehives in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina alone.

The BeeHome costs about the same as the traditional wooden beehive and can robotically manage up to 10 hives each, saving growers on labor costs. Next-gen products could scale that up dramatically — a feature particularly attractive to investors.

""You'll be looking at a BeeHome in a few years that can not only manage 10, but go up to 40 or more. And that's where you get a lot of operating margin and operating profit off of the same investment,"" said John Caddedu, co-founder and general partner at Corner Ventures.

Safra said the Beehome results in 70% lower bee colony loss and healthier hives. There are already thousands of these operating in the field. Safra said revenue, device and customer growth have been enormous, adding that the devices are seeing gross margins of 40%.  

In addition to Corner Ventures, Beewise is backed by Insight Partners, Fortissimo, Lool Ventures, and APG. Its total funding so far is $170 million.

Julie Peck

 September 18, 2025  

The World Health Organization (WHO) added cardiovascular polypills to its 2023 Model List of Essential Medicines, and research continues to show that these medications are effective at preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACD) among various other forms of cardiovascular disease. Yet experts say obstacles remain to the adoption of these medications in high-income developed nations.

“These medications are saving lives,” said Anubha Agarwal, MD, assistant professor of medicine of cardiology and co-director of the program in global cardiovascular health at WashU Medicine in St. Louis. “There is not a financial incentive to produce them, which is an issue in high-income countries like the US and the UK.” 

Agarwal said other issues make the introduction of cardiovascular polypills to high-income markets problematic as well, including providers' preference to stabilize patients on separate medications, while also having some flexibility with their separate components.

“With older patients, who can be more sensitive to blood pressure-lowering medications, and where clinicians are more liberal with tolerances of the upper ranges of blood pressure, there can be some concern about fixed-dose polypills,” she said.

Anthony Rodgers, PhD, a senior professorial fellow at The George Institute for Global Health at the University of New South Wales Sydney in Sydney, Australia, and chair of clinical epidemiology at Imperial College London, London, England, is another leading researcher in the area of cardiovascular polypills, who has collaborated with Agarwal on several studies. Rodgers added that the innovative uses of established medicines aren't incentivized enough, even where their potential for health impact is sizable.

“The cost, time, and risk of developing and getting regulatory approval for a polypill are significant, way beyond the norm for standard generic medicine approval but also way less than for a new chemical entity approval, and our reimbursement systems just don't encourage companies — generics or Big Pharma — to address that need ‘in the middle ground,'” he said.

“We need to enable much more effective and cost-effective methods for prescribers to learn about novel products involving established medicines,” Rodgers said. “Polypills aren't the only example; this is a problem seen in many therapeutic areas.”

Agarwal was the lead investigator in a meta-analysis of research between 2016 and 2022 on the effects of fixed-dose combination therapy, also known as polypill therapy, on ACD. Rodgers also participated.

In this analysis, which was published in the April 2024 issue of Nature Medicine, patients in both primary and secondary populations on this form of medication measured lower in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and systolic blood pressure, and had higher rates of adherence. The study also indicated higher rates of adverse events, including muscle aches, increased liver enzymes, cough, and gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding; however, Agarwal said that these were generally not hugely impactful.

“These side effects weren't dramatic overall, especially in light of the severity of ACD and its burden,” she said. “Additionally, the adverse effect profile does not differ significantly when taking the medications included in the polypills separately as opposed to in just one fixed-dose medication.”

Agarwal noted that some of the polypills included in the earlier trials included in the meta-analysis included aspirin, which was not included in some of the later medications studied, as the thinking on aspirin has evolved in more recent years, especially as a therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular events and in people older than 60 years.

Unfortunately, neither researcher thinks that the adoption of polypills for the treatment of ACD is likely to take place anytime soon in the US or other high-income developed nations. Rodgers said the inclusion of these medications on the WHO's essential medicines list is an important step, but one that won't change outcomes much in these more well-off countries.

“I think most people would regard WHO EML [essential medicines list] inclusion as a necessary but not sufficient step to getting widespread access in low- and middle-income countries,” Rodgers said. “No question it is a hugely important step, which would hopefully stimulate inclusion on national essential medicines lists and procurement; coupled with response by companies to make (them) affordable and available.”

However, these researchers and others continue to show the efficacy of polypills in the battle against various kinds of cardiovascular disease.

“We are currently running trials in Sri Lanka using a polypill against heart failure with reduced ejection fraction that is showing a lot of promise, and we have an application filed for similar trial here in the US,” Agarwal said. “We will also be running trials on heart failure without reduced ejection fraction.” 

Agarwal, Rodgers, and their colleagues continue to demonstrate that polypills save lives in the fight against cardiovascular disease. Agarwal does not give in to frustration over the lack of progress about the adoption of these combination medicines in markets like the US and the UK.

“I certainly hope they will become available over time given the evidence supporting their use in primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,” she said.

Emma Navarro saved two match points, Elena Rybakina struck back for Kazakhstan, and Jessica Pegula teamed with Taylor Townsend to clinch the doubles and send the U.S. into the last four.

The United States, the most successful nation in Billie Jean King Cup history, advanced to the semifinals with a 2-1 win over Kazakhstan in Thursday's first quarterfinal.

After the singles were split, the tie was decided in doubles -- the first of this week's quarterfinals to hinge on the final rubber.

Navarro saves two match points in thriller against Putintseva

In the opening match, World No. 18 Emma Navarro took on No. 61 Yulia Putintseva. The American dropped an early break but recovered to claim the first set 7-5. Putintseva answered with her trademark variety, unsettling Navarro to take the second set 6-2, then broke early for a 2-0 lead in the third.

Navarro fought back to level the decider and forced a tiebreak. At 6-4, Putintseva held two match points, but the 24-year-old American held her nerve, reeling off four straight points to close out a 7-5, 2-6, 7-6 (6) win in 2 hours, 31 minutes and give the U.S. a 1-0 lead.

Rybakina levels tie with dominant win over Pegula

With Kazakhstan needing a response, former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina faced US Open semifinalist Jessica Pegula in a Top 10 showdown.

Rybakina built a 4-1 lead before Pegula steadied to reach 4-4 in the first set. From there, the Kazakh took control, winning eight of the next nine games to close out a 6-4, 6-1 victory in just over an hour and level the tie at 1-1.

Pegula/ Townsend clinch doubles to seal semifinal spot

In the winner-takes-all doubles, the United States paired Pegula with World No. 1 Taylor Townsend, while Kazakhstan fielded Rybakina and Putintseva.

The Americans started fast, taking the opening set 6-2. The Kazakh duo surged ahead 4-1 in the second, but Pegula and Townsend fought back to 4-4, then saved two set points in the 12th game to force a tiebreak. They dominated the tiebreak to close out a 6-2, 7-6 (1) win and secure the United States' place in the semifinals.

U.S. to face winner of Great Britain-Japan tie

The Americans, chasing their first title since 2017, will meet the winner of the Great Britain–Japan quarterfinal, scheduled later on Thursday. Both nations are chasing their first BJK Cup title and are without their top-ranked stars, with Emma Raducanu (Britain) and Naomi Osaka (Japan) unavailable. Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal lead Britain, while Moyuka Uchijima and Ena Shibahara front the Japanese team.

Earlier in the week, five-time champion Italy and Ukraine -- seeking its first title -- advanced to Friday's semifinal with 2-0 wins over China and Spain, respectively.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

McLaren's Norris 'reasonably confident' of 'another good weekend' as constructors' title beckons

IndyCar winner and F1 TV analyst James Hinchcliffe explains what Herta will bring to the new Cadillac team – and why he's given up a front-running seat in IndyCar to chase his F1 dream.

If you are even a remote Formula 1 fan you've no doubt heard the recent news about IndyCar star Colton Herta forfeiting his place as a front runner in the American championship to take on a role as Cadillac F1's new test and development driver.

His role with Cadillac will be dovetailed with a season racing in F2, with the aim of getting a better grasp of the circuits, the cadence of F1 weekends and the very particular traits of Pirelli racing rubber. Herta's ultimate goal is a race seat in F1 with the General Motors-backed outfit.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

McLaren's Norris 'reasonably confident' of 'another good weekend' as constructors' title beckons

Heading to the Azerbaijan Grand Prix? Our fan guide takes you from the Old City's castle walls to the fast straight along the Caspian coast – including travel, photos, food and insider tips for a thrilling Baku race weekend.

Few races on the Formula 1 calendar have as dramatic a backdrop as the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. In Baku, history and horsepower collide – cars threading between centuries-old stone walls with the wind whipping in from the Caspian Sea, and an epic street circuit that has quickly built a reputation for chaos, drama and unforgettable racing.

Are you heading to the Azerbaijan Grand Prix? From the castle-lined corners of the street circuit to sunset strolls along the Caspian, this guide covers travel, Fanzone musts, photo hotspots, local food and the little hacks that make a Baku weekend unforgettable.

Arriving Wednesday or Thursday? Here's how to start your Baku adventure slowly and ease in gently before the roar of engines takes over the streets.

Old City dawn walk

Head into Icherisheher (the Old City) as the sun rises. Ancient stone walls, quiet alleyways, and the sight of the Maiden Tower in the morning light make for a peaceful counterpoint to race day energy. Perfect with tea or Azerbaijani breakfast pastries – which range from variations of buttery pastry, syrupy nutty fillings, with delicate spiced notes (such as Baklava and Shekerbura) to sweet candies (Nogul) and cookies (Kurabiye).

Breakfast on Nizami Street

For a relaxed start, Nizami Street offers cafes and bakeries where locals begin their day with tea, pastries, or Azerbaijani coffee – from the rich and bold traditional flavour to sweet fruity notes in specialty variations. Great for people-watching and easing jet lag before taking on the action over the weekend.

Ateshgah Fire Temple

Around 30 minutes outside central Baku, this centuries-old fire temple is built on natural gas vents that once kept flames burning eternally. It's small, atmospheric, and makes a fascinating half-a-day outing.

Yanardag – The Burning Mountain

Also a short trip from the city, Yanardag is a hillside where natural gas seeps keep flames alive on the earth's surface. It's otherworldly, especially in the evening glow, and still a light-energy visit.

Airport to city

The main international airport (Heydar Aliyev) connects you to the city via buses, taxis, or rideshares. Allow ~30-40 minutes depending on traffic.

Local transport

Baku has buses and a metro system. Taxis / ride-hailing are good options for getting between your hotel, the Fanzone, and the Old City. Walking works well in the city centre, but street circuit sections may require shuttles or local buses depending on road closures.

Tickets & timing

Watch for special transport or shuttle arrangements around race sessions (when roads close). Arrive early, especially on Sunday, to secure good views.

The Baku circuit is one of F1's most photogenic, with key moments and photo opportunities everywhere.

Must-see corners & views

The long main straight gives you speed and drama. The Castle section (near the Old City) is tight and visually striking, but walls, elevation changes, city buildings and street lighting add to the atmosphere all around the circuit.

Fanzone

The Fanzone will feature driver appearances, interactive experiences and activities, food stalls, and merchandise opportunities. Ideal for photos and absorbing the vibrant race atmosphere.

Maiden tower – Panoramic views of the Old City and the Caspian.

Palace of the Shirvanshahs – Stunning courtyards and stone carvings.

Flame Towers – Lit up at night, they dominate the skyline.

Baku boulevard – Best at golden hour or sunset, with the sea as a breathtaking backdrop.

Icherisheher's narrow streets – Atmospheric selfies against historic walls and ornate wooden balconies.

If you're curious to see more, here's some more shots to add to your gallery:

Camera etiquette

Be aware that in some areas there will be signage forbidding photography, particularly near government or sensitive buildings.

Fan hack

Best lighting is early morning sunrise, approximately between 06:00 and 07:00, or golden hour between 18:00 and 19:00 in the evening. Also, get to popular corners early (or better still, on Friday) to get “clean shots” before the grandstands fill over the race weekend.

When the racing's over, the Azerbaijan's capital city has plenty to offer fans:

Seaside promenade

Walk along Baku's coastal boulevard at sunset, with the Caspian breeze in your face and food stalls dotted along the way. It's a calm way to unwind after a fun-filled day.

Old City at night

As the evening winds down, the cobbled streets are wrapped in a warm glow as lights soften, traditional music fills the streets, and tea houses are filled with the buzz of games and conversation, while serving night owls until late.

Concerts & entertainment

Keep the party going in Baku with the concerts and entertainment at Crystal Hall — with Anyma (electronic) performing on the Friday night, and Glass Animals (alt-pop) and Martin Garrix (electronic) performing on the Saturday evening. It's a lively option if you want to keep the energy high post-event.

No F1 weekend is complete without local flavour. In Azerbaijan, you'll find plenty of hearty, fragrant dishes to enjoy...

Plov

A saffron-tinted rice dish with lamb, dried fruits and herbs – the national staple.

Dolma

Vegetables or vine leaves stuffed with spiced mince and rice, usually served with yoghurt.

Kebabs/Shashlik

Grilled skewers, perfect for a late dinner.

Black Tea (Çay)

Served in pear-shaped glasses, often with sweets or jam – a daily ritual in Azerbaijan.

Here are some useful tips to help your trip run smoother and feel more local:

Arrive early

Arrive early each day, especially on Sunday, if you're in general admission as the best viewing spots fill fast.

Dress in layers

Heat, wind, and shade can all hit in the same day.

Carry some cash

Whilst many places do accept card, smaller food stalls or tea houses may prefer manat.

Be careful where you point your camera

Be careful with photography near government or sensitive buildings; if signage forbids, don't risk it.

Keep hydrated and wear sunscreen

Even in late September the daytime heat can be strong, especially near waterfront areas.

Learn a few phrases

Thank you – “sag olun”. Pronunciation: sah oh-LOON.

Good morning – “sabahınız xeyir”. Pronunciation: sah-bah-uh-nuhz khey-eer. Show respect and you will enjoy warm local interactions.

The duo are the latest act to remove their music from the streaming platform.

	Thomas Smith



Massive Attack is the latest artist to pull their music from Spotify in all territories. The trip-hop duo shared the news on Thursday (Sep. 18) via a post on their Instagram. 


	The group announced they were a part of the ‘No Music For Genocide' initiative which has seen over 400 artists and labels request that their music is removed from DSPs (digital service platforms) in Israel. Joining them include artists Faye Webster, Arca, MIKE, Japanese Breakfast and more.


	The duo's statement then adds that they have requested that Universal Music Group remove their music from Spotify in all territories, owing to reported investments made by the streaming service's CEO Daniel Ek through his investment fund Prima Materia. Since 2021, Prima Materia has been investing in Helsing, a defense company that sells AI software to inform military decisions. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	The band wrote, “Unconnected to this initiative & in light of the (reported) significant investments by its CEO in a company producing military munition drones & Al technology integrated into fighter aircraft, Massive Attack have made a separate request to our label that our music be removed from the Spotify streaming service in all territories.”


	The band has released a number of LPs via Universal's Virgin Records, including 1991's Blue Lines and 1997's Mezzanine; their last album, Heligoland, was released in 2010. Universal Music has been approached for comment on the request. At time of press, the group's music remains on the service.


	The group's statement provided additional context for their decision to join the No Music For Genocide initiative. “In our view, the historic precedent of effective artist action during apartheid South Africa and the apartheid, war crimes and genocide now being committed by the state of Israel renders the “No Music For Genocide” campaign imperative,” the group wrote.


	“In the separate case of Spotify, the economic burden that has long been placed on artists is now compounded by a moral & ethical burden, whereby the hard-earned money of fans & the creative endeavours of musicians ultimately funds lethal, dystopian technologies. Enough is more than enough. Another way is possible.” 


	Massive Attack are the latest act to withdraw their music from Spotify, following King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Xiu Xiu, Hotline TNT and more.

Executive Editor, Television


David Letterman has come out swinging.


	The “great grandfather” of late-night television reacted to the news that Jimmy Kimmel Live! was put on pause by ABC after FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened the network over Kimmel's comments about the alleged killer of Charlie Kirk.


	Letterman, speaking Thursday at The Atlantic Festival, called the move “misery.” “It's ridiculous. You can't go around firing somebody because you're fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian criminal administration in the Oval Office, that's just not how this works.”


	The former host of The Late Show said that he had been texting with Kimmel after the move. “He's sitting up in bed taking nourishment, he's going to be fine.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Letterman joked that he was doing the same thing for 30 years. “We all see where this going. It's managed media and it's no good,” he said.


	He pointed out that he made jokes about six Presidents from Jimmy Carter through to Barack Obama, although he laughed that “not so much” about Carter, he was a “sweet guy.”


	“The point is beating up on these people, rightly or wrongly, accurately or perhaps inaccurately in the name of comedy, not once were we squeezed by anyone from any governmental agency, let alone the dreaded FCC,” he said.


	Letterman also called out Carr. “This guy [at] the FCC said, ‘We can do things the easy way. We can do things the hard way.' Who is hiring these goons? Mario Puzo?” he joked.


	It comes two months after Letterman also shared his views on the cancelation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. “I don't think it was money,” Letterman said on a video on the Letterman YouTube channel. “This is pure cowardice.”

Why does nobody mention what happened to Bill Maher in 2001?  Same exact thing and also on ABC.  This is not some new thing. People's obsession with Trump has clouded their rationale.

It's been mentioned several times in various publications over last couple days including the LA Times.

No, that was not the “same exact thing”. JFC!

He got fired for purposefully lying about the ideology of an assassin. Wtf is this guy talking about?

Every word out of Trumps mouth is a lie. To bad we can't fire him.

He's talking about the FCC strong arming networks into shutting up people that criticize Trump. Trump himself said that Kimmel would be next on the chopping block two months ago when Colbert was fired. You have to be a cult member or just absent in the mind to take what they say at face value. Especially when you can read/see Kimmel's own words and realize he made no insinuation that Robinson was rightwing, but that MAGA was doing everything they could to prove the killer wasn't one of them. Those were his words. But let you all tell it, Kimmel said “I KNEW IT ROBINSON IS MAGA AND ALWAYS WAS”. Same ole “believe what I tell you is true, not what you see or hear.”

Incredibly terrible take on what was actually said on your part.  If there was any more spin doctoring going on, there'd be a tornado warning.

So Jimmy Kimmel did not lie about the political ideology of the shooter? FBI, DA, Governor, bullet casings, texts, online search history, family statements are all fake? Dude, grow up.

he didn't lie. do you know anyone on the left who listens to nick fuentes? i sure don't, the left hates that guy.

EXCLUSIVE: Sundance prize-winning animator-director Jeron Braxton has brought an A-list cast around Scott “Kid Cudi” Mescudi for Slime, the animated feature marking his feature debut, on which we first reported in 2023. Newcomers to the ensemble will include Willow Smith (I Am Legend), One Battle After Another breakout Teyana Taylor, Emmy and Golden Globe winner Anna Sawai (Shōgun), John Cho (Tempest) and BAFTA winner John Boyega (The Woman King), sources tell Deadline.


	We're told Smith is set to play the lead role of Muna, with voice work starting next month. Character details for the others are under wraps.

	Set in a too-near future, Slime follows Muna (Smith), an optimistic but broke young woman who signs up for a paid clinical trial, only to be injected with a mysterious creature's slime that unleashes destructive powers she can't control. On the run, she kidnaps Glenn (Mescudi), the lab worker who injected her, and the two set out on a perilous odyssey through a crumbling dystopian world in search of refuge and a cure. But as the clock runs out, is Muna transforming into humanity's worst nightmare or its last, unlikely savior?


	Set to feature an original soundtrack and score by Kid Cudi, the film is described as an anime-inspired pre-apocalyptic sci-fi monster flick with retro video-game aesthetics. Hammerstone Studios is financing the project with Script 2 Screen and producing alongside Mad Solar and Capstone Pictures. Producers include Alex Lebovici, Mescudi, Karina Manashil, Smith, and Aaron Bergman. Ibrahim Mohammed, Chase Vergari, Craig Peck, Dennis Cummings, Brian Ash, Michael Learner, Jon Oakes, Christian Mercuri, Courtney Chenn, Waylen Lin and Alex Kaplunov are serving as exec producers.


	Smith is repped by CAA, manager Sim Hothi, Hertz Lichtenstein Young & Polk, and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern; Taylor by WME; Sawai by WME, 42, United Agents and Chris Abramson; Cho by 3 Arts, UTA and Yorn, Levine, Barnes; and Boyega by UTA and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern. Sacker Entertainment Law reps Hammerstone and is handling production legal.
