Texas-based barbecue pitmaster Erica Blaire Roby shares her step-by-step recipe for a game day burger stuffed with bold flavor, smoky beef bacon and a splash of beer. Sept. 18 marks National Cheeseburger Day in the United States. The combination of grilled beef, creamy American cheese and juicy pickles on a soft bun makes it a staple from barbecues to fast-food drive-thrus. "We use only fresh, never frozen beef, seared on a grill after you order," the Wisconsin-based chain's website states. "Topped with real American cheese made in Wisconsin and served on a lightly buttered, toasted bun." While prices vary by location, ButterBurgers are generally affordable, with Culver's site listing it at $5.50. Culver's ButterBurger has become a Midwestern pride point, thanks to its fresh beef and buttery bun. The ShackBurger is the signature burger of Shake Shack, a chain that began in New York but has since expanded to 30 states. Shake Shack's website describes the made-to-order burger as having "a quarter pound per patty of 100% Angus beef." Shake Shack's ShackBurger balances crisp lettuce, tomato and sauce with its juicy Angus beef patty. Many Americans flock to Five Guys for its delicious burgers and fries — plus the barrels of peanuts and quaint checkered decor. The burger features "American-style cheese melted between fresh patties and placed on a soft, toasted sesame seed bun," the website states. A Five Guys cheeseburger can cost upwards of $11, making it an expensive choice but one that's still a favorite. Five Guys has earned a loyal following with its greasy, customizable cheeseburgers served on sesame seed buns. The Our Burger from Wahlburgers features a certified Angus Beef patty, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles, per the chain's website. Started by actor Mark Wahlberg and his brothers Paul and Donnie, the chain also adds a helping of Wahl Sauce, a ketchup-based sauce, to each Our Burger order. The burger costs between $9 and $11, depending on location. The Quarter Pounder with Cheese debuted nationally in 1973 and has been a staple for McDonald's fans since. "Each Quarter Pounder with Cheese burger features a ¼-lb. of 100% fresh beef that's hot, deliciously juicy and cooked when you order," McDonald's website states. "Each fresh beef burger is seasoned with just a pinch of salt and pepper, sizzled on a flat iron grill, then topped with slivered onions, tangy pickles and two slices of melty American cheese on a sesame seed bun." A Quarter Pounder with Cheese is also one of the most budget-friendly cheeseburgers. It can cost between $5 and $7, depending on the location. McDonald's iconic Quarter Pounder with Cheese has been a fan favorite since its national debut in 1973. Although the Quarter Pounder with Cheese was ranked fifth, a Georgia-based restaurateur told Fox News Digital that it stood out to him the most. Donnie Gale, director of culinary at Big Table Restaurants, said the burger "has stood the test of time and done so on a global stage." "I spent years traveling overseas, and no matter the country, the Quarter Pounder with Cheese was a taste of home," he said. "To this day, the first bite of a Quarter Pounder instantly brings me back to the day I convinced my mother I was too old for Happy Meals and wanted a Quarter Pounder. She said yes, and the rest is history." Readers can follow her on X at @andreamargs or send story tips to andrea.margolis@fox.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Irish novelist Sally Rooney skipped an awards ceremony in London, saying that she risked being arrested under terror laws due to her support for the banned activist group Palestine Action. London's Metropolitan Police told CNN in a statement Thursday it “wouldn't comment on an individual at the point of arrest or prior to this.” CNN has reached out to Rooney and Bowler for comment through Faber, her publisher. British authorities have had their eyes   on the group since 2020, but its June 2025 action – when activists broke into Britain's largest airbase, RAF Brize Norton, vandalizing two Airbus Voyager refueling planes – led to its proscription. Civil liberties campaigners across the UK and beyond have condemned the designation, saying that applying terrorism laws to such a group risk chilling free speech and assembly and sets a dangerous precedent for protest rights. Since its terror designation, more than 1,500 individuals have been arrested at solidarity protests across the UK, many for holding signs that read: “I oppose genocide. In August, Rooney also denounced the ban, writing an Irish Times column titled: “I too support Palestine Action. If this makes me a ‘supporter of terror' under UK law, so be it.” She wrote that “an increasing number of artists and writers can no longer safely travel to Britain to speak in public” and that she intended to take the residual fees from BBC adaptations of her first two novels to donate them toward “supporting Palestine Action and direct action against genocide in whatever way I can.” A United Nations commission concluded this week that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. “If the British state considers this ‘terrorism,'” Rooney wrote, “then perhaps it should investigate the shady organizations that continue to promote my work and fund my activities, such as WH Smith and the BBC.” CNN has reached out to the retailer WH Smith. A spokesperson for the BBC told CNN in a statement that Rooney does not currently receive payment directly from the BBC, “and she is not contracted by us.” Rooney, best known for her novel “Normal People” and its subsequent adaptation for TV, has long criticized Israel's occupation of the West Bank and its pre-war blockade of Gaza. In 2021, she refused to sell the Hebrew-language rights for her third novel “Beautiful World, Where Are You” to an Israeli publisher out of her support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a Palestinian-led global campaign promoting boycotts, divestments, and economic sanctions against Israel. “If the Government in Dublin truly believes that Israel is committing genocide,” Rooney said, “how can it look elsewhere while its nearest neighbor funds and supports that genocide and its own citizens are arrested simply for speaking out?” CNN has reached out to Ireland's Foreign Ministry for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump argues that Jimmy Kimmel's talk show was pulled because of “bad ratings.” Speaking in Aylesbury, Trump also said Kimmel said a “horrible thing” about Charlie Kirk. PM Keir Starmer defends Britain's record on free speech. A pedestrian walks past Jimmy Kimmel's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame after ABC suspended his late-night show indefinitely over his remarks about Charlie Kirk's death, Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025, in Los Angeles. Brendan Carr listens during a Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation committee hearing to examine the Federal Communications Commission on Capitol Hill in Washington, June 24, 2020. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has used threats, lawsuits and government pressure as he remakes the American media landscape, unleashing his long-standing grievances against an industry that has mocked, criticized and scorned him for years. Now Trump is escalating his campaign of censure and retaliation, invigorated by successful efforts to push ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air for his commentary on conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One while returning from Great Britain on Thursday, Trump said federal regulators should consider revoking broadcast licenses for networks that “give me only bad publicity.” It was the kind of brute force response that Trump and his loyalists have routinely flexed since the Republican president returned to the White House with a vow to retaliate against critics and political opponents. Trump has already reached settlements with ABC and CBS over their coverage. Republicans in Congress stripped federal funding from NPR and PBS. At the FCC, Carr has used his influence to target diversity, equity and inclusion programs and to root out what he describes as liberal bias. Attorney General Pam Bondi recently said that “we will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.” Her words alarmed advocates who fear an elastic definition of the term could be used to criminalize dissent. Bondi later revised her comments to say she was focused on “hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence.” Todd Blanche, Bondi's deputy, suggested that protesters could have violated the law by yelling at Trump while he visited a restaurant near the White House. “Is it sheer happenstance that individuals show up at a restaurant where the president is trying to enjoy dinner in Washington, D.C., and accost him with vile words and vile anger?” Blanche said. He said authorities could investigate whether it's “part of an organized effort to inflict harm and terror and damage to the United States.” The latest saga with Kimmel began Monday night with the comedian's commentary about last week's shooting of Kirk, which took place on a college campus in Utah. “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said. Authorities have not formally presented a motive for the killing, but evidence indicates that he held liberal beliefs. Spencer Cox, R-Utah, has said “there clearly was a leftist ideology,” On Wednesday, Carr appeared on a podcast hosted by Benny Johnson, a conservative commentator, and accused Kimmel of the “sickest conduct possible.” Carr said “you could make a strong argument that this is sort of an intentional effort to mislead the American people about a very core fundamental fact.” “He smashed the facade that they get to control what we say, what we think, the narrative around events,” Carr said. “And we're seeing a lot of consequences from President Trump doing that.” Reminding affiliates that their broadcast licenses come with an “obligation to operate in the public interest,” Carr said “it's time for them to step up” and say Kimmel's content “isn't something that we think serves the needs of our local communities.” It didn't take long for Nexstar Media Group, the country's biggest operator of television stations, to echo some of Carr's language. ABC soon announced that Kimmel would be taken off the air. It is unclear when or whether he will return. Later in the evening, the television company Sinclair said its stations would carry “a special in remembrance of Charlie Kirk” on Friday during Kimmel's usual time slot. The news of Kimmel's suspension broke after midnight in Britain, where Trump was traveling for a state visit. But the president soon posted on Truth Social, his social media platform, to celebrate what he called “Great News for America.”</p>

President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hold a joint news conference from Aylesbury, England, during the president's second official state visit to the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused President Donald Trump of exploiting the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in order to go after critics. Schumer's charge came as Senate Democrats teed up legislation called the "No Political Enemies Act," which would prohibit Trump and his administration from weaponizing government agencies. It comes in the wake of late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel's sidelining by ABC over comments he made related to Kirk. The top Senate Democrat said freedom of speech is "one of the great hallmarks of our country" but that the Trump administration "is trying to snuff it out." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused President Donald Trump of exploiting the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. "Those who break the law, of course, resort to any source of violence ought to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," Schumer said. "But using the tragic death of Charlie Kirk as an excuse to supercharge the political witch hunt against critics is abhorrent, obnoxious and as un-American as it gets." "To attack civil society, whether it's Jimmy Kimmel, civil society organizations or the Trump administration's perceived political enemies, its crusade is unending," he continued. "And this is one of the saddest parts of all, because of congressional Republicans' obeisance to Trump, it's unchecked because they are scared to stand up to Trump." Charlie Kirk speaks at CPAC in Oxon Hill, Maryland. It would also hold officials accountable for using their office to go after critics, ensure courts quickly dismiss "abusive actions," and provide due process for U.S. nonprofits that the government tries to "label as criminal or terrorist organizations." President Donald Trump walks to Air Force One at Morristown Airport on Sept. 14, 2025, in New Jersey. Their legislative push also comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi said earlier this week that the administration would "go after you if you are targeting anyone with hate speech." "The shooting of Charlie Kirk was a national tragedy," he said. "It should have been a line in the sand, an opportunity for President Trump to bring this country together to do whatever is necessary to stamp out political violence that's targeted both Republicans and Democrats, political violence that emanates from both right-wing and left-wing radicalization." "But Trump and his lieutenants are choosing a different path," he continued. A DOJ spokesperson referred Fox News Digital to statements Bondi made on her X page, including where she told reporters that the First Amendment is "one of the most important amendments, of course, in our Constitution.

LONDON — President Donald Trump‘s Marine One presidential helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing while traveling from Chequers to London‘s Stansted Airport.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump were aboard the helicopter as the first leg of their journey back to the United States after a state visit when the pilots made an unexpected landing.

“Due to a minor hydraulic issue, and out of an abundance of caution, the pilots landed at a local airfield before reaching Stansted airport,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “The president and first lady safely boarded the support helicopter.”

Trump arrived roughly 20 minutes behind the traveling press pool, but the White House did not provide an explanation for the delay before Air Force One took off for Washington.

TRUMP SAYS PUTIN ‘LET ME DOWN' AS RUSSIA-UKRAINE PEACE DEAL STALLS

During a gaggle with reporters shortly after takeoff, Trump joked that he hoped they all made it home safely.

“Fly safely. You know why I say that? Because I'm on the flight,” he said with a laugh. “Otherwise, I wouldn't care.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A gate is seen at the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, Friday, June 25, 2021. President Donald Trump has suggested he's working to reestablish a U.S. presence at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. President Donald Trump speaks during a joint press conference with Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers near Aylesbury, England, Thursday, Sept. 18, 2025. President Donald Trump and Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer leave after a joint press conference at Chequers near Aylesbury, England, Thursday, Sept. 18, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested that he is working to reestablish a U.S. presence at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, four years after America's chaotic withdrawal from the country left the base in the Taliban's hands. “We're trying to get it back,” Trump said of the base in an aside to a question about ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about whether it or the Pentagon has done any planning around returning to the sprawling air base, which was central to America's longest war. The 20-year conflict came to an end in disquieting fashion under President Joe Biden: The U.S.-backed Afghan government collapsed, a grisly bombing killed 13 U.S. troops and 170 others, and thousands of desperate Afghans descended on Kabul's airport in search of a way out before the final U.S. aircraft departed over the Hindu Kush. The Afghanistan debacle was a major setback just eight months into Biden's Democratic presidency that he struggled to recover from. Those criticisms have persisted into the present day, including as recently as last week, when Trump claimed the move emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine in February 2022. “They just went through the Afghanistan total disaster for no reason whatsoever. We were going to leave Afghanistan, but we were going to leave it with strength and dignity. Asked again about the proposal hours later on Air Force One, Trump offered no details but again bashed Biden for “gross incompetence” and said the base should have “never been given back.” “It's one of the most powerful bases in the world in terms of runway strength and length,” he said. You can land a planet on top of it.” But Trump hinted that the Taliban, who have struggled with an economic crisis, international legitimacy, internal rifts and rival militant groups since their return to power in 2021, could be game to allow the U.S. military to return. “We're trying to get it back because they need things from us,” Trump said of the Taliban. The president repeated his view that a U.S. presence at Bagram is of value because of its proximity to China, the most significant economic and military competitor to the United States. “But one of the reasons we want that base is, as you know, it's an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,” Trump said. An American man who was abducted more than two years ago while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist was released by the Taliban in March. Last week, the Taliban also said they reached an agreement with U.S. envoys on an exchange of prisoners as part of an effort to normalize relations between the United States and Afghanistan. The Taliban released photographs from their talks, showing their foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, with Trump's special envoy for hostage response, Adam Boehler. Officials at U.S. Central Command in the Middle East and the Pentagon, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office, referred questions about reestablishing a presence at Bagram to the White House.</p>

Officials on Thursday identified the three police officers that were killed when they were ambushed while responding to a domestic call Wednesday in York County, Pennsylvania. The fallen included Northern York County Regional Police Department's Sgt. Cody Becker, Detective Mark Baker and Detective Isaiah Emenheiser, according to York County District Attorney Tim Barker. Another Northern York County Regional Police detective and a York County Sheriff's Office deputy were critically wounded, but remain stable at the hospital, Barker said. The suspected gunman, identified as Matthew James Ruth, 24, was killed by police, officials said. He did not have any prior criminal convictions. First responders work the scene after five officers were shot on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025, in North Codorus, Pa.  (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) Barker said that the investigation began on Tuesday night, when Ruth's ex-girlfriend's mother reported seeing him on her property in camouflage, peering into the home with binoculars. Trail camera footage showed Ruth armed with an AR-15-style rifle, and his truck was left nearby. The ex-girlfriend also told police her pickup truck was set on fire in August, but she was not sure if Ruth was to blame, so she requested they not investigate. Detectives returned to the empty home just after 2 p.m. Wednesday, and as they walked through the unlocked front door, the suspect launched an ambush, firing multiple suppressed rounds, according to Barker. Ruth was later killed in a final shootout near the road. Police officers ride during a procession Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025, in Spring Grove, Pa., after multiple police officers were shot and killed. "All actions by law enforcement were justified. I can't imagine the strength and the fortitude that it takes to immediately, after having seen and been engaged in that … immediately thinking of rendering critical aid." "If the actor was not eliminated, and his threat and murderous rampage eliminated, who knows where this would have stopped." Prior to the shooting, Ruth was charged with stalking, trespassing, loitering and prowling at night in relation to the investigation, court documents show. The FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the Pennsylvania State Police are assisting local authorities. The shooting, which took place about 115 miles west of Philadelphia in North Codorus Township, came just a few months after another York County officer was killed in the line of duty. Josh Shapiro said during a news conference Wednesday he is continuing to pray for everyone involved. "This is an absolutely tragic and devastating day for your county and for the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania," Shapiro said. We continue to pray for the full recovery of those who are dealing with their wounds." The Associated Press contributed to this report.

His picture was chosen as the overall winner from a field of more than 15,000 images submitted by photographers all over the world, with nine category winners also selected. “The winners of this year's Ocean Photographer of the Year remind us that photography is more than art – it is a bridge. Their images connect people to the ocean in ways words cannot, reaching those who may never dive in it or paddle on it, but whose lives are deeply intertwined with it,” said Will Harrison, director of Ocean Photographer of the Year, in the release. “In a time of planetary urgency, this year's photographers invite the world to see, feel, and ultimately care.

During a joint news conference Thursday with President Donald Trump, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the assassination of Charlie Kirk should "be condemned." The sports world continues to be shaken up by the assassination of Charlie Kirk last week. Kirk was shot while debating at Utah Valley University and died of his injuries soon after. Many prominent figures in sports reacted to the news, and in a recent appearance on Logan Paul's podcast, UFC president Dana White shared his thoughts. UFC President Dana White speaks during a press conference ahead of UFC 264 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, on July 8, 2021. Charlie Kirk, CEO of Turning Point USA, speaks on the first day of the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 15, 2024. I was f---ing blown away," White said. "I was actually surprised by how impacted my kids were. My kids used to watch him on social media. You have to feel horrible for his family. "The fact that it happened during what he was known for, which was just peaceful debate and conversation, which was a pillar of American virtue," added Paul. "This country was built on people having conversation and talking to people maybe you don't always agree with and hopefully reaching a resolution -- or even if not, saying we respectfully. But that's a lot of the times how progress is made." "When you are unable to talk, shoot and go to violence is just so pathetic," Paul continued. White replied, "That's what happens with people who aren't intelligent enough to debate." Paul also said he "really respected" Kirk for "his ability to step into a room and be the person who he said he was."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(AP) — Every day, LaRanda Schoolcraft drives five minutes down the hill from her Terra Alta home to visit the family member she calls her “person.” “My grandpa has dementia now and doesn't always make sense,” she said. Carl Schoolcraft, originally from Clendenin, has a white beard that nursing home workers keep well trimmed. He used to dress as Santa Claus each year. His granddaughter says the nurses and aides at Hopemont Hospital see him as their adopted grandfather. And while the company says it has no plans to cut staff, public records show it employs fewer nursing staff on average at its facilities in other states than are employed at the state's hospitals. For people like Schoolcraft, living at home until the end of life isn't an option. With few family members left, Schoolcraft lived alone, but his granddaughter checked on him every day. Earlier this year, she arrived to find the man who built her a treehouse beyond her ability to care for him, and she moved him to the state-owned nursing home. He was diagnosed with a fatal brain disease that causes dementia and other problems like confusion and trouble with mobility. “I ask them about their lives,” he said. Other nursing home options were more than an hour away from her, so she wouldn't have been able to visit as often. And when he was first diagnosed about six months ago, he was combative, and a private nursing home in nearby Kingwood wouldn't accept him. “I'll be able to sleep at night,” she said. State lawmakers passed an act in 1911 to build Hopemont Hospital for the isolation of tuberculosis patients. Jackie Withrow Hospital in Beckley originally served people with that infectious disease as well. All four became state-run nursing homes, often serving people who couldn't pay for care or whom private companies wouldn't accept. He said they were operating at a $6 million yearly loss to the state. Company officials have said they are in the early stages of evaluating the construction of three to five new facilities, although they haven't said where or when. The CEO, Paul Pruitt, has said Jackie Withrow and Hopemont have outlived their lifespans. But residents in Majestic Care's nursing homes in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana receive around an hour less nursing care per day on average than residents at the state's four hospitals, Hopemont, Jackie Withrow, Lakin and John Manchin, according to federal health agency reports. Lower staffing levels increase the risk of falls, bedsores, missed medications, infections, behavioral health crises and emergency room visits. “Staffing levels are only one measure,” they added. “Equally important is how we invest in training, recruitment, and resources, so staff can deliver safe, compassionate care.” “I think you're going to get the benefit of having a company that does this for a living, as opposed to having a government that really shouldn't have been in the business in the first place,” he said. Gailyn Markham, spokesperson for the Department of Health Facilities, said health officials also believe the company is well-equipped to provide patients with better care amid a nationwide nursing shortage. She said that many patients have serious mental illnesses or disabilities, and some are deemed too difficult to care for by private companies. “My mother's words to me when I was considering it were, ‘go back to Lakin, Mary, the state's always taken care of me,'” she said. “Well, the state's not taking care of us now.” Many of Lakin's patients have been accused of crimes but were too ill to understand the charges, or they show aggressive behaviors associated with their illnesses. She predicts a private provider will release patients, and they'll end up in jails or homeless shelters. Pastor Leah Starkey said she shows up to minister and finds patients have drawn her pictures. One man is training to teach his own Bible study courses. “A lot of times that's when they'll tell me there is no family,” she said. Are they going to keep them all together?” Stein-Johnson said the health and retirement benefits she has been offered are so inferior in comparison to state benefits, they're essentially equivalent to a pay cut. Majestic officials said the company is offering jobs with no pay cuts to all employees, as well as health insurance, retirement, paid time off and other perks like a relief fund, leadership development, sign-on bonuses and tuition reimbursement. “Our goal isn't just to keep staff,” the company said in a statement. “It's to help them grow and thrive with us.” Across from City Hall, one waves for Andrew Dorsey, a coal miner and Purple Heart veteran who served in World War II and lived out the last of his 92 years of life at the John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center. He also had hearing loss and was starting to fall often. His son, Mark Dorsey, lives a few minutes away from City Hall, and about ten minutes away from the center. Dorsey, a retired coal miner himself, said his dad liked to hunt, fish and bowl. He didn't talk much about the war. He wasn't a big talker at all really. But he wouldn't have kept quiet about any mistreatment. And because the center was so close, Dorsey was there every day, so he was able to spend time with his father at the end of his life and also monitor staff. “It wasn't just a job for them,” he said. “They're not buying it to lose money,” he said. And if it is, you know, they're going to cut staff, and the health care is not going to be as good.” Even so, residents have regularly had to come out and protest the potential sale of the center when state officials have considered it in years past.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Republican administration turned to the high court after an appeals court refused to go along with ousting Cook, part of President Donald Trump's effort to reshape the Fed's seven-member governing board and strike a blow at its independence. No president has fired a sitting Fed governor in the agency's 112-year history. Cook, who was appointed to the Fed's board by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has said she won't leave her post and won't be “bullied” by Trump. One of her lawyers, Abbe Lowell, has said she “will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.” Both Cook and Miran took part in Wednesday's vote in which the Fed cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point. Trump sought to fire Cook on Aug. 25, but a federal judge ruled last week that the removal probably was illegal and reinstated her to the Fed's board. Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties, in Michigan and Georgia, as “primary residences” in June and July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home. “Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself — and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in his Supreme Court filing. According to documents obtained by The Associated Press, Cook did specify that her Atlanta condo would be a “vacation home,” according to a loan estimate she obtained in May 2021. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration had not satisfied a legal requirement that Fed governors can only be fired “for cause,” which she said was limited to misconduct while in office. Cook did not join the Fed's board until 2022. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, left, talks with Board of Governors member Lisa Cook, right, during an open meeting of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve, June 25, 2025, in Washington. Cobb also held that Trump's firing would have deprived Cook of her due process, or legal right, to contest the firing. By a 2-1 vote, a panel of the federal appeals court in Washington rejected the administration's request to let Cook's firing proceed. Trump's lawyers have argued that even if the conduct occurred before her time as governor, her alleged action “indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy.” Those firings have been at will, with no cause given. The Supreme Court has distinguished the Federal Reserve from those other agencies, strongly suggesting that Trump can't act against Fed governors without cause. In its new filing to the Supreme Court, the administration is asking Chief Justice John Roberts for a temporary order that would effectively remove Cook from the board and a more lasting order from the whole court that would be in place while her legal case continues.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla is looking into redesigning the way to open its car doors in an emergency following﻿ several accidents where passengers were reportedly trapped in burning vehicles because rescuers could not open them. Even without an accident, other Tesla owners have reported having to break their own car windows after buckling their children in and then being unable to get in the car again, according to an investigation launched by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, citing owner complaints. An investigation by Bloomberg found 140 incidents of people being trapped in their Teslas due to problems with the door handles, including several that resulted in horrific injuries. Tesla design chief Franz von Holzhausen said in a podcast Wednesday that the company is looking to combine the manual and electronic release mechanisms in the doors, which are now separate, in order to make escaping the car easier and quicker in a “panic situation.” “The idea of combining the electronic one and the manual one together into one button, I think, makes a lot of sense,” he said in an interview for Bloomberg's Hot Pursuit! It's unclear if Tesla is working on a fix for all of its cars or just the new ones, but it's unlikely the company will be able to combine the two ways of opening the door on existing models. But when that fails, the doors need to be opened with a manual door release inside the vehicle to get out. And the location of the manual release buttons can be difficult to find, especially to a young child alone in a car, or a passenger who is not familiar with the vehicle, like in an emergency situation. The Bloomberg investigation found numerous instances of passengers who were killed or severely burned by post-crash fires when rescuers on the scene were unable to open the doors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EDITOR'S NOTE:  In Snap, we look at the power of a single photograph, chronicling stories about how both modern and historical images have been made. More than 160 years later, the influence of this visceral portrait — whose subject may have been called Peter or Gordon — continues to be felt. Musuems, libraries and universities across the US display historic prints of the image, which is often used to educate audiences in a country still reckoning with its past. But amid growing political debate over how history is presented in America's museums, the 1863 photo has become a flashpoint in the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's efforts to eradicate what it calls “corrosive ideology” from federally owned sites. On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that officials at an unidentified national park had ordered that the photo be taken down, along with other signs and exhibits related to slavery. Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper described the move as being in line with an executive order Trump issued in March directing the US Interior Department to do away with content that disparages “Americans past or living.” Spokesperson Elizabeth Peace told CNN via email that sites were not asked to remove the photo. She added: “If any interpretive materials are found to have been removed or altered prematurely or in error, the Department will review the circumstances and take corrective action as appropriate.” By then, however, the story had already sparked concern among artists, activists and curators. The National Parks Conservation Association was among those voicing disapproval, with senior director of cultural resources Alan Spears saying that removing the photo would be “as shameful as it is wrong.” “I find it all very strange,” movie producer and The Black List founder, Franklin Leonard, told CNN's Abby Phillip in response to the Washington Post report. While there is limited historical consensus on Peter's escape — or even his name — the pictured man is thought to have fled a Louisiana cotton plantation in early 1863. Traveling on foot to Baton Rouge, his clothes torn and muddy, he eventually reached Union lines, which under President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was enough to be considered permanently free and eligible to join the US army's “Colored Troops.” A sultry kiss, flipped — the artist turning found photographs into uncanny new images According to one written record of his testimony, the man said he was severely whipped by his former owner's overseer after attempting to “shoot everybody” (though he had no recollection of the alleged incident). To David Silkenat, a historian at Scotland's University of Edinburgh, this assiduous approach suggests that whoever took the photo understood how impactful it could be. The picture was originally produced as a “carte de visite,” a relatively affordable kind of small-format photograph commonly sold, shared and traded by Civil War soldiers. Unlike earlier forms of photography, the negatives could be easily reprinted on paper, meaning images could spread quicker than before (cartes de visite are often dubbed the “social media” of their day). As the photo gained traction in the summer of 1863, abolitionist newspaper The Liberator recounted an enlightening example of its spread: A surgeon in an all-black regiment in the Union Army had sent a copy of “Scourged Back” to his brother in Boston along with a note reading, “I have seen, during the period I have been inspecting men for my own and other regiments, hundreds of such sights — so they are not new to me; but it may be new to you. “If you look at abolitionist newspapers, they're not only talking about what this image means, they're also selling the image to subscribers,” said Matthew Fox-Amato, an associate history professor at the University of Idaho and author of “Exposing Slavery: Photography, Human Bondage, and the Birth of Modern Visual Politics in America,” in a phone interview. By July 1863, “Scourged Back” had found its way onto the pages of Harper's Weekly, a more mainstream publication, where it appeared as part of a triptych in an article titled “A Typical Negro.” While the magazine claimed the three photos depicted the same man — whom they called Gordon — historians believe each picture showed a different individual. This was especially so in the north, where people had largely been spared visceral depictions of slavery. “The image, in many ways, visually confirmed things that abolitionists — including formerly enslaved people — had been saying for the longest time: that violence was at the core of American slavery,” said Fox-Amato, adding “it also confirmed… what photography could do — that photography can serve as a tool of justice,” he added. The sight of Peter's scarred, beaten back continues to inspire and inform. Both museums are part of the Smithsonian, which — according to a letter sent to its secretary, Lonnie Bunch III, by White House officials last month — is now obliged to present America's heritage in ways that are simultaneously “historically accurate” and “uplifting.” The Trump administration has begun a wide-ranging review of Smithsonian museums' content, and has signaled that it expects the institution to start implementing corrections around the end of the year.

An artist in Germany who liked to draw outdoors showed up at the hospital with a bug bite and a host of symptoms that doctors couldn't quite connect. After a month and several unsuccessful treatments, the patient started plugging his medical history into ChatGPT, which offered a diagnosis: tularemia, also known as rabbit fever. Around the same time, another study described a man who appeared at a hospital in the United States with signs of psychosis, paranoid that his neighbor had been poisoning him. It turns out, the patient had asked ChatGPT for alternatives to sodium chloride, or table salt. The chatbot suggested sodium bromide, which is used to clean pools. He'd been eating the toxic substance for three months and, once he'd stopped, required three weeks in a psychiatric unit to stabilize. You're probably familiar with consulting Google for a mystery ailment. You search the internet for your symptoms, sometimes find helpful advice, and sometimes get sucked into a vortex of anxiety and dread, convinced that you've got a rare, undiagnosed form of cancer. Now, thanks to the wonder that is generative AI, you can carry out this process in more detail. Unlike Google search, however, which simply points users to information, ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) invite people to have a conversation about it. They're designed to be approachable, engaging, and always available. This makes AI chatbots an appealing stand-in for a human physician, especially given the ongoing doctor shortage as well as the broader barriers to accessing health care in the United States. As the rabbit fever anecdote shows, these tools can also ingest all kinds of data and, having been trained on reams of medical journals, sometimes arrive at expert-level conclusions that doctors missed. Or it might give you really terrible medical advice. Just don't let the AI talk you into eating pool cleaner. Plenty of people are talking to ChatGPT about their health. About one in six adults in the United States say they use AI chatbots for medical advice on a monthly basis, according to a 2024 KFF poll. “Honestly, I think people need to be very careful about using it for any medical purpose, especially if they don't have the expertise around knowing what's true and what's not,” said Dr. Roxana Daneshjou, a professor and AI researcher at the Stanford School of Medicine. Chatbots also have a tendency to be sycophantic, or eager to please, which means they might steer you in the wrong direction if they think that's what you want. The situation is precarious enough, Daneshjou added, that she encourages patients to go instead to Dr. Google, which serves up trusted sources. This condition is much older than Google, actually. But if you skip the symptom checking side of things, tools like ChatGPT can be really helpful if you just want to learn more about what's going on with your health based on what your doctor's already told you or to gain a better understanding of their jargony notes. Chatbots are designed to be conversational, and they're good at it. If you've gotten some test results and need to make a decision with your doctor about the best next steps, you can rehearse that with a chatbot without actually asking the AI for any advice. One study from 2023 compared real physician answers to health questions from a Reddit forum to AI-generated responses when a chatbot was prompted with the same questions. Health care professionals then evaluated all of the responses and found that the chatbot-generated ones were both higher quality and more empathetic. This is not the same thing as a doctor being in the same room as a patient, discussing their health. Now is a good time to point out that, on average, patients get just 18 minutes with their primary care doctor on any given visit. You should be aware that, unlike your human doctor, ChatGPT is not HIPAA-compliant. That means you should expect any health information you upload will get stored in the AI's memory and be used to train large language models in the future. It's also theoretically possible that your data could end up being included in an output for someone else's prompt. There are more private ways to use chatbots, but still, the hallucination problem and the potential for catastrophe exist. Even if you're not using AI to figure out medical mysteries, there's a chance your doctor is. According to a 2025 Elsevier report, about half of clinicians said they'd used an AI tool for work and slightly more said these tools save them time, and one in five say they've used AI for a second opinion on a complex case. Doctors have been using AI-powered tools to help with everything from diagnosing patients to taking notes since well before ChatGPT even existed. These include clinical decision support systems built specifically for doctors, which currently outperform off-the-shelf chatbots — although the chatbots can actually augment the existing tools. A 2023 study found that doctors working with ChatGPT performed only slightly better at diagnosing test cases than those working independently. One of its co-authors, Dr. Adam Rodman, suggests that this wouldn't necessarily be the case if doctors would be more open to listening to ChatGPT rather than assuming the chatbots were wrong when the doctor disagreed with their conclusions. “The average doctor has a sense of when something is hallucinating or going off the rails,” said Rodman, a hospitalist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and instructor at Harvard Medical School. “I don't know that the average patient necessarily does.” Nevertheless, in the near term, you shouldn't expect to see Dr. ChatGPT making an appearance at your local clinic. You're more likely to see AI working as a scribe, saving your doctor time taking notes and possibly, one day, analyzing that data to help your doctor. In the near future, as AI tools get better, it's possible that more clinicians use AI for diagnosis and second opinions. That still doesn't mean you should rush to ChatGPT with your urgent medical concerns. If you do, tell your doctor about how that went. “If we just both step kind of out of the shadow world and talk to each other, we'll have more productive conversations.” A version of this story was also published in the User Friendly newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Mehdi Hasan explains why he'll debate (almost) anyone. The death of Charlie Kirk reignited heated discussions about political speech in America, especially the value of arguing with people you disagree with. One company, Jubilee Media, has tapped into that sentiment and has been going viral on YouTube these last couple of years with its high-energy and high-drama — and yes, gimmicky — debate shows where one person faces off against a big group of people who disagree with them. (Kirk himself made an appearance on a Jubilee show in 2024: “Can 25 Liberal College Students Outsmart 1 Conservative?”) Jason Y. Lee says he founded the company to foster debates and build empathy in a polarized country. But critics argue that some of Jubilee's content could be categorized more as voyeuristic clickbait than high-minded discourse. One show has women arranging themselves based on perceived attractiveness and men rearranging them; another involves blindfolded guessing games about which participant is Black or white. More recently, Mehdi Hasan — author and founder of his own media company, Zeteo, and former host of his own MSNBC show — appeared on Jubilee's flagship debate show, Surrounded. His episode was called “1 Progressive vs 20 Far-Right Conservatives,” and that too made waves. Hasan said he was prepared to vigorously defend his views, something he's become known for over the years. But when he showed up, he wasn't expecting some of the featured debaters to openly call for his deportation (Hasan is a US citizen originally from England) — or for one to proudly declare himself a fascist. Today, Explained co-host Noel King spoke with Mehdi Hasan about his appearance on Surrounded — and what it taught him about this charged political moment. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify. The Hasans are known for having strong views. We planned to do a show on the Jubilee debates and the argument about whether they are of value or not. And we called you because you appeared in one of these debates that went very viral, and then Charlie Kirk was assassinated in Utah and many people said Charlie Kirk was doing it right. No, I don't believe that Charlie Kirk was practicing politics the right way, to quote former Vox boss, now New York Times columnist, Ezra Klein, a good friend of mine. I totally disagree with Ezra on that piece he wrote. I do have to add the standard caveat because Fox keeps clipping some of us on the left out of context. Obviously, a political assassination in response to speech you don't like is unacceptable in America and very scary. I mean, on paper what they're aspiring to is at minimum neutral, if not good. What turns up on YouTube is not necessarily always the case. Tell me why you decided to go on Surrounded. One is, as I say, I like a good argument and 20 to one — those are good odds. The idea of going into the lion's den and debating a bunch of people who disagree with me, I thought would be fun. Number two, I spoke to my good friend Sam Seder from the Majority Report who had done a Jubilee, and he told me that it's worth doing. It does actually have value — you will reach a whole new audience. And it's amazing since I did Jubilee how many younger people are now coming up to me in the street versus older people because they recognize me from that circle debate show. And number three, it looked like a lot of right-wingers have been dominating that space. Prior to me going on Jubilee, all the top-rated people who had done Jubilee on YouTube with the most views were Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, Candace Owens, Michael Knowles. That was the lean of YouTube and Jubilee. What happened was the craziest two hours of my professional life as a journalist. But I didn't expect one after another person to be telling me to my face that I should leave the country, that I'm not a real American. “I'm a proud fascist,” one person told me very early on in the debate. We spent the last week with Republicans up in arms that anyone would call them fascists, and how that's what led to the death of Charlie Kirk. And yet here I was sitting in a warehouse with a bunch of young, mainly white people saying proudly, yes, we are fascists, we are racist. And that's why I said at the time, if you watch that clip, about halfway through the conversation, I said, “What are we doing here? I don't debate fascists.” And all of the right-wingers watching in the circle, they got very upset because Jubilee then moved this guy out. And so many of them spent the next two hours, every time they came up to the chair to debate me, they would say, “Oh, you're banning people you don't agree with.” And I was like, “That's not what it is. They don't believe in my equal worth as a human being. Fascism at its core is an anti-democratic, authoritarian, and yes, very violent ideology. So, no, I don't believe there is value to debating fascists. And if I'd known that people would be sitting down dismissing the Holocaust or saying, “I'm a fascist,” or saying the country was built for white people or whatever it is, I would not have gone on that show, or I would've said, “Get other people.” Look, I come from a proud anti-fascist tradition on the left where you don't platform fascists, you don't indulge them, you don't meet them halfway. You know, a person who appreciated your appearance on Surrounded might say, these fascist-y types are out there. They're influencing young people in a real way. At least you showed up and gave them a run for their money. I guess you could argue if — and this is gonna make me sound very egomaniacal and immodest, so I apologize in advance — I guess people could say, if you're gonna debate fascists, might as well be someone who's good at debating. So it's better me than someone else who goes on and gets their ass handed to them. So in that sense, I get it, but the counterargument I get as well, a lot of my critics were saying to me: “Just by going on, you legitimize them just by going on. We told them to get the F out of our country.' What is the goal in debating if not to change minds? Very rarely can you change your opponent's mind. My goal is to change the people watching. When you're debating on stage, as I have done, or whether you're debating on YouTube and 10 or 11 or 12 million people now have watched that Surrounded show, you are hoping that in that 11 or 12 million people, there are a handful of people who are truly open-minded, truly independent people. Most people are partisans, whether they want to admit so or not, but you hope that you found some independent folks to go, “Hmm, that's a good point that I hadn't heard before, that's a good statistic that I wasn't aware of, that's a good way of framing the issue.” And, look, people have reached out to me over the years. I've spent the last year and a half doing nonstop debates. I've done a lot of debating about Gaza, another very polarizing issue, and people have reached out to me, and I have had messages from people saying, “I have switched my positions on this issue.” Chris Van Hollen on a government shutdown, Charlie Kirk, and Zohran Mamdani. Weapons, The Conjuring, and more have fueled a horror movie boom. The late Talking Points USA leader built a movement that will outlive him. Zeke Emanuel on RFK Jr. and the crisis of faith in public health. How A/C, tax breaks, and hip-hop tilted America southward.</p>

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The bullet casings authorities recovered during their investigation of Charlie Kirk's killing make at least one thing clear: The alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, was speaking the language of memes. Catch!”, “If you Read This, You Are GAY Lmao,” and “O Bella ciao…” read some of the engravings on bullets, both used and unused, in the shooting last week. In a text exchange with his roommate and partner, reproduced by authorities in charging documents, Robinson references the inscriptions, calling them “mostly a big meme.” “[If] I see ‘notices bulge uwu' on fox new[s] I might have a stroke,” Robinson allegedly said. It all suggests this act of violence, which seems to have been driven by opposition to “hate” Robinson thought Kirk was spreading as well as some left-leaning ideas, was also wrapped up in a kind of dark, nihilistic, deeply online meme culture that has been spawning, or at least inspiring, acts of violence over the last half-decade. It's a complicated world to parse, so we turned to Elle Reeve, someone who has a history of investigating and explaining the shady corners of the internet that have started dealing serious damage in the real world. Reeve is a correspondent for CNN and the author of the book Black Pill: How I Witnessed the Darkest Corners of the Internet Come to Life, Poison Society, and Capture American Politics — all about the kinds of (mostly) men who get sucked into dark worlds online, and as she's put it, “talk themselves into doing strange, cruel, or violent things because it all started with just jokes, man.” Below is an excerpt of Reeve's conversation with us, edited for length and clarity. It's been almost a week since Charlie Kirk was killed. What do we know at this point about his alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson? To me, we still don't know enough. We know that he was a young man, he is referred to as very smart and quiet by a lot of his friends that have talked to the press. He scored well in his ACT, according to a post his mom made, but he dropped out of college after the first semester. He was a big gamer — really into video games. And according to investigators, he was dating his roommate, [who they say is transgender]. The first tranche of information we got about this alleged shooter was when investigators revealed what he allegedly wrote on the bullet casings. Could you help us understand what exactly he wrote? Luckily, people aren't trying to attribute a lot of politics to it because it's so confusing. It comes from an image that's a drawing of two middle-aged, unattractive men role-playing with each other online, making sexy talk as furries. And if people don't know, that's kind of like a sort of sexual thing where you like imagining yourself as an anthropomorphic animal, usually a specific one… Some of them, if it were in a movie, would be funny. But he wrote them before killing a person. It's one of the details that's hard for me to get past. So this can be interpreted as a pro-furry joke or an anti-furry joke because hating furries on the internet is a big thing both in the right-wing world and in other very online spaces. But it's also been reclaimed by furries, kind of like the word “queer.” So the point of saying all that is that an outsider trying to establish with certainty what exactly was being expressed by this message — that's a fool's errand. We're getting a few more details, but it's still pretty ambiguous. And that one — again, I saw other people pick this up on the internet — for me, what it conjures is, like a grizzled law enforcement veteran, bulletproof vest, bends down in the dust to pick up a piece of evidence. You're supposed to laugh, or the image is funny. And yet he did it before killing somebody. So it's not a strong statement about how you should vote in the midterms, that's for sure. The third cartridge is, “Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Ciao, Ciao.” So that's an old anti-fascist song, history buffs are very familiar with this…I'm told it's a meme among anti-fascists — I have done quite a bit of reporting with them and I had never come across it. But that's the internet, I guess… It's become more popular because it's in a Netflix show called Money Heist. And if you go on TikTok, you can see people doing goofy dances to it while ordering coffee. And it's in a video game as well. But broadly, this could be taken as a left-wing anti-fascist message. That and the bulge thing, I heard Ted Cruz say it was a transgender meme, which is false. Is there some sort of throughline in what Tyler Robinson may have written on these casings? And the dominant pose in these very online chat rooms is ironic detachment — so many layers of irony that you can't even fully understand the author's meaning, other than that they're implying “we're part of an in-group and the people outside don't understand.” And what do we know about the online spaces that Tyler may have lived in? We know he was in a few Discords at minimum. Discord is a gaming chat platform, but you don't have to be using a video game to use it. There's a group chat function, you can do one-on-one chats, you can talk by audio and by video. I've done quite a bit of reporting in these Discord servers that become cultures unto themselves. I've interviewed incels who spent like 18 hours a day in their Discord server. The culture, it can become this bubble that leads to very intense groupthink. But what we've seen so far of his messages on Discord — and Discord did confirm that Tyler Robinson had an account — it isn't like that. We know he had a server with about 30 friends. Better throw away my manifesto and exact copy rifle.” So if he was in a very political space, we have not yet seen evidence of that. Which maybe explains why the bullet casings have a bunch of absurdist memes written all over them. It's not the first time we've seen this in one of these high-profile killings in the past year. So a lot of these mass shooters or public assassinations, they reference each other. So Luigi Mangione [allegedly] wrote on three bullets, “deny, defend, depose,” a reference to how health insurance companies deny people coverage for care that they need. That man wrote all kinds of memes all over his guns before killing 51 people in two mosques in New Zealand. That guy had been on this website, 8chan, which is now called 8kun. … It was about speaking to people on 8chan. And he did become a meme there. That person also seems to be part of a very strange, nihilistic Discord, and they wrote a lot of messages in English but with Cyrillic letters. But yeah, this is a recurring thing, writing memes on the gun. And is that to say that these shooters, though they may have very different politics and beliefs, are influencing each other? The shooter [who] killed several people at a grocery store in Buffalo in 2022 — his manifesto and actions very directly referenced the Christchurch shooter. It's one of the other just surreal things in this exchange. You [allegedly] just killed a guy, and all he can think about is, “my dad's gonna be so mad if I don't bring back grandpa's rifle.” And there's another message that's related to what we've been talking about. He says, “Remember how I was engraving bullets? The fucking messages are mostly a big meme. This whole incident, or at least what we know of it so far, just feels like a very uncomfortable clash of I live online versus I live in the real world. And particularly when talking to older colleagues who did not grow up online, it's been very hard to explain. And you see it in the national discourse, too. This is not about supporting Trump, anti-Trump. It doesn't break down into easy political motivations. Many of the young people that I have talked to who are like…locked into these worlds, they think that's absurd, rooting for one party or another. It's probably helpful to clarify what we mean by these people being “very online.” It's something very different than what a lot of us know. Just to talk about the specific people I've talked to, I got really deep into this incel Discord, where people literally were spending 18 hours or more online, sometimes they go on binges, more than 24 hours, and the computer was their whole life. They'd be popping in and out of other related Discord servers, chatting, or going on camera or just going on voice. The server that I was particularly investigating, these guys were obsessed with not being able to get laid, feeling doomed by the way they looked or their personalities, to never get a woman to have sex with them, much less have a relationship and be a normal part of society. But, well, you could start by going outside. A guy I interviewed in southern Florida, he lived really close to the beach. He even said to me that one time he was standing in the water looking out at the waves at the horizon and thought, “This is beautiful, but I would like it better if it were on my computer screen.” Sometimes I'll interview people, and we're talking about this person [as if they're someone] I should know, a celebrity, and I look them up and maybe it's someone with a YouTube account with 300 subscribers. One of the reasons this meme world talk has blown up is that policymakers and normal people are wondering, How big is this world? Is it poisoning the minds of young people? How do we understand the scale of it all? Well, one way to think of it is like Gen Z and Gen Alpha, for them, the internet is the mainstream media, right? It's not like maybe we watch the Emmys and we're checking Twitter on the side as old millennials. But their main stuff is TikTok, Discord, for whatever they're into. Does that mean we can expect more of this element of absurdism, deeply layered irony in future violent extremists or shooters or gunmen? I did a lot of reporting on accelerationists who are trying to accelerate the collapse of society because they think it's irredeemable. So what comes after will be something valuable, a golden age, something better than what we have now. The people I interviewed, that's how they give themselves permission to do bad things. “I'm bringing down this corrupt society.” So all of that is permitted. So this isn't something that we should expect to not happen again. Of course, there will still be people who believe in regular stuff, you know? But it is a very large contingent of online culture. You can look visually at what a lot of the memes communicate. And also like, a lot of kids who spent their critical years locked up during Covid, and it wasn't good for their brain. I mean, even in regular life, post-Covid, I've talked to a lot of people who feel this way, like the work happy hour is more awkward than it used to be, than it was before Covid when people retreated from the world. Once you stop forcing yourself to confront social anxiety, it gets bigger and bigger and I think that leads to a lot of alienation. There's a nihilistic blackmail cult called 764, the FBI is investigating it, but they look for kids in these online spaces, convince them to send them nudes, and then blackmail these children into doing horrible things, like killing their own pets. I just want to be like a crazy fundamentalist about my kid not going on the internet. That can be the adversity you have to overcome — a crazy mom who saw an incel shit his pants on purpose in front of her just to troll her. Like, sorry dude, you're just not going on the internet or you're not getting unfettered access to a phone until you're…I don't know, 35? So I have these incels I first interviewed in 2018, I thought doing a story on them, maybe they would see that they're not so hopeless if they just went outside and joined society. They were still chatting me from it four years later, but I just reached out to them during this to ask, “What's your take?” And they've left. Some people that I thought were in like the blackest possible space have left, so it is possible. And when I go in that old Discord server, the incel one, I was scrolling up through it, all the chats were from deleted user, deleted user, deleted user.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Spirit Airlines pilot received a stern reprimand from an air traffic controller Tuesday morning after the commercial flight came within several miles of Air Force One, which was transporting President Donald Trump over New York en route to the United Kingdom. According to live air traffic control audio shared on LiveATC.net, Spirit Flight 1300, traveling from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Boston, was instructed multiple times to alter its course after drifting within 8 miles of the president's aircraft. Turn 20 degrees right,” the air traffic controller is heard saying. Air Traffic Control had to SCREAM at a Spirit Airlines flight who was getting too close to Air Force One“Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right IMMEDIATELY! Get off the iPad!”You couldn't PAY me to fly on Spirit at this point. As the Spirit flight hovered at 33,000 feet above Long Island and edged closer to Air Force One, the controller's tone grew increasingly exasperated. “Spirit 1300, traffic's off your left wing by eight miles — 747. While commercial pilots are allowed to use iPads and electronic tablets in the cockpit to access navigation charts and checklists, the tone of the exchange sparked questions about situational awareness in a restricted airspace. Data from flight-tracking service Flightradar24 showed that the Spirit plane came no closer than eight miles laterally to Air Force One, which remained at 32,000 feet — just 1,000 feet below Spirit Flight 1300. In a statement to Fox News, a Spirit Airlines spokesperson reportedly confirmed the aircraft “followed procedures and air traffic control instructions” and “landed uneventfully” in Boston. “Safety is always our top priority,” the airline said. “The FAA is aware of social media posts about Air Force One and a Spirit Airlines flight in Boston airspace on Tuesday,” the agency said. Trump was reportedly en route to London for a two-day state visit hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ABC News Chief National Correspondent Matt Gutman has issued a formal apology after facing intense backlash for describing text messages from Tyler Robinson, the alleged assassin of conservative figure Charlie Kirk, as “very touching” during a live broadcast. The remarks came after a Utah County press conference revealed shocking details about Robinson's alleged murder plot and his text exchanges with his transgender partner, Lance Twiggs, following the Sept. 10 shooting at Utah Valley University. DISGUSTING: ABC's Matt Gutman says he's not sure “if we have seen an alleged murder with such specific text messages” that were “very touching, in a way, that I think many of us didn't expect — a very intimate portrait into this relationship between the suspect's roommate and the… pic.twitter.com/ulPcxoOwM3 “It was very touching in a way that I think many of us didn't expect.” But the comment struck a nerve with many, who accused Gutman of romanticizing or sympathizing with the alleged killer. Gutman said he had hoped to underscore the “jarring contrast” between what he described as a “cold-blooded assassination” and the “personal, disturbing” messages that were read aloud at the press conference. “ABC and Matt Gutman have really reached a NEW LOW,” one user said. “Gutman found the murderer's texts to his lover, sent immediately after shooting a husband and father in the neck, oh so ‘touching. What are you doing, man?” OutKick commentator Mary Katharine Ham posted. “He really needs to be fired,” another user added. “Ah yes, a modern-day Romeo and Julius,” one user said. The Utah County Attorney's Office released transcripts of messages between Robinson and Twiggs that prosecutors say were sent just hours after Kirk was fatally shot. In one message, Robinson told Twiggs: “Drop what you are doing, look under my keyboard.” There, Twiggs reportedly found a handwritten note from Robinson stating: “I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it.” When Twiggs asked if the message was real, Robinson replied: “I am still ok, my love, but am stuck in Orem for a little while longer yet. Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, obstruction of justice, and several additional offenses. Authorities say the act was premeditated and carried out in front of a crowd that included children, a factor that could carry serious sentencing implications.</p>
