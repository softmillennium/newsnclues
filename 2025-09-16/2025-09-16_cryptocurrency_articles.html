                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some Bitcoin treasury firms are losing their luster as share prices sag below a key threshold, TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza shared in a Tuesday note. Among them were Semler Scientific (-4%), Sequans (-25%), DDC Enterprise (-18%), and Bitcoin Treasury Corp (-18%). Strategy, which owns $73.49 billion worth of Bitcoin, has never slipped below the threshold. Within the cryptosphere, that ratio is colloquially referred to as mNAV, or market-to-net-asset value. Still, at a 1.29x premium, Strategy's mNAV was two basis points away from all-time lows on Tuesday, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. Strategy's premium peaked at 3.1x in November—before the debut of most Bitcoin treasury firms. That has made it more difficult for Strategy to grow its Bitcoin per share. Bitcoin treasury firms are known to experience outsized volatility, “and bears clearly having their day,” Vitanza said. Some stocks should realistically trade at a premium, he said, given their lack of fees, ability to take on leverage through cheap debt, and manage operating expenses. Bitcoin Goes Slack as US Strike on Venezuela Sparks Turmoil Ahead of Fed Meeting Moreover, TD Cowen expects “a number” of existing Bitcoin treasury firms to outperform the underlying asset, Vitanza said, noting that some struggling ones will likely be acquired. When he unveiled his trade, Strategy was trading at a 1.94x premium to its Bitcoin holdings. On Monday, Bitcoin treasury firm Kindly MD saw its premium temporarily evaporate after its CEO, David Bailey, encouraged the company's doubters to sell their shares. The drop came after a tranche of shares became freely tradable for certain investors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google has unveiled an open-source protocol that allows AI applications to send and receive payments, including transactions using stablecoins — highlighting the growing role of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies in the emerging AI-driven web. The initiative is being launched in partnership with Salesforce, American Express and more than 60 other companies, Fortune reported Tuesday. Stablecoin functionality was developed in collaboration with crypto exchange Coinbase, and the Ethereum Foundation was also consulted on the project. Coinbase engineer Erik Reppel said the exchange worked with Google to make their payment systems interoperable. The payment system builds on Google's Agent2Agent Protocol, introduced in April, which provides a framework for AI agents to exchange information and interact more efficiently. The Tuesday announcement comes amid a growing push to connect AI agents — autonomous software programs capable of making decisions without human input — with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Such integration could streamline trading, improve user interaction, and expand real-world payment use cases. Stablecoins may prove to be the most impactful crypto use case for AI agents, emerging just as both technologies gain broader mainstream adoption. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently underscored stablecoins' importance in this shift, predicting that AI agents will eventually become “the biggest user of stablecoins.” The Ethereum Foundation has also highlighted stablecoins' potential in powering AI-driven applications. In August, the foundation pointed to the dormant HTTP 402 status code — which denotes “payment required” — and noted that, when paired with Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3009, it could enable AI agents to execute stablecoin transfers automatically.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to insights from Anton Golub's Newsletter, this shift comes as regulators grapple with the dominance of private stablecoins like Tether, which they've effectively pushed out through stringent rules. The ECB's original vision for a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, was more conservative, but recent pressures from U.S.-based innovations and declining cash usage have forced a rethink. Golub's analysis highlights how the ECB is now considering “Plan C,” essentially mimicking stablecoin features to compete directly with private issuers. As detailed in a recent post on Anton Golub's Newsletter, this American initiative has heightened competition, prompting European officials to accelerate their plans. Reuters has reported that the ECB is facing an uphill battle in the European Parliament, where concerns about privacy, banking sector disruption, and innovation stifling are rampant. Industry insiders note that the digital euro could run on public blockchains such as Ethereum or Solana, a departure from earlier intentions to use private networks. This idea, covered in DL News, reflects a broader effort to enhance adoption and interoperability. Discussions among EU finance ministers are intensifying, targeting a legal framework by year's end, but hurdles like holding limits and inclusion of non-euro countries persist. Critics argue that this stablecoin pivot might undermine traditional banks by disintermediating them from payment flows. Yet, proponents, including ECB officials, see it as essential for eurozone autonomy amid the rise of dollar-backed stablecoins. Looking ahead, this evolution could bridge the gap between centralized finance and decentralized ecosystems. However, success hinges on addressing parliamentary concerns and ensuring seamless integration with existing systems. As the ECB renews its pitch, per Reuters, the outcome will test Europe's ability to adapt to a digital-first economy without sacrificing core values like privacy and stability. For industry players, this signals a maturing market where central banks are no longer just regulators but active competitors in the digital asset space.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Next month will mark the fifth anniversary of the start of public pilots for China's  central bank digital currency (CBDC). This timing could mark very significant changes in the project. Earlier this week, Mu Changchun gave a slightly cryptic speech about the CBDC, known as the eCNY or digital RMB. Our interpretation of his remarks is that he implied that the central bank may embrace tokenization and that the digital currency may morph into involving fractional banking, although he did not explicitly say so. In other words, rather than the current CBDC requirement of 100% backing at the central bank, perhaps commercial banks might only keep a proportion of issued tokens at the central bank, or just use it for interbank settlement. Mr Mu also highlighted the problematic lack of interest payments for eCNY holders, given their reluctance to hold idle currency. But if the eCNY simply becomes a format for fractional banking, then it makes sense to allow digital currency holders to earn interest. As context, he discussed how the credibility of commercial bank money is underpinned by the central bank's role as lender of last resort combined with deposit insurance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google is taking a step toward merging artificial intelligence (AI) and digital money, rolling out a new open-source protocol that lets AI applications send and receive payments, which includes support for stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, according to a press release. To incorporate stablecoin rails, Google teamed up with U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase, which has been developing its own AI-integrated payments infrastructure. The company also worked with the Ethereum Foundation and coordinated with more than 60 other organizations, including Salesforce, American Express, and Etsy, to cover traditional finance use cases. The move builds on Google's earlier work to establish a standard for “AI agents.” These digital agents may eventually handle complex tasks, such as negotiating mortgages or shopping for clothes, without direct human input. In April, Google rolled out a protocol to standardize agent-to-agent communication. Google's experiment demonstrates a growing trend of activity across the stablecoin market. USDC-issuer Circle's oversubscribed IPO indicated investor appetite earlier this year, with some suggesting that stablecoins are a "monetary revolution in the making." Galaxy Digital Said to Plan Its Own Tokenized Money Market Fund Disclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry. CoinDesk is part of Bullish (NYSE:BLSH), an institutionally focused global digital asset platform that provides market infrastructure and information services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today, XYO, the first DePIN and blockchain project with 10M+ nodes, launches XYO Layer One, a blockchain network designed specifically for data-heavy industries, such as those in artificial intelligence (AI), logistics, and cloud services. With this launch, XYO introduces the first blockchain built to handle large volumes of data without slowing performance, making it the first scalable network designed for data. XYO is the industry's first Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) project, earning $8.8M in revenue in 2024 and attracting 80% of its users from outside the crypto space. Since 2018, XYO has been working on a variety of data-heavy blockchain products, such as the mobile app COIN, where users can turn their everyday data into real-world rewards. Initially focusing on location data, XYO has expanded today to house an ecosystem of over 10 million nodes, or data-producing devices and individuals, around the world. XYO's products are designed to provide accurate, validated data to third parties and its partners, ranging from simple real-world data such as location and temperature, to complex digital action validation, such as individual survey responses and shopping habits. In one campaign, XYO worked with a partner to optimize supermarket chains' product organization using responses from everyday shoppers. XYO decided to launch its own blockchain after more than seven years in the industry, when no existing option could meet the project's need for a high-efficiency, data-focused network. The growth of other data-heavy industries, such as AI, Real-World Assets (RWA), and DePIN also require a blockchain designed specifically for this level of data usage. For example, AI models require enormous streams of accurate data to avoid bias and improve training outcomes. In real estate and supply chain management, tokenized assets depend on precise, verifiable inputs that XYO Layer One is capable of delivering. XYO Layer One's ability to process large volumes of real-time data with low latency and provide data validation capabilities offer a uniquely valuable solution for both emerging and established industries. XYO will first migrate its own products to the new XYO Layer One blockchain, and be followed by key partners. Current chains scale poorly, slowing down transactions and causing immense gas price spikes. XYO Layer One introduces novel features that evolve blockchain into technology that can scale regardless of data and transaction load. XYO's lightweight model improves blockchain speeds, and minimizes hardware strain for DePIN, RWA, AI and other data-heavy projects. $XYO token functions as a deflationary asset with a fixed supply, and within the XYO Layer One Blockchain, $XYO serves as the primary token for DePIN rewards, governance, payment, security and staking roles. $XYO is designed to secure the protocol and align long-term incentives flawlessly and will continue to do so for the lifespan of XYO. A significant portion of $XYO's circulating supply is expected to remain locked within XYO Layer One over the long term through its combined staking and incentivization model. System staking is available, enabling anyone to stake $XYO and earn $XL1. Early participants benefit from higher emissions, as rewards decrease gradually over time. This model creates a practical blockchain framework that's capable of supporting DePIN, AI, and other demanding, data-focused applications. XYO created the COIN App, which introduced millions of users to blockchain by rewarding participation in data validation. In addition to establishing the XYO Foundation, XY Labs Inc. became the first crypto company in the United States to gain SEC approval for a Regulation A offering, opening investment to both accredited and non-accredited investors. In 2022, XY Labs tokenized its shares, which trade as $XYLB on the tZERO ATS, establishing its leadership in the RWA space.</p>

Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit Both products were filed under a single prospectus, which also included TRUMP and BONK ETFs—though no launch date has been set for those. Developed by REX Shares in partnership with Osprey Funds, the ETFs will allow investors to gain exposure to DOGE and XRP through standard brokerage accounts, sidestepping the need for crypto wallets or direct exchange holdings. The framework provides a streamlined path for products that include enhanced investor protections around custody, governance, and transparency—features regulators view favorably. The ETFs will hold XRP directly while using a Cayman Islands subsidiary to manage exposure, capped at 25% of assets. They may also use derivatives to supplement spot tracking, aligning with U.S. tax rules for regulated investment companies. The SEC's willingness to greenlight products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum underscores growing institutional demand for altcoin exposure. XRP and DOGE are merely the first in line: more than 90 ETF filings tied to other cryptocurrencies, including Avalanche and Litecoin, remain under review. If successful, the XRP and DOGE ETFs could pave the way for billions in new inflows, potentially fueling broader adoption of altcoin-based investment products.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto analysts found a strong ‘buy signal' in $XRP's recent market performance, indicating a potential significant upward move very soon. Specifically, trader Ali Martinez identified a TD Sequential in XRP's charts. $XRP has been trading around the critical $3.00 support zone. $XRP's future performance could depend on factors such as the SEC's decision on $XRP-related ETFs and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. Overall, technical indicators suggest a bullish market trend, indicating that now's the perfect time to consider investing in $XRP. However, you should prepare for some market volatility to manage the risks carefully. As $XRP climbs, investors reaping profits are rotating their gains into emerging altcoins, such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Maxi Doge ($MAXI), sparking a wider altcoin surge. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an upcoming scalability solution that fills the gap between Bitcoin's security and the speed and liquidity of Layer 2 ecosystems. $HYPER is a triple-chain utility token with its promising tokenomics and multi-chain capabilities, positioning it as a versatile asset for advanced portfolio strategies. Read more about Bitcoin Hyper's utility in our guide. The project has also been gaining wide traction from big players. Yesterday two whales scooped $58.6K worth of $HYPER, split between a $31.5K and a $27.1K buy — signalling that big wallets are not waiting! Considering the project's ambitious roadmap, our expert projections place $HYPER at $0.02595 by the end of 2025 (about 100% ROI), $0.08625 by the end of 2026 (around 7.5x ROI), and as high as $0.253 by 2030 (over 22x ROI from presale). Besides, you can earn up to 70% APY by staking. Secure your $HYPER at today's presale rate and staking rewards — tomorrow could bring the next surge. Here is why $MAXI could be your next big bag this altseason: The next price surge is less than two days away, and with $MAXI whales buying $37K less than a month ago, you can practically feel the pump. Investing $500 in $MAXI today could be pretty profitable down the line, considering both price appreciation and stakeholding rewards. At a 146% APY, $500 could generate up to $730 in staking rewards by year-end, bringing your total gains to $1,230, even without factoring in a potential price spike. You can grab your $MAXI today by visiting the Maxi Doge presale website — the next pump could hit as soon as tomorrow. Why $XRP's Upcoming Bounce Means Altcoins Are Ready to Explode $XRP's upward price trend has a general positive impact on the altcoin market for numerous reasons. For starters, when a bluechip coin like $XRP rallies, it renews investor optimism and boosts market confidence, a sentiment that spills over into other altcoins. Furthermore, $XRP's price rally mirrors the growing institutional interest, which is increasing trading volumes, creating a favorable environment for altcoins to perform well. Additionally, $XRP breaking key resistance levels coincides with favorable macroeconomic conditions, such as Bitcoin stabilization and regulatory clarity, which simultaneously boosts the broader altcoin market appeal. $XRP is now live on major crypto exchanges, while $HYPER and $MAXI presales remain exclusive to early presale buyers. With $XRP leading the charge, early investors have a chance to score big by joining in on $HYPER and $MAXI presale today. Always do your own research before making any investments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The payments and asset management industries are undergoing a fundamental reset. That inflection point is forcing banks, asset managers, and technology providers to move quickly or risk irrelevance. The firm's head of digital assets, Roger Bayston, says blockchain technology is not a side project but a new foundation for how securities, funds, and collateral will be issued, traded, and managed. Bayston recalls that Franklin Templeton's early work in the space was pure R&D. The question was basic: What could distributed ledgers do for an asset manager? The answer was equally basic at first, eliminate costly reconciliations and duplicative ledgers that plague capital markets. Now it's about focus, delivery, and scaling what we've incubated into real products.” Franklin Templeton's showcase product is Benji, the blockchain-enabled representation of its U.S. Government Money Fund. Early adopters include crypto-native firms and exchanges looking for a yield-bearing alternative to stablecoins in collateral management. In practice, that means Benji can slot into derivatives and lending markets where stablecoins dominate today. Yield-bearing, tokenized cash equivalents are becoming popular complements to traditional stablecoins, with Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Ondo among the early movers. For Bayston, tokenization is not just about faster money funds. It is about transforming what investors can own, “We've updated transfer agency infrastructure with blockchain,” he said. “Now, previously illiquid or non-fungible assets, from private funds to fractional ownership of a sports team, can potentially be wrapped into a client portfolio alongside traditional securities.” “Franklin Templeton's launch of Benji shows how tokenization is making even the most traditional products, like government money funds, more dynamic and interoperable. Institutions are seeking to integrate tokenized and traditional assets into a single operational stack, where yields can be optimized and collateral can move instantly. The implications extend beyond cost savings to entirely new product categories and customer segments. Franklin Templeton has already launched multiple versions of Benji, including U.S. and European Union structures. Early traction is strongest in crypto-native markets where the instrument is used as collateral, but Bayston envisions adoption in public markets as regulations catch up. Bayston avoids bold five-year predictions, but he is confident about the near term. Franklin Templeton has built a tokenization platform across public and private funds. The next step is deploying it widely across its asset management businesses. By blending plain-vanilla money funds with blockchain rails, the firm is proving that tokenization is not just a theory but a functioning business model.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American Express is blending travel and technology by introducing NFT passport stamps, allowing travelers to digitally commemorate their journeys. This move highlights the growing trend of integrating blockchain into everyday experiences, offering a secure, personalized way to preserve memories. By using NFTs, American Express not only taps into the digital collectibles market but also enhances the travel experience, providing a modern alternative to traditional passport stamps. This innovative approach reflects how technology is reshaping how we capture and relive our adventures.American Express has introduced a new way for cardholders to digitally preserve and commemorate their travel experiences. This new feature, called Amex Passport, is designed to offer customers a unique and secure method of storing their travel memories while also tapping into the growing interest in digital collectibles.Advertisement  The travel stamps are built on the Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain, specifically on Base, which provides an efficient and secure way to store data without relying on a centralized server. Public blockchains like Base allow individuals and organizations to securely store and manage data in a decentralized manner, offering an alternative to traditional centralized storage systems. This move by American Express follows similar trends in the business world, where companies are increasingly looking to blockchain to ensure the integrity and security of customer data. For instance, the U.S. Department of Commerce recently announced that it would begin publishing economic data, such as GDP statistics, using blockchain technology.The introduction of blockchain-based travel stamps also aligns with the rising demand for digital mementos and commemorative keepsakes. A survey conducted by American Express found that 73% of respondents expressed interest in new ways to digitally remember their past travels. Moreover, 56% of those surveyed indicated they missed receiving physical passport stamps when arriving in a new country. These findings highlight a growing desire for innovative ways to capture and share travel memories in the digital age.Advertisement  The digital stamps can be easily shared on social media platforms or saved to a camera roll for future reference. In addition, American Express offers an automatic system where trips booked through the service, even up to two years prior, will be included in the passport, ensuring that no past travels are missed. This feature makes it easier for long-time customers to relive their journeys without needing to manually add each trip.Meanwhile, the integration of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology into the travel sector is still relatively new but growing rapidly. Recent data from Travala revealed that crypto users tend to spend significantly more on hotel stays—around three times more—than traditional travelers, often staying for longer periods. More airlines are also beginning to accept crypto payments, further integrating digital currencies into the fabric of modern travel. The ability to preserve travel memories in a way that is both secure and easily accessible makes this a compelling offering for a tech-savvy, travel-loving audience.As more consumers embrace digital currencies and blockchain-based solutions, it is likely that the tourism and travel industries will continue to evolve, offering new ways for travelers to engage with their experiences.

For instance, the U.S. Department of Commerce recently announced that it would begin publishing economic data, such as GDP statistics, using blockchain technology.The introduction of blockchain-based travel stamps also aligns with the rising demand for digital mementos and commemorative keepsakes. A survey conducted by American Express found that 73% of respondents expressed interest in new ways to digitally remember their past travels. Moreover, 56% of those surveyed indicated they missed receiving physical passport stamps when arriving in a new country. These findings highlight a growing desire for innovative ways to capture and share travel memories in the digital age.Advertisement  The digital stamps can be easily shared on social media platforms or saved to a camera roll for future reference. In addition, American Express offers an automatic system where trips booked through the service, even up to two years prior, will be included in the passport, ensuring that no past travels are missed. This feature makes it easier for long-time customers to relive their journeys without needing to manually add each trip.Meanwhile, the integration of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology into the travel sector is still relatively new but growing rapidly. Recent data from Travala revealed that crypto users tend to spend significantly more on hotel stays—around three times more—than traditional travelers, often staying for longer periods. More airlines are also beginning to accept crypto payments, further integrating digital currencies into the fabric of modern travel. The ability to preserve travel memories in a way that is both secure and easily accessible makes this a compelling offering for a tech-savvy, travel-loving audience.As more consumers embrace digital currencies and blockchain-based solutions, it is likely that the tourism and travel industries will continue to evolve, offering new ways for travelers to engage with their experiences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Next Technology Holding Inc., also known as NXTT, has joined the ranks of publicly traded firms that are increasing their exposure to Bitcoin. Next Technology disclosed in its SEC filing that it is establishing a shelf registration for up to $500 million in common stock, paving the way for one or more offerings in the months ahead. The announcement triggered an initial sell-off in NXTT shares, which fell almost 3% in post-market trading on Monday, according to Seeking Alpha. While the filing gives management discretion over the use of proceeds, Next Technology has indicated in past disclosures and commentary that Bitcoin acquisition remains a core corporate strategy. Within a short span, Next Technology has managed to establish itself as one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin relative to its size. The firm reported holding roughly 5,833 BTC, including 5,000 acquired in recent months. Bitcoin-linked equities tend to trade with high volatility, mirroring the digital currency's price swings. NXTT's strategy is not so different from the moves made by Semler Scientific, which earlier this year filed a $500 million shelf registration to fund Bitcoin purchases and general corporate purposes. The longer-term impact lies in execution, and this includes how much stock is ultimately sold, at what prices, and how the capital is deployed. If a portion of proceeds is used for Bitcoin purchases, NXTT could further concentrate its balance sheet exposure to a single, volatile asset. Investors remain divided on the merits of such a strategy. Advocates argue that Bitcoin's supply cap and growing institutional adoption justify corporate treasuries allocating capital to it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. NXTT has already tested investor tolerance for dilution. The company also recently announced a $9 million registered direct offering of stock and warrants. That sale was relatively modest compared to the new $500 million ceiling but illustrates management's willingness to raise funds quickly. The SEC filing gives management a wide window in how to deploy proceeds, and there is no guarantee that significant sums will ultimately be directed toward BTC purchases. Shareholders face potential dilution from future issuances, while the company's fortunes may become increasingly tethered to the volatility of digital asset markets. We strongly recommend independent research and/or consultation with a qualified professional before making any investment decisions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saying in a Monday (Sept. 15) blog post that it is in the early stages of this exploration, Base added it has not determined the timing, design or governance of a potential network token. The company said it had not considered adding a network token in the past but is exploring it now because its blockchain and ecosystem have expanded Base's original goals to become “an open stack that makes it simple for anyone to build, trade and earn on-chain.” “Exploring a network token is one path toward making our vision of a global on-chain economy real, and a Base network token has the potential to accelerate Base's decentralization and expand opportunities for builders and creators across the ecosystem,” the company said. Coinbase said during a July 31 earnings call that Base Chain now supports real-time settlement of stablecoin payments. PYMNTS reported at the time that with USDC volume up, Base Chain scaling and business-focused products like Coinbase Business and Shopify integration gaining ground, Coinbase is pushing toward a vision of crypto as connective tissue for modern finance. In a Monday post on X, Coinbase Co-Founder and CEO Brian Armstrong said the company is exploring a Base network token because it could support the acceleration of decentralization and expansion of creator and developer growth in the Base ecosystem. “To be clear, there are no definitive plans,” Armstrong said. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.
