                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Soccer on Tuesday named Toni Pressley, a long-time professional player and former U.S. youth international, as the head coach for the U.S. Under-18 women's national team. ATLANTA – U.S. Soccer on Tuesday named Toni Pressley, a long-time professional player and former U.S. youth international, as the head coach for the U.S. Under-18 women's national team. “We are excited to have Toni join our coaching team,” U.S. Soccer head of youth women's national team development Tracey Kevins said in a statement. “The U-18 age group is a key milestone for our young female players, offering both top talents and late developers a crucial step on the pathway to our senior women's national team. Toni has lived the experience our players will be having and will be well-equipped to assist our players in maximizing their potentials.” As part of an integrated women's youth national team coaching staff headed by Kevins and guided by USWNT head coach Emma Hayes, Pressley will work closely with U.S. U-19 WNT head coach Carrie Kveton and U.S. U-20 WNT head coach Vicky Jepson in the cycle to prepare teams for the bi-annual FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup tournaments. “As someone who came up through the program as a youth player, I have a sincere appreciation for what it means to wear the crest and how important these years are in the lives of our young players. Getting to work with Tracey Kevins and all of my fellow YNT coaches is a full-circle moment that I'm deeply grateful for. Pressley comes to U.S. Soccer after a two-year stint as an assistant coach at UMF Afturelding in Iceland's second division. She finished her pro career in 2023 at Breiðablik in Iceland, capping a 12-year post-college playing career that included stints in the NWSL with the Washington Spirit, Western New York Flash, Houston Dash and Orlando Pride. Pressley, who also played for the USA at the U-17, U-18 and U-23 levels, finished her U-20 international career with 23 caps and two goals. She finished her U-23 WNT career with eight caps and one goal. She had five caps at the U-17 WNT level. She is the first head coach in YNT history to have represented the USA in a youth Women's World Cup. Pressley holds “B” coaching licenses with both UEFA and U.S. Soccer. Before coaching professionally, Pressley gained experience coaching both girls' high school and club soccer in her home state of Florida. Pressley was a star at Florida State University from 2008-2011, playing in 96 matches for the Seminoles and earning All-American honors. He has written about New York City FC, New York Cosmos, the New York Red Bulls and both U.S. national teams and has penned a soccer history column for the Guardian.com.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Olivia Moultrie approaches her 20th birthday on September 17, the Portland Thorns midfielder has already cemented her place in history by becoming the highest-scoring teenager in NWSL history. At just 19 years old, Moultrie reached this milestone after scoring her 14th career goal during a 1-1 draw with the Chicago Red Stars on Sunday. This goal not only helped secure a crucial point for Portland but also pushed Moultrie past Jaedyn Shaw, the former record-holder, who had previously scored the most goals by a teenager in the league. Moultrie had tied Shaw's record last month, but this goal was the one that put her ahead, showcasing her growth and consistency as one of the league's brightest young talents. Shaw, now 20, has also enjoyed a promising career trajectory, which has included an impressive start with North Carolina Courage and a strong debut at Gotham FC. The goal against Chicago was Moultrie's fourth of the current season, bringing her closer to her career-best single-season tally of seven goals, achieved in 2024. Moultrie first made waves in the NWSL when she debuted at just 15 years old, becoming the league's youngest player to make an appearance. A year later, at 16, she set another record, becoming the youngest-ever goal scorer in NWSL history. On the international stage, Moultrie earned her first cap for the USWNT in 2023 and has since added two goals to her tally in nine appearances. Portland currently holds a slight advantage over San Diego, leading them by just two in goal differential. Moultrie's remarkable performance on the field continues to inspire, and the future of both her and Shaw looks incredibly bright as they both chase even bigger achievements in the years to come.

According to a recent report by For Soccer, the Club World Cup drew 2.5 million spectators. Over 81,000 filled MetLife for the final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain in July. Get amNY in your inbox!News, events, culture and more — delivered to you. When the Premier League Summer Series returned later that month, 82,566 packed MetLife for a match between Manchester United and West Ham. And during the Premier League's opening weekend, NBC platforms, which broadcast six games, averaged a viewership of 850,000 — a 4% increase from the 2024 record high. It's a growing sport in a growing market — one that John Parker and David Gass, the co-founders of Kickback Soccer Media, are tapping into. A new era of sports media Parker and Gass have both worked in soccer for years. Parker, the organization's CEO, has worked as a GM of Soccer Champions Tour at Legends, an operating partner at Striker Partners, and co-founded For Soccer. Part of the challenge with starting a company like Kickback, Gass said, was tapping into a heavily saturated American sports market. They went digital, following a model similar to Jomboy Media's video-driven enterprise. Their company launched with three properties — Soccerwise, Kickback Committee, and First Touch. “One of the things, being a soccer fan, especially in the US, is there isn't really traditional coverage,” Gass said. We can't restart NBC or Fox and make them care about soccer in a valuable way and not a gimmicky way. Kickback has also partnered with the social media platform Bluesky, and aims to further establish it as the home for soccer conversation. Added Gass, who was born and raised on Long Island: “You can find anything in New York, right? Having MLS clubs in the area — New York City FC and New York Red Bulls — creates surface-level excitement, Gass added. Events like the Club World Cup and next year's World Cup will make more people see how popular and connected the sport is. “I hope that we can be a part of an attempt to actually bring them a little closer together.” Impact of the 2026 World Cup Gass said he's drooling over next summer's World Cup and the opportunities it brings to grow the game. “Having a 48-team World Cup across three countries is everything I've ever dreamed about.” He explained that Kickback's plans for the next year are largely built around getting more people into the sport. The World Cup gives them leverage to tap into a market of new fans. This will involve a series of videos — which Gass calls “First Touch” — like explainers and entry-level content. The company has big plans, including live shows, events and longer features. They want to cover the tournament from every angle. “For me,” Gass said, “It's an excuse to cover anything I want, because nothing's not connected to this World Cup with 48 teams across the world. Any little soccer story that you've ever wanted to tell or talk about or delve into, it's connected to this tournament.” “I think people don't fully grasp how big this thing is going to be,” Parker added. “‘94 was great, but we didn't have the digital era. Soccer had not taken the hold it's taken in this country, we didn't have these modern stadiums across the country.

Any little soccer story that you've ever wanted to tell or talk about or delve into, it's connected to this tournament.” “I think people don't fully grasp how big this thing is going to be,” Parker added. “‘94 was great, but we didn't have the digital era.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA is set to distribute a record $355 million US (about $488 Cdn) to clubs around the world as part of an expanded Club Benefits Programme (CBP) tied to the 2026 World Cup, soccer's world governing body announced on Tuesday. The initiative marks an increase of nearly 70 per cent from the $209 million US paid out after each of the past two editions, played in Qatar in 2022 and Russia in 2018. It's part of a renewed memorandum of understanding between FIFA and the European Club Association (ECA) signed in March 2023, aimed at creating a more inclusive and equitable system for global club football. World Cup 2026 ticket presale fiercely competitive for fans With the 2026 edition set to include compensation for qualifiers, the number of benefiting clubs is expected to rise significantly. ECA Chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi called the program "innovative." "Clubs play a pivotal role in the success of national team football," he said. "This initiative recognizes every element of it, from early development through to release for the most important games." A record 48 national teams will participate in the competition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's the timeless hypothetical hovering over American men's soccer. U.S. men's national team and Crystal Palace center back Chris Richards isn't offended by it. “I think the argument gets lost pretty quickly when it's about, like, ‘If LeBron James was our center midfielder … ' It's not really about that,” said former MLS and USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, who noted that Lionel Messi is 5-foot-7. “I just think because of how accessible basketball and football are, our best athletes don't really choose soccer over any other sport,” Richards said. In addition to the inner-city accessibility of basketball, Martino highlighted its economic appeal. The life-changing potential of a career in football or basketball has dramatically expanded in the era of college athletes being paid. Could that ultimately limit the ceiling of the U.S. men's national team, preserving that hypothetical as no more than a fantasy? His father, Ken, played basketball at Birmingham-Southern College and then four years overseas. Chris was hooping from third grade until the end of his sophomore year in high school. He was about 5-foot-6 and, having fallen in love with soccer on an Olympic Development Program trip to Argentina, exclusively focused on it that summer entering junior year. Richards has always been a Crimson Tide football fan but he also loved the University of North Carolina basketball team — he remembered touring their facilities during an official visit — and that was partially why he committed to the school for soccer. He ultimately never suited up for the Tar Heels, signing with FC Dallas instead. Fellow USMNT defender Alex Freeman also opted not to follow his former professional athlete father's footsteps when soccer became his focus at 14. Alex “played a little bit of everything” growing up, consumed a lot of college football and hoops, and there was “a little bit of pressure” from Green Bay Packers legend Antonio Freeman toward football. Richards, 25, and Freeman, 21, have taken different professional paths to the national team. Instead of being a freshman at UNC, Richards was beginning his professional career with one of the biggest clubs in the world. He remembered accidentally opening mail from his youth soccer club indicating that his family — among the many hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis — was behind in payments to the club, and telling himself then: “I need to make it. With Bayern, before NIL burst the dam of dollars flowing to college athletes, Richards was in a unique financial position compared to his friends in the States. “I remember coming home I guess the first Christmas and like I had friends who were playing college sports, whether it was football, soccer, basketball, they were like, ‘Oh, yoooo, can you lend me a few dollars? “I didn't even think about it until now. Freeman, on the other hand, has remained in MLS for the first chapter of his professional journey, enjoying a breakout 2025 with Orlando City and attracting serious European interest. It wouldn't be a surprise to see him eventually land where Richards is today: starting in the Premier League, by far the richest league in global soccer. Freeman isn't bothered by the money he may have missed out on in college football or basketball, which can now easily eclipse the earnings of homegrown players in MLS and most American players in general. While there's a lack of transparency around exactly how much college athletes are earning, that figure is below the estimated range for Power 4 conference football starters at essentially every position in 2025. And Georgia football head coach Kirby Smart told Yahoo Sports' Ross Dellenger prior to the approval of the House settlement — which ushered in direct revenue sharing and was supposed to better regulate payments from boosters via collectives — that there were some high school athletes being paid more than $20,000 a month to stay committed to their school. But Freeman keeps the disparity between soccer and other domestic sports in perspective, eyeing a future abroad. But obviously as a young player myself, signing as a homegrown, I feel like you're signing for the process, being able to eventually make that step,” he said. Richards admits the new landscape of college sports could've made it a tougher call today. I remember hearing about my dad playing overseas, but I never thought about myself playing overseas for basketball,” he said. “It would have been a lot tougher to quit basketball if I knew that two years later, I'd be a freshman in college making more than some of my favorite athletes are making overseas.” Martino was also a hooper until early in high school. He idolized Allen Iverson and at one point dreamed of being in the NBA just as much as being a No. Outside of his TV analyst role for Turner Sports, he's stayed involved in soccer as an entrepreneur. After an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Soccer presidency in 2018, Martino has remained dedicated to raising the level of accessibility and participation in soccer through the proliferation of spaces for unstructured play, normalizing soccer on concrete. This was already a challenge — Martino emphasized that soccer lacks “an offering that is commensurate with or competitive with basketball” — and it's now being compounded. “There's two problems that are happening that I think is going to exacerbate this issue of us not casting the widest net for potential in these communities where maybe American football or basketball becomes the draw,” he said. “One is, yeah, the carrot being bigger earlier, right? So now all of a sudden, if the NBA is where the commitment pays off financially, it starts happening at a younger and younger age, of course that's going to turn heads towards that lifestyle, that possibility.” Richards believes the impact college athletes being paid will have on participation is “huge.” “Props to the kids, but I think definitely parents are going to be pushing their kids in general into playing certain sports, because you can make money before even becoming a professional.” And that pressure to pick even earlier is what concerns Martino. “The bigger problem is the hyper specialization of having to make that choice at a younger and younger age,” he said. “The money is now reinforcement for a 9, 10, 11, 12-year-old who's talented at multiple sports and chooses basketball. Culturally, according to Martino, it's not a mutually exclusive dynamic. “The day that you are seeing soccer look like basketball, show up next to basketball and be as pervasive and prolific in urban areas as basketball is the day our men will win a World Cup,” he said. That's not the expectation next summer, but a deep run definitely is. It's supposed to inspire America's youth and remind them that the USMNT on the World Cup stage is an unparalleled sporting opportunity. “It's amazing to know that you can represent your country at such a young age,” Freeman said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ZURICH (AP) — Hundreds more soccer clubs will get shares of a $355 million FIFA fund from its multi-billion 2026 World Cup revenues for releasing players to men's national teams. FIFA said on Tuesday the program which has shared a total of hundreds of millions of dollars among clubs whose players were selected for each World Cup finals tournament since 2010 will now include all players who took part in qualifying games. Eritrea and Russia — which has been suspended from international soccer since 2022 — did not play qualifying games among FIFA's 211 member federations. “This new approach means that any club that releases a player for a FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier will now be directly compensated,” FIFA said in a statement. FIFA previously agreed on a $355 million allocation for the 2026 edition in the United States, Canada and Mexico as part of a renewed working agreement with the European Club Association (ECA). That was an increase from $209 million paid to clubs worldwide from each of the past two editions, played in Qatar in 2022 and Russia in 2018. FIFA said 440 clubs across 51 member countries got payments from the 2022 program, which were calculated as a daily rate for as long as players were involved with their squads at the tournament. Manchester City got the biggest payment with almost $4.6 million. More than 900 clubs across all 55 UEFA member countries got payments from a similar European program that already includes qualifying games for national team competitions played for four years through 2024. FIFA created its “club benefits program” with $40 million of revenue from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as part of a deal with the ECA which was created two years earlier.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sunette Viljeon is perhaps South Africa's most precious cricketer – she played cricket for her country between 2000 and 2002, including the Cricket World Cup 2000 in New Zealand. She made a return to the sport in 2021 with domestic side Northerns, and has been playing most recently for Lions women. Cricket is replete with stories of multi-skilled athletes from across the world. Ellyse Perry is a two-time ICC Cricket World Cup winner, but also was part of the Matildas (Australian football national team), at the FIFA World Cup in 2011. Not to be left behind should an Ashes rivalry crop up, Clare Taylor of Yorkshire, bowled fast for 127 wickets in 121 matches and went on to become 1993 World Cup winner at Lord's. Two years later in 1995, she represented England at FIFA World Cup. Elite international cricketers have paved the path with their multi-skilled outings in various sports, reaching the top in more than one sport. While the upcoming Cricket World Cup 2025 will showcase the biggest and brightest talents in the women's game as Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka battle it out to try and reach the final on 2 November, it will also be a celebration of these sporting polyglots who went beyond the boundaries of cricket. The ICC while turning pages of history, wrote: “To reach cricket's pinnacle requires talent, hard work and a steadfast determination, but over the years, a handful of past and present stars have reached the top of other sports too.” It started with the game's finest pioneers, Rachel Heyhoe Flint, who captained England between 1966 and 1978, who first hit a six in a Test match in 1973. She also played field hockey for England in 1964 as a goalkeeper. Hailing from Wolverhampton, she was instrumental in arranging the inaugural women's World Cup in 1973, which came two years before the first men's World Cup.H eyhoe Flint last played for England in the 1982 World Cup final and was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in October 2010 after her 22-year international career. Australian Ellyse Perry is a multi-sport legend after debuting for her country in both cricket and football at 16. ‘Perry played for Central Coast Mariners, Canberra United and Sydney FC during her footballing career and made 18 appearances for the Matildas. Bates, after her Beijing stint in Olympics basketball for the Tall Ferns, came from Dunedin decided only in 2011 to focus on cricket. Also from the southern hemisphere, but South Africa came the youngest player to represent South Africa in an ODI when she made her debut aged just 17 years and 10 days, but crucially, Sunette Viljoen won a silver medal in javelin at the Rio Olympics. The Saffers in fact more recently boasted iof Tazmin Brits, who too qualified for the 2012 Olympics in javelin but just eight months before the Games, she was involved in a horrific car accident which resulted in her breaking her pelvis, dislocating her hip and bursting her bladder, as per ICC. In fact as far back as 1934, when Gone With the Wind conceptualised filming for Scarlett O'Hara, Betty Snowball started her 15-year international cricket journey between 1934 to 1949 and also umpired one women's Test in 1951. What made her the Scotts queen was away from cricket, Snowball represented Scotland in squash and lacrosse. Post cricket, she dabbled at and got good at Aussie Rules, turning out for the famous Collingwood, North Melbourne and Hawthorn, after retiring from cricket in 2023. She was also the first player to benefit from Cricket Australia's parental leave scheme when she had her first child, ICC noted.

FIFA, the event's governing body, announced that there will be three draw periods. Later, closer to the tournament, any remaining unsold tickets will be up for grabs. FIFA also announced that it will launch an official resale platform. Alternatively, fans can buy hospitality packages, which are now available without the need to be selected in a raffle. Hospitality packages include preferred seating, refreshments, and access to VIP lounges. Hospitality package tickets start at $1,400 per person. There are also Venue Series packages that include entrance to all games scheduled in a single venue. The global tournament is set to run from June 11 through July 19, 2026. Mexico's team will play in the inaugural match, set to be held in Mexico City. The opposing team has yet to be announced. Team USA is scheduled to debut on Friday, June 12, in Los Angeles at SoFi Stadium. After that, the U.S. team will play on Friday, June 19, at Seattle's Lumen Field, and then return to Los Angeles for a match on June 25. Additional match dates for Team USA will be announced as the tournament progresses, depending on their performance in the group stage and whether they advance to the knockout rounds.

Maybe the national team turned a corner in last week's 2-0 win over Japan. Maybe Pochettino and his players have finally found the chemistry and coordination that was so obviously missing. And maybe, just maybe, the U.S. really can make a deep run in next summer's World Cup, the first to be played in the U.S. in 32 years. One game can't totally erase the dysfunctional and dispassionate performances that have marked much of the brief Pochettino era, one which included four consecutive losses at home and two losses in as many games with Mexico. Nor can it make up for a player pool that has seemingly grown thin and ever-changing or speed the learning curve for a successful club coach who has struggled with the transition to the international game. It's clear Angel City didn't want to upset fans by letting Alyssa Thompson transfer to Chelsea, but the move was a massive win for both player and team. But it can buy the team and its coach some time. “Touch the right buttons and we start to perform,” Pochettino said last September, shortly after he took the U.S. job. Just now, however, is he finding those buttons. The win over Japan clearly lifts a huge weight off Pochettino and his players, but the reprieve may be temporary. And the path they take will likely shape U.S. Soccer's future for years, if not decades. A World Cup the federation has been pointing to for years is just nine months away and much is riding on the U.S. team's performance. But three days before beating Japan, the U.S. was thoroughly outplayed by South Korea in a 2-0 loss — the team's sixth loss in 14 games this year — that raised alarm. Alejandro Zendejas and Folarin Balogun score for the Americans, who were playing a Japanese team of primarily national reserves on Tuesday night. With just three international breaks remaining before the World Cup, there is reason for both hope and concern. Pochettino's lineup choices remain as unsettled as his tactical approach — although the Japan game may help settle that. As Stuart Holden, World Cup midfielder turned Fox Sports analyst, noted, the change to a three-man backline solved many problems. Against Japan, Holden said, the center backs played with noticeable confidence and aggression. The formation also freed wingbacks Max Arfsten and Alex Freeman to be more creative and allowed attackers Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun, the team's game-changers, to be more impactful. There was much to like in the new approach and for the first time in his tenure, it seemed as if Pochettino had finally found a game plan that suited his players, with Balogun among those who benefited most: his goal, off an assist from Pulisic, was his first for the U.S. in nearly 14 months while his start was his first under Pochettino. The other goal went to Alex Zendejas, who was called up for the first time this year despite having one of the best two-year runs of any USMNT attacker, scoring 16 goals and contributing 15 assists to help Mexico's Club América to three straight Liga MX titles. Another player who stepped up when given the opportunity was Seattle Sounders midfielder Cristian Roldan, who played an inspired 90 minutes, leading all players with 83 touches. In the wake of Son Heung-min joining LAFC, here's a look at the 10 most significant signings in MLS history. The October games with Ecuador and Australia could go a long way toward determining that. There's a lot riding on the answer. More than 1.5 million people registered for the chance to buy World Cup tickets in the first 24 hours of the tournament's initial presale lottery, according to FIFA. After a random selection process, successful applicants will be notified via email starting from Sept. 29 and will be given a date and time slot to purchase tickets, starting at $60, beginning Oct. 1. When fans enter the window won't affect their chances of winning. Subsequent ticket sales phases will begin in October.
