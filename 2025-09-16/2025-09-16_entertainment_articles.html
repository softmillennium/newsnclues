                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How are we supposed to protect ourselves as the internet becomes an increasingly tangled web of mis- and disinformation? YouTube is working on solutions for its creators, including a new likeness detection tool. Originally announced last year with a pilot program that included users MrBeast, Mark Robert, Doctor Mike, and Marques Brownlee, the company announced on Tuesday that the tool will now become available to all YouTube Partner Program creators. “Creators can already request the removal of AI fakes, including face and voice, through our existing privacy process. What this new technology does is scale that protection,” YouTube's vice president of creator products Amjad Hanif told Axios. Creators can then request to have the content removed through YouTube's privacy complaint process. Other new features announced on Tuesday include generative AI tools for creating and editing video or turning speech into song. As Hanif explained, “For us, a responsible AI future needs two things: clear legal frameworks like NO FAKES, and the scalable technology—which we're building—to actually enforce those principles on our platform.” Slow Horses widens its spotlight (and turns down the emotional drama) in season 5 By Tim Lowery September 16, 2025 | 3:00am ENDLESS MODEJunk World Revives A Cult Stop-Motion Sci-Fi Series With More Polish But No Less Madness</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tyler Robinson, the alleged killer of right-wing organizer and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, has been charged with seven counts, including aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, and obstruction of justice. “The murder of Charlie Kirk is an American tragedy,” Gray said on Tuesday. “Charlie Kirk was murdered while engaging in one of our most sacred and cherished American rights.” “I'm filing notice of intent to seek the death penalty,” Gray added. “I do not make this decision lightly, and it's one I've made as county attorney based solely on evidence and circumstances of the crime.” Robinson is expected to appear virtually in court for the first time later on Tuesday. Robinson, 22, is suspected of shooting and killing Kirk last week during an event at Utah Valley University. Robinson was arrested after a two-day manhunt during which the FBI interrogated and released at least two other persons of interest in the shooting. Robinson was ultimately turned into authorities by his family, who recognized him from photos released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Gray said Tuesday that Robinson's mother told investigators that Robinson had become “more political and had started to lean more to the left, becoming more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented,” as Gray put it. Gray said that on Sept. 10, Robinson messaged the roommate telling them to look under his keyboard. According to Governor Spencer Cox (R-Utah), investigators recovered a “high-powered bolt-action rifle” they believe was used in the shooting, as well as bullets with various inscriptions appearing to reference video games and online memes.

FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News on Monday that Robinson had said he was going to kill Kirk in a text message, and a “destroyed” note that the bureau was able to reconstruct, but has not been made public.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new tune written for her pops' recent 64th birthday features Mick Fleetwood and Lindsey Buckingham. Miley Cyrus is getting ready to unleash her “Secrets.” Three weeks after teasing the song she said she wrote for dad Billy Ray Cyrus for his 64th birthday, Miley revealed on Tuesday morning (Sept. 16) that “Secrets” will drop this Friday (Sept. 19). In a brief video snippet accompanying the post, Cyrus is seen in close-up staring directly into the camera while wearing what looks like surgical gauze around her chin and head as more white material is blown by a breeze around her face. Cyrus has not said much else about the tune she first teased last month, which Billy Ray said in an Instagram story at the time was a “gift of music” his daughter gave him for his recent bday. Billy noted that the track featured two of his “favorite musicians” from Fleetwood Mac. According to People, Miley previewed the song that features former Mac bandmates drummer Mick Fleetwood and singer/guitarist Lindsey Buckingham in June during her visit to Monica Lewinsky's podcast, where she talked about how writing it helped her resolve some long-running tensions between herself and her father. “I wrote this song about my dad because I wanted him to tell me even though there were secrets, even though I didn't really want to know,” she told Lewinsky about the track that finds Miley singing: “Secrets, I want to keep your secrets/ Like sunlight in the shadows/ Like footsteps in the grass/I won't ever break my promise/ Like a songbird in the silence/ Like stones against the glass.” Noah told People that she tries to keep herself “quite separated” from the family “drama” that has reportedly unfolded since Billy Ray and Tish Cyrus' breakup after nearly 30 years of marriage in 2022. Speculation has bubbled that Noah and her siblings, including Miley, had taken sides in the break-up. She also said a heated letters posted by older brother Trace on his socials were blown out of proportion. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In theaters Dec. 19, the Paul Feig-directed psychological thriller brings Seyfried's character Nina together with Sydney Sweeney‘s Millie under circumstances that are far more sinister than they initially appear. Based on the novel by Freida McFadden, The Housemaid follows Millie as she's hired by Nina to serve as a live-in housemaid. As the trailer shows, overlayed with a haunting rendition of Sabrina Carpenter's “Please Please Please,” the household Nina has built with her husband, Andrew, and their daughter is only picture-perfect in the beginning. What happens behind closed doors — locked doors, spilled secrets, and power struggles — shatters their perfect family illusion, but Millie's closet isn't devoid of skeletons, either. The Housemaid also stars Brandon Sklenar, Michele Morrone, and Elizabeth Perkins. The release will mark Sweeney's latest film following Christy and Echo Valley, both of which arrived earlier this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marilyn Knowlden, the busy child actress of the 1930s and '40s who appeared in Little Women with Katharine Hepburn, Imitation of Life with Claudette Colbert, Les Misérables with Fredric March and in three other Oscar best picture nominees, has died. Knowlden died Monday of natural causes at an assisted living facility in Eagle, Idaho, her son Kevin Goates told The Hollywood Reporter. During a career in Hollywood that spanned just 1931-44 but included more than three dozen pictures, Knowlden collaborated with Colbert, Hepburn, Irene Dunne and Norma Shearer as her onscreen moms in Imitation of Life (1934), A Woman Rebels (1936), Show Boat (1936) and Marie Antoinette (1938), respectively. “A special relationship can develop with the actress who plays a child's mother, even if that bond is temporary,” she told author Nick Thomas in 2016. Another highlight for Knowlden included a turn as a younger version of Ann Sheridan's character in the classic Michael Curtiz-directed Angels With Dirty Faces (1938), starring James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. None of her movies won the top Oscar, however. Knowlden always worked as a freelancer, never under contract at any studio. “Well, my father was very much in control of my career, and he didn't want me to be under contract,” she told Danny Miller in a 2018 interview for Cinephiled. “I think one of the reasons is that if you're a child under contract, you have to go to the studio school, and there goes your normal life. I think he was very happy to have things the way they were.” An only child, Knowlden was born on May 12, 1926, in Oakland, California. When her dad, San Francisco attorney Robert Knowlden Jr., had a business trip to Hollywood in 1931, he brought his wife, Bertha, and her with him. “I had been doing some little acting things in Oakland, and my teacher there had told my father that she thought I should be in the movies, so he thought he'd give it a try.” Her fast-talking dad reached Paramount head of casting Fred Datig, who arranged for an interview that day. The part of Paul Lukas' and Eleanor Boardman's daughter in the early talkie Women Love Once (1931) was discussed, but Datig thought Knowlden was too young. On the scene was actress Dolores Costello, the wife of John Barrymore, who escorted Knowlden to her dressing room and cared for her. During production on Women Love Once, director Edward Goodman took Knowlden to another soundstage to visit The Marx Brothers, then at work on Monkey Business (1931). “I loved that and ended up playing a duet with Chico on the piano,” she said. Women Love Once would prove to be the first of her six films released in 1931, followed by The Cisco Kid, Husband's Holiday, Susan Lenox — that one with Clark Gable and Greta Garbo — Wicked and Once a Lady. “At the end of the film, she signed an autograph for me that says, ‘To Marilyn — Hoping that her archery improves. She and Rochelle Hudson shared the roles of Jessie Pullman in John M. Stahl's Imitation of Life and Cosette in Richard Boleslawski's Les Misérables (1935). “I went on very few cattle calls,” she said. “Usually I would just go on interviews where they were already seriously considering me for a part.” One movie she didn't get was Gone With the Wind (1939), though she was in the running to play Scarlett O'Hara's youngest sister, Carreen. “I so wanted to be in that movie!” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marc Weinstock is leaving Paramount as its President of Global Marketing and Distribution. Weinstock is responsible for propelling the Skydance co-produced Top Gun: Maverick as Paramount's highest global grossing title at $1.49 billion worldwide and Tom Cruise's highest. Weinstock joined Paramount in February 2019 as President of Worldwide Marketing & Distribution and, in 2022, was elevated to oversee the studio's unified global marketing and distribution team. He had previously been head of marketing at Megan Ellison's Annapurna. During his run at Paramount, Weinstock ushered the successful rollout of twenty #1 films. Those include, of course, Top Gun 2, which was also at the time of its release the No. He was also behind turning originally conceived Paramount+ movie, Smile, into a new theatrical global horror franchise, which became the studio's third-most profitable film for the studio in the past decade and spawned a sequel. As the first major studio to return to theaters with a full theatrical release schedule, Weinstock oversaw the release of six #1 films in 2022, one of the most successful years in the studio's history, including Top Gun: Maverick and Smile, among others. Weinstock has been recognized for his innovative marketing campaigns at Paramount, kudos including 2025 Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50, highlighting impactful marketing heads across major global brands; and the Adweek 50 of 2025 spotlighting leaders in advertising, marketing, media and technology. Among his innovative campaigns were Scream and Scream VI, which reignited fan excitement for the franchise with stunts including Ghostface's journey to NYC, which was captured by a grassroots Scream Cam Live stunt; an unforgettable viral moment leading up to the launch of Smile with the creepy “Smile lady” who materialized at major sporting events; the launch of the Mean Girls marketing campaign with a wildly popular TikTok rollout that had never been done before; and bringing big comedies back to theatres with the successful debut of The Naked Gun, which recently surpassed $100M at the worldwide box office. Under Weinstock's leadership, Paramount's marketing team has also tapped into the ever-growing creator space, recognizing early on that, with the continuing emergence of TikTok, Instagram and Snap influencers, the essential need for Creator Marketing to catapult a movie to a great global opening. In response, Weinstock's marketing division carved out an in-house team that identified top tier talent in the creator space, cultivated those relationships, and engaged them across all Paramount titles through custom social content and innovative activations. Cruise embraced this passionately during the promo tour for Mission: Impossible Final Reckoning. Other big pics for Weinstock include A Quiet Place: Day One which opened to nearly $100M globally, setting a franchise record for the biggest worldwide opening, and grossed over $261M at the global box office. Over Memorial Day of this year, Mission: Impossible–The Final Reckoning boasted a franchise-best global opening. As President of Annapurna Pictures, Weinstock helped secure a distribution and marketing deal with MGM. He previously held senior marketing leadership roles at 20th Century Fox and Sony Pictures, overseeing campaigns for films including Logan, Hidden Figures, The Revenant, The Martian, Deadpool, The Amazing Spider-Man, 21 Jump Street, Men in Black 3, Skyfall, and American Hustle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oh, to be great-looking, charming, and avoidant of relationships out of reluctance to hurt the other person because you consider yourself broken. It's a problem most prevalent in Movie World, nearly as debilitating as being great-looking, charming, and prone to solitude; together, these hang-ups may be insurmountable for A Big Bold Beautiful Journey. There, it seems pretty obvious that Sarah (Margot Robbie; avoidant of relationships) and David (Colin Farrell; prone to solitude) may be capable of overcoming their flimsy psychological issues. The film itself, however, risks irreparable harm through its series of screenwriterly excuses for not kissing right away. Who wants to bear that bad news, though, when the fantasy elements of A Big Bold Beautiful Journey are depicted with rare sweetness? If not for some swearing designed to introduce a little irreverence into the proceedings, the story of Sarah and David could be a PG affair. It's not even really a story, per se, but a series of mild, emo adventures crossing the deadpan magical realism of Charlie Kaufman with those scenes in Annie Hall where the characters stroll through scenes of their childhood. They flirt, in a melancholy fashion, and go their separate ways, until a pair of suspiciously interactive GPS systems bring them back together. David and Sarah have both obtained last-minute cars from the same strange, empty-warehouse rental company staffed with Kevin Kline (so restrained it may take a moment to register that it's him) and Phoebe Waller-Bridge (so shticky it's impossible to mistake her for anyone else), who insist on including GPS, in case their phones crap out. One magically transports them to David's high school, during his teenage years. One whisks them into an art museum that Sarah used to visit. They learn about each other's pasts, which are convincing to a point. Somehow, the doors only ever need to show scenes that contribute directly to the characters' psychology, specifically as it affects romantic relationships. It's more of a lucid dream, and though Kogonada doesn't lean too heavily on the weirdness of genuine dreaming, he's well-suited for this tidier imitation. When David is back in high school, he's a teenager again, even though he's still played by an unaltered Farrell; Sarah is there alongside him, even though she shouldn't be. A song and dance scene pointedly breaks through the proscenium. And, of course, what are all those doors if not neatly geometrical compositional tools? But Kogonada gives the characters (and audience) a little space; it seems against his nature to push too hard. Then again, maybe that's demanding too little from the director of After Yang, where the delicate tone is matched with a series of thought-provoking science fiction questions. (It may simultaneously ascribe too much credit to the many prodding soundtrack choices in his new film, even if the chosen Wilco, Bright Eyes, and Mitski tunes are pretty ones.) A Big Bold Beautiful Journey is more of an old-fashioned Hollywood romance, where two big bold beautiful stars coming off of career hot streaks radiate in each other's presence. Farrell gets to use his real accent, and, well, Robbie doesn't, but most people know her as Barbie or Harley Quinn anyway. They're so naturally charming, so easy to like with their little notes of sincerity or cynicism, and so especially welcome in this gentle context, that they almost provide cover for how little of value this movie has to say about anything. (Here's a new experience for Sarah and David: gainful employment! No one mentions whether that openness can perhaps be enhanced via superhuman big-screen-ready charm. Genuine loneliness doesn't seem compatible with this movie's glossier version of the Kogonada aesthetic, so sun showers, scenic overlooks, and stars will have to suffice. Like the outcome of a first date, it will ultimately be determined by chemistry.

That Kogonada is neither a writer nor editor credited on his third feature is the first worrying road sign on this “Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” roles he maintained on both the coolly observed, intellectual romance “Columbus” and the cozy, ruminative AI sci-fi “After Yang.” His latest film, a drawn-out, time-hopping romance between Colin Farrell and Margot Robbie as script-y stick figures trapped by a sentient rental car into literally driving down the memory lane of their most formative episodes, features both embarrassingly earnest writing and nonsensical, incoherent editing. Related Stories Radu Jude Bids You Welcome to His ‘Dracula' on October 29 with a Spooky Special Message What Hollywood Really Wants: The Audience You Already Built Pairing Kogonada with screenwriter Seth Reiss' (“The Menu”) disaster-bound dump truck of cliches feels like an insult to and an underestimation of the Cannes-crowned filmmaker's prior proven bona fides: It's not a drama, it's not a comedy, it's not a romance, but it's kind of a musical at one point? Less discernible human characters than the shapes of people who look like them, David (Colin Farrell) and Sarah (Margot Robbie) are strangers who meet at a mutual friend's wedding they are both attending stag. Robbie, styled in a newsboy cap and oversized red coat, looks like she just came back from a semester abroad living in Soho, Londontown. Beyond just looking cheap and CW-adjacent, the styling only reinforces the level of artifice and unwillingness to go deeper than skin or sickly cotton-candy-sweet surfaces. David and Sarah, across nearly two testing hours that unfold at the pace you imagine being forced to relive your life's most painful moments on the road to rediscovering your inner manic pixie dream child would, aren't revealed to have any dreams of their own beyond the failed quest for love. (Though David's pasted-on childhood fondness for musicals implies something adjacent to character development here.) They are, rather, cut-outs of rom-com archetypes: David is a sad, lonely man whose father (Hamish Linklater) recently died, and Sarah is a self-confessed serial cheater whose mother (Lily Rabe, Linklater's wife and a welcome respite, given her increasing likeness to her mother, the late Jill Clayburgh) died when she was a college freshman screwing her professor. Back up a bit, though the connective tissue is missing here: In the opening sequence, David's parked car gets the dreaded yellow boot due to unpaid parking tickets, a note pasted curbside directing him to an ominous rental car company that turns out to be operated out of a warehouse by an asleep-at-the-wheel Kevin Kline and cloyingly smirky Phoebe Waller-Bridge. It's the car David takes to the wedding, and the car whose GPS, when David eventually offers Sarah a ride, that promises them both a “big bold beautiful journey,” a phrase they are meant to say back to it like some kind of greeting-card-tailored, reverse “there's no place like home.” Said car then takes them on said journey, where each stop is outfitted with a portal-like door that allows them to enter into past milestones: break-ups, significant deaths, soul-shifting encounters with art. There's another stridently mawkish sequence in which David and Sarah both re-experience their most wounding breakups — David with a woman he was engaged to (played by Sarah Gadon) and Sarah with a cableknit-sweater-clad Billy Magnussen, whom she left and ghosted in the middle of the night — in tandem. The problem here is that David and Sarah learn or glean nothing meaningful or revelatory in rehashing old traumas; much like filmmakers, they're observing the material as if moving slides on a Kodak wheel rather than actually engaging with them. It's unfortunate, too, that the actors seem to have an allergy to each other in the sparks department, with about as much chemistry as that between two walls that happen to be facing each other. “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” suffers from the fact that Kogonada, who got his start crafting online video essay analyses of his favorite films and TV shows before debuting with “Columbus” at Sundance 2017 and taking “After Yang” to Cannes in 2021, has no personal stamp on the project. Cinematographer Benjamin Loeb (“Pieces of a Woman,” “Dream Scenario,” “Mandy”) shoots the film more like a cheery extended ad campaign for the AI-powered vehicle driving the characters toward catharsis, and there's certainly nothing romantic about a movie that features multiple moments of cringe-in-your-seat Burger King product placement. “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” opens in theaters from Sony Pictures on Friday, September 19.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter and Troy Donahue, he was discovered (and given a studly stage name) by talent agent Henry Willson. Trax Colton, who starred opposite Jayne Mansfield in It Happened in Athens after being discovered (and renamed) by the same talent agent who did the same for Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter and others, has died. Colton died Aug. 30 of natural causes in Monte Nido, California, his son Ryan Morelli told The Hollywood Reporter. “I couldn't have scripted a better parent,” he said. New Jersey-born Louis Morelli was driving in a convertible on Olympic Boulevard going to meet a friend for lunch in Beverly Hills when another car driven by talent agent Henry Willson pulled up next to him. Paula Shaw, Actress in 'Freddy vs. Jason' and Hallmark Holiday Telefilms, Dies at 84 He was then given second billing as a Greek shepherd named Spiridon Loues who aims to compete as a marathon runner in the first modern Olympics — the 1896 Summer Games — in It Happened in Athens (1962). While the movie was being made, THR's Mike Connolly wrote that Colton “looms as the studio's new “combination of Rudolph Valentino-Ty Power” as the star of a potential Blood and Sand remake at Fox. Fellow columnist Dorothy Kilgallen, meanwhile, suggested the actor “may be our next matinee idol.” However, when the expensive Happened in Athens failed at the box office, Colton and Mansfield were released from their contracts, and he never made another film again. “Trax Colton was handsome and ingratiating, but acting was not his métier,” Eve Golden wrote in her 2021 book, Jayne Mansfield: The Girl Couldn't Help It. Morelli had worked as a car salesman and studied dentistry before he came west and had his encounter with Willson, who famously helped launch the acting careers of Roy Fitzgerald (Hudson), Arthur Gelien (Hunter), Marilyn Louis (Rhonda Fleming), Merle Johnson (Troy Donahue), Francis McGowan (Rory Calhoun), Krekor Ohanian (Touch/Mike Connors) and Robert Moseley (Guy Madison). His son Ryan said he would appear on an episode of ABC's Combat! Colton, who spoke several languages, earned his law degree in 1969 and practiced until the early 2000s.

Tributes are pouring in for Robert Redford, the great actor, director, and Sundance Film Festival founder who died September 16 at the age of 89. One of the most moving comes from his costar Jane Fonda, who appeared in five movies with him: 1960's “Tall Story” (Redford's first movie — he went uncredited), 1966's “The Chase,” 1967's “Barefoot in the Park,” 1979's “The Electric Horseman,” and 2017's “Our Souls at Night.” In a statement provided to IndieWire, Fonda said, “It hit me hard this morning when I read that Bob was gone.

Yet, we kept trying to find out more about each other, just like the characters in the movie. Bob was charismatic, intelligent, intense, always interesting— and one of the finest actors ever. The last time I saw him, when he came to lunch, we discussed art and decided to send each other our first drawings.He was one of a kind and I'm so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him.” The Sundance Institute said in a statement about its founder, “We are deeply saddened by the loss of our founder and friend Robert Redford. Bob's vision of a space and a platform for independent voices launched a movement that, over four decades later,has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema in the U.S. and around the world. We are humbled to be among the stewards of his remarkable legacy, which will continue to guide the Institute in perpetuity.” Morgan Freeman, who starred with him in “Brubaker” and “An Unfinished Life” posted on Instagram, “There are certain people you know that you're going to click with. After working with Robert Redford on ‘Brubaker' in 1980, we instantly became friends. Working with him again in ‘An Unfinished Life' was a dream come true. “I grew up on Robert Redford films, he was the massive superstar of my youth,” Rodriguez wrote on X. “So to have El Mariachi accepted into his Sundance Film Festival — the most important and prestigious independent film festival in the world — remains one of the biggest highlights of my life. His sanctuary in Park City was like a dream: You fly in, meet Redford, present your film, and hope good things would follow. Your vision and independent spirit forever changed my life.” Tom Rothman, chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, told IndieWire in a statement, “In addition to being a titanic acting and directing talent, as an early board member of the Sundance Institute, I saw first-hand the Sundance Kid's passionate commitment to indie film and young artists. The entire scope of American film would have been much poorer without him. Other tributes came from Marlee Matlin, who recognized on X the incredible impact that Redford's Sundance Film Festival had on allowing smaller human dramas to flourish. Colman Domingo wrote on X, “With love and admiration. Thank you Mr. Redford for your everlasting impact.

She is survived by her husband, television producer and executive Andy Friendly, with the two having gotten married in 1986. She is also survived by her two children, five grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Crowley was previously married to sports and entertainment attorney Ed Hookstratten. Fans spoke highly of Crowley's impressive career, paying tribute after her passing. “What a wonderful career she had Patricia Crowley brought so much charm and talent to every role. “Patricia Crowley's talent and grace will always be remembered! Her iconic roles brought joy to many,” another fan commented. “Grace, grit, and generations of screens, Patricia Crowley didn't just act, she anchored eras. Crowley starred in numerous different projects throughout her career, but one of her most well-known roles was Joan Nash in Please Don't Eat the Daisies. The sitcom ran from 1965 to 1967, in which she portrayed a newspaper writer who was married to a college professor, and the couple had four boys. Oh, and you can't forget about the family's Old English sheepdog named Ladadog. “I thought the writing was very intelligent and very sweet,” she told Pioneers of Television of Please Don't Eat the Daisies in a past interview. Crowley went on to have a recurring role in the sixth season of the ABC primetime soap Dynasty, starring as Emily Fallmont in 1986. She also won the Golden Globe for New Star of the Year for her performances in Forever Female and Money From Home in 1953. She also had stints on The Twilight Zone, Friends, The Love Boat, General Hospital, and Beverly Hills, 90210, along with so many others.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Universal Music Group, Sony Music Group and Concord have reached a settlement to end their lawsuit  against the Internet Archive over a project to digitize old vinyl records from Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Bing Crosby and other iconic artists. In a motion filed Friday in Manhattan federal court, both sides say they have a deal to resolve litigation over the “Great 78 Project,” in which thousands of physical records have been digitized and made available to users for free. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed, and neither side immediately responded to requests for more details on the settlement. The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the major labels, said in a statement: “The parties have reached a confidential resolution of all claims and will have no further public comment on this matter.” The Internet Archive fired back that its project was no such nefarious effort – and that it had “preserved hundreds of thousands of recordings that are stored on shellac resin, an obsolete and brittle medium.” “When people want to study sound recordings as they were originally created, they go to libraries like the Internet Archive. In May 2024, a federal judge refused the Internet Archive's request to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing it to move into discovery and toward an eventual trial. But in April, the case was halted after the two sides said they had made “significant progress in settlement discussions.” It has remained largely on ice ever since, leading to Monday's settlement notice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Casting rumors for Season 15 of the “Real Housewives of New Jersey” have swirled ever since the franchise was first put on pause in August 2024. At first, Bravo fans worried that the series would never return; then, earlier this summer, Andy Cohen finally confirmed that things were in motion. In early September, reports surfaced that Melissa Gorga, Dolores Catania, and Margaret Josephs were “test-filming” with a few potential new cast members. Luann de Lesseps was a long-time cast member of the “Real Housewives of New York.“ That means that she most definitely knows how things work at Bravo. I think they're probably actually shooting, if you ask me.” The countess believes that the new girls who were filming may have been testing, but that the footage captured would be used. “[You think they'd] waste their time and crews? When asked if she thought that RHONJ could work if the focus were on Melissa Gorga, Lu said, “Listen, it can go south in a second. According to Ok Magazine on Aug. 29, 2025, Margaret Josephs is the new focus. “There are lots of rumors trying to be put out that Teresa filmed test footage for RHONJ, but the truth is she didn't. But [only] Melissa Gorga, Margaret Josephs, and Dolores Catania filmed with new women … It's really looking probable that Bravo is moving on without [Teresa]. Do you believe that RHONJ is actually already filming? Which of the ladies do you want to see return for Season 15? Do you believe that the franchise can work without Teresa shaking things up and flipping tables?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival lineup has been unveiled. Also slated to perform are Young Thug, the xx, Turnstile, David Byrne, FKA twigs, Addison Rae, Ethel Cain, and dozens more. Rounding out the Coachella 2026 lineup are: Alex G, PinkPantheress, Iggy Pop, Giveon, Little Simz, Devo, Blood Orange, Geese, Dijon, Wet Leg, Oklou, Black Flag, Disclosure, Sexyy Red, Katseye, Moby, Joyce Manor, Lykke Li, CMAT, Wednesday, Model/Actriz, Ceremony, Bedouin, Lambrini Girls, Fakemink, Jane Remover, Drain, and the Rapture. Plus, there's a billing for Nine Inch Noize (presumably a collaboration between Nine Inch Nails and Boys Noize) and the bottom of the poster lists “The Bunker Debut of Radiohead Kid A Mnesia.” (A representative for Radiohead confirmed to Pitchfork that the band does not plan to be physically present at Coachella.) In addition, Anyma is an additional headliner, and he'll be presenting his Æden project. Passes go on sale this Friday, September 19, at 1 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time. She is set to close out 2025 with a string of dates, including residencies in New York and Los Angeles. She also has a smattering of South American festivals booked in the months leading up to Coachella. Although he's been a guest performer joining other artists onstage—Ariana Grande, Daniel Caesar, Chance the Rapper, and Tems and Wizkid—four times at the festival, Bieber has never actually performed at Coachella as a billed artist before. Her latest album, Tropicoqueta, came out last June, and, as things stand, the Coachella set is scheduled to be her first full live show behind the album. Last year's Coachella headliners were Lady Gaga, Green Day, Post Malone, and Travis Scott, with Green Day and Scott both squeezed in on the Saturday night. Others on that bill included Charli XCX—who brought out Billie Eilish, Lorde, and Troye Sivan—and Clairo, who got a Bernie Sanders introduction, but not the visa-beleaguered FKA twigs or Massive Attack, who turned down a slot after lamenting the festival's environmental impact.
