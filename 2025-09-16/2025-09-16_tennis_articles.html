And when Tiafoe snuck a one-set lead against then-No. But Alexander Zverev, who also knows first-hand what it takes to guide a team to Laver Cup glory, assured that the American wouldn't have that euphoric moment for the third year in a row. And when Tiafoe snuck a one-set lead against then-No. After Ben Shelton defeated Daniil Medvedev in a dramatic three-set affair, Team World found itself on the precipice of a third straight Cup with an 11-7 lead on the scoreboard. Despite battling sickness, Zverev was prepared to leave it all on the court, he said.‚ÄúIt was a win or die tie for us and I knew that I had to put all my energy and effort in," Zverev said after the match, which was his eight career win in nine matches against Tiafoe.‚ÄúI had to fight for myself, for the team, for everybody in the stadium, and I'm glad that I came out with the win. ‚ÄúIt was a win or die tie for us and I knew that I had to put all my energy and effort in," Zverev said after the match, which was his eight career win in nine matches against Tiafoe.‚ÄúI had to fight for myself, for the team, for everybody in the stadium, and I'm glad that I came out with the win.
