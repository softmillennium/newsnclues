                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican chairman has signaled his support for FBI Director Kash Patel. Patel is confronting skeptical Senate Democrats at a hearing likely to be dominated by questions about the investigation into Charlie Kirk's killing. FBI Director Kash Patel clashed with skeptical Democrats at a contentious Senate oversight hearing Tuesday, defending his record amid criticism that he has politicized the nation's premier federal law enforcement agency and pursued retribution against perceived adversaries of President Donald Trump. A man detained by authorities days after he nearly died in an Iowa shooting is one of a growing number of crime victims who have been targeted in the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. Felipe de Jesus Hernandez Marcelo was shot in June during an attempted robbery in Muscatine, Iowa, and has been detained since shortly after he got out of the hospital. Others have been detained unexpectedly by ICE as they go through the lengthy application process. Trump is extending a deadline for the social media app TikTok to shut down. It will be the fourth time that Trump has ignored federal law and extended a deadline for TikTok to go out of business. Trump has signed an executive order to keep TikTok operating, a day after he said he'd reached a framework deal with China to keep it operating. “Once again, President Trump is stepping up when Democrats have failed,” Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said in an apparent dig at Democratic New York Gov. Unionized LIRR workers voted to authorize a strike on Monday but also approved seeking federal intervention. It will be Netanyahu's fourth visit to the White House since Trump assumed office in January. A group of Democratic governors is urging congressional leaders to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits. The appeal comes as Congress is moving toward a potential government shutdown, with Republicans and Democrats at odds over how to continue the tax credits that have made health insurance more affordable for millions. President Trump says on social media that Republicans will hold the gathering to highlight “the great things we have done” since he was reelected in 2024. The convention's date and location are still to come, Trump says. But he promised that “it will be quite the Event, and very exciting!” Patel has finished testifying after a contentious 4 ½ hour hearing before Congress. “How on earth are we de-escalating the situation with the tensions as high as they were last week with going out and saying we're at war?” Tillis said. “You are a political buffoon at best!” Patel added. Schiff tried to yell over him, saying, “You can make an internet troll the FBI director, but (he) will always be nothing more than an internet troll.” Sen. Chuck Grassley, Republican chairman of the Senate Judicial Committee, pounded his gavel repeatedly, but Patel continued. The feud between Patel and Schiff dates back years, to when Patel was a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee and Schiff was a House member. U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois says immigration agents have arrested 250 people in the Chicago area since a new enforcement campaign was announced last week. Underwood says the arrests began Sept. 6, two days earlier than a program touted as “Midway Blitz” was publicly announced. Top administration officials arrived in Chicago Tuesday, potentially signaling a more aggressive phase of immigration enforcement. Immigrants are being detained in various locations, sparking fear and leading some people to stay home. Advocates report increased activity from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with unmarked vehicles targeting work vans and staking out neighborhoods with large immigrant populations. One Metro Boston city canceled its Hispanic Heritage Month festival due to safety concerns. ICE's “Patriot 2.0" operation follows a previous crackdown in Boston. The U.S. Department of Justice has also filed a lawsuit against Boston over its so-called sanctuary policies. Advocates argue the city's policy of limiting cooperation with ICE keeps the city safe and ensures Boston remains a place for all residents. ▶ Read more about ICE detentions intensifying in so-called sanctuary cities I see it as something -- working with the public to identify that there was a subject in custody,” Patel told senators. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, pushed back, saying it caused confusion by making it sound like authorities had caught the person suspected of killing Kirk. Patel shot back by saying, “That's not what I said.” A group of Democratic senators say they are deeply concerned that a Pentagon plan to allow military lawyers to work as temporary immigration judges will violate a ban on using service members for law enforcement and affect the military justice system. Mike Braun said that the redistricting conversation is “moving” and it's likely inevitable. Braun said a special session could happen any time after November. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said he has had no direct conversations with the White House or Border Patrol and reaffirmed that Chicago police would not collaborate with ICE. “I get that people are feeling a level of anxiety, but they should be assured that we're going to work with all of our stakeholders to make sure the people of Chicago are safe and supported,” he said at a news conference following his signing of an executive order aiming to protect the right to protest. The order states that, if federal law enforcement disrupts peaceful protests, Chicago police will “collaborate with protest organizers to develop a mutually acceptable alternative plan.” Johnson said the order was an attempt to be “proactive” amid federal intervention and after protesters clashed with federal immigration agents Friday outside an ICE processing facility in Broadview, Illinois. They unveiled a stopgap spending bill to keep the federal government through Nov. 21. So, lawmakers will need to pass a stopgap measure to keep agencies funded while they work out their differences for the full year. Democratic leaders have insisted that Republicans negotiate with them on the spending bill to protect health insurance coverage for millions of Americans. But Republicans leaders have rebuffed those demands and say those discussions are for another time and would not be part of the continuing resolution. Any spending bill that passes will need some support from Democrats in the Senate as the measure will need at least 60 votes to advance to a final vote. Patel and the New Jersey Democrat got into a shouting match as Booker charged that Patel is responsible for a “generational destruction of the nation's premier law enforcement agency.” Still, Booker predicted that Patel would not last long in his post. He told Patel that Trump “will cut you loose. This may be the last time I have a hearing with you.” Patel's leadership of the FBI has been marked by turmoil and Democratic accusations that he's using the law enforcement agency to carry out Trump's goals. But Patel told the Senate panel that it was “an entire falsehood” to suggest that he only got the job because he was a Trump loyalist. Patel pointed to his experience as an attorney, congressional staffer and administration official, saying, “There was no loyalty then. There's no loyalty now to anything but the Constitution.” Geoff Duncan speaks during the Democratic National Convention, Wednesday, Aug. 21, 2024, in Chicago. So Georgia Republicans threw me out of their party,” Duncan said in his announcement video released Tuesday. Now I'm running for governor as a proud Democrat.” Trump seemed miffed when an Australian Broadcasting Corp. reporter asked about his wealth since returning to office. Trump told the reporter, ‘You're hurting Australia very much right now, and they want to get along with me.” He told the reporter that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese would be visiting soon and “I'm going to tell him about you. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before departing on Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House, Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025, in Washington. The president also criticized ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl, whom he's known for years. Karl asked Trump about the attorney general's comments that she will be going after hate speech after the killing of Charlie Kirk. You have a lot of hate in your heart.” FILE - The TikTok logo is seen on a mobile phone in front of a computer screen which displays the TikTok home screen, Oct. 14, 2022, in Boston. The House Select Committee on China says any deal between Beijing and Washington must comply with a law requiring TikTok to be divested from its Chinese ownership or face a ban in the U.S. “Underpinning all of our concerns is the Chinese Communist Party's access to American data,” he said. United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem addresses the media during a visit to the Port of Antwerp in Antwerp, Belgium, Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in an X post that she was on the ground Tuesday in Chicago “to make clear we are not backing down.” The news comes as Gregory Bovino, who spearheaded the immigration crackdown that sparked widespread protests in Los Angeles, announced Tuesday his arrival in Chicago, where residents have been bracing for weeks for Trump's promised immigration crackdown and National Guard deployment. Those comments are notable as the FBI director faces allegations in a lawsuit that he fired other agents and FBI leaders based on cases they worked. Patel has refused to address the termination of those agents, telling lawmakers he won't discuss personnel matters. In a tense exchange, Sen. Richard Blumenthal accused the FBI director of lying when he told lawmakers at his confirmation hearing that agents would not be subject to political retribution. Patel objected to the accusation, telling the Democrat from Connecticut: “You accusing me of lying is something I don't take lightly, but I'm not going to get into a tit for tat with you.” If there were, I would bring the case yesterday that he trafficked to other individuals,” Patel said, while also acknowledging that previous investigations of Epstein were limited. “This issue is not going to go away,” Kennedy said. “And I think the central question for the American people is this: They know that Epstein trafficked young women for sex to himself. Patel said that the current case files only included “limited search warrants” between 2006 and 2007 because federal prosecutors in Florida had previously cut a secret deal with Epstein that allowed him to avoid prosecution for his previous actions. Patel says the FBI has 35 open investigations into threats against judges, who have faced a sharp increase in violent messages in recent years. Judges have increasingly spoken out against threats of violence, pointing to worrying rhetoric from both sides of the political aisle in recent years and saying the threats have reached a new peak during the second Trump administration. Johnson also defended employers who take action against employees whose comments go too far. Johnson noted that Trump has been called “the most despicable names” and he urged all leaders to tone it down. “Leaders cannot call their political opponents Nazis and fascists and enemies of the state because they disagree with their policy priorities,” he said. US Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino speaks during a press conference alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday, June 12, 2025, in Los Angeles. Gregory Bovino, who spearheaded the immigration crackdown that sparked widespread protests in Los Angeles, announced his arrival in Chicago with a post on X. “Operation At Large is here to continue the mission we started in Los Angeles.” Advocates for immigrants say they've noticed an uptick in detentions by ICE agents in Chicago as the nation's third-largest city braces for Trump's promised immigration crackdown and National Guard deployment. The threats have deepened dread among already fearful immigrant communities, which cancelled and delayed Mexican Independence Day celebrations. An ICE officer fatally shot a suspect trying to evade arrest last week. Speaker Mike Johnson said a bill to avoid a partial government shutdown at month's end would not include health care provisions sought by Democrats. Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries has said House Democrats won't support a partisan bill that “continues to gut the healthcare of the American people.” But Johnson said Republicans are not going to revisit their big tax cut bill that trimmed Medicaid spending over the coming decade, and said the looming expiration of tax credits for some health insurance coverage is a “December policy issue.” “The same Democrats who decried government shutdowns under President Biden appear to have no heartache whatsoever at walking our nation off that cliff right now,” Johnson said. Times spokesman Charles Stadtlander said Tuesday the lawsuit “lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. Trump has gone after other media outlets, including filing a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the The Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch in July after the newspaper published a story reporting on his ties to wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein. Patel was asked by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., whether the Kirk shooting is being treated as part of a broader trend of violence against religious groups, and Patel responded, “We are investigating Charlie's assassination fully and completely and running out every lead related to any allegation of broader violence.” Patel also said that the FBI is investigating “anyone and everyone” who was involved in an online gaming chatroom on Discord with the alleged shooter. That chatroom involved “a lot more” than 20 people, Patel said. The FBI director told Sen. Amy Klobuchar that he is “willing to engage and explore new ways” to address gun violence in the United States. “Whatever creativity we can use to eliminate even just one shooting, one horrific death, I am in favor of engaging with Congress fully to do,” Patel told the Democrat from Minnesota. The FBI director said there are “instances on this legislation that could prevent future attacks” but said he would not “weigh into the creation of legislation.” The FBI director says his agency, as well as the U.S. military and intelligence community, will be conducting a yearslong mission that seeks to use counterterrorism tactics against drug-trafficking organizations. Tim Walz said Tuesday he will seek a third term in the 2026 elections, hoping to beat the odds to become the longest-serving governor in a state where voters have usually said two terms were plenty. “I've always tried to do what's right for Minnesota, and I'll never stop fighting to protect us from the chaos, corruption, and cruelty coming out of Washington,” Walz said in a campaign video. Walz has been frequently mentioned as a potential 2028 presidential candidate. ▶ Read more about Walz's decision to run for governor again Questioned by Durbin on the recent firings of FBI agents, Patel said he would not get into personnel decisions and accused the Democrat of unfairly attacking FBI leadership. Patel is facing a lawsuit from three high-ranking FBI officials who have accused him of illegally firing them in a “campaign of retribution.” Neither offered any further on-the-record detail after Trump suggested the U.S. military had carried out an operation on a third vessel from Venezuela. Asked earlier on Tuesday by a reporter about Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's angry response to two military strikes carried out by the U.S. military in recent weeks on alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean, Trump replied “We knocked off, actually, three boats not two.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is a close ally of Trump, asked the FBI director what legal justification the administration is using for military strikes on Venezuelan boats that the president has said are carrying drugs. Still, Graham expressed support for an aggressive approach to nations where drugs are manufactured. “We will hunt down every single one of those narco-traffickers,” Patel told Graham. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., speaks as FBI Director Kash Patel appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his first oversight hearing, Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025, at the Capitol in Washington. During one combative exchange, Patel was pressed by the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee over an unsigned memo released by the Justice Department in July that said there was no evidence of a Jeffrey Epstein “client list.” Patel responded with a dig at former President Joe Biden, telling Durbin: “Would you have preferred I used autopen?” Republicans have accused the Democratic president of signing pardons in his final days in the White House with an autopen instead of by his own hand. The Associated Press has previously reported that agents and senior executives alike have been subjected to polygraph exams aimed at ferreting out disclosures of information related to Patel. Patel brought up the Epstein files in his opening statement, seeking to address a topic that's brought criticism from some quarters of Trump's conservative base who want to see more information released about the probe. He says it involved a “very limited search warrant” and asserted that the Trump administration has done more to release all “credible information” they could under the law. Patel also said Epstein had not been a source for the FBI. He didn't acknowledge criticism that the FBI and Justice Department have faced in recent months over the abrupt announcement in July that they would not be releasing additional documents from their trove of evidence. FBI Director Kash Patel appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his first oversight hearing where he is facing questions about the investigation into Charlie Kirk's killing as well as the recent firings of senior officials who have accused Patel of illegal political retribution, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025. Patel has concluded his opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee with a bit of a challenge for his critics: “I'm not going anywhere.” The FBI director pointed to his experience as a congressional staffer and Trump administration official, saying, “If you want to criticize my 16 years of service, please bring it on.” Senate Republicans have continued to express confidence in Patel despite criticism from some conservative commentators of how he's led the FBI's response to the killing of Charlie Kirk. Democrats, meanwhile, will intensely question Patel over what they say is a highly politicized approach to the FBI. ▶ Read the AP's coverage of Robert Redford's death and legacy In his opening remarks earlier in the hearing, Durbin said Democrats are not responsible for Kirk's death, just as Republicans are not responsible for the killing of a Democratic state lawmaker in Minnesota earlier this year. The country is going through a period of division and political violence, he said, but “Republicans are not Nazis, Democrats are not evil.” Critics have raised concerns that the focus on immigration enforcement and violent crime could divert attention from the FBI's ability to focus on matters like counterterrorism. Trump in a Monday post on Truth Social said that he had read a news report indicating that Hamas would use the captives as “human shields.” Residents still in the city were warned they must leave and head south. The push marks yet another escalation in a conflict that has roiled the Middle East as any potential ceasefire feels even further out of reach despite months of diplomacy.</p>

Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, joins 'America Reports' to discuss a DOJ memo claiming FBI agents who 'followed orders' on Jan 6 investigations won't be fired. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, revealed Tuesday that the FBI's election-related investigation into President Donald Trump, launched in 2022, swept in dozens of Republican entities, including the late Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA. Speaking during a hearing focused on oversight of the FBI, Grassley said the investigation, which the bureau called "Arctic Frost," was partisan in nature and that its expansive scope was evidence of that. "In other words, Arctic Frost wasn't just a case to politically investigate Trump," Grassley said. "It was a vehicle by which partisan FBI agents and Department of Justice prosecutors could achieve their partisan ends and improperly investigate the entire Republican political apparatus." FBI Director Kash Patel talks with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, before a hearing titled, "Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation," on Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025. Since January, Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., have been publishing records related to Arctic Frost, the investigation launched during FBI Director Chris Wray's tenure that served as the basis for former special counsel Jack Smith to bring criminal charges against Trump related to the 2020 election. Grassley unveiled a new set of documents during his opening statement on Tuesday that showed numerous Republican-affiliated organizations and people were targeted with subpoenas during Arctic Frost. Then-FBI Director Christopher Wray speaks during a press conference at the U.S. Department of Justice on Dec. 6, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (Samuel Corum/Getty Images) Some targets on the list were well known, such as Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, who spread unproven allegations that widespread election fraud occurred during the 2020 election. But the basis for targeting other groups, like Kirk's group and the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), was less clear. "For years, the deep state, unelected Biden bureaucrats — including the FBI — used lawfare to target Republican AGs and many other close friends because we were allies of Donald Trump," RAGA Executive Director Adam Piper said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "The Biden Administration bastardized the rule of law, gave license to lawless liberals, and did everything possible to kneecap any and all opposition. Republican AGs will work to hold these bad actors accountable and help President Trump restore objectivity to our federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies." Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk arrives to speak before Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump during a campaign rally at Thomas & Mack Center, Oct. 24, 2024, in Las Vegas. Kirk was assassinated last week while speaking during an event at Utah Valley University. Turning Point USA recruited conservative college students and was heavily involved in promoting election turnout. Spencer Cox and Department of Justice leaders have said the suspect in Kirk's shooting, Tyler Robinson, was driven by leftist ideology but that the investigation remains in an early stage. Authorities said antifascist messaging found on bullet casings, Discord messages and other messages have helped to develop an understanding of Robinson's motive as the investigation continues.

Criminal profiler John Kelly weighs in on Charlie Kirk assassination suspect Tyler Robinson's alleged influence by 'dark' internet culture. Officials announced formal charges against conservative speaker Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin on Tuesday. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said that Tyler Robinson is being charged with several counts, including aggravated murder. "The murder of Charlie Kirk is an American tragedy," Gray said. "As county attorney, I am charged with bringing justice to those who offend our laws." In addition to aggravated murder, the charges announced by Gray include two counts of obstruction of justice for hiding the rifle and discarding his clothing, two counts of witness tampering for instructing a roommate to delete texts and stay silent and one count of committing a violent offense in front of children. This split image shows suspected assassin Tyler James Robinson, left, and victim Charlie Kirk, a founder of Turning Point USA, on the right. Gray also filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, meaning the defendant will remain in jail without bail. "I do not take this decision lightly, and it is a decision I have made independently as county attorney, based solely on the available evidence and circumstances and nature of the crime," Gray said. Gray said Robinson is also believed to have targeted Kirk based on his "political expression." Gray laid out the evidence against Robinson, detailing his actions taken after the shooting, including discarding clothing, hiding the weapon and urging his roommate to delete incriminating texts. Authorities allege Robinson fired a single rifle shot from a rooftop sniper position, striking Kirk in the neck last Wednesday on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem, about 40 miles south of Salt Lake City. He died later that day at a nearby hospital. Robinson, a third-year electrical apprentice at a Utah technical college, initially fled the scene amidst the chaos. Investigators have reportedly tied Robinson to the shooting through surveillance video and digital evidence from his social media accounts, in addition to the information provided by his family. Gray said DNA evidence also tied him to the weapon and ammunition. Gray also highlighted ideological motives, with Robinson's family and his own statements pointing to growing political radicalization. Robinson had voiced opposition to Kirk, accusing him of spreading hate, and left behind a note declaring his intent to kill Kirk. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was shot and killed during an event Thursday in Utah. Gray also revealed a conversation that happened before the shooting where Robinson called UVU a "stupid venue" for Kirk's event and accused Kirk of "spreading hate." "The roommate received a text message from Robinson which said, 'drop what you're doing. "The roommate looked under the keyboard and found a note that stated, quote, I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it. Police found a photograph of this note." Robinson was apprehended two days later at his parents' home, roughly 260 miles away from the university, after relatives and a family friend notified law enforcement that he had confessed involvement in the shooting, according to Gov. "Robinson's mother called her son and asked him where he was. FBI Director Kash Patel also revealed new information about the prosecution against Robinson, saying on Fox News' "Hannity" that authorities are going through Robinson's digital footprint and the people he communicated with leading up to Kirk's murder. Patel also mentioned during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that the FBI was not ruling out the possibility of others being involved in Kirk's assassination. Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby confirmed that Robinson's parents have "fully cooperated" with the investigation. While investigators have yet to disclose a motive, Kirk's supporters, including his wife Erika Kirk, have portrayed him as a martyr for their movement. Kirk, 31, was the co-founder and leader of the conservative student organization Turning Point USA and a close ally of Trump.

Travis Kelce was one of two Kansas City Chiefs, along with Ty'Quan Thornton, to wear shirts that read "Free 4," a nod to suspended wide receiver Rashee Rice. Rice, in his third season in the NFL, is serving a six-game suspension following his involvement in a crash where he was charged with collision involving serious bodily injury and racing on a highway causing bodily injury. He pleaded guilty in July, and as part of Rice's plea agreement, he received five-year deferred probation and 30 days in jail as a condition of the probation. Kelce and Thornton entered GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday ahead of their Super Bowl LIX rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles with graphic tees that featured photos of Rice. "I respect that Kelce and Thornton support their teammate, but the 'gym teacher' needs to talk with the history teacher," he wrote in a statement, referencing his engagement announcement with Taylor Swift, via WFAA. "Rashee isn't Nelson Mandela or Pepe Mujica, men who fought for what they believed in. There is evidence that Rashee was going 119 mph in a $1,749 per day Lambo rental that had pot and a pistol in it, on a highway on Easter weekend. Lenahan continued, adding that Rice has not paid "a single cent" of the $1.1 million settlement he made with his victim. Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice celebrates after scoring during the first half of an NFL football game against the Cincinnati Bengals Sunday, Sept. 15, 2024, in Kansas City, Mo. Rice was the driver of a Lamborghini Urus that was going 119 mph on the North Central Expressway in Dallas when he made "multiple aggressive maneuvers around traffic" before crashing into other vehicles, according to prosecutors. Rice did not check on those vehicles involved in the crash and decided to flee the scene on foot. The 25-year-old receiver said in a statement issued by his attorney that he's had "a lot of sleepless nights thinking about the damages my actions caused, and I will continue working within my means to make sure that everyone impacted will be made whole." Rashee Rice of the Kansas City Chiefs warms up before Super Bowl LVIII against the Kansas City Chiefs at Allegiant Stadium on February 11, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Rice has sat out the Chiefs' first two games, and they certainly miss him. They are 0-2 for the first time since 2014, as Patrick Mahomes is averaging just 211 passing yards so far. He is eligible to return to the Chiefs' sideline in Week 7, when they face the Las Vegas Raiders on Oct. 19. Fox News' Scott Thompson contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FBI Director Kash Patel and Sen. Cory Booker got in a shouting match during Patel's appearance Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, as the New Jersey Democrat accused him of being responsible for a “generational destruction of the nation's premier law enforcement agency.” The oversight hearing, the first of Patel's young but tumultuous tenure, provides a high-stakes platform for him to confront Democrats at a time of internal upheaval and mounting concerns about political violence inside the United States, which President Donald Trump has sought to blame squarely on the left. U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois says immigration agents have arrested 250 people in the Chicago area since a new enforcement campaign was announced last week. Underwood says the arrests began Sept. 6, two days earlier than a program touted as “Midway Blitz” was publicly announced. Top administration officials arrived in Chicago Tuesday, potentially signaling a more aggressive phase of immigration enforcement. Immigrants are being detained in various locations, sparking fear and leading some people to stay home. Advocates report increased activity from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with unmarked vehicles targeting work vans and staking out neighborhoods with large immigrant populations. One Metro Boston city canceled its Hispanic Heritage Month festival due to safety concerns. ICE's “Patriot 2.0" operation follows a previous crackdown in Boston. The U.S. Department of Justice has also filed a lawsuit against Boston over its so-called sanctuary policies. Advocates argue the city's policy of limiting cooperation with ICE keeps the city safe and ensures Boston remains a place for all residents. ▶ Read more about ICE detentions intensifying in so-called sanctuary cities I see it as something -- working with the public to identify that there was a subject in custody,” Patel told senators. He told senators: “Could I have been more careful in my verbiage and said we had a subject instead of the subject? Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, pushed back, saying it caused confusion by making it sound like authorities had caught the person suspected of killing Kirk. Patel shot back by saying, “That's not what I said.” A group of Democratic senators say they are deeply concerned that a Pentagon plan to allow military lawyers to work as temporary immigration judges will violate a ban on using service members for law enforcement and affect the military justice system. It added that “these actions are inherently law enforcement actions that may not be performed by members of the armed forces.” Mike Braun said that the redistricting conversation is “moving” and it's likely inevitable. Braun said a special session could happen any time after November. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said he has had no direct conversations with the White House or Border Patrol and reaffirmed that Chicago police would not collaborate with ICE. “I get that people are feeling a level of anxiety, but they should be assured that we're going to work with all of our stakeholders to make sure the people of Chicago are safe and supported,” he said at a news conference following his signing of an executive order aiming to protect the right to protest. The order states that, if federal law enforcement disrupts peaceful protests, Chicago police will “collaborate with protest organizers to develop a mutually acceptable alternative plan.” Johnson said the order was an attempt to be “proactive” amid federal intervention and after protesters clashed with federal immigration agents Friday outside an ICE processing facility in Broadview, Illinois. They unveiled a stopgap spending bill to keep the federal government through Nov. 21. So, lawmakers will need to pass a stopgap measure to keep agencies funded while they work out their differences for the full year. Democratic leaders have insisted that Republicans negotiate with them on the spending bill to protect health insurance coverage for millions of Americans. But Republicans leaders have rebuffed those demands and say those discussions are for another time and would not be part of the continuing resolution. Any spending bill that passes will need some support from Democrats in the Senate as the measure will need at least 60 votes to advance to a final vote. Patel and the New Jersey Democrat got into a shouting match as Booker charged that Patel is responsible for a “generational destruction of the nation's premier law enforcement agency.” Still, Booker predicted that Patel would not last long in his post. He told Patel that Trump “will cut you loose. This may be the last time I have a hearing with you.” Patel's leadership of the FBI has been marked by turmoil and Democratic accusations that he's using the law enforcement agency to carry out Trump's goals. But Patel told the Senate panel that it was “an entire falsehood” to suggest that he only got the job because he was a Trump loyalist. Patel pointed to his experience as an attorney, congressional staffer and administration official, saying, “There was no loyalty then. There's no loyalty now to anything but the Constitution.” Geoff Duncan speaks during the Democratic National Convention, Wednesday, Aug. 21, 2024, in Chicago. So Georgia Republicans threw me out of their party,” Duncan said in his announcement video released Tuesday. Now I'm running for governor as a proud Democrat.” Trump seemed miffed when an Australian Broadcasting Corp. reporter asked about his wealth since returning to office. Trump told the reporter, ‘You're hurting Australia very much right now, and they want to get along with me.” He told the reporter that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese would be visiting soon and “I'm going to tell him about you. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before departing on Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House, Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025, in Washington. The president also criticized ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl, whom he's known for years. Karl asked Trump about the attorney general's comments that she will be going after hate speech after the killing of Charlie Kirk. Trump responded by telling Karl the administration would “probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly, it's hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart.” FILE - The TikTok logo is seen on a mobile phone in front of a computer screen which displays the TikTok home screen, Oct. 14, 2022, in Boston. The House Select Committee on China says any deal between Beijing and Washington must comply with a law requiring TikTok to be divested from its Chinese ownership or face a ban in the U.S. A framework deal was reached over the future of the popular social media platform at a trade meeting Monday in Madrid. “Underpinning all of our concerns is the Chinese Communist Party's access to American data,” he said. United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem addresses the media during a visit to the Port of Antwerp in Antwerp, Belgium, Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in an X post that she was on the ground Tuesday in Chicago “to make clear we are not backing down.” The news comes as Gregory Bovino, who spearheaded the immigration crackdown that sparked widespread protests in Los Angeles, announced Tuesday his arrival in Chicago, where residents have been bracing for weeks for Trump's promised immigration crackdown and National Guard deployment. Those comments are notable as the FBI director faces allegations in a lawsuit that he fired other agents and FBI leaders based on cases they worked. Patel has refused to address the termination of those agents, telling lawmakers he won't discuss personnel matters. In a tense exchange, Sen. Richard Blumenthal accused the FBI director of lying when he told lawmakers at his confirmation hearing that agents would not be subject to political retribution. Patel objected to the accusation, telling the Democrat from Connecticut: “You accusing me of lying is something I don't take lightly, but I'm not going to get into a tit for tat with you.” If there were, I would bring the case yesterday that he trafficked to other individuals,” Patel said, while also acknowledging that previous investigations of Epstein were limited. “This issue is not going to go away,” Kennedy said. “And I think the central question for the American people is this: They know that Epstein trafficked young women for sex to himself. Patel said that the current case files only included “limited search warrants” between 2006 and 2007 because federal prosecutors in Florida had previously cut a secret deal with Epstein that allowed him to avoid prosecution for his previous actions. Patel says the FBI has 35 open investigations into threats against judges, who have faced a sharp increase in violent messages in recent years. Judges have increasingly spoken out against threats of violence, pointing to worrying rhetoric from both sides of the political aisle in recent years and saying the threats have reached a new peak during the second Trump administration. Johnson also defended employers who take action against employees whose comments go too far. Johnson noted that Trump has been called “the most despicable names” and he urged all leaders to tone it down. “Leaders cannot call their political opponents Nazis and fascists and enemies of the state because they disagree with their policy priorities,” he said. US Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino speaks during a press conference alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday, June 12, 2025, in Los Angeles. Gregory Bovino, who spearheaded the immigration crackdown that sparked widespread protests in Los Angeles, announced his arrival in Chicago with a post on X. “Operation At Large is here to continue the mission we started in Los Angeles.” Advocates for immigrants say they've noticed an uptick in detentions by ICE agents in Chicago as the nation's third-largest city braces for Trump's promised immigration crackdown and National Guard deployment. The threats have deepened dread among already fearful immigrant communities, which cancelled and delayed Mexican Independence Day celebrations. An ICE officer fatally shot a suspect trying to evade arrest last week. Speaker Mike Johnson said a bill to avoid a partial government shutdown at month's end would not include health care provisions sought by Democrats. Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries has said House Democrats won't support a partisan bill that “continues to gut the healthcare of the American people.” But Johnson said Republicans are not going to revisit their big tax cut bill that trimmed Medicaid spending over the coming decade, and said the looming expiration of tax credits for some health insurance coverage is a “December policy issue.” “The same Democrats who decried government shutdowns under President Biden appear to have no heartache whatsoever at walking our nation off that cliff right now,” Johnson said. Times spokesman Charles Stadtlander said Tuesday the lawsuit “lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. Trump has gone after other media outlets, including filing a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the The Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch in July after the newspaper published a story reporting on his ties to wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein. Patel was asked by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., whether the Kirk shooting is being treated as part of a broader trend of violence against religious groups, and Patel responded, “We are investigating Charlie's assassination fully and completely and running out every lead related to any allegation of broader violence.” Patel also said that the FBI is investigating “anyone and everyone” who was involved in an online gaming chatroom on Discord with the alleged shooter. That chatroom involved “a lot more” than 20 people, Patel said. The FBI director told Sen. Amy Klobuchar that he is “willing to engage and explore new ways” to address gun violence in the United States. “Whatever creativity we can use to eliminate even just one shooting, one horrific death, I am in favor of engaging with Congress fully to do,” Patel told the Democrat from Minnesota. The FBI director said there are “instances on this legislation that could prevent future attacks” but said he would not “weigh into the creation of legislation.” The FBI director says his agency, as well as the U.S. military and intelligence community, will be conducting a yearslong mission that seeks to use counterterrorism tactics against drug-trafficking organizations. Tim Walz said Tuesday he will seek a third term in the 2026 elections, hoping to beat the odds to become the longest-serving governor in a state where voters have usually said two terms were plenty. “I've always tried to do what's right for Minnesota, and I'll never stop fighting to protect us from the chaos, corruption, and cruelty coming out of Washington,” Walz said in a campaign video. Walz has been frequently mentioned as a potential 2028 presidential candidate. He sharply criticized Trump while touring early caucus and primary states after he and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris were defeated. ▶ Read more about Walz's decision to run for governor again Questioned by Durbin on the recent firings of FBI agents, Patel said he would not get into personnel decisions and accused the Democrat of unfairly attacking FBI leadership. Patel is facing a lawsuit from three high-ranking FBI officials who have accused him of illegally firing them in a “campaign of retribution.” “We knocked off, actually, three boats not two,” Trump told reporters when asked about Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's angry response to U.S. military operations that the White House says is targeting Venezuelan drug smugglers. Trump had confirmed earlier that the U.S. military on Monday had targeted a second boat allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela, killing three aboard the vessel. He also hinted that the military targeting of cartels could be further expanded. Trump also sent a new warning to the Maduro government on Tuesday: “Stop sending Tren de Aragua to the United States,” Trump said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is a close ally of Trump, asked the FBI director what legal justification the administration is using for military strikes on Venezuelan boats that the president has said are carrying drugs. Still, Graham expressed support for an aggressive approach to nations where drugs are manufactured. “We will hunt down every single one of those narco-traffickers,” Patel told Graham. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., speaks as FBI Director Kash Patel appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his first oversight hearing, Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025, at the Capitol in Washington. During one combative exchange, Patel was pressed by the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee over an unsigned memo released by the Justice Department in July that said there was no evidence of a Jeffrey Epstein “client list.” Patel responded with a dig at former President Joe Biden, telling Durbin: “Would you have preferred I used autopen?” Republicans have accused the Democratic president of signing pardons in his final days in the White House with an autopen instead of by his own hand. The Associated Press has previously reported that agents and senior executives alike have been subjected to polygraph exams aimed at ferreting out disclosures of information related to Patel. Patel brought up the Epstein files in his opening statement, seeking to address a topic that's brought criticism from some quarters of Trump's conservative base who want to see more information released about the probe. He says it involved a “very limited search warrant” and asserted that the Trump administration has done more to release all “credible information” they could under the law. Patel also said Epstein had not been a source for the FBI. He didn't acknowledge criticism that the FBI and Justice Department have faced in recent months over the abrupt announcement in July that they would not be releasing additional documents from their trove of evidence. The state's high court on Tuesday declined to hear Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' appeal of her removal from the case. FBI Director Kash Patel appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his first oversight hearing where he is facing questions about the investigation into Charlie Kirk's killing as well as the recent firings of senior officials who have accused Patel of illegal political retribution, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025. Patel has concluded his opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee with a bit of a challenge for his critics: “I'm not going anywhere.” The FBI director pointed to his experience as a congressional staffer and Trump administration official, saying, “If you want to criticize my 16 years of service, please bring it on.” Senate Republicans have continued to express confidence in Patel despite criticism from some conservative commentators of how he's led the FBI's response to the killing of Charlie Kirk. Democrats, meanwhile, will intensely question Patel over what they say is a highly politicized approach to the FBI. ▶ Read the AP's coverage of Robert Redford's death and legacy In his opening remarks earlier in the hearing, Durbin said Democrats are not responsible for Kirk's death, just as Republicans are not responsible for the killing of a Democratic state lawmaker in Minnesota earlier this year. The country is going through a period of division and political violence, he said, but “Republicans are not Nazis, Democrats are not evil.” Critics have raised concerns that the focus on immigration enforcement and violent crime could divert attention from the FBI's ability to focus on matters like counterterrorism. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before departing on Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House, Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025, in Washington. Trump in a Monday post on Truth Social said that he had read a news report indicating that Hamas would use the captives as “human shields.” Residents still in the city were warned they must leave and head south. The push marks yet another escalation in a conflict that has roiled the Middle East as any potential ceasefire feels even further out of reach despite months of diplomacy. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before departing on Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House, Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025, in Washington. The president, speaking as he was leaving the White House, said that U.K. officials want to continue trade negotiations during his coming visit. Those ranged from the prosecution of White House adviser Peter Navarro for his response to a congressional subpoena, to the probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Republican Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley opened the hearing expressing sympathy for the fatal shooting last week of Charlie Kirk, which is under FBI investigation. Prosecutors are preparing to file a capital murder charge Tuesday against the Utah man who authorities say held a “leftist ideology” and may have been “radicalized” online before he was arrested in the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Charges against 22-year-old Tyler Robinson are expected to come ahead of Tuesday's first court hearing since he was accused last week of shooting Kirk, a conservative activist credited with energizing the Republican youth movement and helping Donald Trump win back the White House in 2024. Majed al-Ansari, a spokesman for Qatar's Foreign Ministry, gave the readout of the talks between Rubio and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. U.S. indices were mostly higher early Tuesday after Wall Street set new records and investor expectation grew that the Federal Reserve will announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 on Wednesday. Shoppers increased their spending at a better-than-expected pace in August from July, helped by back-to-school purchases, even as Trump's tariffs are starting to hurt the job market and lead to price hikes. FILE - Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis arrives during a hearing on the Georgia election interference case in Atlanta, March 1, 2024. Citing an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship Fulton County District Attorney had with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, the Georgia Court of Appeals had ruled that she and her office not continue to prosecute the election interference case against Donald Trump and others. FBI Director Kash Patel will appear before Oversight committees Tuesday and Wednesday as he faces scrutiny over his leadership of the Charlie Kirk investigation and other areas.</p>

Decarlos Brown, accused of fatally stabbing 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska, can be heard in a jailhouse phone call with his sister saying he was under the control of "materials" allegedly implanted in his brain. FIRST ON FOX: The House Judiciary Committee plans to hold a field hearing in Charlotte, North Carolina, this month following the fatal stabbing of a young woman on the city's light rail that sparked heated debate about criminal justice reform. The remote hearing is scheduled for the morning of Sept. 29, Fox News Digital has learned, and will highlight recent criminal activity in Charlotte. News of the hearing comes after Iryna Zarutska's murder on Aug. 22 captured national attention. Chilling surveillance footage showed a suspect who was sitting behind Zarutska stand up and strike her with a pocket knife several times. Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee who was on her way home from work at the time of the incident, died on the train from her injuries, authorities said. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Brown will be prosecuted for murder and said "soft-on-crime policies" caused Zarutska's death. "Iryna Zarutska was a young woman living the American dream — her horrific murder is a direct result of failed soft-on-crime policies that put criminals before innocent people," Bondi said. "I have directed my attorneys to federally prosecute Decarlos Brown Jr., a repeat violent offender with a history of violent crime, for murder." All House Judiciary Committee members are able to attend the hearing. The panel's subcommittee on oversight will lead it. The hearing was scheduled prior to another shocking crime event — the assassination of prolific conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which took place at Utah Valley University last week. The committee visited Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's jurisdiction in April 2023, a week after Bragg brought criminal charges against then-former President Donald Trump. The committee held a similar hearing in Chicago later that year. Charging and trying defendants in Charlotte comes under the purview of Mecklenburg County District Attorney Spencer B. Merriweather III, an appointee of North Carolina Gov.

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., confirmed the hearing in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying Zarutska's death was a "culmination of years of failed liberal policies that put criminals ahead of victims." "This was entirely preventable, and we owe it to the people to fix it before another innocent life is lost," Van Drew said. Fox News Digital reached out to Merriweather's office for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Trump heads to UK: US President Donald Trump is traveling today for a state visit to the UK, where he will be welcomed by the royal family tomorrow at Windsor Castle and meet with Prime Minister Kier Starmer on Thursday. • Focus on hate speech: Attorney General Pam Bondi said the administration will “target” anyone who uses hate speech, regardless of party affiliation. Multiple sources close to GOP leadership insist that the bill is “clean” of any partisan language – and said the only new policy is a bipartisan provision to increase cash for member security. Still, the House GOP's plan sets the stage for a messy funding battle with Democrats, as it did not result from bipartisan negotiations and contains none of Democrats' demands. Most House Democrats are expected to vote against it, forcing Johnson and the House GOP to deliver the votes on their own. Democrats refuse to support any funding bill that does not involve their party's leadership to discuss their own priorities, such as extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire this year. Republicans, meanwhile, are insisting that must be a separate negotiation. House leadership hopes to vote on the stopgap bill on Friday, the last day before Congress leaves for a weeklong recess for Rosh Hashanah. It also includes a funding “fix” for DC, which would free up $1 billion of the city's own money, adjusting a mistake in an earlier bill. Sen. Cory Booker got in a heated exchange with FBI Director Kash Patel during Tuesday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing after the New Jersey Democrat warned that President Donald Trump “will cut you loose.” “I think this might be your last oversight hearing.” Booker told Patel that “as much as you supplicate yourself to the will of Donald Trump and not the Constitution of the United States of America,” Trump has shown “he is not loyal to people like you.” “I believe you have made our country weaker and less safe,” Booker said. Patel replied by telling Booker, “that rant of false information does not bring this country together.” “You're going to lecture me on dividing this country? The two began shouting over each other, with Patel telling Booker the senator was “an embarrassment” and Booker ridiculing Patel for “making a mockery of this committee.” He wouldn't step forward and be accountable for the information that we constitutionally should be getting about the agency,” he said. CNN's Arlette Saenz and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report Britt called it “mind-boggling” that no one has been able to figure out who leaked the decision, which was published by Politico in May 2020. She said that the US Marshals Service was unable to identify a leaker and closed its investigation in January 2023. “I can't speak to what the Marshals did and how they conducted their investigation. Patel also said that the FBI is operating under normal protocol for leak investigations regarding this issue. It would be in addition to the White House's $58 million request for executive and legislative branch security, which is also expected to be included in the bill. More on the shutdown fight: Cole also accused Democrats of throwing a “temper tantrum” that could result in a government shutdown, warning that Republican leadership has no off-ramp strategy if Democrats decide to withhold votes on the short-term bill to fund the government by the September 30 deadline. President Donald Trump is on his way to the United Kingdom for a state visit, but before departing Tuesday, he spoke to reporters at the White House and  addressed topics including Charlie Kirk's assassination and the war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us, here's what Trump said this morning: War in Ukraine: Trump said it was time for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept a deal that would end the war with Russia, suggesting the leader whose nation was invaded was a holdup in striking a peace agreement. Instead of offering a stance on the Israeli operation, Trump zeroed in on Hamas' use of hostages as human shields. Robert Redford: Trump mourned the death of actor Robert Redford, saying, “There was a period of time when he was the hottest.” The comments come a day after President Donald Trump said he'd consider naming far-left anti-fascism group Antifa as domestic terrorists, previewing a plan to crack down on what he's cast as a widespread network of left-wing radicals inciting violence. “Have you been asked or directed by the White House or others to engage in a crackdown on political groups or organizations, nonprofits, after the murder of Charlie Kirk?” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal asked Patel during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. I've been asked by my chain of command to properly root out criminal activity wherever it is in whatever investigation we are conducting. “Nobody gives me a list on who to target,” he added. It's a familiar thing to see in London, British guards stoically standing wearing big, furry and black hats. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham says there's been progress on moving his bipartisan Russia sanctions resolution and predicts there will be a breakthrough on it by Wednesday, as pressure grows for congressional action. “There will be a plan here coming out in the next few days, I think, to act on this bill, and I think it will help in this war. That's my hope,” the South Carolina Republican told reporters, noting he spoke to House members on Monday. I think by Wednesday, we'll have our differences resolved about how the waiver works,” Graham added. The South Carolina Republican's resolution, which has over 80 Senate co-sponsors, would allow the president to levy up to a 500% tariff on imports from countries that purchase Russian uranium, gas and oil, and have not contributed to Ukraine's war effort. “I think the legislation I've been working on with Sen. Blumenthal would be a strong signal to Russia, to China, to Europe, that America, not just President Trump, is behind the idea of holding those accountable who prop up Putin's war machine.” Graham emphasized that Europe and the US will have to pursue sanctions together. During a tense back and forth with the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patel pushed back on a New York Times story that said the two officials, Chris Meyer and Walter Giardina, were fired by the director after becoming targeted by the right for their work on January 6 cases or for their connection to Robert Mueller, the special counsel whose probe into President Donald Trump during his first term has become a political lightning rod for conservatives. FBI Director Kash Patel blamed Alex Acosta, who previously oversaw a non-prosecution agreement with sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein as a US attorney in Florida, for committing the “original sin in the Epstein case.” In the deal, Epstein avoided federal charges by agreeing to serve 13 months in prison on Florida state prostitution charges and to register as a sex offender. “If I were the FBI director, then it wouldn't have happened,” Patel said. A Justice Department review later found that Acosta exercised “poor judgement” in striking the deal. He went on to serve as Trump's Labor secretary in his first term. And he should not have been given a get-out-of-jail-free card.” President Donald Trump on Tuesday mourned the passing of actor Robert Redford — saying “there was a period of time when he was the hottest.” Redford, known for his roles “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” and “All the President's Men,” died Tuesday at age 89. “He had a period of years that there was nobody better,” Trump said before leaving for the UK. Trump added, “That's a good way to go, I guess.” US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that it was time for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept a deal that would end the war with Russia, suggesting the leader whose nation was invaded was a holdup in striking a peace agreement. Russia has maintained its maximalist demands to end the war, including taking over the entire Donbas region and insisting Ukraine never join NATO. Still, it was Zelensky who Trump said Tuesday must agree to a deal. “And Europe has to stop buying oil from Russia. But they have to stop buying oil from Russia,” Trump added, renewing his call for more European efforts to end the war. Trump insisted his Alaska summit with Putin had yielded results. “It accomplished a lot, but it takes two to tango,” he said when questioned by CNN about progress a month after the Anchorage meeting. “It looks like I have to sit in the room with them, because they can't sit in the room together. “You have a lot of hate in your heart,” Trump told an ABC reporter in response to a question about Attorney General Pam Bondi's assertion this week that “hate speech” could be treated as a crime. Trump has since sued multiple other outlets in response to critical coverage, most recently filing a lawsuit against The New York Times on Monday that accuses the newspaper of being a “virtual mouthpiece” for the Democratic Party and seeks $15 billion in damages. President Donald Trump said the US military has targeted three boats that he claimed were transporting drugs from Venezuela. But speaking to reporters outside of the White House Tuesday, Trump said: “We knocked off three boats, actually, not two. CNN has also reached out to the Venezuelan government. Asked about concerns from Venezuela's leader about continued US strikes, Trump responded: “Well I would say this: right away, stop sending Tren de Aragua into the United States. There are not a lot of boats out on the water. Patel is testifying on Capitol Hill this morning, where he's being grilled over his leadership of the FBI — including his decision to prematurely announce that the agency had a suspect in custody in Kirk's murder, a statement he had to walk back hours later. Talking with reporters prior to his departure for the UK, Trump also defended Attorney General Pam Bondi, saying she's done an “unbelievable job.” Bondi came under fire earlier this week for suggesting the administration would prosecute people for “hate speech,” prompting backlash from both sides of the aisle. She later clarified in a post on X that “hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. “Hamas is using the old human shield deal,” he said. Trump has previously been publicly agnostic on Israel's plans to launch a ground invasion, saying it was a decision for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. FBI Director Kash Patel began his oversight hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee by running through a timeline of the investigation into Charlie Kirk's alleged killer, touting his own work amid criticism of his early social media posts that caused public confusion. Ending his opening statement, Patel struck a defiant tone: If you want to criticize my 16 years of service, bring it on,” he said. Follow updates on the Charlie Kirk shooting investigation here. Attorney General Pam Bondi today said that “hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment.” Her comments come after President Donald Trump said he'd consider naming far-left anti-fascists domestic terrorists, previewing a plan to crack down on what he's cast as a widespread network of left-wing radicals inciting violence. Bondi's social media post also went further than comments she made yesterday on the podcast of Katie Miller – former adviser for Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and wife of Trump adviser Stephen Miller – where she used attacks against Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and conservative influencer Charlie Kirk to denounce hate speech. You cannot dox a conservative family and think it will be brushed off as ‘free speech.' These acts are punishable crimes, and every single threat will be met with the full force of the law,” Bondi said on X. President Donald Trump has long sought an elusive deal to wrest TikTok's US assets from Chinese control, allowing an American investor group to buy it. As Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tells it: a threat from Trump to shut down TikTok in the United States. “What turned the tide was a call that Ambassador (Jamieson) Greer and I had with President Trump the night after the first day of negotiations, and President Trump made it clear that he would be willing to let TikTok go dark,” Bessent told CNBC this morning. Bessent said he anticipated Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will finalize a deal during a phone call set to take place Friday. “Treasury secretaries dating back to Alexander Hamilton have a history of dueling,” Bessent said. “Turned out a little better for Treasury's side this time.” CNN reported last week that Bessent threatened to punch Pulte in the face during a dinner at Executive Club, an exclusive MAGA-aligned group started by some of Trump's closest advisers, according to the sources. Bessent accused Pulte of talking negatively about him to Trump in private, the sources said, which quickly escalated as Bessent cursed at Pulte. President Donald Trump could begin introducing actions targeting liberal organizations as soon as this week, people familiar with the discussions said, as he looks to channel conservative anger over Charlie Kirk's killing to go after his political opponents. Trump said yesterday he was open to designating certain left-wing groups as terror organizations and said he was discussing bringing racketeering charges against some operations with his attorney general. Trump has also raised the possibility of revoking tax-exempt status for liberal nonprofits, and his attorney general and senior adviser have raised the prospect of criminal charges against groups or individuals who are allegedly targeting conservatives. What actions the president ultimately takes remain an open question. But advisers said there was an across-the-administration effort now underway to identify groups that target conservatives or promote violence, with a goal of taking quick action. As Trump departs today for a state visit in the United Kingdom, team members are expected to continue those efforts back in Washington, DC, while he is on the three-day trip. Some context: While the suspect in Kirk's killing held “leftist ideology,” according to Utah's Gov. Spencer Cox, a motive for the assassination hasn't been unveiled. Still, Trump has suggested the killing extended from a wider coordinated effort to sow violence against conservatives. “We have some pretty radical groups, and they got away with murder,” he said in the Oval Office yesterday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The top Republican in the Colorado House, Rose Pugliese, resigned from office Monday following clashes with Democratic lawmakers in a special session and a scandal involving a secret photograph of another lawmaker. In a letter to her supporters, Pugliese said she was leaving elected office to focus on her children. There is nothing more important in my life than them. She was elected to be the Colorado House Minority Leader in 2024 after former Colorado House Minority Leader Mike Lynch resigned after failing to disclose an arrest for drunk driving and possessing a firearm while intoxicated. Her resignation comes after she clashed with Democrats on the Colorado House floor during a special session. The clashes followed the abrupt resignation of Republican state Rep. Ryan Armagost, the former House minority whip, who took a picture of a Democratic lawmaker without her knowledge during floor proceedings. He then sent that picture of Democratic state Rep. Yara Zokaie to fellow Republican state lawmakers, some of whom compared her outfit to that of a stripper and a prostitute. She removed Armagost from his committee assignments three months after she knew the photo had been sent in the group chat. “I take this matter very seriously and do not condone this behavior,” Pugliese told CPR News last month about the posting of the picture to social media. The top Republican in the state Senate chamber, Colorado Senate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen, also resigned this year, citing a new job at a conservative organization.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — For the first time, federal health officials are taking aim at telehealth companies promoting unofficial versions of prescription drugs — including popular weight loss medications — as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on pharmaceutical advertising. The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday posted more than 100 letters to various drug and online prescribing companies, including Hims & Hers, which has built a multibillion-dollar business centered around lower-cost versions of blockbuster obesity injections. The FDA warned the company to remove “false and misleading” promotional statements from its website, including language claiming that its customized products contain “the same active ingredient” as FDA-approved drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. “Your claims imply that your products are the same as an FDA-approved product when they are not,” states the warning letter, dated Sept. 9. San Francisco-based Hims said Tuesday that it “looks forward to engaging with the FDA.” “Our website and our customer-facing materials note that compounded treatments are not approved or evaluated by the FDA,” the company said in a statement. It's the first FDA attempt to directly police online platforms like Hims, which have long argued they're not subject to traditional drug advertising rules. A memo signed by President Donald Trump last week directed Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the FDA to ensure that pharmaceutical ads on TV, social media and other websites are “truthful and non-misleading.” As part of the initiative, the FDA promised to send 100 letters to companies with deceptive ads. The new FDA letters each contain “cease and desist” language. That's a different approach for the agency, which typically drafts its letters in highly bureaucratic language citing specific FDA regulations. Hims has been under scrutiny from Washington for months. Earlier this year, a Super Bowl ad from the company touted the benefits of its weight-loss medications but didn't list any of their side effects or potential harms. FDA rules require advertisements to present a balanced picture of drug risks and benefits. But booming demand for obesity medications opened the door to selling cheaper copies. The FDA permits so-called compounding, or customized production, when there is a shortage of the official versions of FDA-approved medications. The letters posted Tuesday come from FDA's drug center. A letter posted last week from FDA's vaccine division took issue with a TV ad for AstraZeneca's FluMist vaccine, saying the spot's “background music and visual distractions” detract from information about side effects. The letter was signed by FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vinay Prasad, an ally of Kennedy who recently returned to his job at the agency after briefly being forced to step aside. Researchers and consumer advocates have long complained that the upbeat TV images of patients enjoying life with family and friends often overshadow discussions of side effects. Additionally, studies have shown that patients exposed to drug ads are more likely to ask their doctors about the medication, even if they don't fit the prescribing criteria.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fani Willis, District Attorney of Fulton County speaks to the Associated Press on Tuesday, Oct. 22, 2024, in Atlanta. ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia's highest court has declined to consider Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' appeal of her removal from the Georgia election interference case against President Donald Trump and others. Citing an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship Willis had with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she had hired to lead the case, the Georgia Court of Appeals in December ruled that Willis and her office could not continue to prosecute the case. Trump hailed the court's ruling as “a great decision” and called Willis' prosecution of him and others for their attempts to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss in Georgia “a rigged case to start off with.” “What Fani Willis did to innocent people, patriots that love our country, what she did to them by indicting them and destroying them, she should be put in jail,” Trump told reporters. Ashleigh Merchant, who exposed Willis' romantic relationship with Wade as defense attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman, said: “We hope this will finally close this chapter.” Willis said she disagreed with the court's decision, but would direct her office to make the case file and evidence available to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia so it can appoint a new prosecutor to replace her. The council's executive director, Pete Skandalakis, said Tuesday he will begin searching for a new prosecutor to replace Willis but didn't know how long that might take. Skandalakis said that once the new prosecutor is appointed it is “up to him or her what to do with the case.” That person could continue on the track that Willis has taken, decide to pursue only some charges or dismiss the case altogether. It could be difficult to find a prosecutor willing to take the case, given its complex nature and the resources required. Even if a new prosecutor wants to continue on the path charted by Willis, it seems unlikely that Trump could be prosecuted now that he's the sitting president. But there are 14 other defendants who still face charges in the case. One of those defendants is former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. An attorney for Giuliani, Arthur Aidala, said he's hopeful that whoever is ultimately appointed as the new prosecutor will abandon the case entirely. “We're cautiously optimistic that they will choose not to go forward,” Aidala told reporters in New York. The Georgia case was one of four criminal cases brought in 2023 against Trump. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith abandoned two federal prosecutions after Trump won the November election. Willis had asked the Georgia high court to consider whether the lower appeals court was wrong to disqualify her “based solely upon an appearance of impropriety and absent a finding of an actual conflict of interest or forensic misconduct.” She also asked the state Supreme Court to weigh whether the Court of Appeals erred “in substituting the trial court's discretion with its own” in this case. “And no Georgia court has ever reversed a trial court's order declining to disqualify a prosecutor based solely on an appearance of impropriety.” Lawyers for Trump had argued in a court filing that the lower appeals court got it right and that Willis' “disqualification is mandated because it is the only remedy that could purge the taint of impropriety.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Georgia Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, leaving in place a lower-court ruling that disqualified her from prosecuting President Donald Trump in the state's 2020 election interference and racketeering indictment. The decision, announced Tuesday, ends Willis's bid to remain on the high-profile RICO case and transfers prosecutorial responsibility to a new attorney. “The Georgia Supreme Court has correctly denied review of the Georgia Court of Appeals decision disqualifying DA Fani Willis and her office as prosecutors in the Fulton County RICO case,” said Steve Sadow, Trump's lead defense attorney. Willis was removed after revelations that she concealed a romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she hired in 2021 to help lead the case. Defense attorneys alleged the relationship constituted a conflict of interest and undermined public confidence in the prosecution, and they also claimed that she received illegal kickbacks. Though Wade resigned in March 2024 following a ruling by Judge Scott McAfee that either he or Willis had to step aside, the Georgia Court of Appeals ruled in December 2024 that Willis's continued involvement in the case was untenable. In that 2-1 decision issued in December, judges on the appellate panel said the appearance of impropriety could not be cured by Wade's resignation alone. Willis petitioned the state's highest court for review in January, arguing that no Georgia court had ever disqualified a prosecutor for mere appearance issues without proof of actual misconduct. The case stems from an August 2023 indictment accusing Trump and 18 others of participating in a racketeering conspiracy to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results. The charges center, in part, on Trump's phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which the president urged officials to “find” enough votes to reverse the outcome. Fourteen defendants still face charges, although four have accepted plea deals.</p>

(AP Photo/John Bazemore, File) ATLANTA (AP) — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they're confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia. The money-losing California-based company breaks ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump's successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car. Rivian Chief Policy Officer Alan Hoffman said the company believes it can sell electric vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because they're superior. “We did not build this company based upon federal tax incentives,” Hoffman said. The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian's key to reaching profitability. The Illinois plant will begin making smaller R2 SUVs next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it's limiting production now in part to launch 2026 models. “For Rivian, it's do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can't scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025's first half, according to Cox Automotive. Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors' slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. At the same time, some automakers' ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant. “With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian's favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can't benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads. Brian Kemp, who has said he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” acknowledges Rivian faces bumps, but says he remains confident the company can fulfill its promises. While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Georgia's Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans. Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater. “I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site. There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Hoffman says Rivian is “in this for the long haul.”</p>
