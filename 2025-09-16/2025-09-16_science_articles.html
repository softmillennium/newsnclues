                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From grade school onward, complex multiplication has been a headache. But an assistant professor from the University of New South Wales Sydney in Australia has developed  a method for multiplying giant numbers together that's more efficient than the “long multiplication” so many are taught at an early age. “More technically, we have proved a 1971 conjecture of Schönhage and Strassen about the complexity of integer multiplication,” associate professor David Harvey says in this video. Although a faster method was developed in 2007, it's rarely used today. Schönhage and Strassen predicted that an algorithm multiplying n-digit numbers using n * log(n) basic operations should exist, Harvey says. His paper is the first known proof that it does. Harvey picks the example of 314 multiplied by 159—a large equation, sure, but much larger ones are used every day in real-life scenarios. To solve the problem, most people are taught to multiply each individual number together, and then add up the sums: It will get the correct answer, but Schönhage and Strassen designed a faster method. It was able to move beyond n2  and into something smaller, but a challenge still presented itself in the form of n * log(n). For some, seeing a word in the middle of a math problem might be enough to make their eyes glaze over like they did in algebra class. As a refresher: log is short for logarithm, which helps people decipher exponents that make numbers squared or cubed or even something higher. So 2⁵ is 32, but expressed logarithmically, it would look like log₂(32)=5. While it may seem like a mouthful, logarithms are crucial when numbers get much larger. A computer using the Schönhage-Strassen method could do so in 30 seconds. “It means you can do all sorts of arithmetic more efficiently, for example division and square roots,” he says. “You could also calculate digits of pi more efficiently than before. It even has applications to problems involving huge prime numbers. It was not a forgone conclusion that someone would eventually be successful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Earth has a few strategies up its metaphorical sleeves for creating new islands. Then, you have the truly bizarre methods, such as mud volcanoes off the coast of Azerbaijan capable of creating islands seemingly overnight. Then, there are geologic processes that are a bit more middle of the road—not exactly spanning geologic epochs but not forming islands within moments either. Over the past century, this lake has seen a lot of changes, as a nearby glacier (Alsek Glacier) has retreated more than two miles, and the lake has grown to almost double its size. Lying within this lake is an approximately 2-square-mile landmass known as Prow Knob, named in the 1960s for its resemblance to the prow of a ship. As Alsek Glacier retreated, a process accelerated by anthropogenic climate change, Prow Knob started to very slowly form as an island. By 1984, the western part of Prow Knob formed a lakeshore, but it would still be another forty years until ice officially separated from the newly formed island. Compared to these examples, the creation of Prow Knob island may seem inconsequential. However, the natural processes that formed these other landscapes were millions of years in the making, and in the era of anthropogenic climate change, glacial retreat is speeding up, which can come with devastating and deadly consequences. One of the more direct threats from glacier retreat is the increased likelihood of landslides within arctic lakes and fjords, and these can have dramatic consequences. In 2023, for example, a landslide in Greenland created a seiche that caused seismic waves for nine days. Eight years earlier, the 2015 Taan Fjord landslide in Alaska created a 600-foot-tall wave. And climate change isn't just limited to its impact on glaciers in Alaska. Another study published this week showed that permafrost in the world's Arctic regions, which are warming some four times faster than the rest of the world, are beginning to turn rivers orange as sulfuric acid, produced from sulfide-rich rocks interacting with water and oxygen, are dissolving toxic levels of naturally-occurring metals into the river. When it comes to climate change, nowhere will be left untouched—not even the most icy, remote corners of the world.

The mosquito Aedes aegypti transmits dengue and other viruses. Support for this article was provided by the Pulitzer Center. Last month, a parade of vehicles wound its way through three cities in Brazil, releasing clouds of mosquitoes into the air. These infected mosquitoes are the latest weapon in Brazil's fight against dengue, which infects millions of people in the country each year and can be fatal. The company that runs it, Wolbito do Brasil, aims to protect about 14 million Brazilians per year through its Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. In 2024, the country experienced its worst outbreak yet: with 6.6 million probable cases and more than 6,300 related deaths. This year's outbreak, although less severe, is also one of the highest on record, with 1.6 million probable cases so far (see ‘Dangerous outbreaks'). A locally produced dengue vaccine is now awaiting approval by the country's drug-regulatory agency, and its health ministry expects to start administering tens of millions of doses by next year. These twin advances offer some hope to other countries — in the region and beyond. Driven by forces such as climate change, mosquito adaptation, globalized trade and movements of people, dengue is becoming a crisis worldwide, with an estimated 3.9 billion people at risk of infection. Currently, there is one main dengue vaccine in use around the world: Qdenga, licensed by the Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda. The vaccine has been approved in many countries, including Brazil, which was the first nation to include it in its public-health system. So far, Qdenga has been administered to children between the ages of 10 and 14, one of the groups most likely to end up in hospital after contracting dengue, together with older people. Its safety and efficacy have not yet been tested in adults aged over 60. The main reasons for such a limited roll-out in Brazil are availability and cost. And even in the most optimistic scenario, the maximum number of doses Takeda could provide by 2028 is 50 million — enough to vaccinate 25 million people. What's more, for people who have not had dengue before, clinical trials did not show Qdenga to be effective against all four variants — or serotypes — of the dengue virus. Brazil is trying to address all of those limitations with its one-dose vaccine candidate, developed at the Butantan Institute, a public biomedical research centre in São Paulo. “Having local production capacity gives us independence on decisions — how many doses we need, and at what speed to vaccinate,” says Esper Kallás, Butantan's director. “You can practise prices that are more suitable and absorbable by a public-health system such as Brazil's.” Butantan is also optimistic that its vaccine will be effective against all four forms of dengue. That means that a successful vaccine needs to generate antibodies for all four serotypes without triggering severe reactions, which makes it a difficult vaccine to develop. “It was indeed a challenge, as each serotype behaves differently,” says Neuza Frazatti Gallina, manager of the viral vaccine development laboratory at Butantan. After testing 30 formulations, Butantan arrived at one that proved highly effective in preventing infections, according to the preliminary results of a phase III trial involving more than 16,000 volunteers in Brazil. “It was a well-designed trial,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, who is team lead for vaccine development at the World Health Organization (WHO). But she says one limitation of the trial is that it was conducted in a single country, and therefore runs a risk that all four serotypes were not circulating at the time. In fact, serotypes 3 and 4 were not prevalent during the data-collection period of the clinical trial, although they are now circulating in Brazil. Butantan researchers suggest that the vaccine will be effective against serotypes 3 and 4, pointing to data from a phase II trial2 in 300 adults that showed participants produced neutralizing antibodies to each of the serotypes. That study evaluated safety and immunological response in the short term, rather than looking at the vaccine's long-term efficacy in preventing infections. The full results of the Brazilian phase III trial — which will provide data on long-term effectiveness — are not yet public and are undergoing peer review. And although there's still no certainty about when Anvisa, Brazil's regulatory agency, will approve the vaccine, the government is counting on it. In February, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced that, starting in 2026, the Ministry of Health would be buying 60 million doses annually. To meet that demand, Butantan is now producing the vaccine at its São Paulo facility. On its lush campus, an entire building is dedicated to churning out doses. Regarding the vaccine's approval, “We are very confident,” says Kallás. “We also anticipate that there is a very prominent need to have this product in the arms of people. So we hit the road running and started producing vaccines late last year.” Although Butantan's production efforts will focus initially on meeting Brazil's need for millions of doses, Kallás expects that the vaccine could reach other countries. In the meantime, Merck is developing a potential vaccine for Asia with an almost identical formulation, which builds on the knowledge that Butantan has developed. In a statement, the drug firm said that Butantan is “sharing clinical data and other learnings”. In June, Merck started enrolling participants for its own phase III trial. The World Mosquito Program (WMP) — a non-profit group of companies owned by Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, where the strategy was developed — has operations in 14 countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico and Colombia, but Brazil leads the way in terms of the scale of its expansion. Wolbachia is naturally present in around 50% of insects, but not in the mosquito species Aedes aegypti, which is the main transmitter of dengue and many other viruses.

A recent trend is the development of tumour-specific or conditionally activated STING agonists for enhanced safety and efficacy. Here we explore an unconventional prodrug activation strategy for on-tumour synthesis of a potent agonist. Leveraging the unique mechanism of MSA2, a small-molecule agonist that dimerizes non-covalently before binding to STING, we showed that its analogues bearing reactive functional groups readily and selectively form covalent dimers under mild conditions and in complex environments. We identified a reacting pair that led to a thioether-linked dimer with submicromolar potency in cell-based assays. Caging one of the reactants with a self-immolative β-glucuronide moiety resulted in a two-component prodrug system that near-exclusively formed the active compounds in tumours overexpressing β-glucuronidase. These results exemplify the use of small-molecule recognition for on-site generation of active compounds from benign precursors. Misplaced cytosolic DNA in mammalian cells is commonly related to pathogen invasion, mitochondrial leakage and chromatin damage1. Their presence is thus closely monitored by cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), a pattern recognition receptor that binds to double-stranded DNA in a sequence-independent manner and subsequently activates the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) through the synthesis of the cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) messenger 2′,3′-cGAMP2,3,4,5. As an adaptor protein, STING scaffolds the phosphorylation of downstream effectors, including TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which induce the secretion of type-I interferons and other proinflammatory cytokines to elicit immune responses against the infected or damaged cells1,6,7. Recently, pharmacological activation of STING has emerged as a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy8,9,10. In animal models, STING agonists could induce tumour regression, promote macrophage repolarization and establish long-term protection by tumour-specific memory T cells8,9,10. Despite their antitumour effects, first-generation STING agonists based on modified CDNs have demonstrated moderate success in clinical trials, and their administration route is limited solely to intratumoural injections11,12. Efforts to discover non-CDN STING agonists suitable for systemic administration have led to several novel small molecules potentially applicable to a broader range of malignancies13,14,15. However, possible side effects of indiscriminate STING activation in both healthy and cancerous tissues remain a potential risk that limits their therapeutic index, as mutations that hyperactivate the cGAS–STING pathway are known to cause severe autoimmune diseases16,17. STING agonist overdosing could also lead to the apoptosis of T cells, which probably contributed to the failure to establish durable anticancer immunity in some studies18,19,20,21. Moreover, instead of promoting immunity against tumours, STING activation in B cells induced the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-35 that impeded the actions of NK cells and led to poorer outcomes in mouse models22. These reports suggest that strategies for minimizing off-target STING activation could be vital in further developing STING-based therapeutics. Several methods for tumour- or cell-type-specific delivery of STING agonists have been reported, including virus-like particles, HEK293-derived extracellular vesicles and antibody–STING agonist conjugates23,24,25,26. Of note, STING agonists combined with these delivery systems compared with the free drugs generally showed superior survival benefits in animal models while requiring lower doses, reinforcing the notion that non-specific activation could be the major obstacle in STING-based therapies. As an alternative to these macromolecule-based strategies, we seek to develop a small-molecule-based prodrug responsive to enzymes overexpressed in the tumour microenvironment (TME), thereby enabling a preferential activation of the STING agonist in the tumour. MSA2 is a small-molecule non-CDN STING agonist discovered by scientists at Merck15. Under physiological conditions, it forms a weakly associated (KD = 18 mM) non-covalent dimer by stacking the aromatic ring. The non-covalent dimer then binds to and activates STING (Fig. Inspired by this unique mechanism of action, we designed a two-component prodrug system for tumour-specific, on-site synthesis of a potent STING agonist (Fig. An MSA2 analogue bearing a caged nucleophile would be administered systematically and uncaged by enzymes overexpressed in the TME, leading to a preferential accumulation of the free nucleophile in the tumour. Another MSA2 analogue bearing an electrophile would be administered intratumourally, which would dimerize non-covalently with its nucleophilic counterpart and facilitate the ligation between them, forming a covalently linked, active dimer in situ. Conventional enzyme-responsive prodrugs for cancer treatment face the hurdle of inadequate tumour specificity due to expressions of the triggering enzymes in healthy tissues27,28. Moreover, individual components could be rendered benign compared with the parent MSA2 by their nucleophilic or electrophilic modifications, thus further increasing the safety profile of the two-component system. a, The unique predimerization mechanism of STING agonist MSA2 discovered by Merck. b, Our two-component prodrug strategy with enhanced tumour specificity for on-site synthesis of a potent STING agonist. Panels a and b created with BioRender.com. As the 5-methoxy groups of the monomers are facing each other in the crystal structure of MSA2-bound STING (PDB: 6UKM), their positions are a natural choice of sites for linker attachment. The ligation reactions between nucleophile N1 and electrophile E1, E2 and E4 near-quantitatively afforded the desired dimers even at a low concentration (50 µM) and under mild conditions (pH 7, 37 °C) (Fig. Because MSA2 is known to dimerize in aqueous solutions, we hypothesized that, through proximity effects, such non-covalent interactions could lead to enhanced reaction rates between the analogues compared with those between N1 and a panel of non-specific electrophiles (Fig. b, HPLC traces of the dimerization reactions. Each reacting pair (50 μM) was allowed to react for 2 h under physiological conditions (37 °C, 10 mM NaPi pH 7, 150 mM NaCl). Reactions were quenched with iodoacetamide (500 μM) to block the remaining free thiol. 1 for a detailed analysis of all identified species. c, Structures of electrophiles used as non-specific competitors. d, A colorimetric assay for rate constant measurement. e, A summary of calculated rate constants (mean ± s.d.).

Right: yields calculated by comparing the integration value of the dimer peak using a calibration curve constructed with pure standards. g, Left: non-covalent dimerization between the non-reactive E4 analogue (E4-ctrl) and N1. Right: dose-dependent 1H NMR chemical shift perturbations of E4-ctrl by N1. Conveniently, N1 exists primarily in its deprotonated form at neutral pH with strong absorption at 410 nm that diminishes after alkylation, allowing straightforward measurements of the rate constants using a published colorimetric assay29 (Fig. 2-Nitro-5-thiobenzoate (TNB2−) was used as a non-specific thiol to benchmark the intrinsic reactivities of the electrophiles. E4 and C6 demonstrated much faster alkylation rates of TNB2−, reflecting the higher reactivities expected for half-mustards. Likewise, similar alkylation rates were observed for the milder chloroacetamides, differing in most cases by no larger than twofold. While the same trend of reactivities was preserved for the alkylation of N1 by C2 to C5, clear rate enhancements were observed for the analogues E1 and particularly E2, which we believe could be attributed to the proximity effects induced by the dimerizing interactions. Among the non-specific electrophiles, C1 also showed an increased alkylation rate, albeit to a lesser extent. It remained possible that its rather hydrophobic aromatic ring could stack with the MSA2 scaffold of N1 as well and thus benefit from similar rate acceleration. Curiously, despite having the highest reactivities as indicated by TNB2−, alkylation rates of N1 by E4 or C6 were mediocre compared with the rest of the electrophiles. To further investigate the eccentric behaviour of E4, we carried out a competition assay where equimolar mixtures of E4 and C1–6 (50 μM) competed for one equivalent of N1 (50 μM) (Fig. Surprisingly, in all cases, E4 prevailed, forming the covalent dimer as the major product. Such product distributions could not be explained in terms of their apparent second-order rate constants, as even the most reactive competitor, C1, merely reduced the amount of dimer by 35%. These results hinted that even weak interactions between the reactants could profoundly impact their selectivity. To ascertain that the thiol-modified structures of N1 and E4 were still capable of engaging in the same stacking interactions of MSA2, we incubated E4-ctrl, a non-reactive analogue of E4, with increasing concentrations of N1 and observed the resulting perturbations of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts (Fig. Indeed, protons close to the thiophene moiety (b, c, d and e) experienced dose-dependent shielding by the addition of N1, while the remote protons (a and f) showed no such effects, in agreement with the proposed spatial arrangement of the stacking monomers. Overall, the model reactions of the MSA2 analogues showed that they could efficiently and selectively form the desired covalent dimer under physiologically relevant conditions, providing the basis for further developing our two-component prodrug. We next tested purified covalent dimers of the reacting analogues on THP-1 Lucia ISG cells, a commercially available human monocyte cell line engineered for monitoring the interferon pathway. While other dimers were inactive, a thioether-containing covalent compound SCS2 (Fig. 3a), formed from N1 and E4, induced the interferon pathway with an half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.71 µM; by comparison, the MSA2 parent molecule had an EC50 of 15 μM (Fig. The binding constant between SC2S and purified human wild-type STING was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to be 176 nM (Fig. Similar to the endogenous ligand 2′,3′-cGAMP, the reaction was highly endothermic, suggesting that both ligands induced substantial conformational change typical of STING activation3. Western blotting of THP-1 Lucia ISG treated with SC2S confirmed the phosphorylation of major STING pathway proteins (Fig. a, The structure of SC2S dimer formed from N1 and E4 under mild conditions. b, Left: dose–response curves of purified SC2S (red) and MSA2 (blue) on THP-1 Lucia ISG reporter cells.

All structural representations were generated using PyMOL. g, Top: workflow to test the in situ formation of SC2S on THP-1 cells. Analogues N1 and E4 were serially diluted in two separate 96-well plates and mixed to generate an 8 × 8 matrix of various concentration combinations. The crude mixtures were then seeded with THP-1 cells. IFN-β concentrations in the supernatants were then measured by ELISA. Bottom: IFN-β secretion levels of THP-1 cells treated with N1 and E4 combined at different concentrations. The response from cells treated with 25 μM of purified SC2S dimer was defined as 100%. Because thioether linkages represent a previously unexplored chemical space of MSA2, we synthesized a series of sulfur-containing dimers D1–7 with systematically varied lengths to gain further insight into their structure–activity relationship (SAR) (Fig. Three-atom linkages appeared to be optimal, with D2, D5 and D7 being the most active compounds in the THP-1 assay. Either shortening (D1) or lengthening the linker (D3) by one atom led to impaired cellular activities. Interestingly, their binding constants to purified STING ligand-binding domain (LBD) did not seem to correlate completely with their cellular EC50, a phenomenon reported previously15. Further lengthening of the linker (D4 and D6) completely abolished their activities. One-microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that thio-containing linkers with four or fewer atoms benefit from more favourable interactions (for example, CH-π with Y167) and greater numbers of hydrogen bonds (Extended Data Fig. Co-crystal structure of D5 and STING LBD (Fig. Well-preserved interactions with residues such as R232, R238 and T263 were observed (Fig. In comparison with STING bound by MSA2 (Extended Data Fig. 4, PDB: 6UKM), the covalent linkage in D5 seems to allow for slightly more intimate packing between the benzothiophene rings, thereby promoting STING closure. A prerequisite of our prodrug strategy is the efficient formation of the active dimer in more complex environments. We first conducted the dimerization reaction in the presence of excessive glutathione, an endogenous thiol that could potentially compete for E4 (Extended Data Fig. No glutathione–E4 adduct was detected, while the formation of SC2S remained largely unaffected. We next tested the dilution limit of the N1–E4 reaction that could still form effective levels of SC2S (Fig. Components N1 and E4 serially diluted in foetal bovine serum (FBS)-containing growth medium were combined at various concentrations and seeded with THP-1 cells to stimulate IFN-β secretions, the levels of which corresponded to the strengths of STING activation. Strong responses were observed even when N1 and E4 were combined at single-digit micromolar concentrations, demonstrating the robustness of the reaction. Importantly, neither N1 nor E4 alone showed any STING activation up to 64 μM, confirming that the individual components of our prodrug system were rendered benign by the introduction of the nucleophilic or electrophilic substituent. Together, these results provided in vitro evidence that N1 and E4 efficiently reacted at low micromolar concentrations and under physiological conditions to form the active SC2S dimer. β-Glucuronidase is an enzyme overexpressed in various cancers, particularly in the necrotic areas of solid tumours30,31. Its activity to cleave β-glucuronides has led to the design of numerous cancer-specific prodrugs and turn-on imaging probes32,33,34,35. Following a published procedure on synthesizing chloromethyl glycosides, we masked the free thiol of N1 with a β glucuronidase-cleavable moiety36. Upon cleavage of the glycosidic bond of the pronucleophile β-GlcA-N1, a hemithioacetal intermediate is released, which would spontaneously collapse in aqueous environments, generating in the process one molecule each of formaldehyde and N1. We hypothesized that N1 would preferentially accumulate in TMEs overexpressing β-glucuronidase, while intratumoural administration of E4 would further enhance the tumour specificity by localizing the formation of the active STING agonist. a, Cleavage of the glycosidic bond of β-GlcA-N1 (caged N1) releases a hemithioacetal, which collapses in aqueous environments and liberate the free N1. Liberated N1 could then react with E4 to form the active SC2S dimer. b, HPLC traces of reactions between β-GlcA-N1 and E4 (250 µM each) in the absence or presence of E. coli β-glucuronidase (250 Sigma units as defined by the manufacturer). 37 °C, 75 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.8, 1-h incubation. 6 for a detailed analysis of all identified species. c, Kinetics of β-GlcA-N1 cleavage mediated by human β-glucuronidase (5 μg ml−1, 67 nM). Each data point was averaged from duplicate measurements. d, Cytokine secretion assays for β-glucuronidase-specific STING activation of THP-1 Lucia ISG cells. Luciferase: reporter gene triggered by interferon pathway; E4-control: E4 substitute without the reactive chloride (see Fig. The final concentration of each compound was 25 μM. The final concentration of β-glucuronidase was 250 units ml−1. Data are represented as mean ± s.d. from three biological replicates with cells that had been split and passaged at least once. Significance was analysed by two-tailed Welch's t-test. The specificity of the β-GlcA-N1/E4 prodrug system was first confirmed by reaction assays in a phosphate buffer (Fig. In the presence of β-glucuronidase, clean and near-quantitative formation of the active SC2S agonist was observed within 2 h. By contrast, β-GlcA-N1 remained stable under the same conditions without the added enzyme, whereas most E4 underwent hydrolysis. No hemithioacetal intermediate was found in the reaction mixture, suggesting it rapidly degraded to release N1 under physiological conditions. The stability of β-GlcA-N1 was further assessed in human plasma (Extended Data Fig. The Michaelis–Menten kinetics of the glycosidic bond-cleavage reaction determined with purified human β-glucuronidase yielded Km and kcat values close to those of previously reported substrates, indicating that the hemithioacetal spacer and the N1 moiety were well accommodated by the enzyme37 (Fig. The β-GlcA-N1/E4 system was then tested on THP-1 Lucia cells (Fig. The addition of β-glucuronidase to the culture medium resulted in significantly increased secretions of cytokines downstream of the STING pathway, including interferon-β, CXCL-10 and IL-6 (test group A). Neither β-GlcA-N1 nor E4 alone activated STING (test group C), although the commercial enzyme used in our study mildly stimulated the secretion of IL-6, which we attributed to the signalling of immune pathways other than STING (test group D). These results provide evidence of the in vitro functionality of the β-GlcA-N1/E4 two-component prodrug system. We next tested the in vivo efficacy of the β-GlcA-N1/E4 prodrug system on a zebrafish xenograft model38,39. Compounds were first assessed for their maximum tolerated concentrations (MTC) on non-tumour zebrafish larvae to determine the treatment dosages (Extended Data Fig. Fluorescently labelled Hs578T cells (a triple-negative breast cancer cell line) were xenotransplanted into the perivitelline space (PVS) of 2 days postfertilization (dpf) zebrafish embryos, which after 24 h were treated with various compounds and analysed at 4 days postinjection (dpi) by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. Hs578T cells were injected into the PVS of 2 dpf zebrafish embryos. At 1 dpi, xenografts were randomly distributed into five treatment groups: DMSO, MSA2 (15 μM), SC2S (0.62 μM), β-GlcA-N1/E4 (20 μM each) and β-GlcA-N1/E4 + enzyme (20 μM each + 250 units ml−1 of β-glucuronidase) with daily renewal of the compounds. At 4 dpi (3 dpt), xenografts were fixed and analysed for apoptosis, tumour size, phagocytosis and macrophage infiltration. Macrophage polarization analysis was performed at 2 dpi (1 dpt) and 4 dpi (3 dpt) by live imaging. All compounds were administrated at concentrations below their MTCs (Extended Data Fig. mac, macrophages; enz, enzyme (β-glucuronidase). b, Treated xenografts at 4 dpi. For c and d, the results of two independent experiments were averaged and are presented as mean ± s.e.m. Each dot represents one xenograft. e, Representative confocal projection images of macrophages (red) in Hs578T xenografts in Tg(mpeg1:mcherry-F) at 4 dpi. Data were averaged from two independent experiments and are presented as mean ± s.e.m. g, Representative confocal images of Hs578T xenografts injected in Tg(mpeg1:mcherry-F, tnfa:GFP-F) at 2 and 4 dpi. h, Ratios of M1- to M2-like macrophages in the TME at 2 dpi. i, Ratios of M1-to M2-like macrophages at 4 dpi. For h and i, data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. Images are maximum intensity projections. All images are anterior to the left, posterior to right, dorsal up and ventral down. Dashed lines delineate the tumours. Those with a Gaussian distribution were analysed by parametric unpaired t-test, and those that did not pass the normality tests were analysed by non-parametric unpaired Mann–Whitney test. Treatments of xenografts with either MSA2 or purified SC2S dimer significantly induced apoptosis, as indicated by elevated levels of activated Caspase 3 (Fig. Unexpectedly, the β-GlcA-N1/E4 combination failed to induce apoptosis, although adding β-glucuronidase to the medium restored their activity. Reduction in tumour size was observed across all treatment groups that induced apoptosis, consistent with the tumour-ablating effect of previously reported STING agonists when given at high doses14,15,21 (Fig. To study the immunomodulatory effects of our prodrug system, a transgenic zebrafish line with mCherry-expressing macrophages (Tg(mpeg1:mcherry-F)) was xenotransplanted with Hs578T cells and treated with the β-GlcA-N1/E4 prodrug system or control compounds (Fig. All treatments significantly increased tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), although for β-GlcA-N1/E4 the effect was more pronounced in the presence of added β-glucuronidase. A distinguishing feature of M1-like macrophages is the expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)40,41. In addition, the macrophages showed increased phagocytic activities accompanying their M2-to-M1 repolarizations (Extended Data Fig. Together, these results suggest that, contrary to our expectations, the expression levels of β-glucuronidase in Hs578T xenografts were insufficient to trigger the β-GlcA-N1/E4 combination. A possibility was that the zebrafish xenograft lacked the necrotic areas of larger, more developed tumours, which contained much higher amounts of extracellular β-glucuronidase, as indicated by some previous studies32,33. With added β-glucuronidase, the prodrug system elicited tumour apoptosis and durable modulation of macrophages, lending further evidence for the in vivo feasibility of our prodrug system. We next evaluated the therapeutic effects of our prodrug system on an MC38 syngeneic mouse model (Extended Data Fig. Consistent with our earlier zebrafish experiments, the combination of β-GlcA-N1/E4 did not elicit an appreciable antitumour response, a result that could probably be attributed to the lack of β-glucuronidase in the TME. Indeed, β-GlcA-N1/E4 preincubated with β-glucuronidase showed tumour-attenuating effects and conferred similar survival benefits compared with the benchmark MSA2 (Extended Data Fig. None of the treatment groups induced significant body weight loss (Extended Data Fig. Secretome profiling of the sera indicated that both MSA2 and preincubated β-GlcA-N1/E4 activated highly overlapping sets of cytokines, suggesting the similarity of their mechanisms (Extended Data Fig. To demonstrate the in situ formation of the SC2S dimer in a β-glucuronidase-rich TME, we turned to a CT26 syngeneic tumour model (CT26mβGUS) where the inoculated cell line was genetically engineered to express a membrane-anchored mouse β-glucuronidase for applications in gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy42 (Fig. At comparable doses, both MSA2 and the β-GlcA-N1/E4 treatments attenuated tumour growth to similar extents, while the individual components did not show significant effects (Fig. The benign nature of either β-GlcA-N1 or E4 alone was further supported by body weight monitoring, as no significant losses were observed (Fig. The β-GlcA-N1/E4 combination conferred slightly better survival benefits compared with MSA2 (Fig. It is worth noting that the effectiveness of β-GlcA-N1/E4 was indistinguishable from the SC2S control treatment group, where a matching concentration of the purified dimer was given intratumourally, from which one could infer that the efficiency of dimer formation from the prodrug system was not the limiting factor of its efficacy. Such results may represent the inherent limitations of STING-based therapy on our tumour model. CT26 cells overexpressing the murine β-glucuronidase (CT26mβGUS) were inoculated into the right flank of BALB/c mice. Overexpression of β-glucuronidase was confirmed by western blotting (Extended Data Fig. Treatments began once the tumour volume reached about 90 mm3. n = 6 for each treatment group. Data were analysed by one-way ANOVA, followed by multiple comparisons adjusted with the Šidák–Holm correction. e, Tissue distribution of SC2S dimer formed after the β-GlcA-N1 (IP) + E4 (IT) treatment. Here, 0.1 ng g−1 indicates that [SC2S] was below the detection limit. All data points are presented as mean ± s.e.m. The tissue distribution of the active SC2S dimer resulted from the β-GlcA-N1/E4 combination (β-GlcA-N1 was given intraperitoneally (IP); E4 was given intratumourally (IT)) was analysed with mass spectrometry (Fig. For up to 4 h after the treatment, the SC2S dimer was detected at a stable level almost exclusively in the tumour. 9b) and histopathology analyses (Extended Data Fig. 10) suggested that the treatments were generally well tolerated, although modest decreases in the levels of red blood cells, haemoglobin and haematocrit were observed for the MSA2 treatment group. Overall, these results provide an in vivo proof of concept of the two-component prodrug system and show that the active dimer could indeed be preferentially formed in a β-glucuronidase-rich TME, with minimal off-target accumulation relative to MSA2. To summarize, we report a two-component prodrug system for STING activation utilizing the unique dimerization mechanism of the non-CDN STING agonist MSA2. Based on structural information of the non-covalent dimer in complex with STING, we synthesized MSA2 analogues with either an electrophile or a nucleophile that formed covalent dimers efficiently at low micromolar concentrations and under physiological conditions. One of the dimers with a thioether linkage activated THP-1 reporter cells at submicromolar concentrations. Caging the nucleophilic analogue with a self-immolative β-glucuronide moiety allowed for β-glucuronidase-specific STING agonist formation in cell-based assays and zebrafish xenograft models. Using a mouse tumour model overexpressing β-glucuronidase, we showed that separate administration of the two components resulted in near-exclusive formation of the active dimer in the tumour, thus providing an in vivo proof of concept of our prodrug system. Considering that β-glucuronidase-responsive prodrugs or imaging probes are known to be uncaged and to accumulate significantly in normal organs such as the liver, the kidney and the heart, the specificity achieved by the two-component system is remarkable32,43,44,45,46. In recent years, a plethora of strategies for ‘on-tumour' generation of therapeutics has been reported47,48. Conceptually related to our two-component prodrug, these systems likewise involve separate administration of two elements: a ‘trigger' that preferentially accumulate in tumours, and a latent effector to be rendered active by the trigger through specific bond formation or cleavage. Triggers are commonly directed to tumours through the enhanced permeability and retention effects of nanomaterial, conjugations to antibodies or ligands, or even direct surgical implantations. An assumption that has been made throughout, however, is that the trigger must be a bioorthogonal reaction, such as palladium-catalysed depropargylation, trans-cyclooctene-tetrazine cycloaddition or azide–phosphine reduction49,50,51. As an alternative to this established paradigm, we showed that even a plain nucleophilic substitution reaction could efficiently and tumour-selectively form the active compound by utilizing the non-covalent interactions between the reactants. Compared with the rate constants of most bioorthogonal reactions, which fell in the range of 10−1 to 10−3 M−1 s−1, the dimerization rates of the MSA2 analogues reported herein were at least ten- to a hundred-fold faster, showing a potential benefit of moving beyond the constraints of biorthogonality. The reaction between the constituent components of our prodrug system also brings about important structural changes in these molecules, resulting in drastically different bioactivities between the reactants and the product. As demonstrated in our cell-based assays, neither β-GlcA-N1 nor E4 appreciably activates STING, while their product is a potent agonist at submicromolar concentrations. Therefore, toxicities stemming from non-specific decaging could be rendered less detrimental, as only a relatively benign precursor rather than a fully active compound would be released. A similar concept has also been explored in a palladium-based prodrug strategy, where targeted delivery of palladium nanoparticles catalysed an in-cell Suzuki–Miyaura coupling to synthesize a cytotoxic compound from two innocuous precursors52. Indeed, at first glance, the benzo[b]thiophene core of MSA2 seems to be a rather inconspicuous moiety that is commonly used in medicinal chemistry. Yet, its stacking is strong enough to hold two monomers together with sufficient lifetime to bind to STING and, as leveraged in this work, to efficiently and specifically form a new covalent bond. It is conceivable that the discovery of more molecular scaffolds with such self-recognizing properties could open up new possibilities in prodrug design and beyond. Most chemicals and solvents were purchased from Acros, Alfa Aesar, Sigma-Aldrich, MedChemExpress, Fluorochem, Biosynth Carbosynth and Cayman Chemical. Milli-Q ultrapure water was used in all relevant experiments. Thin-layer chromatography was performed with Supelco silica gel 60 F254 plates. Flash column chromatography was performed with Millipore silica gel 60 (0.040–0.063 mm, 230–400 mesh). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a BBO smart probe or on a Bruker Avance 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with a TXO cryoprobe. High-resolution mass spectra of small molecules were recorded on a Waters LCT Premier mass analyser equipped with an Agilent 1100 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system or on a Waters Xevo G2-S bench top QTOF. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis of reaction mixtures was performed on a Waters SQD2 mass analyser coupled with a Waters H-class UPLC system (Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 reversed-phase column). Preparative HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1260 Infinity II chromatography system (ZORBAX 5 Eclipse Plus C8 21.2 × 150 mm reversed-phase column). Electrophiles C1–C5 and E1, E2 and E4 were prepared as 50 mM dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stock solutions, diluted in the reaction buffer (10 mM NaPi pH 7, 150 mM NaCl) to 500 µM, and dispensed (100 μl each well) into an ultraviolet-transparent 96-well plate (Corning 3635). Before the start of each assay, thiol N1 (or Ellman's reagent) was freshly weighed and prepared as a 50 mM DMSO stock solution. N1 was diluted in the reaction buffer containing 200 µM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) (TCEP) (400 μM for Ellman's reagent) to prepare a 200 µM working solution, which was then added (100 μl each well) to the electrophiles, resulting in the following initial condition: 250 μM of the electrophile, 100 μM of the nucleophile, 10 mM NaPi pH 7, 150 mM NaCl and 100 µM TCEP (assuming complete reduction of the Ellman's reagent). The absorbance at 410 nm (412 nm for Ellman's reagent) was monitored at 25 °C with a plate reader (Molecular Devices SpectraMax i3x). The concentration of the remaining nucleophile at each timepoint was determined by comparing the background-subtracted absorbance with a calibration curve obtained by serial dilutions of the 200 µM working solution. Rate constants were obtained by fitting the data with the standard second-order rate law (GraphPad Prism). Human β-glucuronidase (AcroBiosystems BEB-H52H3) was reconstituted in deionized water to a concentration of 1 mg ml−1. The enzyme stock solution was further diluted in assay buffer (0.2 M acetate pH 4.5) to 10 μg ml−1 (134 nM). β-GlcA-N1 (50 mM DMSO stock) was twofold serially diluted in assay buffer from 5 to 0.078 mM. The enzyme solution and diluted β-GlcA-N1 were incubated in a transparent 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C until thermo equilibrium was reached. Then, 100 µl of β-GlcA-N1 at various concentrations was mixed with 100 µl of β-glucuronidase using a multichannel pipette, resulting in the following initial condition: [β-GlcA-N1] = 2.5, 1.25, 0.62, 0.31, 0.16, 0.08 and 0.04 mM; [β-glucuronidase] = 67 nM; 5% DMSO (v/v). At 30-min and 60-min timepoints, a 50-µl portion was withdrawn from each reaction mixture and mixed with 50 µl of quenching buffer (1 M sodium carbonate, 1 mM TCEP). The concentration of liberated N1 was determined by comparing the absorbance of each quenched reaction at 410 nm to a calibration curve of purified N1. Reaction velocities were calculated from the slopes of [N1] versus time plots. The velocity versus [β-GlcA-N1] plot was then fitted with the standard Michaelis–Menten kinetic model (GraphPad Prism). Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Thermo Scientific EC0114) was transformed with a pET28a plasmid (Genscript) harbouring the codon-optimized sequence of SUMO-hSTINGwt (aa138-379). Transformed BL21 cells were inoculated into LB medium (50 µg ml−1 kanamycin) and incubated at 180 rpm, 37 °C overnight. The overnight culture was then diluted (1:100 dilution) in 2× YT medium (50 µg ml−1 kanamycin) and incubated at 180 rpm, 37 °C until optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.6 (approximately 3 h). The bacterial culture was then cooled to 16 °C, induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl 1-thio-d-galactopyranoside and incubated overnight at 180 rpm, 16 °C. The bacterial cells were pelleted at 4,000g for 30 min, resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole and 2 mM TCEP supplied with 2 tablets of cOmplete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors) and disrupted by sonication on ice. The total lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 22,000g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45-µm filter (Millipore SLHAR33SS). The clarified lysate was then incubated on a roller with 10 ml bed volume of Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Scientific 88223) at 4 °C for 1 h. The Ni-NTA resin was then packed in a column, flushed with 20 ml of wash buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole) and eluted with 40 ml of elution buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole). The eluted protein was concentrated to approximately 5 ml (Millipore Amicon 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO)) and buffer-exchanged into storage buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl). TCEP was then added to a final concentration of 2 mM, and 250 units of SUMO protease (Merck SAE0067) were added. The cleavage mixture was incubated with 10 ml bed volume of Ni-NTA resin on a roller at 4 °C for 1 h and packed in a disposable column. The flowthrough was collected, and the resin was further flushed with 20 ml of wash buffer. The eluted fractions were combined, concentrated and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Cytiva, Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL). The purified protein in storage buffer was concentrated to 330 µM (dimer concentration) as determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for future use. The binding constants of purified dimers were measured by ITC (Malvern Panalytical AutoITC200) in a reverse-titration format. Stock DMSO solutions of each dimer were dissolved in titration buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl) to a final concentration of 25 µM and added to the titration cell. The syringe was filled with 250 µM of purified STING in a matching buffer. Titration was performed at 25 °C with the following parameters: 750 rpm stirring, 0.2 µl initial injection followed by 2-µl injections of the dimer solution every 120 s. Titration of STING protein into blank buffer was separately performed and subtracted from the raw data before the analysis. The crystal structure of MSA2 in complex with STING (PDB entry: 6UKM)15 was used as initial structure for all simulations. Each complex was immersed in a water box with a 10 Å buffer of TIP3P water molecules56, and the system was neutralized by adding explicit counter ions (Na+). A two-stage geometry optimization approach was performed with the PMEMD module. In both stages, 2,500 steps of steepest descent minimization were followed by 2,500 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. The systems were then heated by incrementing the temperature from 0 to 300 K under constant pressure of 1 atm and periodic boundary conditions for 2 ns. Harmonic restraints of 10 kcal mol−1 were applied to the solute, and the Andersen temperature coupling scheme57 was used to control and equalize the temperature. The SHAKE algorithm was applied to constrain all bonds involving hydrogen atoms58. Long-range electrostatic effects were modelled using the particle-mesh-Ewald method59. A sharp cut-off of 8 Å was applied to Lennard–Jones interactions. Each system was equilibrated for 2 ns with a 2-fs time step at a constant volume and temperature of 300 K. Production trajectories were then run for an additional microsecond under the same simulation conditions. Binding free energy calculations were performed using the MM-GBSA method60. This approach combines molecular mechanics energies with solvation terms estimated using the generalized Born implicit solvent model. Representative snapshots were extracted from the equilibrated MD trajectories for postprocessing. Entropic contributions were not considered in this study. THP-1 Lucia ISG cells (InvivoGen thpl-isg) were maintained in the growth medium (RPMI 1640, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 25 mM HEPES, 10% FBS and Pen-Strep/Normocin) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were pelleted (150g, 10 min) and resuspended in the growth medium (40% conditioned) at a density of 1 × 106 cells ml−1. The cell suspension was dispensed (50 µl each well) into a lidded white 96-well plate (BrandTech 781665). Test compounds or DMSO control were diluted in the growth medium and sterilized by filtering through 0.22-µm polyethersulfone (PES) membranes (Merck SLGP033RS). Compounds serially diluted in the growth medium were then added to (50 µl each well) the cell suspension, resulting in a final density of 5 × 105 cells ml−1 with 20% conditioned medium. In all cases, the DMSO content did not exceed 0.5%. Treated cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Upon cooling down to room temperature, 50 µl of reconstituted luciferase substrate (InvivoGen QUANTI-Luc) was added to each well via the injector of the plate reader (Molecular Devices SpectraMax i3x), and the luminescence output was recorded (4 s delay, 0.1 s integration). Raw signals were divided by the averaged signal of the DMSO-treated control wells and reported in relative luminescence unit (RLU). The dose–response curve of each replicate was fitted individually using the standard 4PL model (GraphPad Prism). The EC50 value of each compound was averaged from three independent experiments and reported as mean ± s.e.m. THP-1 cells (Cell Line Service) were maintained in the growth medium (RPMI 1640, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1× non-essential amino acids, 10% FBS and Pen-Strep) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. On the day before the experiment, the cells were resuspended in fresh growth medium at a density of 5 × 105 cells ml−1, dispensed (75 µl per well) to a round-bottom 96-well plate (Sarstedt 83.3925.500), and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. DMSO stocks of Compound N1 and E4 were serially diluted in the growth medium in two separate 96-well plates (Sarstedt 83.3925.500). The contents of the two plates were mixed and incubated briefly (5 min) at 37 °C before being transferred to the cells (75 µl per well), resulting in a final density of 2.5 × 105 cells ml−1 per well. Cells treated with purified SC2S dimers (25 µM) served as the positive control. All test compounds diluted in the growth medium were sterilized by filtering through 0.22 µm PES membranes (Merck SLGP033RS). In all cases, the final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0.5% (v/v). Treated cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h and pelleted by centrifugation (120g, 10 min). The supernatants were collected and immediately analysed for interferon-β concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; PBL assay science 41435) following the manufacturer's instructions. The signal strength of cells treated with 25 µM of purified SC2S dimer was defined as 100% response. All other wells were reported as percentage activation and plotted on a heatmap (GraphPad Prism) accordingly. THP-1 Lucia ISG cells were maintained as described above. On the day of the experiment, cells were pelleted (150g, 10 min) and resuspended in the growth medium (40% conditioned) at a density of 1 × 106 cells ml−1. Compound β-GlcA-N1, E4 and E4-ctrl were prepared as DMSO stock solutions. β-Glucuronidase (Sigma-Aldrich G8295) was reconstituted in PBS (25,000 units ml−1). Various test groups (group A: 50 µM β-GlcA-N1, 50 µM E4, 500 units ml−1 β-glucuronidase; group B: 50 µM β-GlcA-N1, 50 µM E4-control, 500 units ml−1 β-glucuronidase; group C: 50 µM β-GlcA-N1, 50 µM E4-ctrl; group D: 500 units ml−1 β-glucuronidase) were prepared, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, sterile-filtered through 0.22-µm PES membranes (Merck SLGP033RS) and combined with the cell suspension at an equal volume (1 + 1 ml) on a 48-well plate (Greiner 677102). The final DMSO content of each well did not exceed 0.5%. Treated cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and pelleted by centrifugation (300g, 10 min). The supernatants were collected, aliquoted and frozen at −20 °C for future analysis. The concentrations of cytokines from three biological replicates were quantified by ELISA (CXCL-10: Bio-Techne QK266; IL-6: Bio-Techne D6050B; IFN-β: PBL assay science 41435). Data were analysed by two-tailed Welch's t-test (GraphPad Prism). THP-1 Lucia ISG cells were maintained as described above. On the day of the experiment, cells were collected by centrifugation (150g, 10 min) and resuspended in fresh growth medium at a density of 2 × 106 cells ml−1. Cells were treated with cycloheximide (50 µg ml−1) and incubated for 50 min at 37 °C. Treated cells were then combined with the growth medium containing SC2S dimer (5 µM final concentration) to 1 × 106 cells ml−1 and incubated at 37 °C. At each timepoint, a portion (3 ml) of the cell suspension was withdrawn. Withdrawn cells were pelleted (300g, 3 min), washed with PBS (1 ml), pelleted again (300g, 3 min) and resuspended to a density of 1 × 107 cells ml−1 in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) supplied with protease/phosphatase inhibitor tablets (Pierce A32961) and freshly prepared phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM). Lysates were further disrupted by sonication at low power (5 s × 3 cycles). Sonicated lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C (13,000g, 5 min). The supernatants were collected, and the total protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce 23225). Samples were reduced and denatured at 95 °C for 5 min before being separated on a precast polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris, 20 µg total protein per lane). Protein bands were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen iBlot2). The membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST pH 7.4) on a shaker at room temperature for 1 h and probed by the respective primary antibody (anti-pSTING: Cell Signaling Technology E9A9K, 1:1,000 dilution; anti-pIRF3: Cell Signaling Technology E7J8G, 1:1,000 dilution; anti-pTBK1: Cell Signaling Technology D52C2, 1:1,000 dilution; anti-β-actin: Cell Signaling Technology 13E5, 1:1,000 dilution) at 4 °C for 15 h. The membrane was washed three times with TBST and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed three times with TBST, the membrane was treated with ECL reagent (Pierce 32106) and imaged using automatic exposure (Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP). Tumour samples isolated from the mice were homogenized and lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor (Roche), phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) and 0.1% Benzonase (Sigma) on ice for 30 min. The supernatant was collected, and the total protein concentrations were determined using BCA assay (Sigma). The supernatants were separated on 12% SDS–PAGE gels (30 µg total protein per lane) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes were then blocked with 5% BSA in TBST for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with the primary antibodies (anti-GUSB: Proteintech 16332-1-AP, 1:1,000 dilution; anti-Vinculin, Cell Signaling Technology #18799, 1:1,000 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were then washed three times with TBST and incubated with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG, Abcam ab205719, 1:10,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed three times and imaged using ECL substrate (BioRad #170-5060) and Amersham 800 Imaging System (Cytiva). The zebrafish (Danio rerio) model was handled and maintained according to the standard protocols of the European Animal Welfare Legislation, Directive 2010/63/EU (European Commission, 2016) and Champalimaud Fish Platform. All protocols were approved by the Champalimaud Animal Ethical Committee and Portuguese institutional organizations—ORBEA (Órgão de Bem-Estar e Ética Animal/Animal Welfare and Ethics Body) and DGAV (Direção Geral de Alimentação e Veterinária/Directorate General for Food and Veterinary). Depending on the purpose of each experiment, different genetically modified zebrafish lines were used in this study: Tg(mpeg1:mcherry-F; tnfa:GFP-F)41, Tg(mpeg1:mcherry-F)41 and mutants casper and nacre61. TNBC cell line Hs578T was cultured and expanded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) high glucose (Biowest) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 U ml−1 of penicillin–streptomycin (Hyclone) and supplemented with insulin at 10 μg ml−1 (Sigma-Aldrich). Hs578T cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Hs578T were authenticated through short tandem repeat profile analysis and tested routinely for mycoplasma contamination. Hs578T cells were grown to 70% confluence, washed once with Dulbecco's PBS (Biowest) and detached with EDTA (1 mM) by scrapping. Cell suspension was collected to a microcentrifuge tube, mixed with lipophilic dye Deep Red Cell Tracker (1 μl ml−1 of cell suspension, 10 mM stock) (Life Technologies) for 10 min at 37 °C in darkness and washed with Dulbecco's PBS. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion method, and cell number was determined by haemocytometer counting. Fluorescently labelled Hs578T cells were injected using borosilicate glass microcapillaries under a fluorescence scope (Zeiss Axio Zoom. V16) equipped with a mechanical micropipette (World Precision Instruments, Pneumatic Pico pump PV820). Cells were injected into the PVS of 2 dpf zebrafish embryo previously anaesthetized with 1× Tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich). After the injection, zebrafish xenografts were left for 10 min in 1× Tricaine, transferred to E3 medium and kept at 34 °C. At 1 dpi, zebrafish xenografts were screened for the presence of tumoural mass. Xenografts with cells in the yolk sac or cellular debris were discarded, while the successful ones were grouped according to the sizes of their tumours using the size of their eyes as a scale. The xenografts were then exposed to E2 media containing DMSO or the test compounds. Xenografts were checked daily; dead ones were removed, and the E2 medium with DMSO or compounds was refreshed. Four days later, the zebrafish xenografts were euthanized, fixed overnight with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde (Thermo Scientific) at 4 °C and preserved at −20 °C in pure methanol. For transgenic zebrafish line Tg(mpeg1:mcherry-F; tnfa:GFP-F), fixation was performed with PIPES for optimal fluorescence signal preservation. At 2 dpi (1 dpt), controls and treated Tg(mpeg1:mcherry-F; tnfa:GFP-F) xenografts were carefully selected under a fluorescent scope to ensure that only the double-positive transgenics were imaged. Selected xenografts were anaesthetized and mounted onto a coverslip with 0.8% low-melting agarose with 1× Tricaine in E2 medium. The mounted xenografts were imaged using a LSM 980 Upright confocal laser scanning microscope, with a 25× water objective lens. Then, z-stack images of the tumours were obtained within a 3-µm interval. At 3 dpt, the same xenografts were imaged once again. Image analysis was performed using FIJI software (ImageJ 2.14). Fixed zebrafish xenograft images were acquired using a LSM 980 Upright confocal laser scanning microscope, with a 5-μm interval. Generated images were processed using the FIJI/ImageJ software. The number of cells was quantified using the Cell Counter plugin in ImageJ software. To assess tumour size, three representative slices of the tumour, from the top (Zfirst), middle (Zmiddle) and bottom (Zlast), per z stack per xenograft were analysed, and a proxy of total cell number of the entire tumour (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclei) was estimated as follows: tumour size = (total number of slices/1.5) × (Zfirst + Zmiddle + Zlast)/3. The correction factor of 1.5 was estimated based on human cells with nuclei averaging 10–12 μm in diameter. The number of activated caspase-3-positive cells, macrophages, M1 and M2-like TNF-positive macrophages were counted in every slide along the tumour. The transgenic xenografts negative for TNF were used to quantify TAMs and phagocytosis. To get the percentage of each population of M1 and M2-like, the obtained number was divided by its corresponding tumour size. Xenografts were then permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) Triton in PBS and blocked in a mixture of 1× PBS, BSA, DMSO, Triton 1% (w/v) and goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. The xenografts were then probed with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-cleaved Caspase-3, Cell Signaling Technologies, 1:100 dilution; rabbit anti-mCherry, Abcam, 1:100 dilution; mouse anti-GFP, Roche, 1:100 dilution) overnight and incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa goat anti-rabbit 594, Thermo Scientific, 1:400 dilution; Alexa goat anti-mouse 488, Thermo Scientific, 1:400 dilution) and DAPI (50 μg ml−1) at 4 °C overnight. The xenografts were washed, fixed and mounted between two coverslips, allowing for double side acquisition using Mowiol mounting media (Sigma). Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism 9.0 software. In general, datasets with a Gaussian distribution were analysed by parametric unpaired t-test, and datasets that did not pass the normality tests were analysed by nonparametric unpaired Mann–Whitney test. Clearance datasets were analysed using Fisher's exact test. All tests were two-sided with a confidence interval of 95%. Mouse colon adenocarcinoma MC38 cells were purchased from Kerafast (ENH204-FP). The cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, Thermo Scientific #21969035), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, Thermo Scientific), 1× GlutaMAX (Gibco, Thermo Scientific) and 1× penicillin–streptomycin solution (Gibco, Thermo Scientific). Murine colon adenocarcinoma cell line CT26-overexpressing mouse β-glucuronidase enzyme (CT26mβGUS) was a gift from Dr Steve R. Roffler from the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Thermo Scientific) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, Thermo Scientific), 1× GlutaMAX (Gibco, Thermo Scientific) and 1× penicillin–streptomycin solution (Gibco, Thermo Scientific). Both cell lines were cultured at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. All animal experiments were conducted at the Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine (GIMM, Lisbon). Animal work was performed with strict adherence to the Portuguese Law (Portaria 1005/92) and the European Guideline 86/609/EEC. The Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations guidelines and recommendations concerning laboratory animal welfare were followed. All animal experiments were approved by the Portuguese official veterinary department for welfare licensing – Direção Geral de Alimentação e Veterinária (DGAV) and the IMM Animal Ethics Committee (authorization AWB_2021_03_GB_TargCancerDrugs). Eight-week-old male and female C57BL/6J or BALB/c mice (purchased from Charles River) were subcutaneously inoculated in the right flank with 100 μl of 1 × 106 MC38 cells or 5 × 106 CT26mβGUS, respectively, in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Gibco) with Matrigel (Corning). Tumour growth was monitored over time by performing daily bilateral vernier caliper measurements. Tumour volumes were estimated with the formula: (length × width2)/2. Treatments were initiated when tumours reached 90–100 mm3. Treatments were administered intratumourally (or intraperitoneally for component β-GlcA-N1). Animals were observed every 1–2 days and euthanized when either the tumour volume reached ~1,000 mm3, the body weight loss exceeded 20% or ulceration started to appear. For immune characterizations, inflammatory cells were isolated from the tumours, spleens and inguinal lymph nodes 24 h after the second treatment. Collected data were analysed with GraphPad Prism 9. This study used Luminex xMAP technology for multiplexed quantification of 44 mouse cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. The multiplexing analysis was performed using the Luminex 200 system (Luminex) by Eve Technologies Corp. Forty-five markers were simultaneously measured in the samples using Eve Technologies' Mouse Cytokine 44-Plex Discovery Assay, which consists of two separate kits, one 32-plex and one 12-plex (MilliporeSigma), following the manufacturer's protocol. The 32-plex consisted of eotaxin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12(p40), IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IP-10, KC, LIF, LIX, MCP-1, M-CSF, MIG, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MIP-2, RANTES, TNF and VEGF. The 12-plex consisted of 6Ckine/Exodus2, erythropoietin, fractalkine, IFNβ-1, IL-11, IL-16, IL-20, MCP-5, MDC, MIP-3α, MIP-3β and TARC. Assay sensitivities of these markers range from 0.3 to 30.6 pg ml−1 for the 45-plex. The sensitivities of individual analytes are available in the MilliporeSigma MILLIPLEX MAP protocol. Tumour-bearing mice treated with β-GlcA-N1(IP) + E4 (IT) were euthanized at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 72 h posttreatment (n = 3 for each timepoint). The blood, tumour, lung, kidney, liver and spleen were collected for each mouse. Three mice treated with vehicle were included as control samples. Whole blood samples were centrifuged at 2,000g, 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatant plasma was aspirated into an Eppendorf tube and frozen at −80 °C. Tumour and organ tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. The plasma samples (10-µl aliquots) were prepared by protein precipitation extraction. The organic layer was evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in a solution equivalent to the initial chromatographic starting conditions. The tissue samples were analysed by homogenization to give a 200 ng ml−1 homogenate concentration. All samples were analysed using the PKB Core Facility's 6500 LC–MS/MS system, in negative ion mode. The chromatography was carried out using a gradient method on a Kinetex EVO C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm). Calibration curves were constructed using linear regression with a 1/x2 weighting. Precision and accuracy were well within the PK/B core facility's acceptance criteria of ±20%. The performance of the method met normal Core Facility acceptance criteria for analysis. The 8xHis-tagged R232-STING138–379 construct was expressed using vector pEXP-MBP (Addgene 112568). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, harbouring the recombinant plasmid, were cultivated in 2xYT medium (supplemented with 0.1 mg ml−1 ampicillin) at 37 °C until OD600 reached ~0.8 and then cooled to 18 °C for 30 min. Isopropyl 1-thio-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.4 mM, and growth continued at 18 °C for 16 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (30 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl,10 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol and 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were purified using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) and eluted stepwise in binding buffer with 300 mM imidazole. Removal of histidine tag was performed at 4 °C overnight using recombinant TEV protease (at 1:20 molar ratio) while dialysing (SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing, 10 kDa cut-off weight, Thermo Fisher Scientific) against gel filtration buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP and 5% glycerol). Proteins were further purified by reverse affinity in Ni-NTA followed by gel filtration (Superdex 200 16/60, GE Healthcare). Protein in gel filtration buffer was concentrated to 6.7 mg ml−1 using 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrators (Millipore) at 5 °C. Compounds in 100% DMSO were added to protein (247 µM final solution) at 2.2 mM final concentration (~2.2% DMSO) and incubated on ice for approximately 1 h. This mixture was centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min at 5 °C before setting up 200-nl sitting drops with protein–inhibitor complex and reservoir solution at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2. Crystallization experiments were performed at 20 °C. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Diffraction data were collected at the Diamond Light Source at the I04 beamline. Diffraction data were integrated using XDS (within autoPROC)62 and scaled using AIMLESS from the CCP4 software suite63. Molecular replacement and initial refinement were performed using Dimple (PDB ID 4KSY was used as the molecular replacement search model for phasing). The final model and structure factors were deposited in the PDB (PDB ID: 9QVT). Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article. The co-crystal structure of compound D5 and STING LBD has been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with the accession code 9QVT.

(2025)Cite this article Both metabolic surgery and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) improve cardiometabolic outcomes, but their long-term outcomes have not been directly compared. Here, we compared macrovascular and microvascular outcomes in 1,657 patients (65.7% female) with type 2 diabetes and obesity who underwent metabolic surgery with 2,275 similar patients (53.5% female) who received treatment with GLP-1 RAs. Using a doubly robust estimation method to balance baseline characteristics between groups, we examined the time to all-cause mortality, incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), nephropathy and retinopathy over a median follow-up of 5.9 years. The 10-year cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was 9.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.8–10.8%) in the metabolic surgery group and 12.4% (95% CI 9.9–15.2%) in the GLP-1 RA group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.68 (95% CI 0.48–0.96), P = 0.028). Compared with the GLP-1 RA group, metabolic surgery was also associated with a lower risk of MACE (adjusted HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.51–0.82; P < 0.001), nephropathy (adjusted HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.43–0.67; P < 0.001) and retinopathy (adjusted HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.29–0.75; P = 0.002). These findings indicate that even with the availability of GLP-1 RAs, metabolic surgery remains superior to medical treatment. Future studies should compare the cardiometabolic outcomes of metabolic surgery with newer GLP-1 RAs that are more effective for weight reduction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Fossils Could Help Solve Long-standing Mystery of Bird Migration A breeding pair of ornithurine birds and their hatchlings survey the coastal floodplain. 73 million years ago in what is now northern Alaska. But now, with daylight waning, the terns need to head south. In an instant, the usually noisy birds will fall silent, a behavior known as “dread.” Moments later the entire colony will take to the skies to begin its 25,000-mile journey to Antarctica—the longest known migration of any animal on Earth. Even under ideal conditions, such an epic journey requires huge amounts of energy and exposes the travelers to dangerous weather. The endless summer sun supports lush plant growth, flourishing insect swarms, and plentiful fish populations nourished by zooplankton blooms. With 24 hours of light a day, the birds can more easily catch food such as slippery fish and tiny insects. The round-the-clock daylight also means many of the animals that prey on birds are less likely to sneak up on a nest unnoticed.

Scientists have long wondered when birds began making these extraordinary journeys. They typically have various anatomical and behavioral adaptations to long-distance travel. The Arctic Tern, for example, is a marvel of efficiency. Its skeleton is lightweight and partially filled with air, allowing it to glide for long distances without expending any energy to flap its wings. And, like many migratory birds, it can sleep while gliding. The precise methods by which birds find their way remain mysterious, but biologists generally agree that they use some combination of visual landmarks; the position of the sun, moon and stars; Earth's magnetic field; and scent-based clues. A degree of learning also seems to be involved—in many species, first-time migrants appear to simply fly in the correct general direction, whereas experienced birds may use landmarks to take a more efficient route. Scientists have rediscovered dozens of three-dimensionally preserved teeth and bones from hatchling birds, including this tip of a beak, from the Arctic Circle in Alaska, showing that birds were reproducing at polar latitude by 73 million years ago. They also help to manage insect and rodent populations and, by extension, help to control the spread of disease. In fact, birds are so critical to the success of their habitats that they are hypothesized to have played a key role in structuring remote ecosystems over deep time. Birds carry small organisms, such as plants and insects, over long distances to colonize remote polar regions. Were it not for the evolution of migratory birds, today's tundra would be much more barren. Unfortunately, the polar fossil record is sparse, and most of the fossil-bearing sediments there are covered in ice or water. In spots where these sediments are exposed, fieldwork is often challenging, dangerous and expensive. Furthermore, bird bones are some of the rarest fossils in the world because they are small and fragile, making them less likely to survive long enough to fossilize, let alone to be discovered by paleontologists. In the rare cases when we do manage to find a fossil bird in the Arctic, it can be difficult to determine whether that bird was a visiting migrant or a permanent resident. Let's say we find exactly the same species, in rocks from exactly the same time period, at both temperate and polar latitudes. Even then, we can't say the extinct species migrated. There's always the possibility that it merely inhabited a broad area year-round. The vast majority of living birds that inhabit polar regions migrate to lower latitudes after the breeding season ends. So, if we find fossil evidence of birds not just present but breeding at polar latitudes, we are headed in the right direction. This is where our work on fossils from a Late Cretaceous body of rock in northern Alaska called the Prince Creek Formation comes in. Although fossil fieldwork is never as simple as removing loose sediment with a paintbrush (sorry, Steven Spielberg), Arctic fieldwork is in a league of its own. The summer isn't a walk in the park, either: giant mosquitoes are out in force, it's almost always rainy and cold, and there is So. Moreover, large mammals are out and about, making potentially dangerous wildlife encounters a concern. The sun had already been up for hours. About 20 yards away, right near one of her crewmates' tents, was a giant, fuzzy brown blob. She tried frantically to remember her bear training: Should she call out and try to wake everyone else up? Try to scare it out of the camp? Only after putting herself through this roller coaster of emotions did she finally realize that the “bear” had a large set of horns on its head. Thankfully, the camp visitor was just a musk ox. Brittany Cheung (feature icons) and Rebecca Gelernter (bird illustrations) One may wonder why we bother with such extreme fieldwork. Wilson has often found herself wondering the same thing while working in –30-degree-F weather. The Prince Creek Formation is located at a modern-day latitude of 70 degrees north and preserves fossils of animals that lived an estimated 72.8 million years ago. Plate tectonic activity has shifted Alaska south since that time. During the Late Cretaceous, these species would have been living at an even higher paleolatitude of 80 to 85 degrees north, practically at the North Pole. Summers would have brought plentiful light and warmth, but year-round occupants of the ecosystem had to endure winters with freezing temperatures, snowfall and about four months of continuous darkness. Their team's discovery of baby dinosaur fossils helped to demonstrate that dinosaurs were year-round inhabitants of the ecosystem because the baby dinosaurs would have been too young to migrate before the onset of winter. More recently, smaller bones found alongside the dinosaur fossils have led to another exciting discovery: the oldest evidence of polar bird reproduction. To date, we have identified more than 50 three-dimensionally preserved bird bones, along with dozens of teeth, from the site. The fossils are so tiny that they could all fit together in a single jam jar. Together these fossils demonstrate that birds have been nesting in the Arctic for at least 73 million years, nearly half the time they have existed on Earth. Picture the Arctic in early summer 73 million years ago. The coastal floodplain that was desolate throughout the long winter is now lush with plant life and buzzing with insects. It's the perfect setting for a newly hatched chick to grow up in. He is still covered in downy feathers and scrambles about on skinny legs, not yet ready to take flight. Unlike many other Late Cretaceous birds, he and his relatives have a toothless beak that serves as a precise tool for picking off creeping insects under their watchful eyes. The coastal floodplain offers premium real estate for nesting. Dinosaurs of all kinds are preparing for the arrival of their young, and last year's young are still recovering from their first Arctic winter. The ornithurine chick and his family aren't the only types of birds here to call this landscape home. And they're all here for the same reason birds still nest in the Arctic today: lots and lots of sunshine. We can get at this question from a few angles, however. Let's start by considering whether these birds had the ability to make such a journey in the first place. We know that any birds from the preceding Jurassic period are unlikely to have flown very far. Such early birds had not yet evolved many of the features that help modern birds fly skillfully and efficiently. For example, the iconic Archaeopteryx was capable of flight, but it appears to have had relatively low endurance and couldn't perform complex maneuvers. The keeled sternum, or breastbone, that anchors the pectoral muscles in modern birds was either absent or at most a flat cartilaginous plate in Archaeopteryx. Clawed fingers interrupted the leading edge of its wing, and compared with birds of today, its feathers appear to have been less flexible and thus less adept at forming a coherent airfoil. Even its tail seems like an archaic reminder of Archaeopteryx's grounded ancestry. Researchers excavate a fossil site along the Colville River in northern Alaska. Over time birds evolved a panoply of skeletal and soft-tissue features that improved their flight capabilities. The first finger also anchors an alula, a cluster of small feathers that acts as a mini airfoil, helping in fine maneuvers. A closer look at where these birds fit in the avian family tree provides more clues to how they came to reproduce in the far north. Ornithurines, which include modern birds and their close relatives, were rarer in Cretaceous ecosystems. Like enantiornithines, most Cretaceous ornithurines still had teeth. But advanced members of the group differed from enantiornithines in having fewer teeth; no gastralia, or belly ribs; and separated pubis bones, which allowed them to lay larger eggs. Intriguingly, the Prince Creek bird fossils all come from ornithurine birds. We have identified bones and teeth of three types so far: ternlike ichthyornithines; hesperornithines, which used their feet to propel themselves through water; and some nearly modern close relatives of living birds. Notably absent from our assemblage are any enantiornithines. If all Ornithothoraces were capable of long-distance flight, why are the otherwise ubiquitous enantiornithines missing from Alaska? We suspect one answer lies in the egg. Anyone who regularly cooks eggs has probably noticed a little white blob, which for many people spoils the otherwise appetizing appearance of the yolk. Reptiles, which lack chalazae, do not practice egg rotation. In fact, rotating a crocodile egg can disrupt development of and kill the embryo. So far paleontologists haven't found any fossil chalazae that might allow them to trace the origin of this structure. But we have a hunch that it evolved in ornithurines because crocodilians, nonavian dinosaurs and enantiornithines all buried their eggs at least partially in the ground. Fossil clutches of enantiornithines demonstrate that they placed their eggs vertically in sediment or soil, leaving only the tops exposed. At best, brooding enantiornithines would have been able to make only partial contact with their eggs, resulting in poorer heat transfer and slower development of the embryo. In fact, some paleontologists speculate that they could not incubate via body contact at all, because the eggs were too small to support that parent's weight. Most modern birds that breed in northern Alaska nest from late May through June. For birds that can nest in vegetation, this is a lovely time of year. Yet even at the start of June, snow may still persist in patches, and the soil may remain chilly or even frozen. Temperatures were warmer in the Cretaceous, but the Arctic winter was still dark and cold, and spring would have taken longer to arrive than at more southern latitudes. Why not just wait until later in the summer to nest? There may simply not have been enough time. Because enantiornithines could not provide full-contact incubation, their eggs probably took substantially longer to hatch than those of birds that can sit on their eggs in nests built in vegetation. The inexorable march of the seasons would have left almost no time for fledging for birds that hatched in late summer. The Arctic Tern migrates tens of thousands of miles every year between its breeding grounds in the Arctic and its wintering grounds in Antarctica. In fact, there is some evidence they could fly within a day of hatching. But another aspect of enantiornithine biology might have thrown up a roadblock to Arctic breeding. Recently discovered fossils preserved in amber reveal that enantiornithines molted their body feathers all at once. Yet it would have been a big liability in colder climates. If an early cold snap occurred during a molting interval, being caught half naked could have been deadly to small-bodied birds that had to generate their own body heat, as opposed to obtaining it from external sources such as the sun. By eliminating the possibility of nesting in the summer and overwintering, this molting pattern might have served as a barrier to those birds inhabiting Arctic environments year-round. Our work on the Prince Creek birds is not over yet. We currently have only circumstantial evidence that they were migrating to the Arctic to breed rather than living there year-round. But we may be able to build our case with a technique called stable isotope analysis, which lets us use comparisons of the ratios of different forms, or isotopes, of the same element in an animal's teeth or bones to infer its diet, reconstruct its environmental conditions, and even trace its movements over its lifetime. We know that dinosaurs were overwintering in the Arctic because their young would not have been ready to migrate anywhere the first winter after hatching. Many biological factors, such as diet and metabolism, influence isotopic compositions, though. If he strays too far, he risks becoming dinner for one of the many dromaeosaurs who are also trying to provide for their young. If he can make it a few months, perhaps he will fly south with his kin to somewhere sunny for the winter. But in the remarkable adaptations and behaviors of birds lies hope for survival. Her fieldwork has taken her to the badlands of Montana and the polar wilderness of Alaska's Northern Slope, among other locales. Daniel T.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While our understanding of Alzheimer's disease is far from complete, the latest therapies, and others in more than 100 clinical trials, offer new hope This article is part of “Innovations In: Alzheimer's Disease” an editorially independent special report that was produced with financial support from Eisai. Alzheimer's disease has proved to be a tricky target, and researchers and drug developers have been pursuing effective treatments for decades. Debates rage over the disorder's underlying causes, and various approaches have faced one hurdle after another. Despite the advances, however, there is still a long list of open questions and so much work to be done. The brains of people who die with Alzheimer's show a distinct biology: clumps or “plaques” of amyloid beta proteins in spaces between neurons and tangles of tau proteins that accumulate primarily within the nerve cells. One prevailing theory holds that amyloid builds up early, and tau tangles develop when nerve cell damage is underway but cognitive symptoms are not yet apparent. Over time these pathogenic, or disease-causing, proteins disrupt nerve cell communication. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

With Alzheimer's there is often a 20- to 30-year lag between the initial detection of amyloid and obvious cognitive decline. According to one study that predicted disease risk based on demographic data, death rates and amyloid status, fewer than one quarter of cognitively healthy 75-year-old women who test positive for amyloid in a spinal fluid analysis or positron-emission tomography (PET) brain scan will develop Alzheimer's dementia during their lifetime. Such findings suggest that amyloid alone is not driving disease progression and have spurred scientists to investigate other strategies. DNA-sequencing analyses have identified gene variants that influence Alzheimer's risk. Other research indicates that one way to reduce disease risk is through lifestyle changes. According to a 2024 report, nearly half of dementia cases worldwide could be prevented or delayed by actions addressing 14 modifiable risk factors, including hearing loss, physical inactivity, and vascular risk factors such as diabetes and smoking (many of which also impact immune activity and inflammation). A well-known hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the buildup of tau (a) and amyloid beta (b) proteins in the brain. Recent evidence suggests that inflammation, immune processes and vascular risk factors also play a key role in the disease. There are more than 100 ongoing clinical trials testing a variety of interventions, each of which targets one or more potential contributors to dementia. “We will get there in stages,” says Sudha Seshadri, a neurologist and founding director of the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio in Texas. Immune-modulating drugs are probably going to be a piece of it,” she says. It will also be important to control for vascular risk, she adds, which “is important regardless of what else is happening.” The mechanisms listed here are considered key elements of Alzheimer's risk: Some drugs for Alzheimer's block harmful activity at these receptors, and others boost activity by preventing the breakdown of neurotransmitters. Amyloid • A protein that, when misfolded, can build up outside of nerve cells in the brain and form plaques that disrupt neural function. It can build up within neurons and form tangles, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's, along with amyloid plaques. Some new therapies attempt to target pathological forms of tau, preventing these proteins' aggregation and enhancing their clearance. Both processes can be disrupted in people with Alzheimer's. Breakdown of this barrier has been associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's. Some therapies aim to replenish them and provide an extra layer of protection. Epigenetic regulators • Proteins and other molecules that turn a gene on or off without changing the underlying DNA sequence. Damaged nerve cells can contribute to memory impairment and cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer's. Promoting the growth of new nerve cells could help slow that decline. Oxidative stress • An unhealthy overabundance of free radicals relative to antioxidants in the body, which can harm nerve cells and disrupt their function. Some therapies aim to relieve oxidative damage by enhancing the activity of specific enzymes that neutralize free radicals. Proteostasis • A process that maintains proper protein folding, synthesis and degradation in cells and can become impaired in people with Alzheimer's. APOE • Abbreviation for apolipoprotein E, a protein-encoding gene that has three major forms: ε2, ε3 and ε4. APOE ε4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's. Having one APOE ε4 allele can increase someone's lifetime risk of disease up to fourfold over that of people with two copies of the most common variant, APOE ε3; two APOE ε4 alleles can raise the risk up to 25-fold. This chart includes 138 drugs across 182 clinical trials—pharmacological Alzheimer's trials registered with clinicaltrials.gov as of January 2025. Though not comprehensive (for example, not all trials based outside of the U.S. are included), the dataset provides a useful big-picture view. [Editor's Note: Trials focused on exercise, lifestyle or caregiver interventions, cognitive behavioral therapies, supplements, medical foods or stem cell therapies are also not included.] Trials are grouped according to shared mechanism of action on the left (treatment targets) and therapeutic goals on the right. Neurotransmitter receptors, amyloid and inflammation are currently the most often targeted mechanisms. The most popular therapeutic category is disease-targeting drugs—in which the goal is to slow clinical decline by focusing on molecules and body systems. Jen Christiansen Source: “Alzheimer's Disease Drug Development Pipeline: 2025,” by Jeffrey L. Cummings et al., in Alzheimer's & Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions, Vol. While drugs that target the proteins amyloid and tau have garnered heavy attention and funding, other therapeutic approaches have focused on other biological mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation • Keeping nerve cells healthy and protecting them from damage requires balance between soluble and membrane-bound forms of a protein called TNF-α. In conditions of immune dysfunction, a rise in soluble TNF-α disrupts the healthy balance, or homeostasis, and drives up inflammation. One company (INmune Bio) is developing a drug that binds and deactivates soluble TNF-α, restoring health-promoting effects of the transmembrane form. A clinical trial led by Suzanne Craft of the Wake Forest University School of Medicine is testing intranasal delivery of insulin and the diabetes drug empagliflozin in people with early Alzheimer's or mild cognitive impairment. Vasculature • Several companies are developing new versions of amyloid antibodies that can penetrate the brain more effectively—for instance, Roche's trontinemab. At least one company, Neuvasq, is developing an earlier-stage intervention that targets the vasculature itself, to test whether a less leaky blood-brain barrier could slow disease progression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Early studies suggest that lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise and social engagement may help slow or prevent Alzheimer's symptoms—but the evidence is inconsistent, and many doctors remain cautious This article is part of “Innovations In: Alzheimer's Disease” an editorially independent special report that was produced with financial support from Eisai. When Juli comes home after work, her husband doesn't regale her with stories about his photography business the way he once did. When they go out to a favorite Mexican restaurant, he might opt for a side salad instead of tortilla chips with his quesadilla. “He's actually consuming green food, which is new,” says Juli, who asked to be identified by only her first name to protect her husband's privacy. Over the past year Juli's husband has agreed to change his daily habits in hopes of halting the steady progression of Alzheimer's disease, which he was diagnosed with in December 2023 at age 62. Juli and her husband are both self-employed, and their insurance plans didn't cover the positron-emission tomography scans for disease tracking that a neurologist prescribed, which would have cost thousands of dollars. He recommended a keto diet, along with light cardio exercise and strength training. He also prescribed a bevy of supplements, such as creatine, which Juli's husband takes alongside the memantine and donepezil prescribed by his neurologist. Juli doesn't expect the diet and daily walks to cure her husband, but she hopes the healthy lifestyle will help manage and even improve his condition.

Increasingly, evidence suggests that addressing health problems such as vision and hearing loss, stress, poor diet, diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol and high blood pressure can help slow or even prevent Alzheimer's symptoms. For families like Juli's that have been left with a grim diagnosis and few options, lifestyle changes bring a much needed sense of hope and agency. But researchers worry about overpromising on the efficacy of these changes, especially for people already experiencing dementia symptoms. It's a promising but nascent field of research, one that scientists worry gives patients dangerous and heartbreaking hope for a cure that doesn't exist. She worries about expensive but unproven regimens that promise to reverse cognitive decline, restore and protect the brain, or significantly improve cognition for people with early-stage Alzheimer's or other dementias. “Of course, people want to have hope,” she says. But she cautions against making promises that can't be upheld. Kivipelto led the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), a trial that enrolled more than 1,200 residents of Finland between the ages of 60 and 77. They showed that after two years, participants who were given nutritional advice, exercise regimens and brain-training games had improved their executive function, processing speeds and complex memory by about 83, 150 and 40 percent, respectively, compared with those who didn't take those measures. Now Kivipelto is running World Wide FINGERS, a global network of studies investigating the same interventions in different countries and populations. Similarly encouraging data have come from the Systematic Multi-Domain Alzheimer Risk Reduction Trial (SMARRT), a two-year randomized, controlled study. Researchers tested the effect of treating modifiable risk factors such as uncontrolled hypertension, social isolation and physical inactivity with more than 170 septuagenarians and octogenarians at high risk for dementia. Participants chose a few interventions to prioritize out of eight options, such as improved physical fitness or social connection. After two years, no matter which intervention people opted for, those who received individualized treatments had reduced risk factors for dementia and a 74 percent greater increase in cognition compared with their counterparts in the control group. At a certain point, prevention and treatment become almost the same thing: if people can postpone the onset of symptoms until they're 85 or 90 years old, Kivipelto says, “they might die of something else.” A report from a commission on dementia from the Lancet Group—which comprises experts who make recommendations on health policy and practice—suggests that addressing a range of these lifestyle-based risk factors could help reduce the global incidence of Alzheimer's and dementia by 45 percent population-wide. For people with a genetic predisposition to dementia, introducing diet, exercise, and other modifications before symptoms appear might be particularly important for fending off illness. The idea that diet and exercise could curb a disease that currently affects more than 55 million people globally is an exciting prospect. But scientists say the field is simply too young for anyone to make bold assertions that lifestyle interventions could act as treatments or cures. “We don't have mature information,” says Howard Feldman, a neurologist at the University of California, San Diego. One big caveat is that studies such as SMARRT and FINGER were conducted with people who had mild cognitive decline, not full-blown dementia. “There's very little evidence that these [interventions] work when people have the disease.” Also, the list of possible risk factors gets longer as more data emerge. When Kivipelto started FINGER, she didn't look at elements such as poor sleep and stress. But more evidence suggests that these factors could increase risk for Alzheimer's. Meanwhile interventions that had shown initial promise, such as the MIND diet—a diet geared toward brain health that combines elements of Mediterranean and hypertension-focused diets—weren't backed by further research. Answering questions about lifestyle changes—what works, what doesn't and why—is particularly challenging because these interventions are not as easy to quantify as medications are. Instead exercise might lead to better blood flow in the brain. It could affect insulin levels or increase oxygen flow. All these factors have been linked to the development of Alzheimer's in some way. When researchers test pills, they can easily dispense medication and count how many pills are left at the end of a trial. It's much harder to know whether someone in a lifestyle study has done the assigned exercises or whether all participants worked out at the same intensity. Another big unknown is when these interventions should begin. Some research suggests that to reduce risk factors, middle age might be the most impactful time. Stress and sleep might be bigger risk factors in middle age, whereas social isolation might become more important as people grow older. Perhaps the biggest limitation, however, is that scientists can't measure all the biological and environmental systems at play, nor can they follow enough people for a long enough period to understand which systems are most important. One theory suggests that health interventions—such as diet, exercise and social stimulation—work because they boost cognitive reserve, or the ability of a person's brain to resist dementia. People with more cognitive reserve might not show symptoms even if they have the same pathology as someone else who is symptomatic. Researchers think being active, eating right and socializing might help build up that cognitive-reserve buffer. Even while scientists work on more high-quality studies of lifestyle changes for Alzheimer's—with large, diverse patient populations, control groups, and careful measurements for the intensity of the intervention—numerous commercial companies claim to offer scientifically backed cures. These products, including the approach Juli and her husband are trying, are often based on research in predatory journals, which charge authors high fees to publish papers that look scientific but have none of the oversight of peer-reviewed publications. No large, high-quality clinical trials have shown that supplements can improve human cognition or brain health, but companies selling these products now represent an industry valued at more than $6 billion globally. Some people spend their life savings to follow a protocol that requires them to remediate mold in their homes, even though the evidence linking mold and dementia is debated. Neurologist Joanna Hellmuth, then at the University of California, San Francisco, wrote an article in 2020 in the Lancet Neurology about pseudoscience and dementia, warning that fraudulent solutions can be financially and emotionally harmful for families. “Hope is important in the face of incurable diseases and intuitive interventions can be compelling,” she wrote. “However, unsupported interventions are not medically, ethically, or financially benign, particularly when other parties might stand to gain.” Even under the best of circumstances, changes to diet and exercise cannot ward off Alzheimer's for everyone. Yaffe has seen patients who play bridge, go running and practice über-healthy lifestyles only to be astonished to learn they also have Alzheimer's. Scientists measure the impact of lifestyle modifications in population-wide estimates that don't translate to individual risk. Diet, exercise, hearing aids, and other interventions might reduce the global incidence of dementia by 45 percent, but that doesn't mean they will reduce your specific risk by the same amount. Yaffe estimates that roughly half of a person's Alzheimer's risk is based on genetics, and half probably depends on their activity level, diet and luck. Even as Juli is gently prodding her husband to eat more broccoli, she's also preparing for his inevitable decline. Her husband will trade in his car for a golf cart, and Juli will work almost entirely from home to make sure he stays safe. There's no control group, no way to assess how her husband's disease might have progressed if they'd stuck to only medications. Right now they can afford the supplements ($150 per month), extra visits to doctors ($900 per hour twice a year), blood draws ($500 every six months), and memberships to their doctor's practice and to a platform that promotes the protocol they are following ($3,000 per year). Their daily regimen gives him a sense of agency, which has alleviated some of the anxiety and depression that plagued him after his diagnosis.

Scientific Reports volume 15, Article number: 32096 (2025) Cite this article Nature-based solutions (NbS) can mitigate the climate crisis and provide co-benefits to biodiversity and human well-being. We identified opportunities for NbS in the US by mapping both critical habitat for birds under a changing climate and carbon stocks and sinks. We then investigated the alignment of these locations with areas important for human well-being and land-dependencies. Finally, we identified High Priority NbS areas that align with irrecoverable carbon to focus conservation efforts on places with significant long-term carbon storage potential. Although ~ 30% of US lands have some protection, < 3% of protected US lands align with priorities for birds, carbon, and human well-being. Of the 312 million acres of priority areas for birds, carbon, and human well-being identified, 71% lack legal protection or formal conservation plans (14% of US lands). Targeting such areas for NbS conservation and restoration would help achieve equitable climate benefits by guiding conservation investments to marginalized communities, while also ensuring maintenance of lands that are critical for biodiversity tracking a changing climate. At least 80% of all birds, carbon, and human well-being priorities co-occur with local communities who have cultural and socioeconomic ties to the land, making it imperative to work with these communities to achieve successful conservation outcomes. Habitat loss and climate change are two of the most pervasive and detrimental threats to biodiversity globally1,2,3. Climate change contributes to species declines4,5,6,7as a consequence of range loss and/or exposure to climate change-related threats8,9,10,11,12. Furthermore, conversion of natural ecosystems has accelerated climate change by contributing up to 20% of the world's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through released carbon into the atmosphere13.This number is expected to increase as continued warming leads to accelerated carbon loss13. These dual climate change and biodiversity global crises require urgent solutions. Conserving natural habitats through the implementation of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) is a promising strategy for simultaneously addressing both crises while providing additional ecosystem services14,15. The IUCN broadly defines NbS as actions that protect, sustainably manage, and restore both natural and modified ecosystems to address societal challenges and benefit both people and nature (https://iucn.org/our-work/nature-based-solutions). Restoring or maintaining natural ecosystems under an NbS framework can provide co-benefits to people, including clean and abundant drinking water from healthy watersheds; increased productivity from healthy soils; flood control from functioning wetlands; and temperature moderation from healthy forests15,16. Understanding where opportunities for NbS occur, including natural areas with high carbon sequestration and sinks that align with key areas for biodiversity currently and under future climate change, as well as the impacts they may have on human well-being in those areas, should be a priority in area-based conservation17. Global conservation area-based targets, such as Target 3 of the 23 targets under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF) to protect 30% of lands and water by 2030 (hereafter ‘30 × 30'), and the Global Deal for Nature to protect 50% by 2050 (‘Half-Earth'), are focused on reversing biodiversity loss through the conservation and restoration of natural areas18. Most protected areas in the US have been established for geological or scenic preservation, with little focus on biodiversity or climate change19,20,21. While ~ 30% of continental US lands (including Alaska) are considered formally protected, indicating we are already at the 30% target on paper, in practice, the majority of these lands are managed for multiple uses and were not established with biodiversity goals in mind. Moreover, the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities have historically been overlooked22,23. There is a growing consensus for the need to consider more than a nominal protection designation of pre-defined acreage targets, including elevated focus on simultaneous biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services such as carbon mitigation (i.e. protection of carbon stores and sinks) in conservation planning (see Target 3 under the KMGBF; https://www.cbd.int/gbf/targets/3). Thus, mapping areas of high value for NbS will guide area-based conservation efforts, and on-the-ground NbS implementation17,23,24. The few analyses that identify ‘optimal' NbS focused conservation portfolios that maximize biodiversity and carbon benefits simultaneously often overlook the rights of people living in these areas, as well as the implications of traditional land conservation and protection designations for displacing people and current land uses. Currently, NbS implementation has been criticized for a lack of inclusive participation or capacity to foster change that is transformative25. Notably, area-based conservation targets, such as 30 × 30 and Half-Earth26,27,28, have the potential to perpetuate environmental injustices if consideration of human well-being and livelihoods are ignored29. Conservation without community co-development and support is likely to be ineffective30. In addition, consideration of other area-based conservation measures beyond protected and conserved lands, such as sustainable management, should be integrated into NbS planning efforts. This includes engaging local communities and private landowners in land governance and management activities that achieve positive and sustained outcomes for biodiversity and ecosystem services, while also respecting locally-relevant values and rights31. Given the interconnectedness of climate change, biodiversity loss, and human well-being, a holistic solution with an emphasis on the human communities at highest risk from climate change and land degradation who have historically been marginalized, and even victimized, is critical in conservation planning. Additionally, access to natural areas in the US has been shown to have disparities across race, socioeconomic status, and housing composition, with People of Color and low-income communities being grossly underrepresented32,33. Access to nature can influence overall human health and well-being and foster opportunities for green economic development32,34. Governing bodies have historically ignored social and environmental justice and disregarded how marginalized human communities (e.g., Indigenous groups and Black and brown communities) are included or engaged in setting large-scale conservation targets27,35. Understanding who lives in priority restoration areas and how they may be affected by NbS and land management decisions, is critical for reaching successful and equitable conservation outcomes36. This includes marginalized and historically excluded communities, as well as communities affected by changes in local land management, including those with land-dependent livelihoods, cultural importance factors such as sustenance and spirituality, or risk of green gentrification25; hereafter, these groups are referred to as Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs).Though nearly 30% of US lands are currently within the protected area network, it remains unclear how well these lands help us achieve goals for biodiversity and climate change, and to what extent they account for human well-being. We must identify where conservation action provides maximum return on investment for biodiversity and climate change and who will benefit or be engaged in the process37. Here, we propose a spatially-explicit, conservation framework for integrating multiple priorities into a spatial assessment of NbS-focused, area-based targets (Fig. This framework identifies the spatial distribution of areas that are important for NbS (i.e., biodiversity and climate change mitigation) as well as the human communities whose well-being and land-dependent livelihoods could be impacted by conservation actions, within the context of area-based conservation targets. We focus on birds as representatives of biodiversity, as they are monitored globally and can be effective indicators of overall biodiversity when conservation planning spans many species, habitats, and environmental gradients38,39. We then focused in on areas within the human purview to manage that have high irrecoverable carbon stores40and where they coincide with high value areas for birds, carbon, and human communities, to identify locations prime for NbS action. We focused on the continental United States (US), but this framework can be applied at any scale from local to global. These national maps can be used in combination with local datasets and in partnership with IPLCs to identify what counts toward the 30% goal under 30 × 30 and to design local, state or regional conservation plans that simultaneously address biodiversity, climate change, and the needs of human communities. This approach identifies High Priority NbS Areas across the US to help guide conservation efforts where they are most needed, with social-ecological considerations at the forefront of decision-making41 (Fig. Conceptual diagram of how Bird, Carbon, and Human priorities (BCH priorities), areas of alignment between bird climate strongholds, areas important for carbon storage and sequestration, and vulnerable human communities facing inequities (opportunities to equitably improve human well-being), are classified as, (A) priorities to maintain and (B) priorities to restore, based on the overlap of conservation priorities for birds (pink), carbon (green), and human well-being (yellow). Priorities to maintain are areas where Climate Strongholds and existing carbon stores and sinks are actively benefiting bird species resilience and carbon mitigation. Priorities to restore are areas where Vulnerable Climate Strongholds and potential areas for additional carbon storage and sequestration have potential benefits to bird resilience and carbon mitigation if restored. In each scenario (A and B), we focus on two areas of NbS overlap (1) alignment of Climate Strongholds and carbon priorities (benefits to Bird and Carbon: BC priorities) and (2) alignment of all three priorities (benefits to birds, carbon, and humans: BCH priorities). For both BC and BCH priorities to maintain and restore, we also consider areas with IPLCs considerations (i.e., BC + IPLCs and BCH + IPLCs) as additional priority area types (not shown). We identified 1.1 billion acres of Bird and Carbon (BC) priorities to maintain existing habitats or restore habitats using NbS across all seven ecosystems examined (Fig. A total of 74% of BC priorities occur on unprotected land with no conservation mandate (see Supplementary Table S4). These are potential opportunities under 30 × 30 to conserve biodiversity and mitigate carbon, comprising 43% (980 million acres) of the US (Table 1; Fig. Currently 13% (305 million acres) of the continental US is under strict formal protection (GAP 1–2), with an additional 18% (410 million acres) under multiple-use conservation protection (GAP 3, Table 1). Thus, nearly three-fourths of the US (69%) lacks any formal protection. Nearly 50% of current GAP 1–2 protected lands coincide with BC priorities (Table 1; Fig. 3), which equates to 6% of US lands (143 million acres) that could count towards the 30 × 30 target (Table 1; Fig. Currently, 48% of GAP 3 managed lands overlap with BC priorities, equating to 9% of US lands (200 million acres) that provide additional opportunities for increased protection and could count towards 30 × 30 while benefiting birds and carbon (Table 1; Fig. US lands identified with the highest potential for NbS focused on birds and carbon (BC priorities), as well as potential to promote equitable human well-being (BCH priorities) if maintained or restored. Darker color tones indicate conservation priorities occurring in communities that rely on the land for cultural preservation and/or socioeconomic factors (BC + IPLCs and BCH + IPLCs). This map was created using ESRI ArcPro 3.2.2 (https://pro.arcgis.com/). US lands identified with the highest potential for NbS focused on birds and carbon (BC priorities), as well as potential to promote equitable human well-being (BCH priorities) if maintained or restored according to their current GAP status. Darker color tones indicate conservation priorities occurring in communities that rely on the land for cultural preservation and/or socioeconomic factors (BC + IPLCs and BCH + IPLCs). This map was created using ESRI ArcPro 3.2.2 (https://pro.arcgis.com/). A total of 19% of US lands (438 million acres) align with BC priorities and are also within communities identified as priorities for human well-being (BCH priorities; Table 1; Fig. A quarter of the US population lives in communities with these BCH priorities (hereafter “BCH communities”). Less than 3% of US lands are currently protected BCH priorities (Table 1). Of the 438 million acres of BCH priorities, 71% are unprotected and 15% are within GAP 3 designation. These lands sum to 380 million acres of conservation opportunity across the continental US (or 14% and 3% of the US, respectively; Table 1) with potential co-benefits for people. Furthermore, BCH communities had high community inequities, including less access to nature (91% of the population in BCH communities), followed by chronic health conditions (73%), pollution exposure (62%), and high exposure to climate change risk (47%) (Fig. Overall, 95% of populations in BCH communities face multiple inequities in each region of the US (Fig. Community inequity was high in the Southern Great Plains, Northern Great Plains, and Southeast although the inequity patterns varied regionally (Figs. (A) The percent prevalence of Indigenous peoples' and local communities' (IPLCs) considerations (green gentrification potential, Indigenous land, or natural resource [NR] industry occupations) within populations of land-dependent communities that overlap Bird and Carbon priorities. (B) The percent prevalence of human inequities (climate, health, pollution, or nature access) within populations of socially vulnerable communities that overlap Bird and Carbon conservation priorities (priorities for birds, carbon, and human well-being [BCH]). Percentages are relative to the estimated populations summed across census tracts within each US region. Bird and Carbon (BC) conservation priorities overlap with human communities experiencing co-occurring inequities. This map shows the number of co-occurring inequity indicators (including climate, pollution, health, and nature access) experienced by the human communities overlapping BC priority areas. Geographic region boundaries are shown in black line. This map was created using ESRI ArcPro 3.2.2 (https://pro.arcgis.com/). Across all communities with BC Priorities, IPLCs considerations affected a greater percentage of the population (36%) than community inequities (30%). Of the 1.32 billion acres of BC priorities in the US, regardless of protection status, 80% (1.12 billion acres) also have indicators of IPLCs considerations (i.e., BC + IPLCs priorities) and 29% (387,083,039 acres) are in communities with inequitable human well-being in addition to having IPLCs considerations (i.e., BCH + IPLCs priorities; Supplementary Table S4). A total of 72% (764 million acres) of BC + IPLCs priorities and 69% (269 million acres) of BCH + IPLCs priorities are unprotected, with an additional 17% and 16% in GAP 3 lands, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). Across the continental US, 43% of GAP 3 lands coincide with BC + IPLCs areas and 15% coincide with BCH + IPLCs areas (the percentage of GAP3 in these priorities out of the total US GAP3 area, Table 1, Supplementary Table S5). Of the population living within BC priorities and IPLCs, the majority depended on the natural resource industry (63%). Natural resource industry dependence was highest in the central and western regions, and lowest in the east (Fig. Green gentrification was the next most prevalent indicator, affecting 37% of the population across the US, but percentages were greatest in the Northeast (59% of population), Southwest (46% of population), and Southeast (43%; Fig. A total of 10% of this US population (BC + IPLCs, and up to 70% in Alaska) resides in communities that share a mix of legal boundaries belonging to tribal and non-tribal governments, and state and federally recognized American Indian lands. Populations with high potential for green gentrification were more prevalent in priorities to restore, while populations associated with Indigenous land and natural resource industry were higher in priority areas to maintain (Supplementary Table S6). We identified 261 million acres (11.7% of US lands) of High Priority NbS Areas (Fig. 6) as all combined BC priorities (BC, BCH, BC + IPLCs, and BCH + IPLCs) that align with areas of highest irrecoverable carbon density (i.e., areas of high value carbon stores that are under direct human influence and are crucial for climate mitigation success, thus providing an ideal data layer for prioritizing NbS action)40. We highlight these areas to differentiate regions of the highest priority to better support conservation decision-making within a NbS framework, and to direct efforts of highest potential climate mitigation value when conservation resources are limited. Looking across these High Priority NbS Areas, this includes 53 million acres (2.4% of US lands) of BC priorities, 121 million acres (5.4% of US lands) of BC + IPLC priorities, 10 million acres (0.5% of US lands) of BCH priorities, and 77 million acres (3.5%) of BCH + IPLCs priorities. High Priority NbS Areas are primarily distributed in the Northwest, Northeast, and Southeast regions, where forests, wetlands, and coastal areas contain large amounts of irrecoverable carbon (Fig. A total of 80% of High Priority NbS Areas align with priorities for human well-being, with most of those areas (76%) with IPLCs considerations. US lands identified as High Priority NbS Areas that align both with the highest potential for NbS focused on birds and carbon (BC priorities), as well as potential to promote equitable human well-being (BCH priorities) if maintained or restored and fall within the footprint of irrecoverable carbon density. These areas are the highest priority to better support conservation decision-making within an NbS framework. Darker color tones indicate conservation priorities located in communities that rely on the land for cultural preservation and/or socioeconomic factors (BC + IPLCs and BCH + IPLCs). This map was created using ESRI ArcPro 3.2.2 (https://pro.arcgis.com/). Currently, of the 13% of US lands with a strict legal mandate for biodiversity protection (here, Gap 1 and Gap 2 lands), only 6% align with BC priorities and < 3% overlap with BCH priorities, revealing that we have not been successful to date at representing NbS priorities within our current protected area portfolio. Here, we identified an additional 980 million acres (43% of US lands) of unprotected land with potential opportunities for NbS to conserve BC priorities, and nearly 312 million acres (14% of US lands) representing opportunities to conserve BCH priorities. Here, NbS conservation efforts must go beyond traditional protection, and include actions such as sustainable land management and collaboration with private landowners14. Focusing NbS conservation efforts on these lands would meet 30 × 30 goals and help address the dual climate and biodiversity crises17,42, while simultaneously benefitting human communities. Meeting 30 × 30 targets by increasing or adding protections to existing multiple-use areas (GAP 3) covering nearly 18% of US lands e.g.23 would fail to maximize the benefits of NbS and improve human equity, despite 49% of GAP 3 lands having high value for birds and carbon (totalling 9% of US lands). In addition, we found only 19% of US lands with conservation protection, and 17% of multiple-use lands that also align with BCH priorities (each covering just under 3% of US lands). Protected areas historically have not been designated with biodiversity, climate change or equitable human well-being in mind. More so, traditional conservation practices have been focused on optimizing resource extraction or preserving recreational, scenic, or geological value on land that has been colonized19,20,21,43. These same practices have also led to restricted access to protected lands and lack of inclusion in conservation decision-making, with the brunt of the inequity falling on communities of color, rural communities, and IPLCs43. Therefore, we must look beyond the current protected lands system to meet 30 × 30 targets with NbS in mind. Here, we identified nearly 14% of currently unprotected US lands where NbS-focused conservation could improve equitable human well-being alongside BC priorities (i.e., BCH priorities). Our results indicate 95% of socially vulnerable populations located in BC priorities face multiple inequities, including 91% without adequate access to nature, and > 70% with chronic health conditions, which is consistent with other work demonstrating that communities of color in the US live in areas with more human modification33 and less access to nature32. Given that access to green spaces promotes increased physical activity and mental health, and thus improves human well-being32,34, prioritizing conservation efforts and NbS within these highly modified habitats would likely benefit human well-being in addition to biodiversity and climate mitigation. For example, NbS conservation and restoration action could focus on regions with relatively high community inequity, including areas in the Southern Great Plains, Northern Great Plains, and Southeast (Fig. Focusing on NbS conservation and restoration actions in these regions can help fuel a ‘restoration economy', providing localized social and economic benefits to local communities and economies44. Conservation actions in these priority areas will necessitate working closely with IPLCs to develop conservation solutions that support their well-being and land dependency needs and count towards 30 × 30. We found 80% of BC priorities fall within IPLCs (BC + IPLCs priorities), and most of these lands are not currently protected. The high overlap of these areas is key for addressing biodiversity loss and climate change and highlights the importance of conservation actions that account for people's cultural values and livelihoods. This includes strategies such as integrating ethical considerations into conservation triage, an approach which traditionally prioritizes areas based on conservation urgency where resources are finite45. However, this approach generally does not consider social-ecological connections46. The High Priority NbS Areas identified here allow conservation practitioners to focus on the areas of highest importance for birds, in conjunction with where irrecoverable carbon stores are at risk of being lost without conservation actions. However, 80% of these High Priority NbS Areas fall within areas of low human well-being and numerous IPLC considerations. Effective conservation triage in these areas needs to account for social-ecological challenges46. Adaptive governance and knowledge co-production are essential components of conservation planning that deliver effective and ethical outcomes for human well-being as well as biodiversity, and climate mitigation46. We considered three IPLCs attributes that have been historically affected by conservation and land protection decisions, acknowledging that several more IPLCs attributes could be considered and thus, our estimates of conservation areas in need of IPLCs actions are likely an underestimate. 30 × 30 has set a target to inclusively conserve and restore, and explicitly recognizes many human uses of lands and waters can benefit natural systems including working lands47. This is an important framing, as even with expansion of protected areas, biodiversity loss and extinction rates continue to remain high48.Therefore, protection status alone does not guarantee conservation success without additional management actions49,50,51. Within the context of climate change, proactive management strategies need to be implemented to continuously adapt to changing environmental conditions52,53,54. As part of this approach, we must engage private landowners in conservation, NbS, and stewardship of the land in a manner that can sustain both nature and the people that depend on it31. This includes working closely with private landowners in rural and working lands, as 63% of our IPLCs within BC priorities (77% when only considering IPLCs with BC priorities to maintain, Supplementary Table S6) are employed in the natural resource industry across all regions and priorities in our study. Working lands, if managed appropriately, can be successful NbS and beneficial for both carbon sequestration14,15 and biodiversity conservation55. Conservation practitioners can help support communities in sustainable management of local natural spaces56 by developing and maintaining programs that incentivize NbS. Market-based approaches that encourage the restoration or maintenance of natural land cover, as well as provide guidance on extractive practices that minimize biodiversity and carbon loss, can be key strategies for tackling the climate and biodiversity crises in conjunction with supporting the livelihoods of local communities. For example, ranchers can implement grazing practices that are bird-friendly, thereby promoting resilient grassland bird communities57, while simultaneously increasing the market value of the beef produced via bird-friendly land certifications. These strategies will be particularly critical in the Northern and Southern Great Plains, Alaska, Northwest, and Midwest, where communities with BC priorities have high dependence on natural resources for livelihoods. Private lands are crucial for both sustaining biodiversity and climate change mitigation, and thus local and co-produced conservation solutions that move beyond singularly relying on traditional protected area mandates will be critical going forward31,37,55. Focusing on collaborations supporting and enhancing Indigenous land management or community-led protected area establishment may offer a path towards reaching 30 × 30 conservation targets that benefits human well-being and elevates Indigenous land rights. First, Indigenous lands are home to 10% of the US population within IPLCs with BC priorities, but this proportion was as high as 70% in Alaska. Given dispossession and forced migration, Indigenous lands have been reduced by nearly 99% of their historic extent58. However, Indigenous-managed lands have been shown to have greater vertebrate species richness and threatened species richness than protected areas. This highlights the importance of Indigenous land management, stewardship, and knowledge to conservation59,60,61. The human impact of conservation decision-making will also be strong in priority areas to maintain, as we found both natural resource industries and Indigenous populations were higher within these areas. Given the legacy of displacement and protection of land without collaboration within areas of high conservation value such as these, key conservation opportunities should be identified in partnership with IPLCs. Green gentrification - the greening of urban spaces that leads to increased property values and subsequent displacement of low-income residents62- warrants particular attention given the likelihood of human displacement associated with restoration or wilding efforts in urban settings63. Roughly 37% of BC + IPLCs communities across all regions were at risk of green gentrification, especially within the southern and eastern US. This risk was notably higher within priority areas to restore across all regions. Conservation practitioners must acknowledge that NbS restoration projects can both improve human well-being and have unintended consequences for local communities. New urban green areas have been associated with declines in populations of People of Color, indicating that in some cases, ecosystem restoration or natural climate solutions/NbS resilience projects may cause unintended consequences for vulnerable communities64. The risk of displacement may be highest in areas vulnerable to climate change (e.g. high sea-level rise risk areas), especially close to downtown locations and near active transportation lines64,65. The focus should be on identifying where urban neighborhoods align with areas for potential conservation and resiliency projects and working with local communities to understand where and how to undertake such efforts63. This includes identifying and implementing anti-displacement tools (e.g., community land trusts) to secure affordable housing in the vicinity of conservation projects and ensuring that conservation projects are desired by the local community prior to their commencement63,64. While our findings and conclusions offer a quantitative framework of the ongoing challenges facing equitable conservation planning, we acknowledge that conservation planning inherently requires many subjective decisions, values, and objectives. Variation in input values or threshold choice can yield different priority areas. While we recognize this introduces bias, an assessment of that bias was not our goal, and several other studies have addressed the effects of different weighting, thresholds, and valuation schemes in conservation assessments66,67,68,69,70. In addition, we used commonly applied and recommended thresholds in all analyses (see Methods). Our approach exemplifies only one potential avenue for the strategic implementation of NbS under 30 × 30. Other approaches may consider terrestrial biodiversity, climate corridors, climate velocity metrics67, or different societal values (e.g., natural capital assets, cultural services71 or IPLCs that are nature dependent72 and could be affected by conservation actions. Thus, we offer our analysis as a starting point for the continued development of a socio-environmental approach to conservation planning designed to address the most pressing human and environmental crises of our time. Here, we provide a spatial framework for integrating values of both conservation and human communities within the context of NbS focused, area-based conservation41. To stabilize and reverse the biodiversity and climate crises, places of high value for birds that align with ecosystem carbon storage and sequestration are recommended as high priority for NbS conservation actions, particularly those located within High Priority NbS Areas. Yet, we recognize that local communities may be at odds with these identified priorities, especially those dependent on the land for their livelihoods and cultural practices. In such cases, conservation planning should account for the needs of the community and the desired conservation outcomes56,73, and should include ethical conservation triage practices. As progress is made towards 30 × 30 goals, the most successful conservation plans will promote human well-being alongside actions that restore and conserve nature and help stabilize our climate. We must shift away from historical practices that have excluded Indigenous communities for the sake of “protection” and perpetuated green gentrification that marginalizes people with low socioeconomic status (largely Black and Brown populations). Ongoing and future conservation within the current global context must be strategic, and ambitious, but also intentional and inclusive, ensuring local communities and conservation practitioners work together towards mutual goals. We identified NbS priorities, or areas of opportunity to benefit biodiversity, climate mitigation, and human communities. Key terms and definitions for each are provided in Supplementary Table S1. These refer to areas identified by our method as priorities, a definition commonly used in literature on spatial prioritization for biodiversity conservation (see citations, all of which refer to areas identified by their methods as “priorities” or “priority areas”)42,66,67,74. These areas are a function of our analytical decisions and objectives and thus do not represent the only priorities to be considered in 30 × 30 conservation planning. First, to identify areas that meet dual conservation targets for both birds and carbon (BC priorities), we mapped Existing NbS Areas, or areas of high carbon storage and active carbon sinks that align spatially with Climate Strongholds, which we defined as areas important for birds today and under future climate change scenarios. We defined these NbS alignment areas as Bird and Carbon priority areas to maintain, where protection or sustainable management and conservation actions should be implemented to protect key carbon stores and sinks in areas of high value to birds (Fig. We also identified Potential NbS Areas, or areas with high potential to act as carbon sinks if anthropogenic disturbance is minimized, which align with Vulnerable Climate Strongholds, defined as Climate Strongholds at high risk of conversion or with currently high levels of conversion and degradation. We refer to these NbS areas of alignment as Bird and Carbon priorities to restore, where restoration has the highest potential to improve carbon storage, sequestration, and bird habitat (Fig. Together, these areas were identified as Bird and Carbon priorities (BC priorities). Next, we assessed the alignment of these BC priorities with spatial data on marginalized communities across the US to identify areas where conservation efforts could simultaneously benefit biodiversity, climate change, and equitable human well-being, and designated these areas Bird, Carbon, and Human priorities (BCH priorities; Fig. These areas provide the greatest NbS co-benefit value. Here we identify opportunities to address human well-being by focusing on socially vulnerable communities, based on socio-economic considerations in addition to having at least one more inequity indicator in the following categories: climate change, pollution, health, and access to nature. Next, we assessed how these NbS priorities intersect with IPLCs, defined here as Indigenous peoples, and non-Indigenous communities with land-dependent livelihoods or cultural importance indicated by a prevalence of employment in the natural resources industry and lower-income urban households prone to displacement due to green gentrification (BC + IPLCs priorities and BCH + IPLCs priorities). The spatial analyses used to identify BC and BCH priorities were conducted using R statistical language (version R-4.1.3)75. Finally, we differentiated regions of the highest conservation priority to better support conservation decision-making by intersecting BC priority areas with areas of high irrecoverable carbon density (see High Priority NbS Areas, data description below). We defined these as High Priority NbS Areas, and provided a breakdown of BC, BCH, BC + IPLCs, and BCH + IPLCs that occur within the overlapping area. Irrecoverable carbon has elevated importance for climate mitigation and Nbs actions, as these locations host key carbon stores under direct human influence that, if lost, could not be recovered in a meaningful timeframe for addressing climate impacts40. We identified Climate Strongholds and Vulnerable Climate Strongholds for birds in 17 biogeographical groups as per69 using an optimization approach implemented with Zonation conservation planning software76. Birds were represented by previously published species distribution models developed by Bateman et al.11 at a 1-km resolution across North America for a baseline period (1981–2010) and for three future time periods (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. For a list of species associated with each biogeographical group, please see Supplementary Table S2. The 17 biogeographical groups were based on habitat affiliations for 557 bird species (see Supplementary Table S2) and NbS focus areas11, as per15,69 for seven ecosystems (forests, grasslands and rangelands, aridlands, interior wetlands, coastal wetlands, tundra, and urban and suburban systems) across four major regions of the continental US (eastern, central, western, and Alaska). For each biogeographical region (e.g. eastern forests), we calculated the spatial extent of each ecosystem in each time period based on both current and future land cover projections that incorporated climate change, sea level rise, and human population growth77,78,79,80,81,82,83. We represented each species by its predicted suitability above a species-specific threshold as per11,69 and included projections from both breeding and nonbreeding seasons and all time periods under an ensemble of 15 GCMs as input features in Zonation. Following prior work to develop climate-informed bird prioritizations e.g.,1,69, we used the Core Area Zonation algorithm to rank the landscape based on current and future climate suitability for birds, habitat availability, and landscape condition. For all ecosystems we used the Global Human Modification Index84 to represent degradation due to human activities. For forests, we also incorporated the Forest Landscape Integrity Index85 by selecting the maximum value between the two indices to identify the greatest disturbance threat. We used the inverse of the index to represent landscape condition (i.e., high degradation = poor condition). We limited condition layers to the extent of each biogeographical group for each time-period, and associated species layers with the corresponding condition layer from each time-period using Zonation's grouping function to capture habitat quality and availability. We used Zonation's ecological interactions function to downweight locations farther than a species' natal dispersal capacity for each time period1,86,87,88 up-weighted at-risk species (derived from NABCI conservation status scores and climate vulnerability scores; see Supplementary Table S2)11 and weighted present and near-future predictions higher than late-century predictions to address the increasing uncertainty of climate change projections over time89. To ensure that opportunities for conservation under 30 × 30 encompass ecologically distinct regions and are available across the continental U.S., we stratified rankings either by watershed boundaries (for coastal wetlands) or Bird Conservation Regions (for all other habitat groups; BCRs), the latter being distinct ecological regions with similar bird communities, habitats, and conservation issues90. To identify Climate Strongholds, we selected the core (top 20%) and supporting biodiversity areas (top 40%-top 20%) of the landscape ranking91,92 within each ecosystem (with the exception of (sub)urban where we used the core area (20%) due to the broad footprint of this system and generalist nature of species included). We selected the top 20 and 40% thresholds as they have been shown to be robust thresholds that capture more individuals per species than areas of lower priority91,92. These top areas were predicted to have high climate suitability for birds and low human modification at present and/or under future climate change scenarios. To identify Vulnerable Climate Strongholds, we included both (1) areas not identified as Climate Strongholds but ranked in the top 40% of the prioritization when landscape condition was not considered (i.e., areas that have high climate suitability for birds but have been exposed to high amounts of human modification) and (2) areas in the top 40% of the difference between rankings with and without landscape condition (i.e., areas with the greatest potential to increase their value to birds if landscape condition was restored). To identify existing and potential carbon priority areas, we identified locations with active (i.e., areas that currently function as significant carbon stores or sinks) and potential (i.e., areas that could have high carbon sequestration value if disturbance is minimized) carbon mitigation capacity. We used datasets from the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) model to map carbon storage and flux (i.e., sequestration rate, or the annual amount of carbon exchange between an ecosystem and the atmosphere) in the contiguous US93. To map areas of high carbon storage, we used Total Ecosystem Carbon (TEC) from the latest year available (2015), which measures aboveground and belowground carbon up to two meters. To map areas of high carbon sequestration, we used Net Biome Productivity (NBP), which measures the realized annual rate of carbon exchange, incorporating human and natural disturbances. To identify areas with high potential for increased carbon sequestration, we mapped annual Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP), or carbon flux in the hypothetical absence of natural or human disturbance, and calculated the difference between NBP and NEP. We recognize this may overestimate the area with potential for increased carbon sequestration given some ecosystems require natural disturbances; however, data distinguishing natural and anthropogenic carbon losses were not available. To map carbon storage and flux in Alaska, we used data from the Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning (SNAP) program based on the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model simulations for Alaska and Northwestern Canada, averaged during 2001-201094. We summarized flux rates across the lower 48 from 1980 to 2015 to obtain the average and maximum sequestration rate over time (measured in tons of carbon per year). We summarized high and low estimates of flux rates, calculated as the difference between carbon sequestration continuing at average historical rates from 1980 to 2015 (low) versus maximum historical rates (high). To calculate flux rates in Alaska, we subtracted heterotrophic respiration (HR) from vegetation Net Primary Productivity (NPP) to obtain NEP (net flux without accounting for loss due to disturbance (C/m2/yr). To calculate NBP (gC/m2/yr), we subtracted emissions due to disturbance (fire emissions from organic layer and vegetation burning) from NEP. Total carbon was calculated by summing the decadal average of soil and vegetation carbon pools (gC/m2). We extracted carbon estimates within the biogeographical extent of the Climate Strongholds for each of the 17 biogeographical groups. We included all areas also mapped in the corresponding IBIS time series dataset of the dominant land cover class (i.e., forests, grasslands and rangelands, and aridlands) to ensure the carbon data aligned with the appropriate habitat. Existing NbS areas included areas in the top 20% of TEC for each ecosystem or that had a positive flux based on NBP, indicating these areas currently have high carbon storage capacity or are actively sequestering more carbon than they emit. We chose the 20% threshold for carbon to be comparable, and for assessing potential spatial overlap, with our Climate Strongholds, based on best practices in prioritization assessments looking at multiple conservation values17,95,96. Potential carbon priority areas included areas where NEP was greater than NBP, indicating these areas could sequester more carbon if disturbance was minimized. We did not adjust carbon sequestration estimates for albedo, but acknowledge that in some ecosystems, especially high latitude conifer forests, reduced albedo can lead to a warming effect that offsets carbon storage benefits97. Within each ecosystem, we identified NbS priorities as Bird and Carbon priorities to maintain (BC priorities, maintain), where Climate Strongholds overlap with Existing Carbon Priority Areas (Fig. We considered these areas to have the greatest conservation benefit as they simultaneously help birds adapt to climate change while mitigating further carbon emissions. We also identified Bird and Carbon priorities to restore (BC priorities, restore) where Vulnerable Climate Strongholds aligned with Potential Carbon Priority Areas (Fig. In Alaska, we only calculated BC priorities to maintain due to lack of available carbon data incorporating human disturbance. We merged each ecosystem level BC priority layer across the US into a single layer of priorities to maintain and a single layer of priorities to restore. We then overlaid BC maintain and restore priorities to create a single layer of BC priorities. As there was some overlap among habitats, any overlap between priorities to maintain and restore were considered priorities to maintain so as not to double count areas. Lastly, we assessed the current protected status within the different priorities within the context of US progress towards meeting the area-based conservation goal under 30 × 30. We included five indicators of inequitable human well-being (hereafter “inequity indicators”) to identify where BC priorities aligned with opportunities for establishing equitable outcomes for human communities. We considered locations to have opportunities for improving equitable human well-being (hereafter “priorities for human well-being”) if communities were identified as socially vulnerable based on socio-economic considerations98 in addition to having at least one more inequity indicator in the following categories: climate change, pollution, health, and access to nature99. We obtained social data for human well-being from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) PLACES database100 and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)98 which considers socio-economic status, household composition and disability, minority status and language barriers, housing type and transportation availability, the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) beta version of their Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST)99 and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) environmental justice screening and mapping tool, EJScreen101. Data from these sources come from a range of multi-year estimates (i.e., American Community Survey 2014–2018 and 2015–2019 estimates), analyses, and collection years that fell within 2014–2021. In addition, health inequity indicators were based on 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System community surveys that assessed both the present status of individuals (i.e., physical inactivity and mental health as of 2019) and health history of individuals (e.g., history of heart disease and diabetes throughout the individual's lifetime). All our human well-being analyses were calculated within 2010 US Census Tract units (hereafter, “communities”). To identify priorities for human well-being, we applied the methodologies used by the EPA and CEQ to highlight disadvantaged communities which they define as communities that are both (1) at or above the 65th national percentile for SVI, and (2) at or above the 80th national percentile for one (or more) inequity indicators. These thresholds were set by the EPA and the CEQ and are recommended to be used with their data products. We created a health inequity indicator, which considered the four health conditions (crude prevalence of asthma, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and low life expectancy which were included in CEJST and two additional health conditions from the PLACES database: the prevalence of physical inactivity and poor mental health. We added the latter two conditions because physical activity and mental health have been directly linked to access to greenery and outdoor spaces102. If a community was ranked within the 80th percentile (as per EPA, see above) for any of these six health conditions, the tract was classified as having a health inequity. To create a pollution inequity indicator, we combined several CEJST environmental burden indicators that focused on sources of pollution and non-clean infrastructure. These CEJST indicators were obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) EJSCREEN environmental indicators101. Communities were classified as having this indicator if they were above the 80th percentile for any of the following conditions: wastewater discharge, proximity to hazardous waste facilities, Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) sites, Risk Management Plan (RMP) sites, diesel particulate matter (PM) exposure, traffic proximity and volume, or PM 2.5 in the air. To create an indicator of climate change risk inequity, we kept the same indicators used to measure climate burdens in CEJST: a community was classified as having climate inequities if it was within the 80th percentile for expected agricultural, building, or population losses due to natural hazards103. For an access to nature indicator, we intersected census tracts with the US Protected Areas Database (PADUS version 2.1)104 to identify communities without access to land formally protected for biodiversity (i.e., census tracts that did not intersect areas listed as GAP status 1–2 and Open Access in PADUS)104. To identify BCH priorities, areas where priorities for birds, carbon, and human well-being overlapped, we intersected our priorities for human well-being with our BC priorities. We focused on IPLCs, a subset of human communities having the potential to be negatively affected by protected area designations and other conservation actions, given these communities depend on the land for cultural preservation and livelihoods. Such communities include those of Indigenous peoples, those with a high percentage of their population employed in the natural resources industry, and marginalized and low-income urban communities who are particularly prone to displacement due to green gentrification. Green gentrification is a complex issue, but a large component of long-term displacement is increased housing costs associated with green infrastructure63. Despite the variation in land-dependencies existing within and between these three groups (e.g., economic living standards, subsistence living, health and wellness, culture, and spirituality), all of these dependencies are linked to overall human well-being and are reasons for mandating the inclusion of these communities in land management decisions105,106. For our IPLCs considerations, we used several data sources and retained our 80th percentile threshold for consistency with our inequity indicators. For the Indigenous land indicator, we identified communities intersecting Indigenous land boundaries from the US Census Bureau's 2019 National American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian Areas (AIANNH) dataset107. These boundaries represent federally recognized American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, state-recognized American Indian reservations, and state designated tribal areas. For the natural resources industry indicator, we included communities within the 80th percentile for the percent of their working population in the natural resources industry from the US Census Bureau's 2016–2020 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates of Selected Economic Characteristics108. Natural resources industries include agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and mining. Finally, for the green gentrification indicator, we included communities within urbanized area boundaries classified by the 2010 US Census109 that were also in the 80th percentile for the housing cost burden variable used in CEJST. Housing cost burden is the percent of households in each tract earning < 80% of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Area Median Family Income by county110 and are spending > 30% of their income on housing costs. To identify priorities that may require IPLCs engagement in conservation planning, we identified communities having at least one IPLCs indicator (i.e., Indigenous land, natural resource industry, or green gentrification). We intersected these communities with our BC priorities and our BCH priorities and refer to these coincident areas as BC + IPLCs priorities and BCH + IPLCs priorities, respectively. To assess protected status for all priorities, we used GAP status, a measure of intent to conserve biodiversity classified as follows: GAP 1–2 are under permanent protection for conservation, GAP 3 is under protection but allows multiple uses and extraction, and GAP 4 has no known legal conservation mandate. Here, we classify GAP 1 and 2 lands as highly protected, given the mandate to protect biodiversity and natural land cover and exclude human resource extraction22,66,111. USGS Gap Analysis Project, 2018). Gap 3 and 4 designated lands as they currently are managed may be inadequate to conserve lands in a way that maintains biodiversity, carbon mitigation values, and/or support human well-being22. However, Gap 3 and 4 lands have the potential to be beneficial to biodiversity, climate mitigation value, and human well-being with some adjustments, such as changes in management practices, restoration efforts, and/or increased access to nature23. We flattened the PADUS GAP status data layer104 across overlapping areas by retaining the highest level of protection for each area (i.e., the lowest GAP score), following methods in Dreiss & Malcom23 and considered non-PADUS lands as GAP 4 since their protected status is unknown. Although we designate GAP 4 as “unprotected”, we acknowledge these areas may have local mandates or private land ownership and management that are not captured by PADUS. We calculated the percent of the total land area within the continental US, within sub-national regions determined by the US Global Change Research Program (National Climate Assessment Regions (NCA4)112 and within the identified areas for each of our priorities classified as GAP 1–3. To identify High Priority NbS Areas that, if lost, would have the greatest negative impact relative to carbon storage, we identified Bird and Carbon Priority Areas with the highest levels of irreplaceable carbon reserves. We accessed high value irrecoverable carbon density from Noon et al.40. Irrecoverable carbon is defined as ecosystem carbon reserves that: (1) would not recover by mid-century if lost, (2) would benefit from human management, and (3) are vulnerable to land-use conversion40. Therefore, losing carbon in these areas would negatively impact our capacity to prevent worse-case scenario climate impacts. We did not include irrecoverable carbon as our original carbon dataset as it only covers areas that are ‘within ecosystems that are within human purview to manage'40 and thus did not give us full spatial coverage to identify areas of priority for carbon or biodiversity across the full continental US. We clipped the global map of irrecoverable carbon to the continental US and calculated the median pixel value based on this extent (median value, 22 MgC \(\:{\text{h}\text{a}}^{-1}\)). We then extracted all pixel values above the median, creating a layer with the upper 50% of irrecoverable carbon areas in the continental US. We used this layer as a mask applied to the Bird and Carbon Priority Areas, with all data within the mask representing the priority areas with the highest amount of irrecoverable carbon. We then categorized this layer by Bird and Carbon Priority type and calculated total acreages. The resulting map depicts High Priority NbS Areas across the continental US.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long-term stress levels, measured through hair samples, may provide important clues about mental health risks in children with chronic physical illnesses (CPI), according to new research from the University of Waterloo. The study highlights how high hair cortisol, a type of steroid hormone, acts as a powerful early warning sign that could help identify children who live with CPI and who could be most at risk of mental health challenges, helping guide prevention and treatment strategies to better support their health and well-being. These children face a much higher risk of developing mental health problems than their healthy peers, putting them at greater risk for poor quality of life, suicidal thoughts and increased reliance on health-care services. "Living with a chronic illness means facing daily challenges such as taking medications, missing school and adjusting activities, all of which can take a serious emotional toll," said Emma Littler, a Waterloo PhD candidate in Public Health Sciences and lead author of the study. "Our findings suggest that chronically high stress, measured through hair samples, could help identify children with CPI at the highest risk for developing mental health problems. The study followed 244 Canadian children with chronic physical illnesses over four years, measuring stress using hair cortisol -- a biological marker that reflects stress levels over time. Researchers found that more than two-thirds of these children had persistently high cortisol levels. When the researchers compared these patterns to reports of emotional and behavioral difficulties, they found that children whose cortisol levels declined over time showed fewer symptoms of anxiety, depression and behavior problems than those whose cortisol levels stayed high. "Hair cortisol offers a non-invasive, easy-to-collect biomarker that could one day be used to screen children and track whether treatments or support programs are helping to reduce stress." Ferro and colleagues from Waterloo and McMaster University also published new research showing that biomarkers found in the blood of children with CPI may help predict future mental health challenges. The findings suggest that routine blood tests, combined with mental health check-ups, could help doctors identify children who may need extra support earlier.
